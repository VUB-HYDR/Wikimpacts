        "content": " Typhoon Dot, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Saling, was the strongest storm of the 1985 season. Dot originated from a small area of thunderstorm activity in early to mid October. The system was first classified on October\u00a011, and steadily intensified over the next few days. Dot attained typhoon strength on October\u00a015, and subsequently entered a period of explosive deepening, which was not anticipated by forecasters. The next day the intensification rate slowed, but that evening, Dot attained its maximum intensify. A steady weakening trend began on October\u00a017, though the system maintained typhoon intensity through the passage of the Philippines. After entering the South China Sea late on October\u00a018, Dot briefly re-intensified, only to weaken as it approached Vietnam. On October\u00a021, Dot struck Vietnam while still a typhoon, but dissipated the next day over the high terrain of the nation. Although damage across the Philippines was less than initially expected, the typhoon lashed the nation with heavy rains. Province of Nueva Ecija suffered the worst effects from Dot. There, 500,000 acres (200,000\u00a0ha) of crops and 90%\u00a0of all buildings were damaged. In Cabanatuan, 2,500\u00a0homes and 90%\u00a0of structures were destroyed. Overall, 42\u00a0towns were flooded, forcing a total of 125,000\u00a0people to flee their homes, 35,000\u00a0of which were homeless. Furthermore, 52,933\u00a0houses were leveled while an additional 200,450\u00a0were damaged. Nationwide, 24\u00a0were hurt. While tracking through the South China Sea, Dot passed through Hainan Island. There, two casualties occurred while 34\u00a0others suffered injuries. Across the island, over 2,300\u00a0dwellings were destroyed. In all, Dot was responsible for 90\u00a0deaths and $104.9\u00a0million (1985\u00a0USD) in damage."

        "content": "Following the extratropical transition of Typhoon Brenda on October\u00a05, a mid-level subtropical ridge became centered over the northwestern Pacific, which resulted in an absence of the typical southwesterly monsoon flow typically seen during the autumn. Satellite imagery first detected an area of convection roughly 280\u00a0km (170\u00a0mi) southeast of Ponape on October\u00a011.[1] At 1200\u00a0UTC, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) first identified the system.[2][nb 1] The next day, the storm's outflow became better defined as the storm tracked west-northwest. On October\u00a013, wind shear began to decrease, and the cyclone developed a well-defined circulation. Based on this, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) upgraded the system into Tropical Storm Dot.[1][nb 2] That evening, the JMA followed suit.[2] The newly upgraded Dot was situated in an area of strong easterly winds, and thus the JTWC correctly predicted to the system to continue west-northwest, despite forecasts from various tropical cyclone forecast models that showed otherwise.[1] Dot steadily strengthened during this period, and midday on October\u00a014, the JMA classified Dot as a severe tropical storm.[2] Several hours later, the JTWC upgraded Dot into a typhoon, with the JMA following early on October\u00a015.[5] Around this time, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Saling.[6] Shortly after attaining typhoon intensity, Dot entered a period of explosive intensification. However, this was not expected by forecasters at the JTWC nor the forecast models due to the presence of dry air.[1] At 0600\u00a0UTC on October\u00a015, the JTWC revised the intensity to 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph), equivalent to a mid-level Category\u00a02 hurricane on the United States-based Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (SSHWS). That evening, the JMA increased the intensity of Dot to 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph), making it the strongest tropical cyclone of the season.[5] At 2300\u00a0UTC on October\u00a015, Hurricane Hunters measured a minimum barometric pressure of 906\u00a0mbar (26.8\u00a0inHg), a drop of 63\u00a0mbar (1.9\u00a0inHg) over the previous 23\u00a0hours, equal to a drop 2.8\u00a0mbar (0.083\u00a0inHg) per hour. This rate exceeded the threshold of explosive intensification, which according to the JTWC, is 2.5\u00a0mbar (0.074\u00a0inHg) per hour.[1] Based on the aforementioned aircraft reports, the JTWC increased the intensity to 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph) at 0000\u00a0UTC on October\u00a016. By this time, Dot had developed a well-defined eye surrounded by very cold cloud tops.[5] However, the JTWC also noted that both the storm's radius of maximum winds and central dense overcast were unusually small.[1] By October\u00a016, Dot's rate of deepening had leveled off.[1] At midday, the JTWC estimated that Dot attained peak intensity of 280\u00a0km/h (175\u00a0mph)[5] while the JMA placed the storm's wind speed at 220\u00a0km/h (135\u00a0mph).[2] After maintaining this intensity until the morning of October 17, Dot started a gradual weakening trend[5] while passing directly over Samar Island and encountering increased wind shear. Around this time, radar imagery showed that Dot displayed a small pinhole eye 5 to 8\u00a0km (3.1 to 5.0\u00a0mi) in diameter.[1] On the afternoon of October\u00a018, the typhoon made landfall along southern Luzon. At this time, the JTWC reported an intensity of 205\u00a0km/h (125\u00a0mph) and the JMA assigned the storm's intensity at 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph).[5] That evening, Dot re-emerged into the South China Sea while still at typhoon intensity. Continuing west-northwest, Dot quickly became better organized. According to the JTWC, Dot reaches its secondary peak intensity of 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph) midday on October\u00a020 while situated roughly 550\u00a0km (340\u00a0mi) south-southwest of Hong Kong.[1] Meanwhile, the JMA raised the storm's intensity to 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph).[2] Also around this time, the typhoon exited PAGASA's warning zone.[7] After brushing Hainan Island, Dot resumed weakening. Early on October\u00a021, Dot moved ashore in northern Vietnam, around 240\u00a0km (150\u00a0mi) south of Hanoi.[1] At the time of its second landfall, the JTWC estimate Dot's intensity at 145\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph), while the JMA estimate was lower, at 110\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph).[5] Land interaction with the high terrain of the nation resulted in rapid weakening, and by 0000\u00a0UTC October\u00a022, the JTWC ceased tracking Dot.[1] The JMA followed suit 12 hours later.[2]"

Additionally, railway and shipping services were cancelled.[9] All United States military installations in the Philippines were placed in a Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness[1] and two airbases, Clark Air Base and Cubi Point NAS, were evacuated.[11] Schools and many offices were shut down in preparation of Dot.[12] Typhoon Dot was the strongest tropical cyclone to directly strike the Bicol Region of the Philippines since Typhoon Irma in 1981.[13] Although the storm brought heavy rains to much of Philippines,[14] damage was less than initially expected[15] due to the storm's small size.[1] In Davao Del Sur, 10\u00a0people were killed and several homes were destroyed due to mudslides.[16] A man was swept away in a landslide in Legaspi,[17] which also forced the evacuation of 165\u00a0families.[18] The worst effects of the storm were felt in Nueva. There, 202,345\u00a0ha (500,000 acres) of crops and 90%\u00a0of all buildings were damaged,[16] totaling to $5.3\u00a0million (1985\u00a0USD).[19] Offshore, three people were killed and 16\u00a0others were rendered missing when a cargo ship sunk.[16] Seven fatalities occurred in Cabanatuan,[20] where 2,500\u00a0homes were demolished[21] and 22,000\u00a0were damaged.[22] Ninety percent of all infrastructure was destroyed.[19] Flooding in low-lying areas of Manila forced the evacuation of 29,000. Elsewhere, 69,000\u00a0houses were flooded in Pampanga, Tarlac, and Nueva Ecija.[23] In all, 42\u00a0towns were flooded,[24] which forced a total of 125,000\u00a0people to flee their homes,[25] 35,000\u00a0of which were homeless.[19] Overall, 52,933\u00a0homes were destroyed while an additional 200,450\u00a0were damaged. Throughout the Philippines, 24\u00a0people were hurt,[26] and 88\u00a0perished,[27] and over 1\u00a0million people were directly affected.[26] Nationwide, damage totaled $104.9\u00a0million. This included $92.8 million in property damage and less than $1\u00a0million in agriculture.[7] During the aftermath of the storm, the governor of Nueva Ecija requested President Ferdinand Marcos to declare the province a disaster area.[28] Additionally, UNICEF was asked to provide water-purifying tablets. The Philippine Red Cross, Philippine government, local authorities and civic organizations provided relief assistance in the immediate aftermath of the storm. Despite private appeals for up to $1.4\u00a0million for reconstruction aid, the Philippine government did not submit a request for international aid. However, by October 25, eight non-government relief agencies provided relief, which totaled $1.15\u00a0million. Furthermore, the government of Switzerland provided $8,061\u00a0worth of aid.[26] After passing the Philippines, Typhoon Dot skirted Hainan Island, leaving two dead. Communications were lost in Sanya, the southernmost city in the island.[29] Thirty-four were hurt. A total of 50,000 homes and 83,000 acres of farmland were flooded.[30] More than 2,300\u00a0houses also collapsed.[1] Along the China mainland, heavy rains were recorded, although damage was minor.[29]"

The following day, both the JMA and JTWC upgraded Shanshan to a typhoon after deep convection was seen wrapping into its developing center. The JMA later determined that the storm had peaked in intensity with 10-minute winds of 130\u00a0 km/h (80\u00a0 mph) and a minimum pressure of 970 hPa, and expected the storm to maintain that intensity for several days. The JTWC stated that Shanshan had slightly weakened after a strengthening trend by August 6 after its eye became ragged and slightly displaced. On August 7, Shanshan began to re-intensify and reached its peak strength as a Category 2 typhoon with 1-minute winds of 165\u00a0 km/h (105\u00a0 mph) while nearing southeastern Japan.

The depression began to slowly intensify as it moved towards the west-northwest and Tropical Storm Luke was named on September\u00a015. Luke reached peak intensity prior to recurving to the northeast and weakening due to increased shear. Tropical Storm Luke then paralleled the southeastern Japan coastline before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone. Overall, 12\u00a0people were killed and 23\u00a0others were injured.

At 18:00\u00a0UTC, the JTWC designated the system Tropical Depression 20W, based on synoptic data that indicated the disturbance developed a closed surface circulation. At the time of the upgrade, the depression's structure resembled that of a monsoon depression, with a ring of 55\u00a0km/h (35\u00a0mph) winds surrounding a large area of light and variable winds, indicating a broad and ill-defined circulation.[1] Early on September\u00a015, the JTWC upgraded the depression into Tropical Storm Luke, with the JMA following suit six hours later.[4][nb 2] The cyclone continued to slowly intensity over the next 48\u00a0hours as it tracked west-northwestward. On September\u00a017, satellite imagery indicated that the circulation had become less defined and the overall system had lost organization.[1] Despite this, the JTWC increased the intensity of the storm to 95\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph),[6] its peak intensity. Meanwhile, the JMA upgraded Luke into a severe tropical storm. At 18:00\u00a0UTC, the JMA estimated that Luke reached its peak intensity of 105\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph).[4] Luke turned north-northwestward, only to make a turn to the east as a midtropospheric trough caused the subtropical ridge, which had been holding the system to a westward track, to recede eastward. Meanwhile, the vertical wind shear caused by westerlies increased, causing Luke to transition into an extratropical cyclone. The JTWC issued its final warning at noon on September\u00a019,[1] with the JMA declaring Luke extratropical that evening. It was last noted late on September\u00a021.[2]"

Soon after, Cora began to make a definite eye formation and finished the same day. As it made landfall in the Ryukyu Islands mainly Okinawa[3]), Cora moved up to the island of Kyush\u016b with winds up to 70 knots (81\u00a0mph) at 23:00 UTC on August 20.

The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began following the wave for the next day, as it headed westward, north of Truk. Slowly curving northeast from the island, the wave soon was upgraded to a tropical depression with winds of 30\u00a0mph (48\u00a0km/h) with no eye structure on July\u00a030. The depression strengthened on the morning of July\u00a031 to 35\u00a0mph (56\u00a0km/h) winds and persisted throughout the day at that strength. The depression continued its northwestern curve, speeding up and weakening once again to 30\u00a0mph (48\u00a0km/h) on the morning of August\u00a01.[1] After passing Woleai, the depression strengthened once again and became Tropical Storm Opal the same afternoon. The storm continued intensifying during the afternoon, with winds reaching 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) by nightfall. By the next morning, Opal was upgraded into a typhoon, the eighth of the 1962\u00a0season.[2] The typhoon, now northwest of the island of Ulithi, continued turning to the northwest, beginning to slow as the system continued strengthening. By nightfall, the system had an eye forming, wide as 5 miles (8.0\u00a0km). By nightfall, the system was up to winds of 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) and passing far east of the Philippines. Opal continued the northwest progression, strengthening throughout the day of August\u00a03 and forming a wider eye. By the end of the day, the storm was now a Category\u00a03 typhoon with winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h). Strengthening continued overnight as the typhoon passed to the east of Luzon, strengthening close to super typhoon status by nightfall on August\u00a04 with a shrinking eye. The next morning, Typhoon Opal strengthened into the second super typhoon of the season, boasting sustained winds of 160\u00a0mph (260\u00a0km/h). During the day on August\u00a05, Opal continued strengthening, peaking with winds of 165\u00a0mph (266\u00a0km/h) just east of Taiwan.[2] (Operationally, Opal was classified as a 170\u00a0mph (270\u00a0km/h) typhoon, but this was downgraded to a 165\u00a0mph (266\u00a0km/h) in post-analysis.) Minimum recorded central pressures for Opal were registered at 900\u00a0millibars.[3] Soon after peaking, the storm struck the island of Taiwan with winds of 165\u00a0mph (266\u00a0km/h). The storm weakened over land to 135\u00a0mph (217\u00a0km/h) after crossing the island and continued weakening into a 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) typhoon as it made landfall in mainland China. The typhoon continued to weaken over land, weakening into a tropical storm on the morning of August\u00a06. Opal persisted as a tropical storm on August\u00a06, weakening into a tropical depression the next morning. During the afternoon of August\u00a07, with influences from land, the storm became extratropical.[4][2] The extratropical remains of Opal crossed eastern mainland China, entering the East China Sea in the late evening. Early in the morning of August\u00a08, the storm struck North Korea near the capital city of Pyongyang. After crossing the country, the system reappeared in the sea before crossing. On the morning of August\u00a09, the system made landfall on the Hokkaido region of Japan, near the town of Rumoi. After crossing the island, the storm entered the Sea of Okhotsk on August\u00a010. During the afternoon, the system crossed the Kuril Islands and began a parallel with the Kamchatka Peninsula the next day. On the morning of August\u00a013, the system entered the Aleutian Islands, passing west of Semisopochnoi Island and the Rat Islands before entering the Bering Sea. The extratropical remains disappeared on August\u00a014 in the middle of the sea, just south of the Arctic Circle.[5]"

Some 5,000\u00a0people were homeless in Yilan City.[6] Nearly 1,500\u00a0homes were destroyed as a result of Opal, along with 4,700\u00a0others damaged due to the high winds. Huge waves kicked up by Opel also sent a storm surge into the city, sweeping away homes.[7] However, by August 8, this number was demoted to only 12\u00a0deaths on the island, 966\u00a0injured and five people missing.[8] The 170\u00a0mph (270\u00a0km/h) strong winds took a freighter off its anchors and swamping it, along with a number of fishing boats.[6] Although winds of 110\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h) were felt in Taipei, no fatalities were reported because of ample warning, causing residents to evacuate.[7][9] In Taipei, Opal caused streets to flood, uprooted trees and tore down telephone lines.[9] 38\u00a0injuries were also reported, with 35\u00a0houses destroyed. 180\u00a0were also damaged in Taipei.[10] Elsewhere, Opal caused two deaths in the islands of Japan, centered on the island of Southern Hokkaido.[11] Nine people there were also injured and one person was reported missing.[12] After Typhoon Opal passed through South Korea, seven fishermen were killed along the coast of the Yellow Sea. 72\u00a0more people were missing. Five ships were also sunk in the Yellow Sea, twelve more were reported missing.[13] The estimated damage total came out to about $25\u00a0million (1962\u00a0USD; $184\u00a0million (2011\u00a0USD)).

The second storm of the 2002 Pacific typhoon season, Mitag developed from a trough near the equator on February\u00a025 near the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM). It moved westward through the archipelago and intensified into a typhoon before passing near Yap on March\u00a02. High winds and heavy rainfall affected the state, resulting in an islandwide power outage and destroying hundreds of houses. Mitag caused severe crop damage that resulted in food shortages. The rainfall and storm surge flooded much of the coastline as well as Yap's capital, Colonia. Damage totaled $150\u00a0million, mostly from crop damage.[nb 1] There was one death related to the storm's aftermath. After affecting Yap, Mitag turned to the northwest and later to the north due to an approaching trough. It passed to the north of Palau, contributing to one death there. Despite predictions of weakening, the typhoon continued to intensify, reaching peak winds of 175\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph) 10\u00a0minute sustained) on March\u00a05.[nb 2] The combination of cooler air and interaction with the westerlies caused Mitag to weaken significantly.

        "content": "The origins of Typhoon Mitag were from a trough near the equator in late February 2002.[3] A circulation developed on February\u00a025 south of Pohnpei, which initially had disorganized convection due to moderate wind shear. After further organization,[1] the system developed into a tropical depression on February\u00a026. Located south of the subtropical ridge,[3][4] it moved generally westward, intensifying into Tropical Storm Mitag near Chuuk State in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) on February\u00a028. This was based on analysis from the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA);[nb 3][4] the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)[nb 4] estimated that the system intensified into a tropical storm a day prior.[3] It passed just south of Weno in Chuuk while continuing westward,[6] intensifying quickly due to decreasing wind shear.[1] The JTWC upgraded the storm to a typhoon on March\u00a01,[3] and the JMA followed suit a day later.[4] Despite being early in the season, Mitag intensified significantly to the east of the Philippines.[3] On March\u00a02, an eye was observed on satellite imagery in the center of the deepest convection. Late that day, Mitag passed just south of the island of Yap in the FSM.[1] On March\u00a03, the typhoon entered the area of warning responsibility of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA); the agency gave it the local name \"Basyang\".[7] An approaching deep-layer trough turned the typhoon to the northwest and later to the north.[3] Although southwesterly wind shear was expected to restrict intensification, Mitag turned to the northeast in the same direction as the shear, causing the outflow to increase. After completing an eyewall replacement cycle, very deep convection surrounded the eye, and Dvorak numbers peaked at 7.0. On this basis, the JTWC upgraded Mitag to a super typhoon on March\u00a05, estimating peak winds of 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph) 1\u00a0minute sustained) while the storm was located about 610\u00a0km (380\u00a0mi) east of Catanduanes in the Philippines. This made it the only super typhoon on record in the month[1] until Typhoon Maysak of 2015. Also on March\u00a05, the JMA estimated peak winds of 175\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph) 10\u00a0minute sustained),[4] PAGASA assessed the same intensity as JMA, and the National Meteorological Centre of China estimated peak winds of 205\u00a0km/h (127\u00a0mph) 10\u00a0minute sustained).[7] For about a day, the typhoon maintained its peak winds,[4] before increasing wind shear and cool, dry air imparted significant weakening. In a 24\u2011hour period, the JTWC estimated that winds decreased by 110\u00a0km/h (68\u00a0mph) 1\u00a0minute sustained) while the storm turned to the northeast,[3] and on March\u00a07, Mitag weakened below typhoon-force.[4] A surge in the monsoon combined with the upper-level Westerlies displaced the low-level circulation from the upper-level center, causing the low-level system to turn to the east and south. On March\u00a08, the JTWC issued its last advisory,[3] and Mitag dissipated on March\u00a09.[4]"

The rains caused a few minor landslides and flooded some homes on Weno Island.[6] Later, Mitag passed near several islands in Yap State, first affecting Woleai. On the island, high wind gusts of around 170\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph) knocked out power and downed breadfruit and coconut trees. The winds destroyed a few houses, forcing residents to evacuate to a local school. Mitag dropped heavy rainfall while passing by Yap state, peaking at 255\u00a0mm (10.0\u00a0in) on Ngulu Atoll.[6] On Yap, the typhoon produced sustained winds of 56\u00a0km/h (35\u00a0mph), with gusts to 141\u00a0km/h (88\u00a0mph).[1] The winds also caused an islandwide power outage that lasted for about two days, and damaged the roof of the Yap International Airport terminal. High waves and storm surge damaged coastal structures and flooded areas up to 183\u00a0m (600\u00a0ft) inland. The seawall at the capital city of Colonia was damaged, and portions of the town were flooded 1.5\u00a0m (4.9\u00a0ft) deep.[6] The storm destroyed over 150\u00a0houses on Yap, leaving hundreds staying in shelters.[8] Across the island, the winds knocked down trees onto roads, and saltwater intrusion caused severe crop damage; most of the taro and banana crops were destroyed. Damage in the FSM totaled $150\u00a0million, of which $100\u00a0million from crop damage.[6] Lastly, the typhoon passed about 320\u00a0km (200\u00a0mi) north of Palau, producing gusty winds but no damage. There was an indirect death on the island after a person was crushed by a tree; he had been helping a friend cut down the tree out of fear it could cause damage during the storm.[6]"

It was the only super typhoon of that year. Bart reached \"super typhoon\" status on September 22, when it grew to comprise winds containing a force of 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph). Bart killed at least two people on the island of Okinawa and brought over 710 millimeters (28\u00a0in) of rain to the island. Kadena Air Base was badly damaged by the typhoon, with over $5 million of damage sustained by the base. Heavy flooding and landslides led to a death toll of 30 and over 1,000 injuries in Japan. Over 800,000 homes lost power, whilst 80,000 were damaged in the aftermath of the storm.

        "content": "On September\u00a014, an area of disturbed weather formed within the active monsoon trough south of Okinawa. The disturbance began to develop a low-pressure area, but it quickly merged with another collection of thunderstorms to the north. The following day, a new system developed and moved west-southwest. It only slowly organized given suppressed outflow from a nearby tropical upper-tropospheric trough and a lack of cyclonic rotation.[1][2] The developing system drifted eastward and acquired a surface circulation, which prompted the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert at 03:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a017.[1] This came just three hours after the principal agency in the West Pacific, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), first began monitoring the system.[3] At 15:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a017, the JTWC issued their first advisory on Tropical Depression 24W.[2] The suppressive effects of the trough initially stripped the center of deep atmospheric convection, but as this trough moved northwest and weakened, the surrounding environment began to improve. Both the JMA and JTWC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Bart at 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a019, at which time the Philippines-based organization PAGASA began warning on Tropical Depression Oniang. Six hours later, PAGASA upgraded the depression to a tropical storm as well.[1] Some northerly wind shear continued to affect Bart as it moved along a northwesterly course between two subtropical ridges on either side of the cyclone. However, deep convection, originally confined to the southern semicircle of the system, began to wrap around the eastern quadrant as an anticyclone developed aloft. This improving presentation on weather satellite soon yielded the development of an 19\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi)-diameter eye around 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a020, prompting the JTWC to upgrade Bart to a typhoon at this time. While Bart attained increased in intensity, one of the subtropical ridges to its north weakened, causing the system to become nearly stationary while it was positioned about 370\u00a0km (230\u00a0mi) southwest of Okinawa.[1] A climatological rate of strengthening ensued as the cyclone slowly began to move northward late on September\u00a021, and Bart reached winds of 240\u00a0km/h (150\u00a0mph) at 18:00\u00a0UTC that day, making it a super typhoon based on JTWC classification. By 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a022,[2] with an eye that had grown to 39\u00a0km (24\u00a0mi) and excellent outflow in all directions,[1] Bart attained peak one-minute sustained winds of 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph), equivalent to a Category\u00a05 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale.[2] The JMA, meanwhile, recorded ten-minute sustained winds of 165\u00a0km/h (103\u00a0mph) as the system passed only 75\u00a0km (47\u00a0mi) west of Okinawa.[1][3] Later on September\u00a022, the potent cyclone began to feel the effects of dry air entrainment into its circulation. The eye diameter fell to 14\u00a0km (8.7\u00a0mi) and continued to shrink, and soon, Bart began to undergo an eyewall replacement cycle as it fell below super typhoon intensity. An approaching trough in the mid-latitudes and an intensifying ridge to its northeast caused the cyclone to accelerate in that direction, while microwave imagery depicted a newly formed, symmetric 74\u00a0km (46\u00a0mi) eye. The system made landfall near Omuta in Kyushu, the southwesternmost island of Japan, and it soon crossed Honshu. This movement brought Bart into the Sea of Japan to the west of Hiroshima by 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a024, around which time it further decayed into a tropical storm. The effects of land were exacerbated by an increase in strong southwesterly wind shear as Bart continued to accelerate northeastward.[1] The JTWC declared the system an extratropical cyclone at 15:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a024,[2] and the JMA followed suit over subsequent hours as the non-tropical low moved into the Sea of Okhotsk east of northern Hokkaido.[1] The remnants of Bart continued into the North Pacific.[2]"

The highest recorded value was 1,180\u00a0mm (46\u00a0in) in Funato, located in the K\u014dchi Prefecture.[5] Heavy rains caused flooding, which was exacerbated by swollen rivers.[6] The cyclone also produced numerous tropical storm- or typhoon-force winds across the island, peaking at 151\u00a0km/h (94\u00a0mph) across Seto in the Ehime Prefecture.[5] The inclement weather caused over 245\u00a0landslides and damaged or destroyed buildings.[7][8] Strong winds downed numerous trees, contributing to additional damage to structures.[9] Ferry service connecting the various prefectures was cancelled,[10] airline flights were halted, train service was severely disrupted, large ships moored along the coast were evacuated, and many schools were closed.[11] Numerous people were evacuated throughout the region.[12] In total, Bart caused 36\u00a0fatalities,[5] injured over 1,314\u00a0people, flooded 18,498\u00a0homes,[2] and left 813,000\u00a0households without power.[13] In Okinawa, downed trees, flooded roads, and overturned cars were prevalent, forcing the U.S. military to restrict personnel and their families to their homes.[7][14] In the Gifu Prefecture, landslides collapsed roads, leading to eight deaths and eight injuries.[15] In the Yamaguchi Prefecture, the collapse of a wall in Yamaguchi City killed two people, while another person died from strong winds in Ohata Town.[16] The storm shuttered production units at a Seibu Oil company.[17] In the Hiroshima Prefecture, two large cranes under construction collapsed and hit a nearby office, killing three employees. Two more people died in Shimamachi and Tomoda. Along the coastline, a pier suffered structural damage, and thousands of oyster farming rafts were damaged.[16] The Itsukushima Shrine, one of Japan's most famous Shinto shrines and a member of the United Nation's World Cultural Heritage List, was damaged.[17] Three people were killed in the Fukuoka Prefecture,[18] where firefighters traveled by rubber boat to search for missing people. In the Kumamoto Prefecture, more than 30\u00a0police officers were sent to Shiranui,[19] conducting search and rescue in homes that were flooded to their rooftops by a storm surge up to 3.5\u00a0m (11\u00a0ft) that funneled into Yatsushiro Sea. The surge coincided with the peak timing of the spring tide,[20] killing 13\u00a0people. Another three people died from head injuries caused by flying debris. Forty-three municipalities in the prefecture set up disaster response headquarters.[21] The trade office was closed and suffered minor damage, but it was expected to swiftly reopen following the passage of the storm.[22] In the Kagoshima Prefecture, strong winds downed a steel tower which contributed to power and water outages through September\u00a028.[23] In the Miyazaki Prefecture, the collapse of a road caused a man to plunge into the Gokase River and die.[24] Bart also spawned a tornado outbreak. The first tornado, rated F0\u2013F1 in strength, occurred in the Nagasaki Prefecture late on September\u00a023. This was succeeded by tornadoes of F1 and F2 intensity in the Kochi and Yamaguchi prefectures, respectively. The four other tornadoes occurred in the Aichi Prefecture; two were rated F1, one was rated F2, and one was rated F3. The majority of damage during the outbreak was associated with the F3 tornado which grew up to 550\u00a0m (600\u00a0yd) and tracked for 18\u00a0km (11\u00a0mi). The tornado completely demolished 40\u00a0houses and damaged 309\u00a0others, resulting in 415\u00a0injuries. The F2 in the Aichi Prefecture also destroyed a house and damaged two others; it caused 38\u00a0injuries. The F2 in the Yamaguchi Prefecture injured 13\u00a0people.[25] These tornadoes occurred in the right front quadrant of the typhoon, a historically favorable quadrant for tornadic activity. The presence of high convective available potential energy and strong wind shear favored the development of supercell thunderstorms across Japan on September\u00a023\u201324.[26]"

The sixth tropical cyclone and second typhoon of the 1999 Pacific typhoon season, Maggie developed from a monsoon trough over the Philippine Sea on June 1. Quickly intensifying to tropical storm strength the following day, Maggie followed a northward course as it continued to intensify, reaching typhoon strength at 18:00 UTC as it turned northwestward. Maggie rapidly intensified to reach its peak intensity as a Category 3 equivalent typhoon on June 5 as it passed through the Luzon Strait. The typhoon brushed Taiwan on June 6 and began to weaken, making landfall near Hong Kong as a minimal typhoon on June 7. Afterward, Maggie weakened to a tropical storm as it briefly moved offshore. The storm moved back onshore the following day and quickly weakened, degenerating into a remnant area of low pressure on June 8. Heavy rainfall from Maggie caused flooding and mudslides in the Philippines, which claimed the lives of three people. The typhoon caused an additional two fatalities in Taiwan, while five others were reported missing. In the Chinese province of Guangdong, the typhoon left four people dead and damaged thousands of homes. The outer bands of the system produced moderate rainfall in parts of Indochina, causing localized flooding. Total damages from Maggie were estimated to be $168 million (USD)."

        "content": "The disturbance that was to become Typhoon Maggie, a monsoon trough, was first mentioned as a by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) at 06:00 UTC on May 27.[1] Initially, the disturbance was disorganized, mostly consisting of scattered convection with no discernible rotation or center of circulation. However, the disturbance gradually organized over the next few days, presenting organized convection and good outflow within an environment with low wind shear. At 00:00 UTC on June 1, a tropical depression developed from the trough, aided by a strong and moist cross-equatorial flow. PAGASA and the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began issuing advisories on the depression at that time, with the former assigning it the local name Etang. At the same time, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA).[2] The JTWC issued their first advisory on the system eight hours later.[3] The depression quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Maggie at 00:00 UTC the following day, and at 18:00 UTC the JMA upgraded it to a typhoon, with PAGASA following suit a day later.[2] Satellite imagery and intensity reports early on June 3 suggested the formation of a banding eye in the center of the system, leading to further organization and intensification as it continued on a northward course. A subtropical ridge to the north of the system became the dominant steering influence, causing Maggie to turn northwestward.[2] Satellite imagery on June 4 revealed a well-developed eyewall and an anticyclone established directly over the center of the typhoon, signaling that rapid intensification could be occurring.[1] Early on June 5, Maggie reached its peak intensity with maximum 1-minute sustained winds of 195\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph) while located over the Luzon Strait.[2] After reaching peak intensity, Maggie began to gradually weaken due to land interaction with the island of Taiwan. The subtropical ridge to the system's north strengthened, steering the cyclone further westward towards the southeast coast of China. On June 6, the weakening typhoon absorbed Tropical Depression Gening. At 12:00 UTC on June 6, Maggie made landfall approximately 55 nautical miles east-northeast of Hong Kong with 1-minute sustained winds of 150\u00a0km/h (93\u00a0mph).[2] Weakening to a tropical storm overland, Maggie moved back offshore later that day as it paralleled the coast, passing just northwest of Hong Kong before becoming quasi-stationary off the Chinese coast, with the JTWC issuing the final warning on the system at 03:00 UTC.[4] However, the JMA and the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) still carried Maggie as a strong tropical storm.[1] Although the JMA later dropped the system as a tropical cyclone, the HKO continued to observe Maggie as a weak tropical storm. Afterward, Maggie moved northwestward, making a second and final landfall near the mouth of the Pearl River late on June 7. The weakening storm moved inland and weakened to a tropical depression shortly after landfall, with the HKO issuing their final warning on the system at 06:00 UTC on June 8 while it was located north of Wuzhou.[1] The weakening system subsequently degenerated into a remnant low pressure area and continued northwestward before dissipating on June 9."

The winds and rain caused one fatality and cut off electricity to over 100,000 homes and caused US$18 million in agricultural damages as torrential rains flooded farmland and ruined crops. Offshore, five fishermen went missing after their vessels were damaged in the storm.[7] In Hong Kong, several high wind signals were posted as the typhoon approached.[5] Schools in Hong Kong were closed for the day while banks closed until 12:00 PM local time. Transportation was severely disrupted in the city as a number of ferry, bus, and taxi services were delayed and suspended and some roads were damaged.[7] Four people were confirmed to have died as a result of the typhoon in Guandong Province, while 3,200 structures and 120 vessels were damaged or destroyed by high winds and heavy rain. An oil barge docked near Tsing Yi sank in high seas while another barge, carrying 50,000 liters of diesel fuel sank near Tuen Mun Ferry Pier, its cargo polluting the nearby Butterfly Beach, which was forced to close.[5] As Maggie passed south of Taiwan, a high potential vorticity (PV) zone developed to the north of the island, while a low PV zone developed to the east of the island. These dynamical atmospheric changes sent a plume of moisture northward into Japan, causing heavy rainfall on the southernmost island, Kyushu. This event, while uncommon, is not a unique event, and has been termed as a \"moisture road\".[8]"

Satellite imagery showed a large area of curved convection near the equator from the 139th meridian east to the 145th meridian east. The disturbance tracked west-northwest, passing just south of Palau late on October\u00a09. Aided by an excellent poleward outflow channel via an upper-level trough, the disturbance steadily organized. At 02:22 UTC on October\u00a011, a Hurricane Hunter aircraft discovered a surface circulation east of Mindanao along with winds of 30 to 40\u00a0km/h (20 to 25\u00a0mph) and a barometric pressure of 1,006\u00a0mbar (29.7\u00a0inHg).[1] On the same day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a tropical depression. The disturbance became more defined as it passed through the islands of the southern Philippines.[2][nb 1] Early on October\u00a012, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the system. Later that day the JMA upgraded the depression into a tropical storm.[4][nb 2] An increase in organization prompted the JTWC to classify the system as a tropical depression later that day, although post-season analysis revealed that Cecil was already a tropical storm by this time. At the time, the JTWC expected the cyclone to rapidly intensify over the South China Sea and strike Vietnam within three days.[1] After becoming a tropical storm, Cecil turned northwest over the open waters of the South China Sea along the southern edge of a ridge over eastern China and the East China Sea. The storm steadily intensified,[1] with the JMA classifying the system as severe tropical storm at 00:00 UTC on October\u00a013.[2] After a Hurricane Hunter aircraft plane measured a pressure of 984\u00a0mbar (29.1\u00a0inHg) early on October\u00a013,[1] the JTWC upgraded Cecil to a typhoon at 18:00 UTC,[1] with the JMA doing the same early the next day.[4] Continuing to intensify, the typhoon cleared out an eye, which it would maintain until it struck land.[1] The JMA set the peak intensity at noon on October\u00a014, with winds of 145\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph) and a minimum pressure of 960\u00a0mbar (28\u00a0inHg).[2] Meanwhile, the JTWC estimated that Cecil obtained its peak intensity of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph) at 00:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a015. Continuing to slowly track northwest as the ridge to its north was weaker than expected, Cecil passed south of Hainan Island that morning and, according to the JTWC, began to weaken due to its close proximity to Vietnam.[1] However, the JMA estimated that no changed in strength occurred during this time.[2] Cecil turned west as the ridge to its north built back in and contrary to expectations did not make landfall until moving onshore just north of Hu\u1ebf at 22:00 UTC on October 15. Cecil crossed into Laos two hours later and by 06:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a016, the JTWC ceased tracking the system.[1] The JMA did the same 30 hours later.[2]"

        "content": "Hurricane Enrique was a Category 1 Pacific hurricane that brought heavy rainfall and flooding to much of western Mexico in late June 2021. The fifth named storm and first hurricane of the 2021 Pacific hurricane season, Enrique developed from a tropical wave the entered the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Nicaragua on June 22. In an environment conducive for intensification, the disturbance moved west-northwestward and developed into a tropical storm by 6:00 UTC on June 25, as it was already producing winds of 40\u00a0mph (65\u00a0km/h), and received the name Enrique. Enrique strengthened steadily within an environment of warm waters and low-to-moderate wind shear while continuing its northwestward motion. By 12:00 UTC on June 26, Enrique had intensified into a Category 1 hurricane as the storm turned more northwestward. Nearing the coast of Mexico, Enrique reached its peak intensity around 6:00 UTC the following day, with maximum sustained winds of 90\u00a0mph (150\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 972\u00a0mbar (28.7\u00a0inHg). Enrique, passing closely offshore west-central Mexico, maintained its intensity for another 24 hours as it turned northward toward the Gulf of California. Turning back to the northwest on June 28, increasing wind shear and dry air caused the hurricane to weaken. Enrique dropped to tropical storm status at 18:00 UTC that day, and further weakened to a tropical depression on June 30 just to the northeast of Baja California. The depression was absorbed into a larger low pressure area to the southeast later that day. Although the storm never made landfall, Enrique's path just offshore the Mexican coastline caused significant flooding, high surf, and rip currents across western Mexico. Two direct deaths resulted from the stormy conditions created by the cyclone in Guerrero. Over 115,000 electricity customers lost power in Jalisco. Some areas were inundated in over 4 feet of floodwater. Overall, Enrique was responsible for $50 million (2021 USD) worth of damage."

Slight additional intensification was forecast,[12] but this did not occur. On June 28, at 15:00\u00a0UTC the convective structure of Enrique had been eroded with the inner core becoming increasingly ragged due to dry air, causing the hurricane to weaken.[13] On the same day at 21:00\u00a0UTC the NHC downgraded Enrique to a high end tropical storm as the structure continued to deteriorate and had a partially exposed center.[14] On June 30, at 12:00 UTC, the NHC further downgraded Enrique to a tropical depression as its thunderstorms shrunk to a small area of deep convection.[15] On 21:00 UTC that day, Enrique degenerated into a remnant low in the Gulf of California as all of its convection had dissipated.[16]"

The fourth named storm of the 2021 Pacific hurricane season, Dolores developed from a low-pressure area that formed offshore the Mexican state of Oaxaca on June 16, 2021. The low steadily developed organized deep convection and a closed surface circulation, becoming Tropical Depression Four-E around 06:00 UTC June 18.[nb 1] The depression strengthened into a tropical storm nine hours later and was named Dolores. Gradually approaching the southwestern coast of Mexico, Dolores steadily intensified despite its close proximity to land. The storm reached its peak intensity around 15:00 UTC June 19 with maximum sustained winds of 115\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 29.2\u00a0inHg (989\u00a0mbar), just below hurricane strength. Shortly after reaching this intensity, Dolores made landfall just northwest of Punta San Telmo, near the Colima\u2013Michoac\u00e1n state border. The storm rapidly weakened as it moved inland over Mexico and dissipated early on June 20 over the state of Zacatecas. The precursor disturbance to Dolores and the Atlantic's Tropical Storm Claudette caused several days of heavy rainfall across southern Mexico and Central America. Tropical storm watches and warnings, as well as a hurricane watch, were issued along the southwestern coast of Mexico shortly after Dolores' upgrade to a tropical storm, from Nayarit southeastward to Michoac\u00e1n. At least three people died in Mexico due to the storm, with two of the deaths occurring in Guerrero and the third in Jalisco. Total damage across Mexico was estimated at USD$50\u00a0million.[nb 2]"

        "content": "A convectively-enhanced monsoon trough developed over the eastern Pacific Ocean in early June 2021, offshore the western coast of Central America. A separate tropical wave crossing Central America around this time interacted with the trough, resulting in a broad atmospheric circulation forming over the region by June 12. The northern part of this disturbed weather pattern moved north into the Gulf of Mexico, where it eventually developed into a separate tropical cyclone, Tropical Storm Claudette. The southern portion produced a new low-pressure area to the south of Mexico by June 16 over open waters. This new system started to produce a wide area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms.[1][2] The disturbance organized little until early on June 18, when convection surrounding the system's center became more well-organized. Simultaneously, a closed surface circulation formed, which signaled the development of a tropical depression at 06:00 UTC that day.[3] Expanding deep convection over the center of the depression, as well as increasing Dvorak classifications, resulted in its upgrade to a tropical storm at 15:00 UTC, where upon it was named Dolores.[4] A large tropical storm, Dolores gradually intensified due to favorable environmental conditions for the remainder of the day, characterized by warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear. The cyclone also underwent a general north-northwestward motion as it rounded the western side of mid-level ridge.[5] Deep convection began to develop in more organized, large rainbands over Dolores' circulation around 09:00 UTC on June 19, and increased in coverage near the storm's center.[6] Dolores continued to become more organized as it neared the coastline of southwest Mexico, with a defined eye and an almost-closed eyewall developing. The storm reached peak intensity shortly before 15:00 UTC that day, with maximum 1-minute sustained winds of 115\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 29.2\u00a0inHg (989\u00a0mbar). Dolores made landfall just after reaching peak intensity near the border of the Mexican states of Colima and Michoac\u00e1n, slightly northwest of the town of Punta San Telmo in the latter state.[7] Dolores rapidly weakened as it moved inland over western Mexico as it interacted with the mountainous terrain in the area. The cyclone was downgraded to a tropical depression at 03:00 UTC on June 20.[8] Shortly afterward, Dolores' surface circulation dissipated over southwestern Zacatecas.[9] However, mid-level moisture associated with Dolores' remnants continued north over west-central Mexico for another 12\u201324 hours.[1]"

The worst damage in Oaxaca occurred in the Sierra Sur and Costa regions, where debris were strewn across roads and extensive mudslides rendered many streets impassable.[18] At least 232 fallen trees were reported throughout the state of Colima due to Dolores' strong winds. Over 16 consecutive hours of rain fell across the state from June 18\u201319. Rainfall accumulation peaked around 439.9\u00a0mm (17.31\u00a0in) in Callejones, with isolated areas of over 12 inches elsewhere, including 400\u00a0mm (15.75\u00a0in) near Tecom\u00e1n.[1][19] The extreme rainfall resulted in floods that damaged banana crops statewide and threatened other agriculture.[19][20] More than 150 people rode out the storm at an evacuation center at a school in Cerra de Ortega, Tecom\u00e1n.[21] At least two houses were seriously damaged by flooding in the state.[22] In neighboring Michoac\u00e1n, at least 20 municipalities were affected by torrential rainfall for nearly 30 consecutive hours that flooded buildings and uprooted trees.[23] Landslides from the heavy rainfall blocked roads in the municipalities of L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas, Uruapan, Aquila, Chinicuila. Apatzing\u00e1n, Morelia, and Arteaga. An overflowing stream caused flooding in the village of Villa Victoria, Chinicuila.[23] The Federal Electricity Commission (CFE) reported 54,399 customers lost electricity across Jalisco, Nayarit and Sinaloa due to Dolores' passage to the south and east of those states.[24] Torrential rainfall and flash flooding lashed southern portions of Jalisco. At least 80 houses and 300 people living in El Rebalse were isolated in floodwaters after the Marabasco River overflowed.[11] A man died in a soccer field in Ciudad Guzm\u00e1n after being struck by lightning.[25] The outer bands of Dolores also caused minor flooding in neighboring Nayarit and further north in Sinaloa.[26] Insured losses from Dolores across Mexico were estimated at USD$50\u00a0million by professional services corporation Aon.[27] The Mexican Secretary of National Defense, Luis Cresencio Sandoval, activated Plan DN-III-E following Dolores' landfall, which allowed for the dispatch of 2,302 military units to assist in relief efforts in Colima, Michoac\u00e1n and Guerrero. Additionally, 190 shelters, 10 shelters, and 8 community kitchens were opened in these states to assist affected residents.[28] The Colima State Civil Protection Unit noted there was only moderate damage to infrastructure in coastal areas statewide following the storm.[20] However, Dolores caused significant damage to Colima's agricultural sector, with 60% of banana crops in the state wiped out by flooding, causing the price of bananas to rise statewide following the cyclone's passage.[29] Despite its destructive effects elsewhere, the heavy rainfall from Dolores and its precursor also benefited parts of Guerrero, which was suffering from drought conditions, thereby helping its agricultural sector.[30]"

        "content": " Typhoon Sarah, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Openg, was a powerful typhoon that caused extensive damage along an erratic path across the Western Pacific in September 1989. Originating from a disturbance within a monsoon trough in early September, Sarah was first classified as a tropical depression near the Mariana Islands on September\u00a05. Moving quickly westward, the depression soon strengthened into Tropical Storm Sarah. On September\u00a08, the storm abruptly turned southward and temporarily attained typhoon status. Following a series of interactions with secondary areas of low pressure, the storm turned northward the following day. By September\u00a011, Sarah entered a region favoring development and underwent a period of explosive intensification. At the end of this phase, the storm attained its peak intensity as a Category\u00a04\u2013equivalent typhoon on the Saffir\u2013Simpson Hurricane Scale. The typhoon subsequently weakened rapidly and made two landfalls in Taiwan by September\u00a012. After moving over the Taiwan Strait, Sarah made its final landfall in Eastern China on September\u00a013 before dissipating the following day. While the typhoon meandered near the Philippines, it brought several days of heavy rain to much of Luzon, triggering extensive flash flooding. At least 44 people perished across the country and another 200,000 were left homeless. Striking Taiwan as a strong typhoon, Sarah caused widespread wind damage that left approximately 840,000\u00a0residents without power. Excessive rainfall associated with the storm triggered flooding that washed away highways and inundated about 40,500 hectares (100,000 acres) of farmland. Throughout the island, Sarah was responsible for 19 fatalities and at least US$171\u00a0million (4.38\u00a0billion New Taiwan dollars) in damage.[nb 1] Four deaths also took place on the Got\u014d Islands.

        "content": "In early September\u00a01989, a monsoon trough became established across the western Pacific. By September\u00a03, a disturbance formed within the trough approximately 1,100\u00a0km (680\u00a0mi) southeast of the Japanese island of Minamitorishima. Initially, a tropical upper tropospheric trough (TUTT) to the northwest inhibited convective development; however, \"complex interactions\", according to Lt. Cdr. Nicholas D. Gural, later occurred between the TUTT cell, the initial disturbance, and a second disturbance, which resulted in favorable conditions for tropical cyclogenesis. Due to the improved environment, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued two Tropical Cyclone Formation Alerts on the system on September\u00a05.[1][nb 2] By this time, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began monitoring the system as a tropical depression.[3][nb 3] Ultimately, the JTWC issued their first advisory on Tropical Depression 22W early on September\u00a06, at which time the depression was situated northwest of the Mariana Islands.[1] Initially, the depression tracked west-southwestwards and gradually intensified; however, after being upgraded to Tropical Storm Sarah late on September\u00a06, the system turned northwestward and accelerated towards Okinawa. By September\u00a08, Sarah decelerated as it underwent a binary interaction with a secondary area of convection to the southwest. This interaction caused the cyclone to abruptly turn southwestward towards the Philippines before nearly stalling on September\u00a09. During this time, the storm temporarily attained typhoon status, having estimated winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph). Coinciding with Sarah's time as a typhoon, a new area of low pressure, classified as a \"lee side low\", developed along the west coast of Luzon.[1] Due to the cyclone's proximity to the Philippines, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Openg.[5] Later on September\u00a09, Sarah turned sharply northward as the lee side low rapidly tracked northeast. Reintensification gradually took place as the storm moved away from the Philippines, with the storm reaching typhoon status by September\u00a010. Tracking generally towards the north-northwest, Sarah entered a favorable region for development and underwent a period of explosive intensification on September\u00a011. Over a six-hour span, the storm's winds increased from 140 to 215\u00a0km/h (87 to 134\u00a0mph). A powerful typhoon, Sarah featured a well-defined eye and multiple outflow channels. The storm reached its peak strength later that day as a Category\u00a04\u2013equivalent typhoon on the Saffir\u2013Simpson Hurricane Scale with winds of 230\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph).[1] The JMA assessed Sarah to have been somewhat weaker, estimating peak ten-minute sustained winds of 150\u00a0km/h (93\u00a0mph) along with a barometric pressure of 950\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.05\u00a0inHg).[3] Forecasters at the JTWC initially projected the storm to track north of Taiwan on September\u00a012 and merge with an approaching frontal system. Contrary to this, Sarah moved south of the expected path and quickly weakened as it interacted with the mountainous terrain of Taiwan. The storm eventually struck the island with winds of 165\u00a0km/h (103\u00a0mph) late on September\u00a011. Unexpectedly, the typhoon executed a counterclockwise loop and briefly moved offshore before making a second landfall 12\u00a0hours later along the northeastern coast of Taiwan as a tropical storm. Sarah failed to reorganize as it moved over the Taiwan Strait and later made its final landfall in Zhejiang, China as a minimal tropical storm on September\u00a013. The storm was last noted the following day as dissipating over Eastern China.[1]"

In many areas, waters were waist-deep and officials advised residents in low-lying areas to move to higher ground.[7] Tropical storm force winds, recorded up to 88\u00a0km/h (55\u00a0mph) at the John Hay Air Base, also impacted the country.[1] In Zambales Province, a tornado spawned by the typhoon injured three people and caused approximately $90,000 worth of damage.[8] Another tornado struck the Clark Air Base, uprooting trees and damaging buildings. Losses from this tornado reached $150,000.[9] At least 44 people were killed in various incidents related to Typhoon Sarah in the Philippines while another three were reported missing. A total of 1,157 homes were destroyed and another 24,638 sustained damage,[5] leaving approximately 200,000 people homeless.[10][11] Damage from the storm was placed at $4.3\u00a0million.[12] In light of the severity of damage caused by Sarah, a state of calamity was declared for northern provinces.[13] Less than a week after the storm, additional rains in areas affected by Sarah triggered landslides that killed at least 16 people. Officials blamed the landslides on rocks loosened by the typhoon's rains.[11]"

The Central Weather Bureau also advised vessels in the Bashi Channel to be cautious or rough seas associated with the typhoon.[14] Most flights to and from the island were canceled by September\u00a011 for the duration of the storm; however, rail service continued for another day. Approximately 10,000 volunteer firefighters were placed on alert and city police were called in to organize evacuation centers.[15] Striking Taiwan as a powerful typhoon, destructive winds battered coastal areas near where the center moved ashore. According to officials in Taiwan, winds were recorded up to 174\u00a0km/h (108\u00a0mph) with gusts to 208\u00a0km/h (129\u00a0mph).[9] These winds downed thousands of trees and power lines, leaving an estimated 840,000 residents without electricity.[16] A total of 272,000 telephone lines were damaged or destroyed by the storm.[17] Excessive rainfall triggered widespread flash flooding that inundated agricultural areas and paralyzed transportation as roads and bridges were washed away.[12] On September\u00a011, the Suhua Highway was shut down due to landslides.[15] In Hualien City, flood waters reached a depth of 1.2\u00a0m (3.9\u00a0ft) and several homes were destroyed, leaving roughly 100 people homeless.[16][18] Across the island, 28\u00a0homes were destroyed and another 41\u00a0sustained damage. At least 19 people perished in Taiwan and another 14 were reported missing.[12] At least 40,500 hectares (100,000 acres) of farmland was submerged by flood waters.[10][19] Agricultural losses related to Typhoon Sarah reached US$171\u00a0million (4.38\u00a0billion New Taiwan dollars).[17] Offshore, a 12,800-ton Panamanian freighter, the Lung Hao, broke in two amidst rough seas produced by the typhoon. Twenty-one people were rescued by police after the vessel drifted 1\u00a0km (0.62\u00a0mi) to shore; however, four people were listed as missing.[20] After two days of search and rescue efforts, officials deemed their chance of survival to be very slim and the four missing crew members were declared dead on September\u00a014.[21]"

The deadliest tornado touched down just south of the Tennessee-Mississippi state line in Desoto County and tracked east-northeast for about 145 miles (233\u00a0km) across Shelby, Fayette, Hardeman, Chester, Henderson and Decatur Counties. While it was estimated to be an F4, some reports indicate that there was more than one tornado. Among the towns affected were Horn Lake, Mississippi, where about half of the fatalities were recorded, and Whitehaven, Tennessee, where the tornado damaged 30\u00a0homes. The parent supercell continued on to produce additional tornadoes in Scott County. North of Memphis, Tennessee, two F3 tornadoes killed a total of 22\u00a0from Crittenden County, Arkansas, to Carroll County, Tennessee. Homes were destroyed in Marion, Arkansas, resulting in five\u00a0deaths in Arkansas. In Tennessee, the town of Locke was mostly destroyed by the first F3 tornado. The second F3 tornado flattened structures near Covington and Medina. Several of the injured people who later died were plantation workers. A family of tornadoes also affected Hickman and Williamson Counties southwest of Nashville and later moved into the city of Cookeville and Putnam County. Three other tornadoes killed four\u00a0people in the Memphis coverage area, including in St. Francis and Lee Counties in Arkansas and Haywood County in Tennessee. Other F4 tornadoes were reported in Missouri near Golden, in Illinois near Texas City, and in south-central Tennessee near Bee Spring, just north of the Alabama state line. 11\u00a0deaths were recorded in the Missouri storm, five\u00a0near Texas City and 31\u00a0just north of the Alabama\u2013Tennessee state line.

The storm quickly strengthened into a severe tropical storm and reached a peak intensity of 110\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph)[nb 1], while slowly tracking west-northwest on September 30. Lekima would stay at peak intensity for the remainder of its life until the cyclone made a final landfall over Central Vietnam on October 3. The remnants dissipated over land later that day. In the Philippines, Hanna brought heavy torrential rains to Luzon that caused landslides which killed eight people in the province of Ifugao, as well as flooding, infrastructure damage, agricultural damage and disruption of transportation service in other parts of the Philippines. In China, over 100,000 people were evacuated, six flights were cancelled and more than 20,000 fishing boats were recalled back to the harbors.

Additionally, no tropical cyclones formed in the Central Pacific basin for the first time since 2017. The season officially began on May\u00a015 in the East Pacific Ocean (east of 140\u00b0W), and on June\u00a01 in the Central Pacific (from 140\u00b0W to the International Date Line, north of the equator; they both ended on November\u00a030. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the respective regions. However, the formation of tropical cyclones is possible at any time of the year, as illustrated in 2020 by the formation of the season's first system, Tropical Depression One-E, on April\u00a025. This was the earliest formation of a tropical cyclone on record in the eastern Pacific basin proper. The final system of the season was Tropical Storm Polo, which dissipated on November\u00a019. The most significant storms of the season were Tropical Storm Amanda and Hurricane Genevieve. Amanda developed near Central America in late May and struck Guatemala, causing widespread damage in neighboring El Salvador and killing 40 people amid the COVID-19 pandemic in the latter country. Genevieve passed closely to the tip of the Baja California Peninsula in August, bringing hurricane-force winds and heavy rainfall, killing six and causing an estimated $50 million in damage. Otherwise, impact from other storms was minimal. In late July, Hurricane Douglas made an extremely close pass to Hawaii, with its weak southern eyewall crossing Oahu, causing minor effects. The remnant moisture of Tropical Storm Fausto brought dry thunderstorms and lightning to Northern California, sparking hundreds of fires that contributed to the state's worst fire season in recorded history, and the remnants of Genevieve dropped heavy rainfall in Arizona and Southern California. Tropical Storm Hernan moved very near the coast of southwestern Mexico, causing an additional fatality and several millions of dollars worth of damage. Collectively, the tropical cyclones of this season caused about US$267.91 million in damage and 47 deaths."

This marked the earliest formation of a tropical cyclone on record in the eastern Pacific basin, surpassing 2017's Tropical Storm Adrian.[6] Among relatively unfavorable conditions, the depression soon dissipated without developing further,[7] and activity would not resume in the basin until nearly a month later with the formation of Tropical Depression Two-E near the coast of Guatemala on May 30. This system would later become Tropical Storm Amanda, the first named storm of the season and one of the worst natural disasters in El Salvador in around two decades.[8][9] Not for nearly another month after Amanda, Tropical Depression Three-E would briefly become Tropical Storm Boris on June 25 well out to sea before weakening in the Central Pacific basin.[10][11] A short-lived tropical depression would form near Baja California Sur just 2 days after Boris's dissipation and quickly weaken.[12] Moving into July, Tropical Storm Cristina formed on July 6 and slowly intensified to a peak intensity of 70 miles per hour (110\u00a0km/h), barely missing hurricane status.[13][14] Activity continued as yet another tropical depression, Six-E, formed on July 13 but quickly dissipated among the unfavorable conditions unfolding in the basin.[15] Two more tropical systems formed in mid July, Tropical Depression Seven-E and Tropical Storm Douglas. Seven-E was short lived and although it did gain tropical storm intensity, it was operationally left unnamed. Douglas strengthened into the first hurricane of the season at 15:00\u00a0UTC on July 22, marking the fourth\u2013latest date any season had gone without a hurricane. Douglas would later strengthen into a Category 4 hurricane and brush Hawaii with rain and gusty winds.[16] A burst of activity occurred in early August, with a tropical wave south of Mexico evolving into Tropical Storm Elida on August 9, later to become the second hurricane of the season. Elida was generally short lived, but with the formation of Tropical Depression Ten-E, Tropical Storm Fausto, and Hurricane Genevieve activity continued. Genevieve later became the second major hurricane of the season before briefly effecting Baja California Sur as a minimal hurricane. Two additional tropical cyclones, Tropical Storms Hernan and Iselle, formed in late August. Both were generally weak and did not make landfall, although the former brought heavy flooding and mudslides to western Mexico. Later, on September 5, the remnants of former Atlantic tropical cyclone Nana reformed into a new cyclone in the Pacific named Julio. After Julio, Karina and Lowell formed. Near the end of September, Hurricane Marie formed and rapidly intensified up to Category 4 strength before weakening out to sea, becoming the strongest storm of the season. The only October storm of the season, Norbert, lasted for 10 days. After almost a month of inactivity, Odalys formed on November 3, and dissipated three days later without affecting land. Tropical Storm Polo formed close to the end of the season, but it was also short-lived and weak. The Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) index for the 2020 Pacific hurricane season (Eastern Pacific and Central Pacific combined) as calculated by Colorado State University using data from the National Hurricane Center was 77.3\u00a0units.[nb 1][18] Broadly speaking, ACE is a measure of the power of a tropical or subtropical storm multiplied by the length of time it existed. It is only calculated for full advisories on specific tropical and subtropical systems reaching or exceeding wind speeds of 39 miles per hour (63\u00a0km/h)."

Both the low and associated thunderstorm activity gained cohesion over the coming days, resulting in the formation of a tropical depression around 18:00\u00a0UTC on November\u00a017 to the southwest of Baja California Sur. The depression intensified into Tropical Storm Polo six hours later and reached peak winds of 45\u00a0mph (75\u00a0km/h) the following morning. As the system moved west-northwest, it encountered an increasingly hostile environment, and Polo weakened to a tropical depression early on November\u00a019. By 18:00\u00a0UTC that day, the cyclone degenerated to a remnant area of low pressure that moved west and then west-southwest prior to dissipating into an open trough on November\u00a021.[63]"

The eighth tropical cyclone, fifth named storm,[a] first hurricane, and first major hurricane of the 2020 Pacific hurricane season, Douglas originated from a tropical wave which entered the basin in mid-July. Located in favorable conditions, the wave began to organize on July 19. It became a tropical depression on July 20 and a tropical storm the following day. After leveling off as a strong tropical storm due to dry air, Douglas began rapid intensification on July 23, becoming the season's first major hurricane the following day and peaking as a Category 4 hurricane. After moving into the Central Pacific basin, Douglas slowly weakened as it approached Hawaii. The storm later passed north of the main islands as a Category 1 hurricane, passing dangerously close to Oahu and Kauai, causing minimal damage, and resulting in no deaths or injuries. Douglas weakened to tropical storm status on July 28, as it moved away from Hawaii, before degenerating into a remnant low on July 29 and dissipating on the next day."

        "content": "Douglas originated from a tropical wave located over the central portion of the East Pacific basin on July 19.[1] This tropical wave was located further east and in a slightly more conducive environment than another tropical wave to its east, later to become Tropical Depression Seven-E.[1] With large convective bursts repetitively occurring near the circulation, the wave became more organized into the day and chances of development were gradually raised.[2] This organization was followed by a scatterometer pass which indicated the system had a well-defined, closed low level circulation, indicating the system had very quickly developed.[3] Thus, the first advisory was issued on the system as Tropical Depression Eight-E at 15:00 UTC on July 20.[3] This quick evolution of the storm continued, and a small but defined central dense overcast became evident on satellite imagery.[4] This, bundled with increasing satellite estimates, allowed the National Hurricane Center (NHC) to upgrade the depression to Tropical Storm Douglas at 03:00 UTC, July 21.[4] A small cyclone, Douglas continued to take advantage of its favorable environment and continuously intensified.[5] Well-defined banding developed on the storm's western side, while thunderstorms near the center gathered into a comma head shape.[6] At the time, Douglas' southwest movement was largely influenced by strong mid-level ridging to its north.[6] However, Douglas' small size and this movement allowed a moderate intake of dry air to be entrained into the circulation.[7] Intensification took a halt for much of July 22, as a result, and Douglas' thunderstorms began to slowly decay.[8] After successfully mixing out mid-level dry air from the core of the system, Douglas swiftly recuperated.[9] Convection re-developed, and a ragged eye became briefly evident on satellite imagery, indicating Douglas had strengthened to low-end Category\u00a01 hurricane intensity.[9] This marked the fourth-latest date on record that the first hurricane formed in a season, tying the record of 2004's Hurricane Celia.[9] It soon became apparent Douglas was entering a phase of rapid intensification, as a ring of intense thunderstorms formed around a warming eye.[10] Douglas jumped to Category\u00a03 major hurricane status, as rapid intensification continued, and the storm became larger in size.[11] Intensification slightly leveled off as the day went on, but the formerly-ragged eye became very warm and symmetrical, indicating the storm had entered a more stable state.[12] Despite this, a regrowth of the eyewall began, and Douglas reached its peak intensity as a Category\u00a04 hurricane at 21:00 UTC on July 23, with maximum 1-minute sustained winds of 130\u00a0mph (210\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 954 millibars (28.2\u00a0inHg).[13][14] On July 24, visible imagery revealed Douglas' eye had become increasingly cloud-filled, while the storm's overall satellite appearance degraded.[15] Douglas entered the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility by 21:00 UTC on July 24.[16] As Douglas drifted over cooler sea surface temperatures, more weakening ensued as the system continued northwest.[17] Douglas eventually fell below Category\u00a03 major hurricane status late on July 24, and weakened to a Category 1 hurricane about 12 hours later.[18][19] At this time, Douglas was located roughly 325 miles (523\u00a0km) east of Hilo, Hawaii.[20] Douglas continued a slow movement towards the Hawaiian islands, while retaining its intensity,[21] before weakening further as it passed north of Big Island.[22][23] Nonetheless, the storm remained in rather healthy condition, despite being situated over cold sea surface temperatures and experiencing wind shear near Hawaii.[22] Douglas passed north of Maui at 01:00 UTC on July 27, Oahu at 07:00 UTC, and Kauai at 22:00 UTC.[24][25][26] Douglas' close pass just 30\u00a0mi (48\u00a0km) north of Oahu broke the previous record set by Hurricane Dot for closest passing tropical cyclone to the island, whereas Dot passed about 60\u00a0mi (97\u00a0km) southwest of Oahu.[27] After moving away from Kauai, Douglas briefly re-intensified as confirmed from reconnaissance.[28] However, strengthening was very short-lived as wind shear quickly displaced deep convection from the storm's circulation.[29] Douglas weakened into a tropical storm shortly afterward,[30] and eventually became a remnant low by 12:00\u00a0UTC on July 29.[31][13] Douglas' post-tropical low entered the Western Pacific basin later on July 30,[32] before opening up into a trough at 06:00\u00a0UTC that day.[13]"

By 00:00 UTC the following day, deep convection had become sufficiently organized within the disturbance, and it strengthened into a tropical depression.[1] At 06:00 UTC, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Selma.[1] After being classified as a tropical storm, Selma turned to the north-northwest in the flow between a mid-level ridge to its northeast and a trough over the Gulf of Mexico. A compact tropical cyclone, Selma was initially expected to strengthen due to warm waters and light to moderate wind shear in its path, but the cyclone ended up strengthening little after northeasterly wind shear strengthened, which also caused most of the deep convection to be displaced to the southwest of the storm's center.[3][4] At around 11:00 UTC on October 28, Selma made landfall near Playa El Pimental in El Salvador with maximum sustained winds of 40\u00a0mph (65\u00a0km/h).[1] The storm rapidly weakened to a tropical depression over the rugged terrain of El Salvador, and by 18:00\u00a0UTC the same day, the circulation of Selma had completely dissipated.[1]"

Two days later, Judy attained typhoon status as it began a gradual turn to the west-northwest. Late on July\u00a025, the storm peaked with winds of 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph). Striking Kyushu on July\u00a027, interaction with the island's mountainous terrain caused Judy to quickly weaken as it neared South Korea. The weakened storm struck the country west of Pusan the following day before losing its identity near the border with North Korea. The remnants of Judy were last noted over the Sea of Japan. In Japan, damaging winds from the typhoon left approximately 4\u00a0million people without power. Significant flooding in the country resulted in 11 deaths and $28.9\u00a0million in damage. In South Korea, heavy rains from the storm exacerbated ongoing floods, leading to at least 20 fatalities. Flooding from the remnants of Judy affected the Soviet Far East, temporarily severing the Trans-Siberian Railway and killing 15 people."

        "content": "In mid-July, a monsoon trough located west of the Northern Mariana Islands produced two tropical disturbances. The first of these tracked due west and later became Tropical Storm Irving. The second of these disturbances remained poorly organized and development into a tropical cyclone was expected to be slow. By July\u00a021, an area of low pressure formed within the system and convection associated with it increased. Situated underneath an anticyclone, upper-level outflow also improved. Following further organization of the system, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued their first advisory on Tropical Depression 11W on July\u00a021;[nb 1] at this time, the depression was located about 555\u00a0km (345\u00a0mi) west of Guam. Further aided by a tropical upper tropospheric trough to the northwest, the depression intensified into a tropical storm on July\u00a023 and was assigned the name Judy by the JTWC.[2] On July\u00a023, a subtropical ridge to the northeast of Judy caused the system to turn northward. This turn was not well anticipated by tropical cyclone forecast models. By July\u00a025, satellite imagery indicated that Judy had intensified into a typhoon. Within hours of reaching this strength, the a weather buoy near the storm recorded a barometric pressure of 974\u00a0mb (hPa; 28.76\u00a0inHg) and winds of 105\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph). Strengthening continued throughout the day and Judy soon attained its peak intensity as a Category\u00a02 equivalent typhoon on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale, with maximum sustained winds estimated at 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph).[2] Around this time, the Japan Meteorological Agency assessed the typhoon to have attained ten-minute sustained winds of 155\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph) and a pressure of 940 mbar (hPa; 27.76\u00a0inHg).[3][nb 2] On July\u00a026, the typhoon turned towards the northwest and weakened somewhat. Late the next day, Judy struck the southern coast of Kyushu before moving over the Korea Strait. Interaction with the mountainous terrain of the island caused the storm to degenerate. Less than a day after moving over Kyushu, the system weakened to a tropical storm and soon made landfall in South Korea, roughly 205\u00a0km (127\u00a0mi) west of Pusan. Once onshore, rapid weakening took place with Judy being downgraded to a tropical depression within 12\u00a0hours. The remnants of Judy were last noted on July\u00a029 over the Sea of Japan.[2]"

Across Kyushu, rainfall rates exceeded 40\u00a0mm (1.6\u00a0in) per hour at times and many areas measured total rainfall over 500\u00a0mm (20\u00a0in).[7] Significant flooding and landslides from the storm destroyed 25\u00a0homes and damaged many more.[8] In Nichinan, Miyazaki, roughly 1,800 people evacuated as a river rose and threatened to flood parts of the city. Damaging winds from the storm, measured up to 180\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph) in Kagoshima, left roughly 4\u00a0million households without power.[7][9] Train service throughout Kyushu was significantly disrupted, with 110,000 passengers stranded.[7] Damage throughout the island was placed at $3.8\u00a0million.[10] Agricultural losses from the storm reached 3.5\u00a0billion yen ($25.1\u00a0million).[7] In all, Typhoon Judy killed 11\u00a0people in Japan, destroyed 76 homes and damaged 10,664 others.[11] On July\u00a028, typhoon and heavy rain warnings were issued for all of South Korea.[12] Numerous people in low-lying areas were evacuated. Thousands of vessels were also called to port to ride out the storm.[10] Winds up to 125\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph) battered coastal areas of South Korea, uprooting many trees and leaving thousands without power.[13] In Yeosu, hundreds of windows were blown out by the winds.[10] Heavy rains, amounting to at least 335\u00a0mm (13.2\u00a0in) along the Yeongsan River,[14] from the storm exacerbated ongoing floods in the country.[8] In Pusan, 15 people were killed by the storm, 9 by landslides and 6 by structural collapse or flooding.[15] Approximately 2,000 homes were damaged or destroyed in the city.[16] In some areas, flood waters were \"knee-deep.\"[8] Throughout the country, 20 people were confirmed to have been killed by the storm;[17] however, media reports indicated that 24 people perished.[16] According to Korean officials, roughly 47,000 people were left homeless and losses reached 1.2\u00a0billion won (US$1.8\u00a0million).[17] In the wake of Typhoon Judy, the South Korean Red Cross set up soup kitchens.[18] The remnants of Judy produced heavy rains in the Soviet Far East in early August, resulting in significant flooding. In Primorsky Krai, at least 15 people were killed by the floods which virtually cut off part of the Trans-Siberian Railway and washed out 267 bridges. A total of 109 settlements were also inundated.[19][20] Approximately 120,000 hectares (300,000 acres) of land was underwater at the height of the floods. In addition to the loss of human life, 75,000 cattle drowned.[21]"

        "content": "On Thursday, March\u00a03, 1966, the atmosphere over Mississippi was ripe for a violent tornado. In the upper-levels of the troposphere, a fairly strong jet stream, with winds estimated at 140 to 150 miles per hour (230 to 240\u00a0km/h), oriented itself northeastward over the state, providing strong diffluence. A large mid-level trough, centered near Sioux Falls, South Dakota, was the overall system that produced the tornado. It featured low millibar heights roughly four times below the standard mean. Additionally, an unusually strong mid-level jet stream with 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h) winds provided additional energy to the storm system. The final factor in the development of the Candlestick Park storm was a subtle wind shift near the surface. At the higher levels, winds flowed from the southwest to the northeast in relation to the jet stream; however, closer to the surface, the inflow from the low pressure system over South Dakota resulted in a south to north flow, allowing for rotation within storms.[3] In the hours prior to the tornado forming, convective available potential energy (CAPE) values of over 1,500\u00a0J/kg were present, indicating moderate instability. However, dry air at higher levels created a capping inversion, limiting the number of thunderstorms that could develop. Later on, a warm front moved past Jackson, Mississippi, allowing more moist air into the region and increasing lapse rates. While this cap served to prevent a widespread tornado outbreak, it did allow for the formation of a few discrete strong storms.[4] With this, a supercell thunderstorm developed over Louisiana and produced three tornadoes, including the large F5 tornado that moved through Mississippi and Alabama.[5]"

Tracking generally to the northeast, the tornado moved through mostly rural areas south of Raymond though several barns and a few homes were heavily damaged. The tornado also toppled the 1,900-foot (580\u00a0m) broadcast tower for Jackson television station WLBT. Around 4:30\u00a0p.m. CST, the storm struck the southern limits of Jackson as an F4 or F5 tornado and mostly leveled the Candlestick Park shopping center. Cinder-blocks from the structure were scattered for long distances.[12] A number of homes and businesses were also destroyed in this area. Eyewitness reported pavement scouring, and that a few cars were tossed upwards of one-half mile (0.80\u00a0km) by the tornado. Many homes and businesses in the area were completely destroyed by the tornado, including a glass factory that was severely mangled. A brick Baptist church was destroyed with such force that it seemingly \"exploded\".[13] Once it moved through Jackson, the storm crossed the Pearl River and entered Rankin County. In Rankin County, the tornado's progress became unclear as it passed through mostly rural areas and an industrial complex. Currently, it is believed to have continued a nearly straight northeastward track through the entire county. However, reports from locals indicate that the tornado turned slightly more northward.[5] Near the Leesburg community, the tornado reached its maximum strength of F5, where multiple homes were swept away, large swaths of trees were leveled, pavement was scoured, and chicken houses were obliterated. Similar damage took place as the system moved into Scott County, though specifics are scarce for this portion of the storm's history. Crossing into Leake County along MS 35, the tornado took a more northeasterly track, passing near the communities of Madden and Salem. In Neshoba County, the storm began to weaken and may have lifted several times as it moved through both the Neshoba and Kemper counties. Despite this, about a dozen more homes were destroyed before the tornado crossed into Alabama. After crossing the border, significant damage continued through Pickens and Tuscaloosa Counties before the tornado finally dissipated near the city of Tuscaloosa around 7:45\u00a0p.m. CST. During the storm's three-hour-and-forty-five-minute existence, it traveled roughly 202.5\u00a0mi (325.9\u00a0km), one of the longest paths ever recorded.[7][5][9]"

        "content": "Prior to the Candlestick Park tornado, there had only been one other F5 (the other occurring on December\u00a05, 1953) to touch down in Mississippi.[15] The next storm of this intensity would not take place until April 27, 2011, when two EF5 tornadoes touched down near the towns of Philadelphia and Smithville.[16]  Overall, the tornado ranks as the second-deadliest and longest-tracked in the state's history, having killed 57-58 and traveled 202.5\u00a0mi (325.9\u00a0km); however, excluding outside portions of the track, it ranks third.[15] In general, it is also regarded as one of the most devastating tornadoes to ever strike Mississippi.[17] In the decades following the tornado, reassessments on the history of the storm have been made; most notably the Jackson, Mississippi branch of the National Weather Service and meteorologist Thomas P. Grazulis both indicate that there were two separate tornadoes. Based on reports from residents who experienced the tornado, a second one formed as the original dissipated, a common occurrence in cycling supercell thunderstorms. Though there is agreement on this feature, the results have not been implemented into the National Climatic Data Center's severe weather database, thus it is still officially considered one tornado.[5] According to the study by Grazulis, the tornado dissipated over Leake County and a second tornado, estimated at F2 strength, touched down in Pickens County, Alabama.[18] On the 50th anniversary of the tornado, the National Weather Service in Jackson published a section on the tornado titled \"If the Tornado Happened Today,\" briefly detailing the scale of damage in relation to new development just to the east of Jackson in the communities of Pearl and Flowood. Given exactly the same path that took place in 1966, the loss of life would be considerably higher. Striking at rush hour, numerous vehicles would be in the path of the tornado as it crossed Interstates 20 and 55 as well as US 80 and MS 25. Despite vastly improved warning systems, the population density of Jackson's eastern suburbs would lean towards a higher likelihood of fatalities.[5]"

An area of disturbed weather was first detected on September\u00a011 near Ponape. After moving westward, the system gradually became better organized and thunderstorm activity increased. On September\u00a016, the system attained tropical storm status. Two days later, Clara attained typhoon intensity and subsequently began to deepen at a faster rate. On September\u00a019, Clara reached maximum intensity, before making landfall along the northern tip of Luzon. Clara steadily weakened after interacting with land, but by late on September\u00a020, Clara leveled off in intensity over the South China Sea. The next day, Clara moved ashore to the east-northeast of Hong Kong while still at typhoon intensity before rapidly dissipating over land. In the Philippines, 55\u00a0people perished. A total of 7,125\u00a0homes were damaged and 1,195\u00a0houses were destroyed, which left nearly 4,000\u00a0people homeless in one province alone.

        "content": "An area of disturbed weather was first detected by satellite imagery on the afternoon of September\u00a011 near Ponape embedded in the monsoon trough. The disturbance tracked westward, with its development aided by a tropical upper tropospheric trough that provided divergence aloft. Despite some wind shear, thunderstorm activity increased in organization and coverage by the afternoon on September\u00a013.[1] At 18:00 UTC, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started monitoring the cyclone, classifying it as a tropical depression.[2][nb 1] Less than two hours later, a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) was issued by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). Thunderstorm activity continued to increase as the shear relaxed, and at 19:23\u00a0UTC on September\u00a014, the TCFA was re-issued. After passing 390\u00a0km (240\u00a0mi) south of Guam, the JTWC initiated warnings on the system early on September\u00a015.[1] Eighteen hours later, the JTWC classified the system as a tropical storm.[4] At 18:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a016, the JMA did the same.[5][nb 2] Upon becoming a tropical storm, the JTWC initially expected Clara to track into Luzon.[1] At 18:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a017, the JMA declared Clara a severe tropical storm.[2] The same day, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also started monitoring the storm and assigned it with the local name Rubing.[7] By September\u00a018, the JTWC had modified its forecast and called for the storm to re-curve out to sea in response to a weakness in a ridge to its north, but this weakness was only enough to enable a west-northwest track. After satellite images indicated that Clara developed an eye,[8] both the JTWC and JMA reported that Clara had intensified into a typhoon, and subsequently began to rapidly intensify.[5] Midday on September\u00a019, the JTWC raised the intensity of Clara to 210\u00a0km/h (130\u00a0mph), equal to low-end Category\u00a04 intensity on the United States-based Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS).[4] At this time, hurricane hunters measured a barometric pressure of 924\u00a0mbar (27.3\u00a0inHg).[8] However, the JMA estimated a slightly higher pressure of 925\u00a0mbar (27.3\u00a0inHg).[2] At 18:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a019, the JTWC estimated a peak wind speed of 225\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph) while the JMA reported a peak intensity of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph).[5] At 22:00\u00a0UTC, the typhoon briefly made landfall on the northern tip of Luzon at the same intensity,[1] with the storm passing approximately 40\u00a0km (25\u00a0mi) north of Calayan.[8] After entering the South China Sea, the typhoon began to move northwest, but a ridge to its north prevented re-curvature.[1] The storm weakened some due to land interaction, but leveled off in intensity late on September\u00a020.[5] At 12:00\u00a0the next day, Clara made landfall around 260\u00a0km (160\u00a0mi) east-northwest of Hong Kong,[1] or near Shanwei,[8] with the JTWC and JMA reporting winds of 145 and 135\u00a0km/h (90 and 85\u00a0mph) respectively.[5] Clara rapidly dissipated over the hilly terrain of China,[1] but the JMA did not cease tracking its remnants until October\u00a02, after the storm turned to the north and reached 56\u00b0N.[2]"

There, a total of 36\u00a0families sought shelter in higher ground due to floodwaters 2.4\u00a0m (8\u00a0ft) high[9] while many towns in the surrounding area were isolated.[10] Throughout the Cagayan province, 3,725\u00a0people were rendered homeless and property damage totaled $1.8\u00a0million.[11] Nationwide, 55\u00a0people died.[12] Nearly 48,000\u00a0people sought shelter.[13] A total of 7,125\u00a0homes were damaged and 1,195\u00a0houses were destroyed.[14] Damage was estimated at $13.4\u00a0million,[nb 3] with $10.9\u00a0million from crops, $2\u00a0million from public infrastructure, and roughly $500,000 from private infrastructure.[14] Offshore Calayan Island, the 1,600-short-ton (1,450\u00a0t) vessel Datu Kalantiaw was wrecked by a coral reef,[10] with 19 of the 97\u00a0people necessitating rescue.

Twelve victims sustained injures.[17] To search for the missing, authorities dispatched four helicopters, one C-130 transport plane, and an ammunition ship.[10] The United States Navy also provided some assistance initially, but gave up searching on September\u00a023.[19] While the typhoon passed 50\u00a0nmi (93\u00a0km) northeast of Pratas Island (Tungsha/Dongsha), Taiwan (ROC), winds of 45 knots and a pressure of 984.7\u00a0mbar (29.08\u00a0inHg) were measured.[8]:\u200a25\u200a Across China, 62\u00a0people were killed.[8] In the Fujian province, nearly 20,235\u00a0ha (50,000 acres) of rice paddies and 121,405\u00a0ha (300,000 acres) of sugar cane were damaged.[16] Many highways were impassable and there was widespread loss of communication.[20] About 8,500\u00a0ha (21,000 acres) of farmland were flooded in Shantou alone, where winds of 110\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph) were recorded. Several thousand people were homeless due to the flooding. In Hong Kong, a No 1. hurricane signal was issued on September 20. The next day, the signal was increased to a No 3. hurricane signal. All signals were dropped after the typhoon moved inland. On Cheung Chau, a peak wind speed of 58\u00a0km/h (36\u00a0mph) and a peak wind gust of 94\u00a0km/h (58\u00a0mph) was reported. Tate's Cairn observed 23.2\u00a0mm (0.91\u00a0in) of rain over a 24-hour period, the highest in the region. Local ferry service and air traffic were disrupted by the typhoon and a few signs were knocked down, but there were no serious reports of damage in the vicinity of Hong Kong. Further north, in Taiwan, up to 560\u00a0mm (22\u00a0in) of rain fell in some places, but there was no serious damage.[8]"

The most destructive tornado of this event occurred on the early evening of Wednesday, June 8, 1966, when Topeka, Kansas was struck by an F5 rated tornado. It started on the southwest side of town, moving northeast, passing through several subdivisions and over a local landmark named Burnett's Mound. 57 tornadoes were confirmed during the 11-day span, which left 18 people dead and 543 injured (16 of the 18 deaths and 450 of the injuries were attributed to the Topeka tornado)."

        "content": "A violent tornado began developing at 6:55\u00a0p.m. Central Time on June 8, touching down 8 miles (13\u00a0km) west of the city. The National Weather Service could not detect the developing tornado on radar as the Topeka forecast office used a modified military radar that was donated by the U.S. government after World War II. While it was state-of-the-art for the time, it had limited ability to detect tornadic activity compared to Doppler weather radar. Around 7:30\u00a0p.m., a 1/4 to 1/2-mile (400\u2013800 m) wide tornado tracked into the southwest side of town, moving northeast, and passed over Burnett's Mound. Bill Kurtis, then a fill-in reporter at WIBW-TV (channel 13; then a hybrid CBS/ABC/NBC affiliate, now CBS) delivered the message to take shelter from the devastating storm by telling viewers calmly but sternly, \"for God's sake, take cover!\"[7][8] After broadcasting a take-cover report on the air while driving down the winding road on Burnett's Mound with the tornado approaching his direction, Rick Douglass, a reporter for radio station WREN (1250 AM, now KYYS), attempted to take shelter under an overpass, while trying to do a second live report on the storm. Douglass was carried by the tornado, becoming airborne for a few seconds, and was dropped over one block away. Douglass, whose clothes were ripped from his body, was pushed by the strong winds along the ground until the tornado passed on to make a six-block swath across Topeka. Douglass was found with dirt and debris covering his body. When he arrived at an area hospital, a nurse placed a cover over Douglass's face \u2013 believing he had perished. In an interview with The History Channel's Wrath of God, Douglass stated that he then pulled off the cover, resulting in the attending nurse wincing in reaction, Douglass found shards of debris in his skin for several years after the tornado and was left with a smell he described in the interview as \"a mix of blood, guts, wood and metal\" for several weeks.[9] The tornado first struck residential areas, cleanly sweeping away entire rows of homes and hurling vehicles hundreds of yards through the air. Grass was scoured from the ground according to eyewitnesses.[10] Washburn University took a direct hit, and many large stone buildings on campus were badly damaged or destroyed.[10] A 300-pound section of stone wall was torn from one building and thrown two miles away.[11] One vehicle on campus was reportedly lofted over the top of the university's ROTC building, before coming to rest on the 50-yard line of the football field.[12] The tornado ripped through the central part of the city, hitting the downtown area. Buses were crushed when the transportation barn was collapsed by the tornado, and trains on the Santa Fe Railway were overturned. Most of the downtown buildings were badly damaged or had windows blown out. Cars were flipped and tossed, and streets were blocked with debris. Many workers at the AT&T building downtown took shelter after a co-worker warned them of the approaching tornado, which could not be heard through the soundproof operator's room. The building incurred only light damage. The Kansas State Capitol building was also damaged when debris struck the dome removing one of the copper panels. As the storm raged through the downtown area, meteorologists at the National Weather Service Topeka forecast office, located at Philip Billard Municipal Airport, took shelter as the tornado tracked through the airport, flipping over several airplanes. At 7:29\u00a0p.m., 34 minutes after it touched down, the tornado dissipated after ripping through the airport. By this time, the tornado had traversed 22 miles (35\u00a0km) of the city, with a damage path width of 1\u20442 mile (800\u00a0m). The most intense damage occurred in residential areas on the east side of town, due to the closely spaced housing units. Homes and other buildings along the tornado's path were obliterated, and the National Weather Service Topeka forecast office years later rated the tornado at F5 on the Fujita scale. Then-mayor Chuck Wright later issued a decree that those caught looting would be shot on sight. The Kansas National Guard was called in. Streets in devastated areas of the city were filled with sightseers checking out the ruins of homes and businesses, which hampered efforts from first responders to find those missing under rubble. Families of victims also came to the scene to try to find them. A total of 820 homes were destroyed and 3,000 others were damaged. 250 businesses were destroyed and 2,390 were damaged including a major shopping center. 330 of the damaged homes and businesses suffered major damage and the other 5,000 received lesser degrees of damage. Hundreds of apartments were destroyed. Many government buildings, public buildings, other structures and much other property were damaged or destroyed. Overall, 16 people were killed, and many others were injured. However, it is believed that had the tornado hit during school and work hours or during the night, that as many as 5,000 people would have been killed. Bill Kurtis was credited for saving many lives with his urgent message to take cover.[13][8] According to a local Native American legend, Burnett's Mound (a local landmark that was named after Potawatomi Indian chief Abram Burnett, and also believed to be an ancient Native American burial ground) was thought to protect the city from tornadoes, suggesting that the 250 feet (76\u00a0m) hill would cause a tornado that was approaching Topeka to disintegrate. A few years earlier, a water tower had been built directly on the mound, which sparked controversy among Topeka residents who felt it could impede the mound's reputed protective effect.[citation needed] Ten other tornadoes had struck the city since state records began in 1889, but the 1966 tornado was worse than any of the others.[14][failed verification]"

While on the ground for 30\u00a0minutes, it traveled along a 28.28-mile (45.51\u00a0km) path through four counties, leaving behind three deaths, eight injuries, and $1.1\u00a0million in damage. The supercell thunderstorm that produced this tornado formed around 1:00\u00a0p.m. CDT south of Jackson, Mississippi. Traveling briskly to the northeast, it became severe within 25\u00a0minutes and potentially tornadic by 1:36\u00a0p.m. CDT. A tornado finally touched down at 2:30\u00a0p.m. CDT just east of the Philadelphia Municipal Airport. It quickly intensified and began producing EF5 damage by 2:38\u00a0p.m. CDT; extreme ground scouring, up to .5 metres (1.6\u00a0ft) deep in places, occurred in northeastern Neshoba County. After crossing into Kemper County, the tornado obliterated a mobile home, killing all three inside. It reached EF5 strength a second time near the Kemper\u2013Winston county line where extreme ground scouring again took place and pavement was scoured from roads. Extensive tree damage took place elsewhere along the track and it ultimately dissipated at 3:00\u00a0p.m. CDT about 6 miles (9.7\u00a0km) north of Mashulaville."

        "content": "The environmental conditions leading up to the April 2011 Super Outbreak were among the \"most conducive to violent tornadoes ever documented\".[1] On April\u00a025, a vigorous upper-level shortwave trough moved into the Southern Plains states.[2] Ample instability, low-level moisture, and wind shear fueled a significant tornado outbreak from Texas to Tennessee; at least 64\u00a0tornadoes touched down that same day.[1] An area of low pressure consolidated over Texas on April\u00a026 and traveled east while the aforementioned shortwave trough traversed the Mississippi River and Ohio River valleys.[3] Another 50\u00a0tornadoes touched down on that day.[1] The multi-day outbreak culminated on April\u00a027 with the most violent recorded day of tornadic activity since the 1974 Super Outbreak. Multiple episodes of tornadic activity ensued with two waves of mesoscale convective systems in the morning hours, followed by a widespread outbreak of supercells from Mississippi to North Carolina during the afternoon into the evening.[1] Activity on April\u00a027 was precipitated by a 995\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.39\u00a0inHg) surface low situated over Kentucky and a deep, negatively tilted (aligned northwest to southeast) trough over Arkansas and Louisiana. A strong southwesterly surface jet intersected these systems at a 60\u00b0 angle, an ageostrophic flow that led to storm-relative helicity values in excess of 500\u00a0m2s\u22122\u2014indicative of extreme wind shear and a very high potential for rotating updrafts within supercells. Ample moisture from the Gulf of Mexico was brought north across the Deep South, leading to daytime high temperatures of 77 to 81\u00a0\u00b0F (25 to 27\u00a0\u00b0C) and dewpoints of 66 to 72\u00a0\u00b0F (19 to 22\u00a0\u00b0C).

        "content": "Around 1:00\u00a0p.m. CDT, a supercell thunderstorm developed south of Jackson, Mississippi, and traveled northeast at 55\u00a0mph (89\u00a0km/h).[4][5] About 25\u00a0minutes later, the intensifying storm became severe and prompted a severe thunderstorm warning\u2014advising residents of damaging winds in excess of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) and 1-inch (2.5\u00a0cm) diameter hail\u2014from the National Weather Service office in Jackson for Leake, Rankin, and Scott counties.[5] The developing storm gradually developed a hook echo signature,[4] and a tornado warning was issued for Leake and Scott counties at 1:36\u00a0p.m. CDT,[6] and extended to Neshoba County at 2:03\u00a0p.m. CDT.[7] At 2:30\u00a0p.m. CDT, the storm produced a small tornado along the northern edge of Philadelphia, just east of Philadelphia Municipal Airport and near an Army National Guard armory.[8][9] Here, large trees were downed and a building sustained significant roof damage.[9] Within minutes, the tornado began producing EF2 damage to homes and other structures.[4] It soon grew to 900 yards (820\u00a0m) in diameter and warranted the issuance of a tornado emergency for northeastern Neshoba County at 2:36\u00a0p.m. CDT.[7][8] Traveling along and parallel to MS 21, the tornado leveled and partially swept away a brick home near the intersection with MS 491, indicative of low-end EF4 damage.[9] A debris ball was apparent on Doppler weather radar imagery by this time. The storm began producing EF5 damage at 2:38\u00a0p.m. CDT in northeastern Neshoba County. Tremendous ground scouring took place in the county, including in one field where the tornado dug a large trench into the ground, removing up to 2 feet (0.61\u00a0m) of soil in places.[4] Grass was torn out by the roots and in clumps by suction vortices embedded within the tornado.[1] Large trees were entirely uprooted, debarked, defoliated, and thrown up to 20 yards (18\u00a0m) as well.[9] Maximum winds in the tornado were estimated at 205\u00a0mph (330\u00a0km/h).[8] The storm moved through the Pearl River Resort, where it destroyed a historic log cabin,[10] fencing, lighting, and dugouts at two baseball fields.[11] As the storm neared the edge of Neshoba County, the tornado emergency was extended to include northern Kemper County, southeastern Winston County, and all of Noxubee County.[12] The tornado weakened briefly as it passed through the small community of Coy along the Neshoba\u2013Kemper County line. Some trees took some extensive damage and a mobile home was destroyed. Upon leaving the community,[9] the tornado intensified and produced EF5 damage again by 2:47\u00a0p.m. CDT.[4] Throughout Neshoba County, the tornado damaged or destroyed 91\u00a0structures, leaving about 32\u00a0people homeless.[11] In Kemper County, a 3,000\u00a0sq-ft (280\u00a0m2) mini-mart was damaged beyond repair. Eleven people sought refuge inside the building's bathroom when the tornado struck; all escaped without injuries.[13] Along the Kemper-Winston County line, EF5 damage occurred as extremely deep ground scouring took place again and asphalt was ripped from roads. On Green Road, a double-wide mobile home, anchored to the ground, was lofted 300 yards (270\u00a0m) and obliterated when it landed in a nearby tree line; debris from the home was scattered hundreds of yards farther. The survey team found no evidence of it having bounced or rolled from where it was picked up to where it impacted the tree line. All three occupants were killed, the sole fatalities from this tornado. Nearby, the tornado weakened to EF3 strength as two brick homes were destroyed with barely any interior walls left standing; two people sustained serious injuries.[9] A well-built frame wood home was nearly swept clean off its foundation and two trailers were destroyed. Cars were hurled hundreds of yards, often bouncing along the way, and some were rendered almost unrecognizable and were wrapped around trees.[4] Continuing through southeastern Winston County, the tornado weakened slightly to EF2 strength but continued to produce extensive tree and property damage. As it crossed Central McDonald Road, it destroyed a single-wide mobile home and leveled a nearby grove of pine trees.[9] As the tornado approached the Winston\u2013Noxubee border, it caused substantial roof damage to a church and left impact holes in the back wall. Extreme tree damage was noted along the border as the tornado regained EF3 intensity. Along Butler Road, to the southwest of Macon, additional pavement scouring took place, along with the destruction of a shop and a bus being rolled. Thereafter, the tornado steadily weakened before dissipating roughly 6 miles (9.7\u00a0km) north of Mashulaville at 3:00\u00a0p.m. CDT.[9] Throughout its 30-minute track, the tornado traveled 28.28 miles (45.51\u00a0km), killed three people, injured eight others,[9] and caused $1.1\u00a0million in damage.[8][14] The supercell that produced this EF5 tornado later spawned an EF1 tornado in northeastern Noxubee County at 3:18\u00a0p.m. CDT. The parent storm dissipated around 3:29\u00a0p.m. CDT as another supercell overtook it near the Mississippi\u2013Alabama state line. That cell produced an exceptionally long-lived EF4 tornado that traveled nearly 128 miles (206\u00a0km) across Alabama. The Philadelphia tornado marked the first instance of an F5 or EF5 tornado in Mississippi since the March\u00a03, 1966, Candlestick Park tornado. Following another EF5 tornado that struck Smithville later on April\u00a027, the outbreak marked the first known instance of two EF5 tornadoes on a single day in Mississippi.[15]"

This allowed residents and some local governments to sign up to receive federal funding to repair damage incurred from the storms.[16] More than 60\u00a0members of the Longino Baptist Church assisted residents of Neshoba County with debris removal and cleaning; also providing refreshments. The Salvation Army established a feeding center at the Coy Methodist Church.[17] Disaster unemployment assistance was made available for people who lost their jobs due to storms and flooding, starting on May\u00a017.[18] By July, a total of $15,734,072 in federal funding was approved through the Federal Emergency Management Agency for victims of the April\u00a015\u201328 storms.[19]"

        "content": "Within hours of the fire commencing, numerous criticisms were raised by a small group of Fire and Rescue NSW firefighters through the Fire Brigade Employees Union in relation to the handling of the fire.[20] Of immediate concern was the fact that their assistance had been declined in the early stages of the fire,[21] which they believe cost more houses which could have been saved.[22] Further culminating the issue were claims by RFS Deputy Commissioner Rob Rogers that it would have been \"dangerous\" for Fire and Rescue NSW firefighters to attend the fire,[23] as the terrain required four wheel drive vehicles and there were multiple fires along the Far South Coast. Following the allegations, further information was released detailing numerous incidents across the entire state where the Rural Fire Service had denied help from Fire and Rescue NSW at fires and other emergencies.[24] As a result of this, the NSW Government instituted a commission of inquiry, headed by Mick Keelty AO, APM, a former Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police. The focus of the inquiry was on the call taking and dispatch arrangements of both Fire and Rescue NSW and the NSW Rural Fire Service.[25] The NSW Rural Fire Service Association which represents the Volunteers and Staff undertook a comprehensive consultation process with its members and provided considerable information.[26] Both the Fire Brigade Employees Union and former Commissioner Keelty emphasised prior to and following the report, that it would not be a criticism of the action of volunteers, but rather an investigation into the overall co-ordination of emergency incidents in NSW. The inquiry identified numerous issues with the response to, and management of the fire. These included: the fact \"some policies were not followed on the day\"; a deputy incident controller was not appointed; there were delays in feeding information back to the FRNSW ComCen who were on the line to numerous 000 callers seeking assistance; the 'Fires Near Me' app was not regularly updated; an emergency alert was issued too late; ABC radio continued normal broadcasts on the day of the fires rather than broadcasting emergency updates; there were discrepancies in the number of resources attached to the fire between agencies; the RFS were limited to communications by radio with no real time vehicle locators; and that the 000 call taking system was \"cumbersome\" among other issues.[11] The key issue of the declined FRNSW assistance was addressed by Keelty in the report. Keelty stated that \"It is likely that assistance from FRNSW was initially declined without full situational awareness of the intensity and speed of the fire\" and that \"FRNSW ComCen overruled the decision of the RFS District Duty Officer and deployed to the Bega Valley fires without being called out, but as it happened this was very useful for the overall protection of homes\".[11] Keelty made a number of recommendations, including the abolition of fire district boundaries between the two agencies, the establishment of an independent centralised 000 call taking system to replace the FRNSW call centre, the roll-out of automatic vehicle locators across the RFS fleet, a review of the effectiveness of emergency public information arrangements and that both services take steps to continue to building a strong mutual respect based relationship with one another, particularly in management areas.[11] Under the Coroner's Act 2009, the New South Wales Coroner instituted a coronial inquiry to establish the cause and origin of the bushfire. The Coroners Inquiry was conducted by Deputy State Coroner Elaine Truscott \nacross 17 days (3-7 August 2020, 10\u201314 August 2020, 17\u201321 August 2020, 10 and 12 November 2020) at the Coroner's Court of New South Wales in Sydney. Due to COVID-19 restrictions and the high level of public interest, all sessions were live streamed and recorded for playback. The Deputy State Coroner handed down her findings on 17 December 2021. The findings which are covered in a 186-page report make a number of recommendations for the NSW Rural Fire Service, as well as Energy network operators Essential Energy and various vegetation management providers. Two of the recommendations focused on improvements to Bega Fire Control Centre, including the need to preemptively stand up incident management teams at the Bega Fire Control Centre early. This highlighted the need to build a new Fire Control Centre in Bega which was announced in 2020."

While moving to the northeast, the storm dumped heavy snow and ice over parts of the Upper Midwest and Michigan Peninsula through 21 December. One specific part of the storm close to the upper-level low lingered near Kansas and produced snowfall rates of 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1\u00a0cm) per hour, before eventually moving northwards and leaving behind snowfall totals of up to 10\u201314 inches (25\u201336\u00a0cm) in some areas. On 22 December, the storm brought freezing rain to the state of Maine.[14] The storm caused freezing rain to accumulate on tree branches, causing some to fall off and topple power lines.[15] The storm complex continued to produce ice and snow in the northern parts of New England and Canada, before finally weakening and dissipating late on 23 December. The storm complex was also responsible for producing a small but damaging tornado outbreak that occurred from 20 to 21 December, most of which occurred on 21 December, due to the fact that supercell thunderstorms were able to pop up, and eventually coalesced into a squall line later the same day along the system's cold front, as it tracked towards the East Coast. It then began to linger over the Southeast before weakening as the initial area of low pressure tracked out of the country."

In Trenton, just east of the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), there was a reported 3\u00a0cm (1.2\u00a0in) of ice accumulation on the ground. The ice accumulation across southern and eastern Ontario was severe enough to cause widespread power outages because of fallen trees and branches. There were numerous automobile accidents on Highway 401. The town of Woolwich declared a state of emergency on 22 December after it was determined it would be without power for at least 24 hours. Elsewhere in Ontario, thousands of customers remained without power until well after Christmas Day.[43] Toronto, Canada's largest city, was one of the hardest hit by the ice storm. The first wave of freezing rain began on 20 December; it coated the city in a significant but manageable quantity of ice. The second, more powerful wave of rain struck the city in the early morning of 22 December. Utility poles and tree branches collapsed under the weight of the thick ice accumulation. At the height of the storm over 300,000 Toronto Hydro customers had no electricity or heating.[44] The City of Toronto simultaneously opened and operated 13 community reception centers and 13 Toronto police facility community warming centers, providing temporary sleeping accommodation, food, water, hygiene kits and other resources. The warming centers operated 24 hours a day, offering those without electricity a warm place to sleep and eat until their power was restored.[45] By 24 December, four days after the storm, 69,800 customers throughout the city were still without electricity.[46] Approximately 1,000 people spent Christmas Eve in the warming centers. On 29 December, Hydro One diverted its crews to assist Toronto Hydro to help restore power to over 6,000 people in the city who were still without power. In addition to Hydro One, crews were called in from Ottawa, Windsor and Michigan and Manitoba to help restore power to the city by the New Year. West of Toronto, crews were called in from Goderich, Niagara Region, Tillsonburg, St. Thomas, Essex, Guelph, Haldimand County and Oakville. In Ottawa, temperatures were low enough to spare the nation's capital the worst of the freezing rain. The city received over 30\u00a0cm (12\u00a0in) of snow in two days. Slippery conditions on Ottawa's roads resulted in public transit delays of up to 30 minutes. There were also numerous VIA Rail delays on services between Ottawa and Toronto. In some cases, trains were delayed for over two hours because of the accumulation of snow and ice on the tracks. Additional delays were caused by fallen trees obstructing the railway. Approximately 6,000 customers in Ottawa lost electricity supplies at the height of the storm; however, unlike areas to the south, the power outages in Ottawa lasted only a few hours.[47] On 30 December, Loblaws, Shoppers Drug Mart, Sobeys and Metro donated CA$25,000 in grocery and gift cards, Coppas Fresh Market donated CA$5,000 in grocery cards, and the Ontario Government donated CA$100,000. Residents of Toronto who could not afford to replace food spoiled by the blackout could pick up the cards at Ontario Works offices from 31 December 2013 to 3 January 2014.[48] On 22 December 2013, the Toronto Transit Commission suspended streetcar services for most of the day because of thick ice on the overhead wires. The Sheppard line also ceased operations until 24 December. On the Yonge\u2013University\u2013Spadina line, trains bypassed North York Centre station because there was no electricity. The entire Scarborough RT line was shut down until 23 December because of the freezing rain. Along the Bloor-Danforth line, shuttle buses ran from Victoria Park to Warden, Kennedy stations and beyond to those on the Scarborough RT line.[49]"

In Central Park, the temperatures rose to 71\u00a0\u00b0F (22\u00a0\u00b0C) which smashed the previous record of 63\u00a0\u00b0F (17\u00a0\u00b0C) set in 1998.[58] Temperatures also reached record highs of 67\u00a0\u00b0F (19\u00a0\u00b0C) in Philadelphia and Wilmington, Delaware, and Atlantic City, New Jersey also set a record high with a maximum temperature of 68\u00a0\u00b0F (20\u00a0\u00b0C).[59] In the state of Maine, more than 123,000 homes lost power.[60] Central Maine Power (CMP), Maine's largest electricity supplier, brought in 900 line crews to supplement the CMP's 85 line crews to restore supplies. In Michigan, approximately 380,700 homes and businesses across the state were without electricity. Many of the outages were reported in Ingham, Genesee, and Lapeer counties. Consumers Energy stated, \"this storm was the largest Christmas-week storm in the company's 126-year history and the worst ice storm in 10 years\".[61] Both Vermont and New York issued states of emergency.[62][63] In Jefferson County, New York, officials declared a state of emergency after significant damage affected the area. An emergency operations center was set up to monitor the storm damage.[64] In upstate New York, more than 70,000 customers were without electricity; 17,000 National Grid plc customers reported outages.[65] Ice storm preparation was in force in New Hampshire, where utility crews staged vehicles before the storm arrived.[38] In the state of Maine, hydro service provider Central Maine Power started power recovery efforts to 123,000 customers. On 25 December, 1,800 workers cleared broken branches and fallen trees to restore electricity supplies.[66] On 3 April 2014, the Federal Emergency Management Agency declined a request from governor Paul LePage, in funding disaster support to Maine.[67] In Michigan, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality allocated an emergency order to allow several counties to send debris from fallen trees to local landfill sites.[68]"

More commonly, tree branches made walking on sidewalks difficult; pedestrians were either forced to navigate through the debris or walk onto busy roads to avoid the large branches. Further snow accumulations a few days after the storm resulted in more broken branches and power lines. The city of Toronto announced that debris clearing operations would begin on 3 January 2014. The operation was expected to take about eight weeks to complete. Clearing streets and sidewalks was prioritized, before attention was shifted to cleaning debris from city parks on 23 January.[72] Residents were told that while the city would pick up debris that fell on private property, homeowners were responsible for ensuring the material was piled at the end of their driveways for municipal employees to collect. However, the city announced it would not take responsibility for large tree limbs that had fallen on private property. Residents were told they would have to hire private contractors to remove the material.[73] Toronto Hydro reported an estimated cost of CA$12.9 million due to the ice storm, including around $1 million of lost revenue, $10 million spent on labor, and $2 million in materials. CEO Anthony Haines reported that the cost might be passed on to customers in increased electricity charges.[74] Haines told critics who argued that Toronto's power distribution system should be moved underground that the project would cost CA$15 billion. He said this would cause a price hike of about 300 per cent because underground systems cost about seven times as much as overhead systems. He also said underground systems may not solve all the problems associated with weather-related power outages.[74] Funding of CA$114 million was requested for provincial and federal aid by the Toronto City Council.[75][76] It was estimated that damage to the city of Brampton cost $51 million; in Mississauga it was $25 million.[75] Several Manitoba Hydro utility workers assisted in the recovery efforts.[77]"

An area of disturbed weather developed within the monsoon trough during early September\u00a01982 near Guam. Following an increase in organization, a tropical depression developed on the morning of September\u00a05. Later that day, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Irving. Irving tracked westward, nearly becoming a typhoon before hitting the central Philippines. There, Irving uprooted trees, downed power and telephone lines, triggered landslides, and forced the cancellation of several domestic airline flights. Irving damaged 7,890\u00a0houses in Albay and Sorsogon provinces alone, resulting in 138,500\u00a0people homeless. Nation-wide, 65\u00a0people were killed, 26\u00a0others were hurt, and 29 were rendered missing. A total of 44,383\u00a0families or 248,040\u00a0residents sought shelter. Moreover, 18,488\u00a0homes were damaged and 5,599\u00a0others were demolished. Damage in the country was assessed at US$23.3\u00a0million, including US$14.2\u00a0million in crops. While crossing the island chain, Irving turned northwestward. After entering the South China Sea, Irving continued generally northwest, and became a typhoon on September\u00a011. After developing a well-defined eye, Irving attained its peak intensity of 160\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph) the following day. Land interaction with Hainan Island resulted in a weakening trend, and Irving was downgraded to a tropical storm before striking the southern coast of China on September\u00a015. Across the Leizhou Peninsula, 90% of homes were damaged. Onshore, Irving rapidly weakened and the storm dissipated on September\u00a016."

        "header": "Meteorological history",
        "content": "Typhoon Irving originated from an area of poorly organized convection associated with an active monsoon trough anchored south of Guam in early September\u00a01982. Surface pressures throughout the region between 125th meridian east to 135th meridian east and 8th parallel north to 13th parallel north were below 1,004\u00a0mbar (29.6\u00a0inHg), and winds were up to 40\u00a0km/h (25\u00a0mph). By the morning of September\u00a04, a low-level circulation had become evident on visual satellite imagery, despite a decrease in deep convection. In response to a decrease in wind shear that followed the development of Typhoon Judy and passage of Typhoon Gordon east of Japan, conditions became more favorable for tropical cyclogenesis. The circulation then became more developed and an increase in cloud organization was seen on satellite imagery, prompting the issuance of a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert early on September\u00a05.[2] At 06:00\u00a0UTC, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the system into a tropical depression,[3][nb 1] and three hours later, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified the system as Tropical Depression 18, after a Hurricane hunter aircraft closed off a surface circulation with observed winds near 55\u00a0km/h (35\u00a0mph). Based on continued convective organization, Tropical Depression 18 was upgraded to Tropical Storm Irving at 18:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a05 by the JTWC,[2][nb 2] \nwith the JMA following suit six hours later.[6] At the time of the upgrade, Irving was characterized with an exposed low-level circulation center to the east of the deep convection, where the upper-level circulation was. Through September\u00a08, Irving tracked south of a strengthening subtropical ridge and maintained a westward track across the Philippine Sea.[2] An eye developed on early on September\u00a08, indicating a strengthening trend.[7] Irving made landfall at 09:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a08 on the southern tip of Luzon. At the time of landfall, the JTWC estimated winds of 115\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph)[2] while the JMA reported winds of 105\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph), making Irving a severe tropical storm.[3] Over land, the eye quickly disappeared from satellite imagery.[7] Thereafter, Irving assumed a more northwestward path through the Sibuyan Sea and crossed the central Philippines. Despite losing organization due to land interaction, Irving maintained much of its intensity. Irving entered the open waters of the South China Sea, 30\u00a0mi (50\u00a0km) southwest of Cubi Point Naval Air Station, at 17:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a09.[2] As Irving moved into the South China Sea, a return to a more westward track and gradual intensification were forecast by the JTWC, in part because the subtropical ridge was anticipated to remain anchored north of the system. However, this ridge proved to be weaker than expected and Irving tracked slowly northwestward instead. A Hurricane hunter aircraft at 06:30\u00a0UTC on September\u00a012 reported maximum winds of 170\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph)[2] and a peak pressure of 947\u00a0mbar (28.0\u00a0inHg),[7] which was considerably higher than satellite intensity estimates of 95 to 120\u00a0km/h (60 to 75\u00a0mph),[2] even though satellite images also detected a well-defined eye.[7] Post-storm analysis by the JTWC, however, revealed that Irving attained typhoon intensity about 24\u00a0hours earlier, early on September\u00a011. At noon on September\u00a012, the JMA estimates that Irving attained its maximum intensity of 160\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 30\u00a0inHg (950\u00a0mbar).[6] At the time of its peak, Typhoon Irving had a very tight circulation, with the radius of 95\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph) winds within 110\u00a0km (68\u00a0mi) of the center during this period of maximum intensity. On September\u00a015, as the system began to interact with Hainan Island and the coast of China, Irving was downgraded to tropical storm strength by the JTWC[2] and the JMA.[3] Irving made landfall approximately 125\u00a0mi (205\u00a0km) northeast of Hanoi at 18:00\u00a0UTC.[2] At the time of landfall, the JTWC estimated winds of 115\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph)[6] while the JMA reported winds of 105\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph), making Irving a severe tropical storm.[3] Irving thereafter rapidly dissipated over the mountainous area of Vietnam.[2]"

At least seven\u00a0tornadoes affected the American U.S. states of Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee, six\u00a0of them rated violent F4s on the Fujita scale. The tornado outbreak killed at least 243\u00a0people. Five\u00a0of the tornadoes were long tracked, each traveling more than 32 miles (51\u00a0km) across Mississippi and into Alabama. A tornado that began in Oktibbeha County, Mississippi, crossed into Alabama and lifted over Limestone County, having covered a distance of more than 130\u00a0mi (210\u00a0km). Along its path, the tornado destroyed entire communities and killed at least 44\u00a0people in Alabama, becoming the state's deadliest tornado until March\u00a021, 1932, when another F4 tornado killed 49\u00a0people. An EF5 tornado on April\u00a027, 2011, is currently the state's deadliest on record, with 72\u00a0fatalities.[1] In addition to the tornadoes on April\u00a020, other tornadoes associated with the same weather system occurred on April\u00a019 and April\u00a021.[nb 2][nb 3][nb 4]"

A counterclockwise circulation was evident on the daily weather maps, with a trailing cold front approaching Mississippi from the west. An influx of warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico yielded surface temperatures of 70\u00b0 F or greater as far north as Nashville, with mid to upper 70s over the southern halves of Mississippi and Alabama.[12] Conditions were described as being \"cloudy and sultry\", even during the preceding night, with little fluctuation in relative humidity.[13] Due to a steep temperature gradient and low-level moisture, atmospheric instability was conducive for convective growth, with a convergence zone providing sufficient wind shear for supercells. Relatively colder air above the surface also invaded the warm sector, further heightening parameters for severe thunderstorms.[13] Despite widespread cloud cover, high temperatures in Alabama attained 85\u00a0\u00b0F or higher at several stations, illustrating the richness of the unstable air mass.[12]"

The funnel rapidly began producing \"devastating\" damage as it passed northwest of Starkville, with seven\u00a0dead.[15] Moving northeast, the tornado killed 10\u00a0more people near Cedarbluff in Clay County, leveling many homes. Its path was then 200 to 300\u00a0yd (600 to 900\u00a0ft) wide.[13]  Thereafter, the tornado entered Monroe County and proceeded to ravage the western part of Aberdeen. 22\u00a0people died there, though it was the only sizable town in the path.[15] Widening to at least 1\u20444 mile (440\u00a0yd) wide, the tornado killed five\u00a0more people in the county before crossing Itawamba County and then moving into Marion County, Alabama.[13] In all, the tornado flattened more than 200\u00a0homes, mostly small, in Mississippi.[15] In Alabama, it leveled entire farms south of Bexar, with nine\u00a0deaths.[15] One\u00a0farm alone reported 500\u00a0hogs killed. In Marion County alone, the 1\u20442-mile-wide (0.80\u00a0km) tornado killed 20\u00a0people and injured about 200, leveling 87\u00a0homes and damaging 100, especially in the Hackleburg area.[12][15]  In one area, a Ford automobile was hurled 1\u20444\u00a0mi (0.40\u00a0km), and a swath up to 1+1\u20442\u00a0mi (2.4\u00a0km) wide was reportedly \"swept clean\" as homes vanished.[12] In Franklin County, the tornado continued to destroy homes near Phil Campbell and Spruce Pine, but most of the deaths were near the Waco quarry, east of Russellville, where small homes were said to have been \"wiped out\" and swept away.[12] 19\u00a0people died in and near the quarry, nine\u00a0of whom were part of a family.[15] Nearby, large oak trees were wrested from the earth, huge stones thrown \"like a feather\", and half of a large boulder transported to Littleville, about 11\u00a0mi (18\u00a0km) away.[12] Continuing into southeast Colbert County, the tornado flattened the Mehama community south of Leighton. There, four\u00a0people died, many homes were destroyed, and numerous cattle were killed; notably, a Ford vehicle, hurled some distance, was stripped of its wheel casings.[12][15] One\u00a0other home was destroyed nearby at Wolf Springs. Afterward, the tornado lost intensity, after having maintained F4 or greater strength for more than 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km).[15] Southeast of Town Creek, the tornado killed one\u00a0more person before losing detection near the Tennessee River; the termination of its path is unknown and may have been in Limestone County, Alabama, or southern Tennessee.[12] Pronounced darkness occurred at several locations in the path of the storm; one observer near Waco noted that there was no daylight and conditions were \"dark as midnight.\"[12]"

It entered the Thorn Apple Woods, damaging trees before crossing 200th Street northeast of the woods. It also crossed Franklin Avenue before entering the limits of Aredale. The tornado hit the Bailey Farm southwest of Aredale, heavily damaging a farm but causing no fatalities.[1] The tornado then tracked through the McKinney Farm, destroying almost every building on the property.[1] At around this time, another tornado was briefly reported on the ground, but disappeared shortly after.[1] The tornado then left the limits of southern Aredale, and hit the Landers Farm, located 5 miles northeast of Aredale.[1] Debris from the farm was found over half a mile away.[1] The tornado then began to track through relatively unpopulated areas, crossing multiple unknown streets before tracking parallel to 110th Street for a brief period of time. The tornado began to turn to the north, hitting Floyd Line Street and crossing multiple other streets, downing power lines and damaging structures.[2] The tornado began to rapidly intensify as it hit Kirkwood Road, and crossed  280th Street before beginning to run almost diagonally to Marble Rock.[2] As the tornado tracked passed areas west of Marble Rock, a funnel cloud as briefly seen before lifting.[1]   Another tornado then touched down east of Marble Rock, and would stay on the ground until around 4 miles southwest of Charles City.[1] The tornado crossed the intersection of Miner Avenue and 260th Street, again intensifying. The tornado would pass just south of Oakwood, crossing multiple roads before tracking directly across Avenue of the Saints and entering the city limits of Charles City. The tornado then crossed 215th  Street at F5 intensity, entering downtown Charles City.[2][3] The tornado began to turn northward in the center of Charles City at ~4:47 PM. The tornado caused extreme damage on 2nd Street, and directly impacted the Charles City City Hall.  It obliterated a row of housed located on the southern end of Kelly Street, before crossing Blunt Street. Heavy damage was documented and observed in northern Charles City, and intense ground scouring occurred, suggesting wind speeds of 200\u2013300\u00a0mph (320\u2013480\u00a0km/h). As the tornado began to track out of Charles City, it hit 13th Avenue, damaging structures and other buildings.[3][4] The tornado crossed Triumph Avenue and Underwood Avenue northeast of Charles City, and narrowly avoided the Northeast Iowa Regional Airport. The tornado passed west of Doubleday, causing damage to farms and other structures. The tornado then passed Victory Avenue and crossed an unnamed river before moving south of Nilesville. The tornado also tracked directly east of Colwell, causing an unknown amount of damage to structures.[5] The tornado then started to track through sparsely populated areas of rural northern Iowa, damaging farms but killing nobody. The tornado tracked west of Alta Vista before hitting eastern Elma, heaving damaging many buildings in its path. The tornado also moved in-between Saratoga and Davis Corners, crossing State Highway 9, before turning slightly northward directly west of Lime Springs.

Established in 1714 by Louis Juchereau de St. Denis as part of French Louisiana, the community was named after the indigenous Natchitoches people. The City of Natchitoches was incorporated on February 5, 1819, after Louisiana had become a state in 1812. It is the oldest permanent settlement in the land acquired by the Louisiana Purchase. Natchitoches is home to Northwestern State University. Its sister city is  Nacogdoches, Texas."

        "content": "Natchitoches was established in 1714 by Canadien explorer Louis Juchereau de St. Denis. It is the oldest permanent European settlement within the borders of the 1803 Louisiana Purchase.[5] Natchitoches was founded as a French outpost on the Red River for trade with Spanish-controlled Mexico; French traders settled there as early as 1699. The post was established near a village of Natchitoches Indians, after whom the city was named. Early settlers were French Catholic immigrants and creoles (originally meaning those ethnic French born in the colony). French creoles acquired lands that were developed in the antebellum years as cotton-producing Magnolia Plantation and Oakland Plantation. Each has been preserved and is designated as a National Historic Landmark. After the United States' Louisiana Purchase of 1803, migration into the territory increased from the US. Natchitoches grew along with the population in the parish. Initially, the Americans were primarily of English and Scots-Irish ancestry and of Protestant faith. They developed several cotton plantations along the Red River. Numerous enslaved African Americans were brought to the area through the domestic slave trade to work the cotton, and provide all other skills on these plantations, generating the revenues for the wealthy planters before the Civil War. The United States Government established a federal fur trade factory here in 1805. It was removed to Sulphur Fork, Arkansas in 1818.[6] In the 1820s and early 1830s, Natchitoches also served as a freight transfer point for cotton shipped from parts of east Texas. Cotton shippers used a land route crossing the Sabine River to Natchitoches, where the freight was transferred to boats, and floated down the Red River to New Orleans.[7] When the course of the Red River shifted, it bypassed Natchitoches and cut off its lucrative connection with the Mississippi River. A 33-mile (53\u00a0km) oxbow lake was left in the river's previous location which became known as Cane River Lake."

Confederate cavalry pursued the fleeing soldiers and arrived in time to help extinguish the flames before the town was destroyed. Alexandria was destroyed by Union troops in 1864, but both Union and Confederate troops were responsible for severely damaging plantations along the river during the war, including Magnolia and Oakland. Radford Blunt published the Natchitoches Republican. He was also a candidate for the state legislature. William H. Tunnard edited the paper.[8]"

        "content": "As the parish seat, Natchitoches suffered from the decline in agricultural population through the mid-20th century, and grew at a markedly lower rate after 1960. The mechanization of agriculture had reduced the number of workers needed, and many moved to cities for jobs. By the early 1970s, the town's businesses were declining, along with many area farms, and buildings were boarded up. In the mid-1970s, Mayor Bobby DeBlieux and other preservationists believed that attracting tourists to the area, based on its historic assets of nearly intact plantations and numerous historic buildings, could be a key to attracting visitors, reviving the town, and stimulating new businesses. Over the years, he worked with a variety of landowners and local people to gain support for designating a historic district in the city. He also supported making a national park out of the working area of Magnolia Plantation, which had many surviving outbuildings from the 19th century, and from Oakland Plantation, both downriver in the parish.[9] By the end of the 20th century, the mile-long French colonial area of downtown, which lies along Cane Lake, was designated as a National Historic District. Many buildings were adapted as antique shops, restaurants and souvenir emporiums. To accommodate tourists, the town had 32 bed-and-breakfast inns, the highest in the state.[9] By 2018, that number had increased to 50. The plantation country surrounds Cane River Lake. The markedly intact downriver Magnolia and Oakland plantations were designated as National Historic Landmarks, and are part of what has been developed as the Cane River Creole National Historical Park,[9] which was authorized in 1994,[10] with the support of US Senator J. Bennett Johnston. He was a cousin by marriage of Betty Hertzog, the last of the family to live in the great house at Magnolia.[9] Tours and interpretive programs at both sites continue to attract visitors, especially as they grapple with telling the difficult history of slavery and its aftermath at the plantations. They also cover the contributions of blacks and Creoles of color to the community.[9] In April 2022, the city council added Juneteenth as an official city holiday.[11] Since the late 20th century, the 35-mile oxbow lake has served as the spring-break training location for numerous university crew teams,[12] from universities such as the University of St. Thomas, Kansas State University, University of Kansas, Wichita State University, Murray State University, University of Central Oklahoma, and Washington University in St. Louis, as well as Northwestern State University. In the spring of 2018, LSU, Alabama, Texas and Georgia were also represented. Tourists interested in sports often visit in this period to watch the sports teams.[12] Over the years, the city and parish have improved conditions with a riverbank stabilization project and a water pump project to improve water levels in the lake. This directs water from Hampton Lake into Bayou Possiant, which feeds Cane River Lake.[12] In March 1965, nine children were among seventeen people killed in a natural gas pipeline explosion.[13] Natchitoches was the site of the 1973 plane crash that claimed the life of singer-songwriter Jim Croce. Croce had performed a concert on campus for Northwestern State University students at Prather Coliseum. He was killed less than an hour later in a plane headed to Sherman, Texas. The crash may have been a result of the pilot suffering a fatal heart attack.[14]"

The Port of Natchitoches\u2014a river port on the Red River\u2014is located off the eastbound part of U.S. Route 84, just outside Natchitoches. The port exports lumber from yards onsite, as forestry is a major industry in the area, as well. Natchitoches Regional Airport serves cities (via FBO) such as Baton Rouge, New Orleans, Dallas, Houston, Little Rock, Monroe, and Shreveport. It is adjacent to Northwestern State University; together, they offer flight training. The airport is under renovation to become one of the country's most advanced non-towered airports.[citation needed] The Natchitoches National Fish Hatchery is based here. They handle over six species of fish and other wildlife. The parish attracts numerous sports fishermen during the seasons. The Natchitoches Christmas Festival is a well-known celebration of the holidays for locals. The festival is held on the river.[20] Since completion of Interstate 49, many business have either moved or have been built outside the city's central area. Gas stations and hotels have developed in this area and serve many of the Natchitoches Christmas Festival visitors.

Natchitoches, a popular tourism area of the state, is equipped to serve visitors with 11 national chain hotels, and 27 bed-and-breakfast inns,[21] including the Steel Magnolia House.[22] Natchitoches attracts over one million visitors annually. The city is known as a retiree-friendly city. In 2006, Natchitoches was awarded the Great American Main Street Award for the effort the community has put into revitalizing and restoring much of the historic district. The city's tourism center is the downtown river walk. This includes Front Street, which becomes Jefferson at the Texas Street light. Front Street is the jewel of the city. It overlooks the river walk and is bordered by an assortment of shops and boutiques. The city has identified this area as its historical district. The Historical Society maintains the area through regulations on changes and restorations. Natchitoches has a mini \"Walk of Fame\" located in the historical district of the city. While visiting the area, tourists may notice many unusual structures; these are many of the Natchitoches Christmas Festival lights. The city recently built a small convention center located on Second Street, which holds many city events. The Bayou Pierre Alligator Park is a major tourist attraction, where tourists may feed the alligators and dine and shop. The park teaches school children to respect nature and to conserve its many habitats. Natchitoches is home to a branch of the Kisatchie National Forest, a designation promoted by naturalist Caroline Dormon to preserve regional natural wonders.

Huge waves on the Thames river sent water 6 feet (1.8\u00a0m) higher than had ever been recorded in London, destroying more than 5,000 homes along the river.[4] HMS Vanguard was wrecked at Chatham. Admiral Sir Cloudesley Shovell's HMS Association was blown from Harwich to Gothenburg in Sweden before way could be made back to England.[5] Pinnacles were blown from the top of King's College Chapel, in Cambridge. There was extensive and prolonged flooding in the West Country, particularly around Bristol. Hundreds of people drowned in flooding on the Somerset Levels, along with thousands of sheep and cattle, and one ship was found 15 miles (24\u00a0km) inland.[6] Approximately 400 windmills were destroyed, with the wind driving their wooden gears so fast that some burst into flames.\nAt Wells, Bishop Richard Kidder and his wife were killed when two chimneystacks in the palace fell on them, asleep in bed. This same storm blew in part of the great west window in Wells Cathedral. Major damage occurred to the southwest tower of Llandaff Cathedral at Cardiff in Wales.

These ships included HMS Stirling Castle, HMS Northumberland, HMS Mary and HMS Restoration, with about 1,500 seamen killed, particularly on the Goodwin Sands. Between 8,000 and 15,000 people died overall. Some sources cite a figure between 10,000 and 30,000.[4] In total, around 300 Royal Navy ships anchored along the south coast were lost.[4] The first Eddystone Lighthouse off Plymouth was destroyed on 8\u00a0December [O.S. 27\u00a0November], killing six occupants, including its builder, Henry Winstanley. (John Rudyard was later contracted to build the second lighthouse on the site.) Two days later, a cargo ship struck the rocks and sank. She was the first wrecking to occur there since the lighthouse was constructed five years prior.[7] Another ship, torn from its moorings in the Helford River in Cornwall, was blown for 200 miles (320\u00a0km) before grounding eight hours later on the Isle of Wight. The storm also caught a convoy of 130 merchant ships sheltering at Milford Haven, along with their man of war escorts Dolphin, Cumberland, Coventry, Looe, Hastings and Hector. By 3:00pm the next afternoon, losses included 30 vessels.[8] The number of oak trees lost in the New Forest alone was 4,000.

Winds of up to 80 miles per hour (130\u00a0km/h) destroyed more than 400 windmills.[10] Defoe reported that the sails in some turned so fast that the friction between the wooden brakes and the wheel caused the wood to overheat and catch fire.[11] He thought that the destruction of the sovereign fleet was a punishment for their poor performance against the Catholic armies of France and Spain during the first year of the War of the Spanish Succession.[12]"

More than 40 merchant ships were also lost.[18] Lamb (1991) claimed 10,000 seamen were lost in one night\u2014a far higher figure\u2014about one-third of the seamen in the Royal Navy.[19] Defoe's The Storm suggests that the Royal Navy lost one-fifth of its ships; this would, however, indicate a much lower proportion of seamen were lost, as some wrecked sailors survived."

Multiple commercial vessels were kept at port until the storm passed.[2] At least 50\u00a0domestic Philippine Airlines flights were canceled and international flights were diverted to airports not in the path of the typhoon.[3] Strong winds produced by Brenda caused widespread disruption from the Visayas through Luzon, downing numerous trees and power lines. Significant power disruption occurred in the Bicol Region as well as the Central Visayas. Three people were killed in Manila after a car was thrown into a bus by strong winds.[3] On May\u00a016, during the filming of Delta Force 2: The Colombian Connection, a helicopter crashed roughly 45\u00a0km (30\u00a0mi) south of Manila, killing five people and injuring four others. The crash was associated with strong winds from Brenda that made flying difficult.[4][5] Flooding triggered by the storm prompted officials to evacuate over 5,700 people.[6] Rough seas associated with the typhoon were responsible for several incidents across the Philippines. Two people drowned and thirteen others were reported missing after a motor launch capsized roughly 320\u00a0km (200\u00a0mi) east of Manila.[3] Off the coast of Calavite Island, 23\u00a0people went missing after the cargo vessel MV Zambales sank.[6] In Albay Province, the Corazon-II sank while berthed at the Tobaco town pier.[3] Additionally, the five-ton vessel Albert sank off the southern tip of Luzon with five crewmen. The crew reportedly drifted at sea  for three days before tying a makeshift raft to a sea turtle which towed them to safety.[7] Throughout the Philippines 13\u201319 people were killed by the storm while another 40\u201353 were reported missing.[1][6] A total of 652\u00a0homes were destroyed while another 4,392 were damaged.

The main tornado-producer was a long-tracked right moving supercell with a BWER and a hook echo visible on radar which formed in southern Poland and moved north-northeastward, spawning several strong tornadoes. The outbreak began when a weak tornado touched down in Knur\u00f3w causing little damage. While the first tornado was occurring, the main tornado-producer produced its first tornado, a large and violent multiple-vortex that struck the villages of Dolnica, Kopanina, Zimna W\u00f3dka, Kolonia Jarysz\u00f3w, Balcarzowice, B\u0142otnica Strzelecka and D\u0105br\u00f3wka with a total path of 20\u00a0km damaging or destroying hundreds of buildings and wounding 15 people, with a width of 500\u20131000 m before dissipating in a wooded area. It was given a rating of high-end F3/low-end F4. The supercell produced another multiple-vortex tornado near Pi\u0142ka and struck the northern side of town, causing little damage. Northeast of Rusinowice the tornado quickly became large and destroyed a large swath of forest, its path still clearly visible on satellite imagery today. The tornado then hit the western suburbs of Kalina where it killed one person and caused more tree damage before it probably dissipated east of Herby, where the supercell either quickly recycled and produced a new F3 tornado that struck the city of Blachownia, or the same tornado continued into Blachownia. After the tornado that impacted Blachownia dissipated, the supercell produced an F2 tornado struck the town of Mykan\u00f3w. This tornado flipped a bus while it was crossing a highway. At 16:40 UTC the same supercell produced another multiple-vortex and non-fully condensed [3] F3 which struck the west part of Radomsko, destroying or damaging about 100 houses on a path of about 4\u20135\u00a0km. Four other tornadoes touched down, including another F3 and an F2 before the main tornado-producing supercell decayed. Another F1 tornado touched down in Radom, likely associated with a different supercell, before activity on the 15th ended. The outbreak continued on 16 August, producing two tornadoes, both were F1, one in Osipy-Kolonia and one, the strongest (T3), struck Seroczyn damaging 130 buildings."

On the A4 highway, some cars and trucks were thrown tens of meters away and the trees were debarked. Crossing the highway, the tornado struck Sieroniowice and Balcarzowice where many buildings were almost razed to the ground (F4\u2013T8 damage) and some people were injured. After Balcarzowice the tornado struck B\u0142otnica Strzelecka with a width of about 400\u2013500 m causing severe damage, classifiable as a strong F2 (T5), and finally the tornado struck the forest between B\u0142otnica and D\u0105br\u00f3wka causing F2 sporadic damage and causing damage classifiable as a low F1 (T2).

It was the 21st JTWC tropical depression, the 15th named storm, and the 10th typhoon of the 2002 Pacific typhoon season. It developed on August\u00a022 from the monsoon trough in the northwestern Pacific Ocean, well to the southeast of Japan. For several days, Rusa moved to the northwest, eventually intensifying into a powerful typhoon. On August\u00a026, the storm moved across the Amami Islands of Japan, where Rusa left 20,000\u00a0people without power and caused two fatalities. Across Japan, the typhoon dropped torrential rainfall peaking at 902\u00a0mm (35.5\u00a0in) in Tokushima Prefecture. After weakening slightly, Rusa made landfall on Goheung, South Korea with winds of 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph 10\u00a0minute sustained).[nb 1] It was able to maintain much of its intensity due to warm air and instability from a nearby cold front. Rusa weakened while moving through the country, dropping heavy rainfall that peaked at 897.5\u00a0mm (35.33\u00a0in) in Gangneung. A 24-hour total of 880\u00a0mm (35\u00a0in) in the city broke the record for the highest daily precipitation in the country; however, the heaviest rainfall was localized. Over 17,000\u00a0houses were damaged, and large areas of crop fields were flooded. In South Korea, Rusa killed at least 233\u00a0people, making it the deadliest typhoon there in over 43\u00a0years, and caused $4.2\u00a0billion in damage.[nb 2] The typhoon also dropped heavy rainfall in neighboring North Korea, leaving 26,000\u00a0people homeless and killing three. Rusa also destroyed large areas of crops in the country already affected by ongoing famine conditions. The typhoon later became extratropical over eastern Russia on September\u00a01, dissipating three days later."

Early on August\u00a023, it intensified into Tropical Storm Rusa,[2] about 1,800\u00a0km (1,100\u00a0mi) east of Guam.[4] At 1800\u00a0UTC on August\u00a025, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA)[nb 3] upgraded Rusa to a typhoon while the system was northeast of the Northern Marianas Islands. The next day, the agency estimated that the typhoon attained peak winds of 150\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph 10\u00a0minute sustained).[2] Around the same time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)[nb 4] estimated peak winds of 215\u00a0km/h (135\u00a0mph 1\u00a0minute sustained).[3] While at peak intensity, Rusa struck the Japanese island of Amami \u014cshima.[6] After maintaining the peak winds for about 12\u00a0hours, Rusa weakened slightly as it continued to the west-northwest, but on August\u00a028 the JMA again reported the typhoon attained winds of 150\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph 10\u00a0minute sustained).[2] Despite forecasts that it would weaken, Rusa maintained its intensity while passing south of Japan, due to minimal wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures of up to 29\u00a0\u00b0C (84\u00a0\u00b0F).[4] The typhoon again weakened slightly on August\u00a029 while passing between the Amami Islands and Japan. Thereafter, Rusa turned to the north toward the Korean Peninsula.[2] Warm, moist air blew across the peninsula ahead of the storm, which prevented significant weakening, and an approaching cold front contributed to atmospheric instability.[4] At around 0800\u00a0UTC on August\u00a031, Rusa made landfall on Goheung, South Korea, with winds of 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph 10\u00a0minute sustained).[2][4] According to the JTWC, Rusa was the most powerful typhoon to hit the country since 1959.[3] The typhoon rapidly weakened while crossing the country, deteriorating into a tropical depression early on September\u00a01.[2] Around that time, the JTWC issued its last advisory on the system.[3] The depression turned to the northeast, and after moving through the Sea of Japan, Rusa became extratropical over Primorsky Krai in the Russian Far East late on September\u00a01. The extratropical remnants continued northeast and dissipated on September\u00a04 over the Kamchatka Peninsula.[2]"

The storm left 20,000\u00a0people without power and cancelled several flights.[10] Winds reached 104\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph) in Nomozaki, Nagasaki. Rains fell for seven days in the country, peaking at 902\u00a0mm (35.5\u00a0in) in Tokushima Prefecture. The heaviest of the precipitation fell in Nara Prefecture, where a station reported 84\u00a0mm (3.3\u00a0in) in one hour. At least 275\u00a0houses were flooded, and 137\u00a0houses were damaged. During its passage, Rusa injured 12\u00a0people, 4 seriously.[11] The typhoon also produced light rain and high seas along the coast of Taiwan.[12] Before Rusa affected South Korea, the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) issued high sea warnings on August\u00a029.[13] Airports were closed in the southern portion of the country,[14] and dams let out water to prevent excessive flooding.[15] Typhoon Rusa affected much of South Korea with heavy rainfall and high winds.[4] Jeju Island off the country's southern coast reported 660\u00a0mm (26\u00a0in) of rainfall, producing flash flooding that flooded cars. On the island, high winds downed trees and left 60,000\u00a0people without power. All lower and middle schools on the island were closed, and residents were stranded after officials halted ferry and airline service.[14] On the South Korean mainland, winds reached as high as 180\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph). High amounts of rainfall were reported on Jeju Province and along the country's southern coast, although the heaviest rainfall was only reported in a small region. In Gangneung, located in the eastern portion of the country, severe thunderstorms developed due to high instability resulting from humid air from the east interacting with the Taebaek Mountains, producing high amounts of precipitation. The city reported the highest rainfall total in the country with 897.5\u00a0mm (35.33\u00a0in), of which 880\u00a0mm (35\u00a0in) was observed in one day. The total represented 62% of Gangneung's average yearly rainfall, and became the highest daily rainfall in the country's history, exceeding the previous record set in 1981 by 300\u00a0mm (12\u00a0in). In the South Korea interior, rainfall rates were considered a 1 in 200 year event.[4] Damage in South Korea was estimated at $4.2\u00a0billion (\u20a95.15\u00a0trillion KRW).[6] Damage was heaviest in Gangneung,[4] where about 36,000\u00a0homes and 622\u00a0military buildings were flooded. At the airbase in Gangneung, floods submerged 16\u00a0jet fighters.[3] Along the coast, high winds damaged 640\u00a0boats and about 200,000\u00a0marine buildings, and 265\u00a0industrial buildings were also damaged.[6] The heavy rainfall left mudslides in the country, one of which covered ten cars in Gangneung.[16] Flooding and the landslides disrupted the country's infrastructure;[6] the storm destroyed 274\u00a0bridges and damaged roads and rails at 164\u00a0locations.[17] Rusa killed 300,000\u00a0livestock and flooded 85,000\u00a0hectares (210,000\u00a0acres) of crop fields,[17][18] representing 6% of the country's agricultural lands, mostly affecting fruit and vegetables.[6] The storm caused the Vana H Cup KBC Augusta golf tournament to end early,[19] and a stadium to be used for the 2002 Asian Games was damaged.[20] Across the country, 88,625\u00a0people were forced to evacuate due to the typhoon,[3] and 17,046\u00a0houses were damaged.[21] High winds left 1.25\u00a0million people after blowing down 24,000\u00a0power lines.[17][18] There were 213\u00a0deaths in the country, and another 33\u00a0were missing and presumed dead;[6] This made Rusa the deadliest typhoon in the country in more than 43\u00a0years.[22] In neighboring North Korea, Rusa produced winds of 72\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph) and heavy rainfall reaching 700\u00a0mm (28\u00a0in) in mountainous areas of Kangwon Province; rainfall totaled 530\u00a0mm (21\u00a0in) in the county of Kosong.[17] The rains caused flash flooding and increased surface runoff. This occurred about a month after similarly heavy rains caused severe damage in the country.[23] The rains from Rusa damaged and flooded thousands of houses and many public buildings,[24] and destroyed 86,000\u00a0tonnes of crop fields;[25] the latter was most significant due to the country's ongoing famine conditions.[17] Damage was heaviest in Kangwon Province, and the typhoon affected four provinces and one administrative city. More than 26,000\u00a0people were left homeless in the country, although advance warning allowed for evacuations.[23] Rusa disrupted transportation by destroying 25\u00a0km (16\u00a0mi) of roads and 24\u00a0bridges; however, most of the damage was isolated to a small region.[25] There were three deaths in North Korea.[23] The typhoon also affected the Russian Far East.[6] On Sakhalin island, Rusa's remnants dropped heavy rainfall, the equivalence of two months average precipitation. The rains flooded 350\u00a0houses, but there were no deaths in the region.[26]"

        "content": "Following the storm, damaged buildings polluted rivers in South Korea with chemicals and heavy metals.[6] The country utilized 30,000\u00a0soldiers to assist in cleaning up and repairing storm damage. President Kim Dae-jung authorized emergency funding for disaster aid. Much of Gangneung lost power and water; as a result, relief supplies were sent to the affected citizens.[17] By ten days after Rusa struck the country, power lines were restored and transportation returned to normal. After an appeal to other residents in the country, the South Korea Red Cross chapter received $49\u00a0million in donations (\u20a958\u00a0billion won), mostly from the country's northwest portion. The agency provided 50,680\u00a0meals to 16,919\u00a0families, as well as clothing and cooking supplies.[22] Residents in the country raised about $60\u00a0million (\u20a972.1\u00a0billion won) in disaster relief, the highest such total for a disaster in the nation.[27] The Chinese Red Cross sent $20,000 to the South Korean Red Cross in the weeks after the storm.[28] On September\u00a013, the South Korean government declared 203\u00a0cities and counties as disaster zones,[29] which entitled 8,714\u00a0families who sustained storm damage to receive government loans.[30] The combined storm damage and floods preceding the storm caused the nation's economy to contract during the third quarter of 2002.[31] The 2003 fiscal year reported a $300\u00a0million deficit for non-life insurance companies, mostly due to losses from the typhoon.[32] Crop damage from Rusa caused the price of rice to increase to their highest levels since 1980.[33] In the year after the storm, the South Korean government worked to reconstruct damaged roads and provided monthly assistance payments to families who lost their homes.[34] However, many residents remained homeless and were residing in temporary shelters. The country's Habitat for Humanity built 69\u00a0houses for storm victims in 2003, although that was only for a small portion of the overall number of people affected.[35] About a year after Rusa hit, Typhoon Maemi also struck South Korea with stronger winds, causing $3.74\u00a0billion in damage and 117\u00a0deaths. The damage total was less than from Rusa but was more significant to industrial areas.[36] In North Korea, the Red Cross provided relief supplies to residents affected by flooding. The agency's international disaster relief fund provided FR75,000 (2002\u00a0CHF (US$50,000).[nb 5]. Soldiers were used to assist in search and rescue missions and to repair damaged infrastructure. Due to storm damage, the Red Cross in North Korea distributed over 2.1\u00a0million water purification tablets and over 11,000\u00a0water containers. The agency also provided 32,753\u00a0blankets and 4,931\u00a0kitchen units.[23] After the storm, people left homeless by the storm sought shelter with neighbors or in shelters.[23] A South Korean dairy company donated 42,000\u00a0cans of baby formula to North Korea.[38] The name Rusa was retired after its usage in 2002, and was replaced with Nuri in 2004.[39]"

They are as follows:[7] Emergency Alert telephone warnings may be sent in extreme circumstances.[7] Landlines in the emergency area receive voice messages and mobile phones (with a billing address in the emergency area) receive text messages. Emergency broadcasts are made on local ABC and commercial radio stations and Sky News television. Information can also be sought by telephone from the Victorian Bushfire Information Line. During an emergency, the Standard Emergency Warning Signal is played via television, radio and public address systems.[7] Current bushfire incidents and warnings are listed on the VicEmergency website launched in December 2013,[8] Information is also available through the CFA's Twitter and Facebook sites as well as the FireReady app.[7] A 90-second siren at a CFA fire station indicates that CFA members are attending an emergency incident.

Public utilities, such as powerlines, ignite relatively few fires, but these subsequently burn similar area to that of deliberately lit fires. Cigarettes, matches and such, ignite a fair few fires, mostly in and around urban areas, and thus burn small areas of land as they are attended to more easily in the more accessible terrain. Many fires are caused by many other less common ignition sources or have unknown causes."

        "content": " Tropical Storm Rolf, also known as Tropical Storm\u00a001M, was an unusual Mediterranean tropical storm that brought flooding to Italy, France, Spain, and Switzerland in November\u00a02011. Rolf originated from an extratropical system near western France on 4\u00a0November. Despite the generally unfavorable conditions in the Mediterranean Sea, Rolf transitioned into a subtropical depression on 7\u00a0November, before becoming a tropical storm later that day. On 8\u00a0November, Rolf reached its peak intensity, with 1-minute sustained winds peaking at 85\u00a0km/h (53\u00a0mph) [nb 1] and a minimum central pressure of 991\u00a0mb (29.3\u00a0inHg). During the next day, the storm made landfall on the island of \u00cele du Levant, in France, and soon afterward, near Hy\u00e8res in southeastern France. Following its second landfall, Rolf quickly weakened and dissipated on 10\u00a0November. Rolf was the first tropical cyclone ever to be officially monitored by the NOAA in the Mediterranean Sea.[1][2] Rolf caused widespread flooding across southwestern Europe, especially in France and Italy, with the majority of the damage from the storm occurring in those two countries. The rainfall worsened a series of ongoing floods in Europe at the time. Torrential rainfall from Rolf caused multiple rivers to overflow their banks in France and Italy, flooding multiple cities and resulting in extensive property damage. The storm forced numerous schools and businesses to close temporarily, and also caused significant damage to 300 farms in France. Floodwaters from Rolf's rainfall also cut the power to over 8,000 customers and necessitated thousands of rescues, in addition to forcing thousands of evacuations. Rolf killed 12 people, and was at the time, the costliest Mediterranean tropical-like cyclone on record, causing at least $1.25 billion (2011 USD, \u20ac926 million) in damages. It was later surpassed by Storm Daniel in 2023.[3][4][nb 2][nb 3]"

        "content": "In early November 2011, a large extratropical cyclone named \"Quinn\" moved to the northwest of the British Isles, with the storm's frontal boundary stretching southward into Western Europe.[5] On 4 November, an extratropical disturbance was spawned over western France, near the border of Spain, within the cold front of Quinn.[6][7] On the next day, the new disturbance developed a low-pressure area over western France, within the southern part of Quinn's frontal structure;[7] the system was subsequently named Rolf by the Free University of Berlin, which names all significant low-pressure systems that affect Europe.[8][9] Rolf quickly separated from Quinn, and proceeded to slowly move eastward.[7] Rolf gradually organised and convection, or thunderstorms, associated with the storm consolidated. Over the next couple of days, Rolf continued to increase in organisation as it moved eastward.[10] On 5 November, Rolf's forward motion slowed while the storm was situated above the Massif Central in southern France, maintaining a central pressure of 1,000 millibars (30\u00a0inHg).[7] On 6 November, the system moved into the western Mediterranean Sea in the direction of northwestern Italy, while gradually strengthening, before turning southward.[10][2][7][11] Around the same time, the storm's frontal structure shrunk to 150 kilometres (93\u00a0mi) in length.[7] From 12:00 UTC on 6 November to 00:00 UTC on 7 November, Rolf moved across the Balearic Islands, before turning to the east and then the north, moving in a counterclockwise motion.[2] Later on 7 November, Rolf turned westward, and slowly transitioned from an extratropical system into a subtropical depression over the abnormally-warm waters of the Mediterranean Sea,[7][12] which were at 17\u00a0\u00b0C (63\u00a0\u00b0F).[13] With this transition, Rolf acquired a warm quasi-symmetric core, and organised convective rainbands wrapped around the center of the storm.[10] The storm was then given the designation Invest 99L, by the United States Naval Research Laboratory (NRL).[14] The NOAA also began monitoring the subtropical depression, which was now located in the Gulf of Lion. Later that day, Rolf transitioned from a subtropical depression into a tropical depression off the coast of France,[14][10] and the NOAA gave Rolf the identifier 01M.[1][14] Late on 7 November, soon after Rolf had completed its tropical transition, the system increased further in organization and strengthened significantly in the process, with the NOAA noting that deep convention had persisted around the core of Rolf long enough to officially declare the system a tropical storm.[14][10] Consequently, the Satellite Services Division of NESDIS in the NOAA classified the system as Tropical Storm 01M. By then, Rolf had developed a deep warm core, while turning northeastward.[2] On 8 November, Rolf strengthened further as it slowly approached the southeastern coast of France and the coast of Liguria, with the storm also developing an eye. At 03:00 UTC on the same day, Rolf reached its peak intensity, attaining a minimum central pressure of 991\u00a0mb (29.3\u00a0inHg) and maximum 1-minute sustained winds of 85\u00a0km/h (53\u00a0mph).[14][10][15][2] Rolf began to weaken on 9 November as it approached the French coastline, due to hostile conditions, with the storm's convection decreasing and its upper- and mid-level circulation centers becoming misaligned.[16] That same day, Rolf turned westward, just off the coast of France.[14] Later that day, Rolf weakened into a tropical depression as the storm neared landfall in France, with the NOAA issuing their final bulletin on the storm, as Rolf was expected to dissipate soon.[14] Later that day, Rolf made landfall on the island of \u00cele du Levant, with a central pressure of 1,015 millibars (30.0\u00a0inHg),[7][17] Soon afterward, Rolf made another landfall near Hy\u00e8res, in Southeastern France,[8] weakening rapidly upon making its second landfall.[10] Rolf fully dissipated several hours later, early on 10 November.[14][18][7] As a tropical system, the warm core of Rolf persisted for a longer period of time compared to most of the other documented Mediterranean tropical-like cyclones.[2]"

On 4 November, torrential rainfall in the region\u2014which had begun on the day before\u2014led to widespread flooding, killing seven people and triggering the evacuation of a few thousand people in northern Italy.[23][3] The Ferregiano, a westward-flowing tributary of the Bisagno, overflowed its banks by 4 metres (13\u00a0ft).[22] The Genoa-Sestri Levante section of Highway A12 in Italy was closed, due to the flooding, and air and rail traffic in the region were suspended.[22] The road between Recco and Camogli was also flooded.[24] On 5 November, lightning struck the roof of a house in Camogli, starting a fire that was quickly put out by firefighters.[25] The storm also caused multiple small landslides and downed numerous trees in Liguria.[26] Flooding from Rolf also led to traffic obstructions by 6 November in Piedmont and Tigullio, in the Province of Savona, after severe thunderstorms dumped large amounts of rainfall on the night of 5\u20136 November.[23] The flooding also caused blackouts in the Province of Savona on that night, and homes in the area suffered from flooded garages and basements.[27] On the evening of 6 November, Rolf spawned a tornado over Alassio, in the Province of Savona, damaging buildings and walkways in Piazza d'Italia, and flooding basements in the village of Barusso.[27] In Calice al Cornoviglio, chasms opened up in the roads after multiple collapses, due to damage from the floodwaters.[28] From 6\u20137 November, 300\u00a0mm (12\u00a0in) of rain fell in Triora, in the Province of Imperia, which led to flooding in Sanremo that forced the evacuation of 25 families from a six-story building; a total of 40 people were evacuated.[29] On 7 November, rainfall from Rolf caused a landslide in Savignone, which blocked Provincial Road 10.[30] Rolf also caused a landslide in the Province of Genoa that broke the natural gas line between Casella and Montoggio, which was estimated would require four to six months to repair.[31] In Genoa, schools closed from 5\u20139 November.[32] In total, Rolf caused at least \u20ac118.4 million (US$160 million) in damages in Italy.[3] The Italian Government was criticized for the poor hydrogeological conditions in the city of Genova after Rolf, as well as the lack of safety measures for preventing the disaster; the aftermath led to the eruption of a political scandal.[33]"

Some of the hardest hit areas in France included Valleraugue, Sabli\u00e8res, Loubaresse, Draguignan, Arles, and Cannes.[3] The region was still recovering from a prior flooding event in June 2010, 17 months ago.[21] The Department of Var in southeastern France was severely impacted by Rolf, with the department seeing widespread flood damage and thousands of evacuations. The Alpes-Maritimes district along the Var River was also heavily impacted, with the district suffering several million Euros in damages. In the days preceding and during its landfalls, Rolf triggered floods across southern France, from the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques all the way to the French\u2013Italian border, as well as on the island of Corsica.[21] Rolf killed a total of five people in France.[3][21] During a nine-day period, from 1\u20139 November, 605\u00a0mm (23.8\u00a0in) of rain fell across southern France, with 443\u00a0mm (17.4\u00a0in) of rain falling on 4\u20136 November alone.[19] On 5 November, 240\u00a0mm (9.4\u00a0in) of rain fell on Caussols and 297\u00a0mm (11.7\u00a0in) of rain fell on Saint-Martin-d'Entraunes.[19] All of the rivers in the north, west, and central regions of the Alpes-Maritimes overflowed their banks, including: the Fray\u00e8re in Auribeau, the Mourachone in P\u00e9gomas, the Siagne in Mandelieu, the Brague, the B\u00e9al, the Riou, the Cagne, the Loup, the Roya, the Va\u00efre, and the Var. The floods forced numerous evacuations across southern France. From 5\u20138 November, Rolf forced the evacuation of 2,500 people in the Argens region,[21] triggered blackouts that left 8,000 families without power, and required 1,100 rescues by French SP firefighters. During that same period of time, Rolf caused widespread traffic disruptions, triggered multiple landslides, and also flooded numerous homes and apartments.[19][21] The storm damaged numerous municipal roads, wastewater treatment plants, waste reception buildings, schools, and other public buildings. The storm also damaged at least 300 businesses and 300 farms in the Var. Of the different communes in the Var, La Palud-sur-Verdon, near Fr\u00e9jus, suffered the most damage.[21] On 10 November, following the storm, 4,000 customers remained without electricity in the Var, and eight municipalities had no access to clean drinking water. In the aftermath of the storm, 36 municipalities requested the French Government to declare a state of emergency.[21] Wind gusts between 130 and 150\u00a0km/h (81 and 93\u00a0mph) were recorded across the Var in the days leading up to Rolf's first landfall.[19][15] At \u00cele du Levant, a maximum 10-minute sustained wind speed of 110\u00a0km/h (68\u00a0mph) was recorded, while a maximum gust of 149\u00a0km/h (93\u00a0mph) was recorded at the same location. Porquerolles reported the highest wind gust from Rolf, at 154\u00a0km/h (96\u00a0mph), while the same location reported a 10-minute sustained wind speed of 104\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph).[15] Rolf also generated waves up to 6 meters (20 feet) high off the coast of France, prior to making landfall.[34] The Caisse Centrale de R\u00e9assurance (CCR), the French state insurance company, estimated that Rolf caused around \u20ac807 million (US$1.09 billion) in insured losses in France.[21][3]"

The first floors and garages of multiple homes also flooded. The flooding in Catalonia resulted in over \u20ac1 million (US$1.344 million) in insured losses.[4] Rolf also caused flooding in the Balearic Islands from 6 to 7 November.[7][2]"

        "content": "On 1 February 2011, a combination of high temperatures and strong winds led to the outbreak of several fires in the Gippsland region of Victoria. While most were relatively small and quickly contained, the worst of the fires, the Tostaree bushfires, spread rapidly, burning 8,000 hectares (20,000 acres) of thinly populated State forest, grassland, and farmland near the Princes Highway between Nowa Nowa and Newmerella, just west of Orbost. The fires quickly destroyed two houses (with several other houses being saved by fire crews), cut power to most of East Gippsland east of Nowa Nowa for several days, and caused the Princes Highway to be closed for almost two days, effectively isolating the region. The firefighting effort included two hundred CFA firefighters, seven aircraft, and the Elvis air crane. Early speculation was that the fire had been started by clashing or fallen power lines caused by the strong winds.[6] Milder weather conditions allowed the fire to be largely contained by 3 February, and the Princes Highway was reopened with a reduced speed limit.[7] Further investigations suggested the fire had been started by smouldering tree roots from a lightning strike months earlier.[8] On the night of 5 February 2011 a fire began to the east of Swan Valley[9] when a tree branch fell on an electrical transmission tower, resulting in hundreds of people being evacuated.[10] By 7 February the fire had burnt through 1,167 hectares (2,884 acres) with 150 firefighters tackling the blaze.[10] The high winds resulted in all fixed wing water bombers being grounded, but five helicopters (four helitankers and one large type 1 helicopter) were used to combat the blaze.[11] At about midday 6 February a fire began in the south eastern suburbs of Perth, Western Australia in the Perth Hills. By the next day hundreds of residents were evacuated from the suburbs of Roleystone and Kelmscott as firefighters battled to contain the blaze. At an early stage of the fire at least eight homes were lost and over 300 hectares (741 acres) of bush had been destroyed.[12] By the end of daylight on the same day the number was raised to 35 homes lost.[13] By late afternoon of 7 February the fire had destroyed 64 homes, with 32 more damaged, and was 95 percent contained with more than 100 firefighters still tackling the blaze.[14] A total area of 440 hectares (1,087 acres)[15] was burnt out by the blaze, which is believed to have been started by sparks from an angle grinder igniting dry grass. On 6 February additional bushfires were burning in the Perth suburbs of Ferndale and Wilson in bushland adjoining the Canning River. Outside of Perth there were three additional fires burning in Chittering Estate, Jarrahdale, and in the Lesueur National Park.[16] On 6 February the Victorian Government sent 21 specialist firefighters along with two helitankers, with an additional two helitankers due to arrive on 8 February.[17]"

On 18 January, the Federal Government pledged A$4 million in relief funds.[52] Three platoons from Victoria's 4th Reserve Response Force (4RRF), under the command of Headquarters 4th Brigade, conducted Rapid Impact Assessments (RIA) on townships identified by VICSES since 20 January, to provide information on the impact of the floods on community and private infrastructure.[53] ADF personnel delivered relief items including almost 200,000 sandbags, various emergency stores, fuel, sand, water and bedding to a number of communities in the flood-affected region. In addition, a RAAF aircraft transported 76,000 ADF sandbags from Townsville and Brisbane to Melbourne on 22\u201323 January.[53] By 24 January, RIAs had been completed for the towns of Charlton, Hamilton, Glenorchy, Halls Gap, Rochester, Bridgewater, Carisbrook, Dunolly, Clunes, Creswick, Appin South, Kerang West, Skipton, Newbridge and Horsham.[53] On 24 January the ADF committed two Royal Australian Navy (RAN) Seahawk helicopters for providing support to Victorian flood relief and recovery efforts in addition to approximately 100 personnel and more than 40 land vehicles.[53] The Prime Minister of Australia, Julia Gillard, toured flood affected areas from 28 January.[54] Victorian Premier Ted Ballieu publicly criticised the Prime Minister for forgetting her home state while she pushed for a controversial flood levy to repair Queensland's flood damage.[55] In March 2011, the Queen's eldest grandson, Prince William, toured the affected areas in Victoria, as well as those damaged by the floods in Queensland.[56] In April 2011, Scouts Australia's Victorian Branch replaced its traditional Hoadley Hide hiking event with the Hoadley Project, where hundreds of Venturer and Rover Scouts assisted residents of Charlton, Rochester and Murrabit in the continuing cleanup effort.[57]"

The most notable storm of the day produced several tornadoes across the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex. The first tornado touchdown in the Fort Worth area but caused little if any damage.[1] An F2 tornado shortly caused extensive damage to the town of DeSoto in Dallas County. Numerous structures were destroyed and the City Hall itself sustained major damage that totaled about $50 million. No fatalities were reported by this tornado.[2] However, further east, the same storm intensified and produced a violent F4 tornado that traveled through the Lancaster area killing 3 and injured nearly 50 others while destroying much of the historic downtown square.[3] In addition to the tornadoes, extensive hail was recorded across much of the Metroplex region. Total tornado and hail figures in Texas alone on this date was estimated at $300 million.[4] On April 26, the most productive storm affected portions of eastern Illinois just southeast of Chicago and portions of northern and central Indiana. Shortly before 11:00 PM, an F4 tornado tore through a mobile home park and a subdivision 2 miles west of West Lafayette killing three and injuring 70 others across Tippecanoe County. The mobile home park was very heavily damaged with numerous structures being totally demolished. A factory where one of the fatalities was also heavily damaged while the two other fatalities were inside the same home.[5] Another tornado earlier in the day caused extensive damage to the town of Gainesville, Texas and injuring eight people. Several other tornadoes were reported in and around the Gainesville tornado at the same time the parent storm tore through most of the city.[6][7] Across North Texas near the Red River Valley, over 20 tornadoes were confirmed along that area alone on April 26 from roughly near Wichita Falls to west of Texarkana, Arkansas.[4] Activity ended on April 27 with weaker tornadoes across Missouri, Kentucky and Tennessee and minimal damage reported."

The term is most commonly found on tourist maps, and on the government Department of Environment and Conservation pamphlets and materials relating to the regional headquarters at Mundaring Weir \u2013 The Perth Hills National Parks Centre[1][2] (formerly known as the Hills Forest Discovery Centre)  and its \"Nearer to Nature\" programs and activities. It is also sometimes used in books and pamphlets.[3][4] In earlier usage of the term \"The Hills\" by people living in Perth, the identification of specific locations along the Darling Scarp (also called the Darling Range) found some places more commonly referred to than others. Both Kalamunda and Darlington, as separate and specific areas, were frequently referred to specifically as \"The Hills\", due to their presence on the edge of the scarp.[citation needed] Greenmount Hill is often considered the \"entrance point to the Hills\", because the main road \u2013 the Great Eastern Highway \u2013 passes through this location, adjacent to the route of the much earlier road, the York Road. The \"Swan Hills\" is a name often given to a part of the range centred on Toodyay Road and its corridor through the north-eastern part of the City of Swan and Gidgegannup.[citation needed] However, the term \"Swan Hills\" is also used in other ways as well.[how?] A \"Welcome to Perth Hills\" sign within 100 metres of Chippers Leap on Greenmount Hill is the entry point for that part of the hills in the Mundaring shire.[5] Another \"Welcome to Perth Hills\" sign is on Kalamunda Road, before the road climbs to Kalamunda.[6]\nThe area also includes the Bickley and Carmel Wine region.

The twentieth named storm of the 2007 Pacific typhoon season, Faxai originated from a tropical depression over the open waters of the western Pacific Ocean in late October. The storm quickly strengthened, becoming a severe tropical storm on October\u00a026 as it rapidly traveled toward the northeast. The storm became extratropical the following day as it brushed Japan. The remnants dissipated on October\u00a028. Although Faxai never made landfall, outer bands associated with the storm produced torrential rains, amounting to 458\u00a0mm (18.0\u00a0in) on Miyakejima. A Japan Airlines flight to Narita Airport encountered severe turbulence during the afternoon of October\u00a027. One person sustained serious injuries, and five others received minor injuries; the plane was damaged during the event. One person was killed near Tokyo as the storm passed by, and three others were injured. Damages from the storm amounted to \u00a5150\u00a0million (US$1.5\u00a0million)."

        "content": "Tropical Storm Faxai began as an area of convection that persisted about 805 kilometers (500\u00a0mi) west of Guam on October\u00a024. Satellite imagery indicated broad cyclonic turning in the lower levels of the atmosphere, and a trough was near the surface. Convection consolidated around the center of the low-level circulation, and the upper-level environment\u2014low wind shear and good divergence\u2014favored development.[1] The following day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a tropical depression.[2] Shortly after, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert as convection deepened around a partially exposed low. The storm traveled northwest under the influences of a subtropical ridge to the north.[3] At 0000\u00a0UTC on October\u00a026, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) designated the system as a tropical depression and gave it the local name Juaning.[4] Around the same time, the JMA upgraded the depression to a tropical storm and gave it the name Faxai.[2] The JTWC issued advisories on Faxai, designating it as 20W; however, they classified it as a tropical depression.[5] Several hours later, the storm began to undergo an extratropical transition, with convection persisting mainly in the northwestern portion of the storm and cold, dry air entering into the southwestern portion.[6] At 1200\u00a0UTC, PAGASA issued their final advisory on Tropical Storm Juaning as it moved out of their area of responsibility.[4] The JTWC reported that Tropical Depression 20W (Faxai) had become extratropical around this time as it merged with a baroclinic zone. A cold front developed along the southern portion of Faxai, a feature of extratropical cyclones.[7] Around that time, the JMA upgraded Faxai to a severe tropical storm with (10-minute sustained) winds of 95\u00a0km/h (59\u00a0mph).[2] The JTWC subsequently upgraded the depression to a tropical storm based on the development of a very impactful central dense overcast. A shortwave trough over the Korean peninsula provided a favorable upper-level environment for Faxai to intensify.[8] Early the next day, Faxai began accelerating rapidly towards the northeast in the mid-latitude westerlies. An anticyclone over Japan created a strong pressure gradient between it and the tropical storm, causing the wind field of Faxai to expand significantly to the northeast. As the JTWC issued their final advisory,[9] they assessed the storm to have reached its peak intensity, with (one-minute sustained) winds of 75\u00a0km/h (47\u00a0mph).[10] The JMA also assessed Faxai to have reached its peak intensity at that time, with (10-minute sustained) winds of 100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph) and a minimum pressure of 975\u00a0hPa (mbar); however, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reported that Faxai had attained hurricane-force winds by this time, peaking at 130\u00a0km/h (81\u00a0mph).[11] The storm continued towards the northeast at a rapid pace and became extratropical off the eastern coast of Honshu around 1200\u00a0UTC on October\u00a027. The extratropical remnants persisted for more than a day before dissipating over open waters late on October\u00a028.[2] NOAA, on the other hand, continued to monitor the remnants of Faxai, with the system reaching the Aleutian Islands on October\u00a029. The following day, the storm rapidly intensified, with the central pressure dropping to 957\u00a0hPa (mbar) by 1800\u00a0UTC. On October\u00a031, the system tracked into Alaska and weakened.[11] The Japan Meteorological Agency uses 10-minute sustained winds, while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center uses one-minute sustained winds.[12] The conversion factor between the two is 1.14.[13] JMA's peak intensity for Faxai was 100\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph) 10-minute sustained, or 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph) one-minute sustained.[2][13] The JTWC's peak intensity for Faxai was 75\u00a0km/h (47\u00a0mph) one-minute sustained, or 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph) 10-minute sustained.[13][14]"

One home, two hectares of farmland, 2\u00a0km (1.2\u00a0mi) of roads, and one ship were damaged by the storm. At the height of the storm, 9,605 residences were without power throughout Japan.

The most devastating of these happened in Tasmania, where several large bushfires burnt out of control.[13][14] The fires were intensified by the heatwave,[15] with Hobart, at 4:05 pm on 4 January, experiencing 41.8\u00a0\u00b0C (107.2\u00a0\u00b0F): the city's highest temperature since records began in 1882.[16][17] Communities affected by the fires included Bicheno,[18] Boomer Bay, Connelly\u2019s Marsh, Copping, Dunalley,[19] Eaglehawk Neck, Forcett, Murdunna, Primrose Sands, Sommers Bay, Susan Bay, and Taranna.[20][21] By 5 January, up to 40 fires were burning across Tasmania and at least one hundred properties were destroyed.[22] More than 20,000 hectares (49,000 acres) of bushland were burnt out[4] and some of the buildings lost included sixty-five in Dunalley (including the police station, primary school and bakery),[20] fifteen in nearby Boomer Bay, twelve in Bicheno,[18] and fourteen in Sommers Bay.[21] Communities on the Tasman and Forestier peninsulas in south-east Tasmania were forced to flee fires coming down from the north, engulfing the only road out of the area and destroying much of Dunalley. A seaborne rescue operation described as \"huge\"[by whom?] was launched for the thousands of people sheltering on beaches, in boats, and at the Port Arthur historic site. More than 2,000 people were ferried to safety by police, commercial vessel operators and private volunteers, and another 2,000 took refuge at a community centre at Nubeena.[23] A large fire on the Giblin River in January 2013 was not attended to[24] and burnt much of the Southwest National Park.[25]"

Attempts were made to ensure that the community understood that the fire season was not yet over.[26] There was concern about a possible repeat of conditions similar to those during the 1967 fires, or the 1933\u201334 season.[27] On 6 February 2013, a significant fire started on Glen Dhu Road in the Molesworth area[28] and spread rapidly, with swirling winds causing unusual and unpredictable fire behaviour.[29] Due to the rugged nature of the terrain, water-bombing helicopters were used extensively, despite significant dangers posed by high-power transmission lines and smoke. One helicopter (a Firebird 427) crashed while fighting the blaze, though the pilot survived.[29] At least two other major blazes were fought on the same date, with blazes at Franklin in the Huon Valley, and Lefroy, near Georgetown.[30]"

        "content": "Typhoon Tingting was a destructive tropical cyclone that produced record-breaking rains in Guam. The eighth named storm of the 2004 Pacific typhoon season, Tingting originated from a tropical depression over the open waters of the western Pacific Ocean. The storm gradually intensified as it traveled northwest, becoming a typhoon on June\u00a028 and reaching its peak the following day while passing through the Mariana Islands. After maintaining typhoon intensity for three days, a combination of dry air and cooler sea surface temperatures caused the storm to weaken as it traveled northward. On July\u00a01, the storm passed by the Bonin Islands, off the coast of Japan, before moving out to sea. By July\u00a04, Tinting had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. The remnants were last reported by the Japan Meteorological Agency, the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center for the western Pacific basin, near the International Date Line on July\u00a013. While passing through the Mariana Islands, Typhoon Tingting produced torrential rains which triggered flooding and numerous landslides. In Guam, 554.99\u00a0mm (21.850\u00a0in) of rain fell in 24 hours, breaking the daily and monthly rainfall records for June. Winds gusted up to 212\u00a0km/h (132\u00a0mph), causing significant structural damage, amounting to $6\u00a0million in losses. One fatality occurred as a result of flooding and nine others resulted from rough seas. In the Mariana Islands, 71 homes were destroyed and hundreds were damaged; losses totaled $11.2\u00a0million. In Japan, two people were killed by rough seas.[nb 1]"

        "content": "On June\u00a024, 2004, an area of low pressure associated with developing convection formed about 1,110\u00a0km (690\u00a0mi) to the east-southeast of Guam. Early the next day, as the system began to intensify,[1] the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began monitoring the low pressure as a tropical depression.[2] With low wind shear and favorable diffluence,[3] the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the storm at 0000\u00a0UTC, classifying it as Tropical Depression 11W twelve\u00a0hours later. The depression traveled towards the northwest along the edge of a mid-latitude ridge.[1] Outer bands began developing around the system, although the ridge to its north restricted outflow.[4] About 24\u00a0hours after the JMA designated the depression, the agency upgraded it to a tropical storm and named it Tingting,[2] which was contributed by Hong Kong and is a fairly common pet name for young girls.[1] At 0600\u00a0UTC on June\u00a026, the JTWC also classified Tingting as a tropical storm.[5] As Tingting tracked northwestward, it continued to develop outflow in all directions.[6] The storm slowly intensified as it traveled towards the Mariana Islands,[1] strengthening into a severe tropical storm early on June\u00a027.[2] Later that day, a ragged eye began to form.[7] The ridge influencing the track of Tingting moved eastward, causing the storm to begin a gradual turn towards the north[1] At 0000\u00a0UTC on June\u00a028, the JTWC upgraded the storm to a minimal typhoon, the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale,[5] and the JMA followed about six hours later.[2] Several hours later, Tingting passed through the central Mariana Islands, tracking near the small island of Sarigan, while continuing to intensify.[1] At 0900\u00a0UTC, the typhoon reached its peak intensity with winds of 150\u00a0km/h (93\u00a0mph) according to both agencies[2][5] and a minimum pressure of 955\u00a0hPa (955\u00a0mbar).[2] With low wind shear, further strengthening was anticipated as it neared the Bonin Islands.[8] However, the typhoon began to weaken due to increasing dry air and decreasing sea surface temperatures. On June\u00a030, Tingting passed within 95\u00a0km (59\u00a0mi) east of Iwo Jima.[1] Later that day, the storm's eye dissipated as convection around the center of circulation weakened.[9] On July\u00a01, the JTWC downgraded Tingting to a tropical storm.[5] At 1200\u00a0UTC the following day, the JMA downgraded the storm to a severe tropical storm as winds decreased below 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph) (10-minute winds).[2] Convection associated with the storm began to diminish as Tingting began to undergo an extratropical transition.[10] Although the storm maintained its intensity as a severe tropical storm,[2] it was moving into increasingly unfavorable conditions and weakening was anticipated.[11] As Tingting tracked towards the northeast into the mid-latitude westerlies, it completed its extratropical transition on July\u00a04.[12] After becoming an extratropical cyclone, Tingting accelerated towards the north before abruptly stalling near the Kamchatka Peninsula. On July\u00a06, the extratropical remnants of Tingting were absorbed by a developing area of low pressure located to the south of the former typhoon.[13] However, the JMA continued to monitor Tingting as a separate system as it executed a counter-clockwise loop though July\u00a010 before heading towards the International Date Line. The storm was last reported on July\u00a013 to the west Aleutian Islands.[1][2]"

A small craft advisory was also issued for rest of the Mariana Islands.[24] A typhoon warning was declared for most of the islands on June\u00a027.[25] The United States Air Force Base in the Mariana Islands was placed under Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness Four, the lowest level of readiness, as Tingting approached.[26] As Typhoon Tingting approached the Mariana Islands, three Chinese women drowned in rough seas produced by the storm in Saipan.[22][27] On June\u00a028, Tingting produced strong winds throughout the region. Sustained winds on Guam reached 82\u00a0km/h (51\u00a0mph) with gusts to 106\u00a0km/h (66\u00a0mph); a pressure of 994.6\u00a0hPa (mbar) was also recorded on the island. Although located closer to the center of Tingting, Rota reported lower winds than Guam; the highest sustained wind reached 70\u00a0km/h (43\u00a0mph) with gusts of 93\u00a0km/h (58\u00a0mph). Due to the lack of sufficient observations on Tinian, the highest sustained winds recorded were suspected to be lower than what they really were. Winds of 56\u00a0km/h (35\u00a0mph) were recorded several times with gusts to 84\u00a0km/h (52\u00a0mph). Sustained winds on Saipan were recorded up to 100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph) with gusts to 124\u00a0km/h (77\u00a0mph); a pressure of 984.9\u00a0hPa (mbar) was also recorded. The highest winds during Typhoon Tingting throughout the Mariana Islands were measured on Pagan Island where 106\u00a0km/h (66\u00a0mph) sustained winds were recorded along with a gust of 212\u00a0km/h (132\u00a0mph).[28] Although Tingting passed about 400\u00a0km (250\u00a0mi) to the northeast of Guam, torrential rains from a monsoonal feeder band produced record-breaking rainfall. In the span of 24\u00a0hours, 554.99\u00a0mm (21.850\u00a0in) of rain fell on Guam, shattering both the record for highest single day rainfall and the monthly rainfall for June[28] at 80.26\u00a0mm (3.160\u00a0in)[25] and 371.09\u00a0mm (14.610\u00a0in) respectively. Most of the northern areas of the island received more than 510\u00a0mm (20\u00a0in) of rain but the southern areas of Guam reported much lower totals. At Anderson Air Force Base, a total of 287.78\u00a0mm (11.330\u00a0in) of rain was recorded over a 30-hour span. Rota recorded much less rainfall than Guam, having 145.28\u00a0mm (5.720\u00a0in) during 24\u00a0hours and a storm total of 221.99\u00a0mm (8.740\u00a0in). No rainfall was recorded on both Tinian and Pagan Island due to the lack of observations. On Saipan, a total of 197.61\u00a0mm (7.780\u00a0in) was measured.[28] The record-breaking rainfall in Guam produced severe flooding and numerous landslides throughout the island. A total of 57 homes were destroyed and another 624 were damaged. Crop damages on the island amounted to $500,000 with most of the farmers reporting total crop losses. One person died after being swept away along a flooded road. Total property damages totaled to $6\u00a0million. Most of the damage on Rota resulted from flooding and high seas. The port on the island suffered $1\u00a0million in damages and crop losses amounted to $500,000.[28] The same day that Tingting made its closest approach to Guam, a 19-year-old was swept off a reef and drowned in rough seas produced by the typhoon.[29]  On Tinian and Saipan, unlike Guam and Rota, most of the damage was a result of the winds. A total of 4 homes were destroyed and 24 others sustained major damage on Tinian while another 4 were destroyed, 81 sustained major damage, and another 101 were affected on Saipan.[28] Schools on the two islands sustained a combined $92,737 in damages.[30] At Saipan's port, an oil tanker sank, spilling thousands of gallons of oil into the water.[28] Throughout the Saipan, 50 power lines, 20 transformers, and 6 power poles were damaged or destroyed,[28] leaving 25\u00a0percent of the islands' residents without power[31] and $300,000 in damages. An estimated 90 percent of the banana trees were knocked down, contributing to the $518,000 in crop losses. Property losses on the two islands was estimated at $1.6\u00a0million. On the islands of Alamagan, Pagan, and Agrihan all private homes, a total of six, were destroyed, the food stores and crops were lost, and the water supply was contaminated. The main public facility, which was used as a storm shelter on Alamagan, sustained heavy damage. Damages from the three islands amounted to $500,000.[28] The following day, five people went out kayaking however, the rough seas overturned the kayaks and all five drowned.[32] Numerous water rescues on jet skis had to be made as residents became stranded in their cars after driving into flooded roads.[25] Damages throughout the islands amounted to $11.2\u00a0million.[28]"

No known property damage resulted from the passage of Tingting.[35] Throughout eastern Japan, large swells produced by Tingting caused moderate coastal damage and killed two people.[17][18] In Urakawa District, Hokkaid\u014d, the local fishing industry sustained considerable damage, amounting to 20.5\u00a0million JPY (US$240,000).[20] Moisture from the storm also enhanced rainfall in the Shizuoka Prefecture, resulting in a record daily rainfall of 368\u00a0mm (14.5\u00a0in) in Shizuoka City on June\u00a029. The rains led to significant flooding and several landslides; 921 homes were flooded and an estimated 160,000 residences were without power at the height of the storm.

The American Red Cross also provided $17,000 in assistance.[37] The Government of Guam requested $6\u00a0million in aid from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to repair the damages from Tingting.[38] On July\u00a029, George Bush approved the request for a disaster declaration and federal aid began to be sent to the Mariana Islands and Guam.[39] Almost a month later, the islands of Agrigan, Alamagan, and Pagan were granted public assistance.[40] In mid-August, Typhoon Chaba caused significant damage in the Mariana Islands. A bill was passed following the storm to allow up to 500 people to be hired as temporary workers on Saipan and Tinian.[41] In mid-September, a request was made by the commonwealth for $10\u00a0million in natural disaster mitigation following the effects of successive typhoons in the region.

This is despite having extensive fire in parts of the country over the last 12 months. The reason for this prediction is the abundant grass growth spurred by two La Ni\u00f1a events over the last two years.[1] Most parts of the country experienced a heat wave at the start of 2013, with a new national average maximum being set on 7 January 2013. The new record of 40.33\u00a0\u00b0C (105\u00a0\u00b0F) beat the old record of 40.17\u00a0\u00b0C (104\u00a0\u00b0F) that had been set on 21 December 1972. Another record that was beaten in 2013 was Australia's mean temperature, climbing from 31.86\u00a0\u00b0C (89\u00a0\u00b0F) set on 21 December 1972 to 32.23\u00a0\u00b0C (90\u00a0\u00b0F) on 7 January 2013.[2] Additionally, six of the 20 hottest days in Australian records (by average maximum) have been in January 2013. Australia also experienced its hottest summer on average following a particularly hot spell in January. Using average day and night temperatures the average was found to be 28.6\u00a0\u00b0C (83\u00a0\u00b0F) beating the previous record set in the summer of 1997\u20131988.[3] Fourteen of the weather bureau's 112 long term weather stations recorded their hottest days on record including one in Sydney that recorded a daytime record of 46\u00a0\u00b0C (115\u00a0\u00b0F).

The fire made a significant run under the influence of westerly winds gusting at up to 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph) on 8 January. During a 13-day period, the fire burned 12,335\u00a0ha (30,480 acres) of scrub, forest and pasture in and around the Kybeyan State Conservation Area and impacted on properties within the Kybeyan Valley; 4 houses, 18 vehicles and 200\u00a0km (120\u00a0mi) of fencing were destroyed and 2,000 head of livestock died.[14] On 7 January, a fast moving grass fire ignited near the village of Oura.[42] 140 volunteers from the RFS, six aircraft\u2014including an Erickson Air-Crane\u2014and four heavy plant equipment were used to try to contain the fire. Approximately 800\u00a0ha (2,000 acres) of scrub, forest and pasture were burned, one vehicle was destroyed and a firefighter suffered minor injuries after being over-run by the fire in a firefighting tanker.[42][43] On 8 January, a fire ignited around Bald Hill, approximately 8\u00a0km (5.0\u00a0mi) east of Jugiong, during temperatures of 42\u00a0\u00b0C (108\u00a0\u00b0F) and winds gusting to 80\u00a0km/h (50\u00a0mph). During a four-day, period, the fire burned 14,260\u00a0ha (35,200 acres) of scrub, forest and pasture and impacted on the communities of Berremangra, Bookham, Childowla, Talmo and Woolgarlo; although no houses were destroyed, a number of sheds and 1,200\u00a0km (750\u00a0mi) of fencing were destroyed and 10,200 head of livestock died.[44] On 12 January, a fire ignited near the Wambelong campground, on the north side of the John Renshaw Parkway and within the Warrumbungle National Park, during temperatures of up to 40.8\u00a0\u00b0C (105.4\u00a0\u00b0F). Steep, inaccessible terrain on the eastern and western flanks meant that the fire could not be contained or controlled on the first afternoon, despite the intervention of two fixed-wing firefighting aircraft, and the fire grew to 25\u00a0ha (62 acres) by the morning of 13 January.[19] Catastrophic conditions were forecast for the Coonabarabran region throughout 13 January; the weather prediction across the fireground at 10:10 AEDT was for temperatures to be up to 45\u00a0\u00b0C (113\u00a0\u00b0F), relative humidity at 10% with winds to be north to north-westerly at 50\u00a0km/h (31\u00a0mph) gusting to 80\u00a0km/h (50\u00a0mph).[19] At Coonabarabran Research Station, some 20\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi) from the point of ignition, a relative humidity of 28% was observed at 15:00 AEDT, and a \"fresh gale\" strength wind gust of 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph) from the north was recorded at 12:13 AEDT.[45] In the hours after midday the fire spotted across John Renshaw Parkway and breached the containment line, burning with flames of up to 33\u00a0m (108\u00a0ft) and impacting upon the Warrumbungle Visitors Centre, where a number of New South Wales Rural Fire Service and NSW National Parks & Wildlife Service employees were sheltering. By mid-afternoon, the fire was spreading downwind at a rate of 3.7\u00a0km/h (2.3\u00a0mph) and the NSW Police commenced evacuations to the east of the fire, including at Siding Spring Observatory. The observatory was impacted by the fire in the late afternoon, causing the destruction of three buildings in the complex; 'The Lodge' accommodation used by visiting researchers, the Director's Cottage and the Fire Station.[46][47] Throughout the evening a 14\u00a0km (8.7\u00a0mi) high pyrocumulonimbus cloud formed above the blaze, creating unpredictable winds, intense spotting and other extreme meteorological conditions; the fire burned to the east, along Timor Rd., burning to within 13\u00a0km (8.1\u00a0mi) of Coonabarabran township.[19] A southerly wind change passed through the fire ground some time after 18:00 AEDT, causing hot ash and embers to fall in Baradine, 50\u00a0km (31\u00a0mi) north of Coonabarabran, throughout the night and prompting the Baradine local hospital to secure the windows with damp towels to prevent the entry of smoke and ash.[19] Over a 41-day period, the fire burned 55,210\u00a0ha (136,400 acres) of pasture, scrub and forest\u2014including 95 percent of the Warrumbungles National Park\u2014and impacted the communities of Bugaldie, Coonabarabran, Goorianawa, Quanda, Tonderburine and Warrumbungle; a hotel, three buildings at the Siding Spring Observatory, 53 houses, 130 other non-residential structures and 1,700\u00a0km (1,100\u00a0mi) of fencing were destroyed and 1,100 head of livestock died in the fire.[19][48]"

Over 50 firefighters were required to save homes and sheds from the blaze and had the blaze under control the following day.[115] Bushfires were also burning around Busselton which were thought to have been deliberately lit, following the outbreak of about 25 fires over the course of the month. Another fire was accidentally started by the exhaust of a quad-bike being used to spray weeds by a contractor on 29 January at the Benger Swamp reserve south of Harvey. Over 300 hectares (741 acres) of scrub was burned before it was brought under control.[116] A bushfire near Carnarvon was burning on the north eastern side of town on 28 January. The fire burnt out of control with strong winds starting spot fires among the banana plantations.[117] The blaze was controlled a day later but not before 1,400 hectares (3,459 acres) of bushland destroying 20 derelict buildings and sheds, but leaving the plantations with only minor damage.[118]"

A tornado warning was issued for Reeves County before 8:00 PM after a wall cloud was spotted, and a brief tornado touched down near Balmorhea at 8:10 PM. At 8:16 PM, another tornado touched down just east of Balmorhea, about 2 miles (3.2\u00a0km) from Saragosa, north of Interstate 10. Initially, it destroyed farms and outbuildings prior to evolving into a large multiple vortex tornado. It intensified sharply into a violent F4 tornado before entering Saragosa. Twenty-two people were killed inside Catholic Hall of Our Lady of Guadalupe Church, where a graduation ceremony for pre-schoolers was taking place. Eight others were killed elsewhere across the town, including one inside a car. The worst of the damage occurred inside most of the business and residential area. Trees were debarked and homes were reduced to their foundations. Eighty percent of the town was destroyed. In addition to Catholic Hall, 118 homes, the post office, a grocery store, two churches and a school were also heavily damaged or destroyed.[1][2] Damage was estimated at $1.4 million.

Local storm spotter TV and radio stations based in Midland, Odessa and Pecos rebroadcast the warnings in Spanish and English, but many residents in the affected region (over 100 miles to the southwest) did not receive them. The town was not equipped with a siren, did not have its own police or firefighters, and as many as 50% of residents did not own their own TV or radio; those who did generally preferred Spanish-language stations based in Mexico (which did not provide weather alerts). Ultimately, the town's first awareness of the danger came when a parent (arriving late for the graduation ceremony) spotted the tornado bearing down on Saragosa from the west and interrupted the ceremony at Catholic Hall to give warning in Spanish.[4] The crowd of children and their respective families, estimated to be about 100 people\u2014or about 25% of Saragosa's total population at the time\u2014immediately took cover. As the only concrete block building in town, the town hall/community center would have been considered a relatively safe haven under such circumstances, but it was unable to withstand a direct hit from a violent F4 tornado, collapsing with the loss of 22 lives, a fatality rate of roughly 22% (not uncommon for F4 tornadoes).[2][3] In the years following the tornado, the Catholic Hall and the community center/town hall (\"Saragosa Multi-Purpose Center\") were rebuilt in the center of town along Hwy. 17 with steel-reinforced masonry construction designed to survive an F4 tornado, and a storm shelter was also installed under one wing of the new community center. The town's housing quality has stayed the same, given its continued role as primarily a home for poor Mexican-American agricultural workers; very few houses were rebuilt along the SW/NE damage path through town, with most displaced residents moving in with family or relocating to Pecos, Texas or other nearby farming communities."

During the following years, it was surpassed by the Birmingham, Alabama tornado in 1998 and the Oklahoma City Metro Area tornado in 1999 that killed 32 and 36 people, respectively. The 1990 Plainfield tornado killed nearly as many as the Saragosa event, as did the Jarrell tornado in 1997.[5] It was the ninth-deadliest tornado in the state of Texas between the Zephyr tornado in 1909 and the Lubbock Tornado in 1970.[6] The community was also destroyed in 1938 by a tornado and was later rebuilt slightly to the southwest.[7]"

Six people were injured from the tornado, one of whom died from his injuries at the end of the month.[5][8] After midnight, storms moved into northern Indiana, northern Ohio, southern Michigan and southwestern Ontario where heavy damage was reported just outside Toledo in Wood County where seven people were killed. In Allen Township, eight homes were destroyed, three received major damage and 10\u00a0received minor damage.[9] Heavy damage was also reported in Leamington, Ontario where a state of emergency was declared.[10] In Michigan, shortly after midnight, Calhoun, Kalamazoo, Hillsdale, Jackson, Ingham, Branch, Berrien, Van Buren, Saint Joseph, Washtenaw, Wayne, and Monroe counties were all under simultaneous tornado warnings, including two separate simultaneous warnings covering all of Calhoun County.[11] Damage in Calhoun County included downed trees and a metal flagpole bent at a right angle in Homer, Michigan due to extreme winds. The decision to sound tornado sirens was made in many communities. An EF1 tornado was confirmed just south of Battle Creek by the NWS; damage included a roof being torn off of a church.[12] An EF2\u00a0tornado damaged a total of 311\u00a0houses, apartments and commercial and public buildings in Monroe County.[13] A moderate risk was issued for June 6 across the northeast coast of the United States primarily due to damaging wind, with tornadoes also a significant threat.

At the time of the upgrade, Jangmi made landfall over the town of Hinatuan in the province of Surigao del Sur. The storm traversed the Caraga region, and exited the landmass of Mindanao during the afternoon hours of the same day, as it had accelerated to the northwest. Late on December 30, Jangmi made landfall over Cebu and southern Negros, right before the JTWC downgraded it to a tropical depression. On December 31, the JTWC issued the final warning to Jangmi, and the JMA downgraded it to a tropical depression at noon the same day. The system was last noted by the JMA and the JTWC on January 1, 2015, dissipating over Borneo, just before the 2015 Pacific typhoon season started.[citation needed]"

The Spanish expedition departed Arkansas two years later, leaving behind numerous Old World diseases. It was 130 years before Europeans visited this region again. The French expedition of Joliet and Marquette in 1673 found none of the towns or people that the Spanish had documented; all that remained were the many mounds that still dot the landscape along the rivers and creeks.

This became such a problem that on February 19, 1863, four companies of Federal forces burned down the entire town. The town of Hopefield was rebuilt after the war but never regained the prominence it once held in Crittenden County.

In addition to its lost ferry operations, this area, in the same fashion as its northern neighbor Hopefield, became part of the Mississippi River flood plain in the 1890s.[5] The entire area usually flooded in the spring until the St. Francis Levee District was established in 1893. However, private landowners along the Mississippi River built levees that were only three or four feet high. In 1912 and 1913, the St. Francis main levee broke, flooding the area from the Mississippi River to Forrest City in St. Francis County. The flood of 1913 was the last time the levee broke in Crittenden County.[6]"

Bragg, a lumberman who had been logging in St. Francis County since 1905, purchased 300 acres of virgin timber and established a sawmill in 1914. The mill was located along a railroad spur and a dirt path that would eventually become Missouri Street in West Memphis.[6][7] Bragg also acquired the timbering rights to thousands of acres of adjacent land clearing the area that eventually gave way to fertile farmland and to the future West Memphis. The area around Bragg's Mill was known for the first few years as Bragg, Arkansas. The small community consisted of the mill, a commissary and boarding house, and a few dozen dwellings for workers.[8] In 1914, another operation began two miles south of Bragg's Mill when William H. Hundhausen began plans for the Bolz Slack Barrell Cooperage plant located at the southern end of present-day 8th Street in West Memphis. The Bolz Cooperage, which was a stave mill, purchased a great quantity of acreage for its lumber operation. Within a short time of the mill's beginning, a small community developed. In 1917, highways 70 and 61 were established and clearing began through the future West Memphis.[9] With the threat of river flooding diminished by a strengthened levee, the establishment of two lumber operations and the building of two major U.S. highways, the small lumber communities grew rapidly. In 1920 the population was approximately 132 and by 1928, the population had grown to 350.  The community incorporated as a city in 1927 with the name West Memphis. Zack T. Bragg, one of the city's founders, was elected as the first mayor and served for three consecutive one year terms. William H. Hundhausen, another founder of West Memphis, was elected as its third mayor and served from 1932 to 1944.[6]"

        "content": "The first automobiles began crossing the Mississippi River at Memphis in 1917 by special roadways constructed on the Harahan Bridge, which was built for rail traffic and opened in 1916. This heralded the growth of the future West Memphis as its main street, U.S. Highway 70, known as Broadway Avenue, brought an influx of automobile traffic through the area. U.S. Highway 61, named Missouri Street in West Memphis, was constructed at the same time and its juncture with Highway 70 would become the epicenter of downtown West Memphis.[8] West Memphis was officially incorporated in 1927 and continued to grow to become the largest city in Crittenden County. The availability of river and rail transportation transformed West Memphis into the manufacturing and distribution hub of the county. In the 1930s West Memphis, along with the rest of the Mississippi Delta, suffered due to the economic depression. However, the city grew and developed at a record pace. The most notable export of West Memphis from that era was its original blues music. At one time Sonny Boy Williamson, Howlin' Wolf, Robert Lockwood, Jr., and B.B. King lived in West Memphis. The growth and development of the city's main commercial thoroughfare, Broadway Avenue, was instigated by the increased traffic and by demand for the industrial products produced and shipped through West Memphis by rail and river. Tourist courts, restaurants, hotels and other amenities geared toward the traveler were constructed along the traffic corridor through West Memphis. During the World War II years, transportation of soldiers and goods by road, river, and rail in the Memphis/West Memphis area created the need for lodging and other services. Construction in 1949 of a second automobile bridge across the Mississippi, connecting Memphis and West Memphis, created another influx of automobile traffic. The buildings in the 700, 800 and 900 blocks of East Broadway reflect the growth of the city of West Memphis in the years 1930 to 1958. Until the national interstate highway system was opened in the late 1950s, diverting traffic away from former routes through the middle of America's towns, West Memphis' Broadway Avenue was the city's center of commerce, with retail stores, tourist courts and hotels and office buildings. Decline of Broadway Avenue was rapid after the traffic through the town diminished with the opening of the interstate highways. Although the three blocks of East Broadway contained in the West Memphis Commercial Historic District remain much as they appeared in the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s, the remainder of the city's major traffic corridor, Broadway Avenue, has changed significantly."

King (who began his public entertaining at the Square Deal Caf\u00e9 on South 16th Street)[citation needed] and Elvis Presley (who ate his first breakfast after being inducted into the U.S. Army at the Coffee Cup on East Broadway on March 24, 1958).[citation needed] Other night spots along Broadway Street included Willowdale Inn, the Cotton Club, and the Plantation Inn. Legal greyhound racing began in the county in 1935. In the years that followed, the track closed several times\u2014once for flooding, another due to World War II, and another time due to fire. However, the business currently known as Southland Park Gaming & Racing on North Ingram Boulevard has been in the same location since 1956 and is now open every day of the week, including 24 hours on weekends. West Memphis began its role as a trucking hub with the opening of parts of Interstate 55 in the 1950s. With both I-55 and I-40 traveling toward the Mississippi River, West Memphis became known as the \"crossroads of America\" in the trucking industry. In 1973, a six-lane highway bridge, known as the Hernando de Soto Bridge and located north of the Harahan, opened as part of I-40. In 1980, Leo Chitman was elected as the city's first African American mayor.[11] Current mayor Marco McClendon, who became the youngest West Memphis Mayor to be sworn into office in 2019,[12] is African American as well.[13] On December 14, 1987, a tornado killed six people and caused approximately $35\u00a0million in damage. The town had not recovered from the tornado damage when it flooded from 12 inches (300\u00a0mm) of rain on December 25, 1987. Additionally, 7 to 10 inches (180 to 250\u00a0mm) of snow fell on January 6, 1988. When the snow began to melt, this added to the already existing flood problems and the destruction caused by the tornado. Some of the major employers in the city are Schneider National Carriers, Southland Park Gaming & Racing, Family Dollar Distribution, FedEx National LTL, and Robert Bosch Power Tools. Family Dollar Distribution and FedEx National LTL are located in the Mid-America Industrial Park west of the city. The 1993 murders of three young boys and the subsequent convictions of Damien Echols, Jason Baldwin, and Jessie Misskelley, Jr. brought much unwanted attention to West Memphis. The three young men convicted were known as the West Memphis Three and the case brought about a great amount of public intrigue. Four documentaries have been made about the incident, the first being Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills. Echols, Baldwin, and Misskelley were released from jail in 2011 after signing an Alford plea, which allowed them to plead guilty while maintaining their innocence. They were released with time served and placed on probation until 2021.[14]"

A small piece of West Memphis extends south as far as the Mississippi River, but in most places the river is from 0.2 to 2 miles (0.32 to 3.22\u00a0km) south or east of the city limits. Downtown Memphis, Tennessee, is 8 miles (13\u00a0km) east of downtown West Memphis. According to the United States Census Bureau, West Memphis has a total area of 28.5 square miles (73.9\u00a0km2), of which 28.5 square miles (73.7\u00a0km2) is land and 0.077 square miles (0.2\u00a0km2), or 0.34%, is water.[3] Ecologically, West Memphis is located on the border between the Northern Backswamps (western part of West Memphis) and Northern Holocene Meander Belts (eastern section of West Memphis) ecoregions within the larger Mississippi Alluvial Plain. The Northern Backswamps are a network of low-lying overflow areas and floodplains historically dominated by bald cypress, water tupelo, overcup oak, water hickory, and Nuttall oak forest subject to year-round or seasonal inundation. The Northern Holocene Meander Belts are the flat floodplains and former alignments of the Mississippi River, including levees, oxbow lakes, and point bars. Much of the wetlands and  riverine habitat have been drained and developed for agricultural or urban land uses.[15] The Wapanocca National Wildlife Refuge, which preserves some of the year-round flooded bald cypress forest typical of this ecoregion prior to development for row agriculture lies north of West Memphis."

Residents started to be allowed back in from 6 January, with their identity and address being checked to limit access to only the roads that had been cleared as safe for travel. Road clearing was suspended on the afternoon of 7 January due to the wind and thunderstorms making the activity unsafe for the cleanup crews.[17] The major emergency declaration was rescinded at 3pm on 7 January, despite it being able to remain in force for 14 days.[18] The weather assisted to contain the fire on Sunday and Monday 4\u20135 January with mild winds and temperatures in the range of 30\u201334\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u201393\u00a0\u00b0F), but daily temperatures rose again on Tuesday and Wednesday 6\u20137 January, with forecast maximum temperature in the range of 35\u201339\u00a0\u00b0C (95\u2013102\u00a0\u00b0F) on both days.[19] Thunderstorms on the afternoon of 7 January produced a spate of new grass fires from lightning, but also brought cooler temperatures, increased humidity, and rain over some parts of the fireground, making it easier to control and extinguish the remaining areas. In the early morning hours of Thursday 8 January, the South Australian Country Fire Service confirmed on its website that the fire had been completely brought under control with crews remaining on the ground to extinguish the remaining hot spots.

The resident of the home where the incinerator was located said a dam pump on the property was not operational until he fixed it two weeks ago and that an irrigation pipe, which was burnt in the fire, was laid on the ground rather than buried underneath. The fires are the worst to affect the Adelaide Hills region since the 1983 Ash Wednesday bushfires, which was caused by years of drought and extreme heat.[37] In addition to the significant fire in the Adelaide Hills, there was also a major fire in the south east of South Australia, and several in Victoria at the same time. The two large water bombers were based in Victoria at Avalon Airport south of Melbourne, but moved for several days to RAAF Base Edinburgh in northern Adelaide at the height of the fire. From either base, they were flying sorties to both South Australia and to western Victoria. The fire in total had blackened more than 12,500 hectares (31,000 acres) of forest and grazing land, including 35 hectares (86 acres) of vineyards[38] stretching a total perimeter of 224 kilometres (139\u00a0mi).[4] A number of native wildlife, livestock and family pets perished in the blaze.[39]"

On Chuuk, the highest 24-hour precipitation total was 506\u00a0mm (19.9\u00a0in), which was greater than the average monthly total. The rain produced floods up to 1.5\u00a0m (4.9\u00a0ft) deep, causing landslides across the island that killed 47\u00a0people. There was also one death on nearby Pohnpei, and damage in the FSM totaled over $100\u00a0million.[nb 1] After affecting the FSM, Chataan began a northwest track as an intensifying typhoon. Its eye passed just north of Guam on July\u00a04, though the eyewall moved across the island and dropped heavy rainfall. Totals were highest in southern Guam, peaking at 536\u00a0mm (21.1\u00a0in). Flooding and landslides from the storm severely damaged or destroyed 1,994\u00a0houses. Damage on the island totaled $60.5\u00a0million, and there were 23\u00a0injuries. The typhoon also affected Rota in the Northern Marianas Islands with gusty winds and light rainfall. Typhoon Chataan attained its peak intensity of 175\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph) on July\u00a08. It weakened while turning to the north, and after diminishing to a tropical storm Chataan struck eastern Japan on July\u00a010. High rainfall, peaking at 509\u00a0mm (20.0\u00a0in), flooded 10,270\u00a0houses. Damage in Japan totaled about $500\u00a0million. The name Chataan means \"rainy day\" in the Chamorro language, which is spoken on Guam.[1] The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) named the storm Gloria while the typhoon was in the vicinity of the country.[2]"

        "content": "On June\u00a027, 2002, the monsoon trough spawned a tropical disturbance southwest of Pohnpei.[3] The system rapidly organized that day, and at 2000\u00a0UTC the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)[nb 2] issued a tropical cyclone formation alert.[5] Early on June\u00a028, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA)[nb 3] classified the system as a tropical depression near the Mortlock Islands in the Federated States of Micronesia;[6] around the same time, the JTWC also initiated storm advisories.[3] Early on June\u00a029, the JTWC upgraded the system to Tropical Storm 08W,[3] and shortly thereafter the JMA named the system Tropical Storm Chataan.[6] After moving northwestward, the storm turned to the east, resuming a northwest track on June\u00a030 due to a subtropical ridge to the north. The track was erratic because the storm had not yet separated from the monsoon trough.[5][6] By June\u00a030, Chataan had steadily strengthened to severe tropical storm status, with 10-minute maximum sustained winds of 95\u00a0km/h (59\u00a0mph).[6] Only July\u00a01, the system's circulation became broad, with most of the convection located west of the center.[3] The next day, Chataan briefly weakened to an intensity of 85\u00a0km/h (53\u00a0mph), although it began strengthening steadily on July\u00a03,[6] when its center passed very near Weno in Chuuk State in the FSM. At 1800\u00a0UTC that night, the JTWC upgraded Chataan to a typhoon,[3] and about 24\u00a0hours later the JMA followed suit while the storm was approaching Guam from the southeast.[6] At about 2130\u00a0UTC on July\u00a04, the eye of Chataan moved across northern Guam in about two hours, although the center of the eye passed north of the island.[3] After affecting Guam, Chataan continued toward the northwest and gradually intensified. At 0000\u00a0UTC on July\u00a08, the typhoon reached its peak intensity of 175\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph) 10-minute sustained) while located near the Japanese island of Okinotorishima.[6] The JTWC assessed that Chataan had reached its peak intensity of 240\u00a0km/h (150\u00a0mph) 1-minute sustained) about six hours earlier; on that basis, the agency classified the system as a super typhoon. On July\u00a08, Chataan turned toward the north around the subtropical ridge while maintaining its peak winds for about 18\u00a0hours.[5] On July\u00a09 the typhoon turned to the northeast, and late that day it weakened to a severe tropical storm. At around 1530\u00a0UTC on July\u00a010, Chataan made landfall on the B\u014ds\u014d Peninsula in Honshu with winds of about 100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph) 10-minute sustained). The storm briefly moved offshore before making a second landfall on eastern Hokkaido at 1200\u00a0UTC on July\u00a011;[6] this marked the first occasion of a July landfall on the island in 28\u00a0years.[7] A few hours later, Chataan became an extratropical cyclone in the Sea of Okhotsk, where the remnants stalled before dissipating on July\u00a013 near Sakhalin.[6]"

        "content": "While Chataan was in its formative stages and still tied to the monsoon trough, it produced a large area of heavy rainfall and strong winds that affected Pohnpei and Chuuk in the FSM. The storm passed very near Chuuk with wind gusts of 82\u00a0km/h (51\u00a0mph). In the day before Chataan affected the island, it dropped torrential rainfall due to its elongated structure and slow movement. Persistent winds from the larger monsoon trough generated high surf and tides of 0.3\u00a0m (0.98\u00a0ft) above normal across the region. The most significant effects were from the rainfall, peaking at 954\u00a0mm (37.6\u00a0in) at the Chuuk Weather Service Office over 13\u00a0days. The highest 24-hour total was 506\u00a0mm (19.9\u00a0in) on Weno Island, of which 361\u00a0mm (14.2\u00a0in) fell in 12\u00a0hours;[3] this was greater than the average monthly rainfall total for the station.[8] High winds downed power lines on Chuuk,[9] while surf destroyed seawalls and buildings along the coast.[10] The rains causes severe flooding across the island that reached 1.5\u00a0m (4.9\u00a0ft) in some locations,[11] triggering at least 30\u00a0mudslides that killed 47\u00a0people. This represented the deadliest natural disaster in the island's recorded history.[3] The landslides reached a depth of 4.6\u00a0m (15\u00a0ft), which destroyed several homes made of tin and concrete. Many people were buried by the landslides or washed into the ocean.[9] Saltwater flooding contaminated the groundwater and destroyed much of the island's crops.[9][10] Chataan damaged roads and bridges, and high winds downed power lines,[11] which cut communications between islands.[12] Across Chuuk, the storm destroyed about 1,000\u00a0homes and left about 1,000\u00a0people homeless.[9] About 100\u00a0people were injured.[10] In nearby Pohnpei state, Chataan produced 72\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph) winds in Nukuoro.[3] The winds destroyed a house and a weather station.[9] Rainfall on the atoll reached 457\u00a0mm (18.0\u00a0in). High winds, surf, and rain also affected Sapwuafik.[3] Rough seas killed a person on Pohnpei. Crop damage in the country totaled $3\u00a0million, and overall property damage was estimated at $100\u00a0million, mostly on Chuuk.[9]"

The highest sustained winds were estimated at 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph), with gusts to 167\u00a0km/h (104\u00a0mph) at Andersen Air Force Base. Gusts were slightly higher at Apra Harbor, peaking at 170\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph), and gusts may have reached as high as 200\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph). Similar to its effects on Chuuk, Chataan dropped heavy rainfall on Guam,[3] peaking at 536\u00a0mm (21.1\u00a0in) on Mount Almagosa; the same station reported 311\u00a0mm (12.2\u00a0in) in about three hours.[13] The Weather Forecast Office on the island reported 265\u00a0mm (10.4\u00a0in) in a 24-hour period.[3] The rains were less than 250\u00a0mm (9.8\u00a0in) in northern Guam, and were highest in the mountainous southern region where the eye crossed.[13] While moving across the island, Chataan produced a significant storm surge that peaked at about 3.6\u00a0m (12\u00a0ft) in Umatac.[3] High winds caused damage across Guam, mostly to roofs and to poorly built or wooden structures.[3] A total of 1,996\u00a0houses were severely damaged or destroyed.[9] Better constructed homes fared well during the storm, and there was little window damage. The winds also downed power lines,[3] leaving an island-wide power outage. John F. Kennedy High School sustained damage to its football field and library.[9] The most significant effects were from the heavy rainfall, resulting in landslides in some areas and causing rivers to flow at above-normal rates; 14\u00a0stations reported either record flow rates or peak crests, including an island-wide peak crest of 8.55\u00a0m (28.1\u00a0ft) at the mouth of the Tolaeyuus River.[13] Two water gauges were destroyed during the storm.[14] Swollen rivers damaged roads, washed away trees, and caused erosion. The storm flooding contaminated Fena Lake, which provides water to the military base, for a few days.[3][13] In addition, 34 of the island's 110\u00a0water wells failed due to the storm. Flooding also destroyed a building and damaged the runway at Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport, and damaged a bridge near Inarajan.[9] A few palm trees fell due to the soil being loosened, either from heavy rains or high waves. Some of the downed trees struck cars, but the winds were not strong enough to overturn any vehicles. In the higher elevations of Guam, some areas experienced heavy crop damage due to strong winds; however, crop damage in general was less than expected,[3] estimated at $500,000. In Apra Harbor, high seas washed ashore or sank five boats, and a Navy barge spilled 397,000\u00a0litres (105,000\u00a0gallons) of oil. Overall, Chataan caused about $60\u00a0million in property damage on Guam, and there were 23\u00a0injuries, none of them serious.[9]"

Rainfall was much less than elsewhere in the typhoon's path, and a 24-hour total of 38.6\u00a0mm (1.52\u00a0in) was reported at Rota's airport.[3] The storm inflicted heavy damage to crops and fisheries, and 60% of farmers reported a total loss. Chataan also damaged roads on the island, many due to fallen trees. Nine huts were destroyed, and damage was estimated at $2.7\u00a0million.[9] Energy from the typhoon enhanced monsoonal moisture over the Philippines,[15] in conjunction with Tropical Storm Nakri. The two storms contributed to heavy rainfall that triggered floods and landslides,[16] which closed roads and highways.[17] High waves killed three people after a boat overturned.[18] The storm destroyed 566\u00a0houses and damaged another\u00a02,363. A total of 31,813\u00a0people evacuated to 184\u00a0government-opened shelters.[19] Officials canceled classes during the system; several schools were used as temporary shelters.[20] Damage totaled over $1.5\u00a0million (\u20b164\u00a0million pesos),[16] and the floods killed 58\u00a0people.[21] The last location Chataan affected was Japan. The typhoon forced the cancellation of 316\u00a0flights[22] and 150\u00a0train trips. The expressway between Shizuoka and Tokyo was closed.[23] At least 396\u00a0schools were closed in the country,[22] and a baseball game between the Yokohama DeNA BayStars and the Yakult Swallows was canceled due to the inclement weather.[24] Toyota temporarily closed most of its factories in the country.[25] Heavy rainfall, peaking at 509\u00a0mm (20.0\u00a0in) in Gifu Prefecture, fell across Japan. The rains flooded 10,270\u00a0houses in the country,[26] resulting in evacuation orders for about 145,000\u00a0people.[27] The floods damaged roads in 338\u00a0locations, and at least 10\u00a0bridges were destroyed.[28] About 15,000\u00a0evacuees were in Ogaki after a river exceeded its banks.[5] High rainfall caused hundreds of landslides,[15] two of which resulted in a death.[29] Floods killed at least three people.[15] Winds from the typhoon peaked at 97\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph) at Hachij\u014d-jima.[26] High winds in Sakai, Osaka damaged 20\u00a0houses.[22] In Tokyo, the storm produced light winds and rains, despite passing within 102\u00a0km (63\u00a0mi).[5] Chataan destroyed 21\u00a0homes and damaged 239\u00a0others to some degree. During its passage, the typhoon destroyed 258.6\u00a0km2 (99.8\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of crops. The typhoon killed six people, left one person missing, and injured 30\u00a0others. Overall damage in Japan totaled about $500\u00a0million (\u00a559\u00a0billion 2002\u00a0JPY).[nb 4][26] During the storm, Yahoo!

        "content": "After Chataan affected Chuuk state, the island's residents were in need of food, clothes and medicine. Only a few crops were not destroyed by the storm; much of the breadfruit was stripped from the trees, and fruit not destroyed by the storm were damaged by parasites.[9] In the days after the storm, the local Red Cross deployed about 100\u00a0volunteers to search for victims buried by landslides.[8] However, rescue operations were hampered by persistent flooding after the storm.[12] Initially the death toll was unknown, and it was feared that hundreds of people had been killed.[8] Six people who were seriously injured on Chuuk were flown to The Queen's Medical Center in Hawaii for treatment; they were initially scheduled to fly to Guam Memorial Hospital, but the facility was full.[32] About 2,000\u00a0residents affected by the storm evacuated to government-run shelters.[11] The Red Cross shipped various relief supplies, including raincoats and water, to the affected areas.[8] By July\u00a04, power systems were restored and the airport reopened. Although there was enough food in the immediate aftermath, the destruction of crops and cattle posed a long-term food shortage.[12] On July\u00a03 while Chataan was passing the region, the governor of Chuuk declared a state of emergency,[10] requesting international assistance.[12] On July\u00a09, the government of Japan sent $87,000 (\u00a510\u00a0million) worth of supplies to Micronesia, including 1,000\u00a0blankets and 10\u00a0electric generators.[33][34] Two days later, United States President George W. Bush declared the island as a disaster area.[35] This was six days after FSM President Leo Falcam sent the disaster declaration to the US president, although Falcam had improperly filed the paperwork. Because the FSM is in a Compact of Free Association and not a U.S. state, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) could not provide immediate assistance. During the delay, a group of doctors from Guam flew to Chuuk to provide medical assistance.[36] On July\u00a011, the government of Israel sent $5,000 worth of medicine to the FSM.[37] The next day, Caritas Australia sent $20,000 worth of water and food.[38] Residents from elsewhere in the FSM sent clothes and food. The Australian government sent $10,000 to replenish emergency supplies, and the International Red Cross released about $20,000 for immediate relief.[33] The government of China sent $30,000 worth of aid.[39] On July\u00a030, FEMA announced that residents and business owners in Chuuk could apply for individual assistance, including money for housing, repairing damage, and low-interest loans.[40] The declaration would not apply to outer islands in Chuuk, which did not sustain significant damage; this is because FEMA only had funds to restore areas to how they were before the storm.[41] Ultimately, FEMA provided 93,000\u00a0L (25,000\u00a0US\u00a0gal) of water, 1,300\u00a0blankets, 45,360\u00a0km (100,000\u00a0lbs) of rice, 11,328\u00a0meals ready to eat, and various other supplies.[42] In total, the agency allocated $10.6\u00a0million, mostly in the form of individual assistance that provided money for purchasing lost supplies.[43] FEMA ultimately sent just under $5\u00a0million to Chuuk after Chataan, as well as subsequent typhoons Pongsona and Lupit; however, about $445,000 of the funding was believed to have been misspent due to discrepancies discovered in an audit in 2006.[44] In the days after the storm, thousands of people on Guam evacuated to the 15\u00a0government shelters set up in schools across the island; the total reached 3,947\u00a0people on July\u00a010.[9] The governor of Guam declared a state of emergency after the storm,[5] and on July\u00a06 President Bush declared the island a major disaster area; this allocated federal funding to assist in removing debris and other emergency services.[45] A week later, the declaration was extended to include individual assistance for anyone who experienced damage from the storm.[46] The Fena Lake reservoir experienced excess silt deposit after excessive rainfall from Chataan, which prevented water distribution from the facility; on July\u00a019\u00a0\u2013 fifteen days after the typhoon's landfall\u00a0\u2013 water production resumed.[9] Before the facility reopened, the Guam Waterworks Authority distributed water to the island at differing times of the day to ration the limited supply.[47] However, by a month after the storm, residents were still required to boil water as a precaution.[48] About five days after Chataan struck Guam, Typhoon Halong affected the island and caused further power outages.[49] Some areas on the island remained without power for over a week, due to electric workers restoring the main transmission lines before fixing individual lines.[47] By July\u00a019, 23% of those who lost power still were without electricity, mostly in outlying areas. By that date, trash collection was restored, and government-opened shelters were closed.[50] Later in July, flooding washed debris from Chataan and clogged two rivers.[9] The oil spill in Apra Harbor was cleaned at three of seven affected locations by August\u00a019.[48] In the months after the storm, tourism decreased further after a decline that began after the September 11 attacks.[51] Ultimately, FEMA provided $73\u00a0million in assistance to the territory, including $10\u00a0million in housing checks to 5,947\u00a0people and $6.5\u00a0million worth of food stamps for 79,814\u00a0people. The agency provided $10\u00a0million for debris removal and rebuilding public buildings.[52] In December 2002, Typhoon Pongsona struck Guam and caused additional flooding and damage.[14]  On August\u00a07, President George W. Bush also declared Rota to be a disaster area, which provided funding for debris removal.[53]"

Koinu, a replacement name for Tembin which means puppy or Canis Minor in Japanese, was the fourteenth named storm and ninth typhoon of the 2023 Pacific typhoon season. Koinu originated from an area of low pressure near Guam that generally moved westward into the Philippine Sea, where it was upgraded into a depression. Koinu later underwent rapid intensification and became a Category\u00a03-equivalent typhoon. The storm then weakened before intensifying to attain its peak intensity as a category\u00a04-equivalent typhoon. Koinu passed close by Lanyu then made landfall over Hengchun, Taiwan."

        "content": "On September 27, a low-pressure area formed near Guam, with the JTWC indicating the potential development of a tropical cyclone. It moved westward into the Philippine Sea until it entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility, where it was later upgraded into a tropical depression and gained the name Jenny by the PAGASA.[1] A Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert was then issued for Jenny as it began to show signs of further organization. Hours later, JTWC gave its identifier 14W at 13:00 UTC (21:00 PHT). On September 28, JMA upgraded 14W into a tropical storm and attained the name Koinu, which replaced the name Tembin. PAGASA later followed suit at their 5 AM PHT bulletin, also upgrading Jenny into a tropical storm; JTWC followed thereafter. Koinu moved west northwestward in the Philippine Sea whilst having its low-level circulation exposed due to wind shear. Koinu then later organized further, and by the next day, the JMA upgraded Koinu into a severe tropical storm. As usual, the PAGASA followed suit a few hours later. Koinu later gradually intensified into a Category 1 typhoon by the JTWC. The other agencies also followed suit in upgrading Koinu into a typhoon as an eye began to form. Koinu then began a period of rapid intensification by the evening of October 1 into the early morning hours, intensifying to become a low-end Category 4 typhoon whilst it developed a clear eye as it moved east of Cagayan before weakening slightly. Koinu weakened to Category 2 strength yet rebounded its intensity and reached Category 4 again whilst nearing Taiwan and moving west northwestward. Koinu passed dangerously close to Lanyu, and making its first landfall on mainland Hengchun, Taiwan, later weakening into a Category 3 storm as it did so.[2] Koinu then weakened into a Category 1 after slamming into Taiwan and later exited the PAR into the South China Sea.[3] Contrary to forecasts, Koinu unexpectedly restrengthened back into a Category 2, reforming a clear visible eye surrounded by a powerful eyewall. Koinu further intensified, regaining Category 3 status east of Guangdong. After re-intensifying, Koinu weakened again for the last time, as it started to move west-northwestward. Dry air intrusion and land interaction continued to weaken the system into a tropical storm on October 9. Afterwards, it weakened to a tropical depression before reaching the Leizhou Peninsula into the Gulf of Tonkin. Both agencies ceased their advisories as Koinu weakened into a remnant low on October 10."

A weather station on Orchid Island recorded gusts of winds of 198.7 kilometres per hour (123.5\u00a0mph) at 9:40 p.m. and gusts of 342.7 kilometres per hour (212.9\u00a0mph) 13 minutes later, both representing record-highs since record-keeping began in 1897.[8] Many trees fell down on roads and damaged infrastructure. A landslide occurred on Provincial Highway No. 9 in Pingtung County forcing vehicles to drive on the same lane, while 2 roads in Taitung County, Provincial Highway 20 in Haiduan Township and Provincial Highway 23 in Donghe Township were blocked.[9] Agricultural losses in Taiwan were about NT$344.56 million (US$10.72 million), according to the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA).

        "content": " The Black Friday bushfires of 13 January 1939, in Victoria, Australia, were part of the devastating 1938\u20131939 bushfire season in Australia, which saw bushfires burning for the whole summer, and ash falling as far away as New Zealand. It was calculated that three-quarters of the State of Victoria was directly or indirectly affected by the disaster, while other Australian states and the Australian Capital Territory were also badly hit by fires and extreme heat. This was the third-deadliest bushfire event in Australian history, only behind the 1983 Ash Wednesday bushfires and the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires.[1] Fires burned  almost 2,000,000 hectares (4,900,000 acres) of land in Victoria, where 71 people were killed, and several towns were entirely obliterated. Over 1,300 homes and 69 sawmills were burned, and 3,700 buildings were destroyed or damaged.[2] In response, the Victorian state government convened a Royal Commission that resulted in major changes in forest management. The Royal Commission noted that \"it appeared the whole State was alight on Friday, 13 January 1939\".[3] New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory also faced severe fires during the 1939 season. Destructive fires burned from the NSW South Coast, across the ranges and inland to Bathurst, while Sydney was ringed by fires which entered the outer suburbs, and fires raged towards the new capital at Canberra.[4] South Australia was also struck by the Adelaide Hills bushfires."

        "content": "Eastern Australia is one of the most fire-prone regions of the world, with predominant eucalypt forests that have evolved to thrive on the phenomenon of bushfire.[5] However, the 1938-9 bushfire season was exacerbated by a period of extreme heat, following several years of drought. Extreme heatwaves were accompanied by strong northerly winds, after a very dry six months.[6] In the days preceding the fires, the Victorian state capital, Melbourne, experienced some of its hottest temperatures on record at the time: 43.8\u00a0\u00b0C (110.8\u00a0\u00b0F) on 8 January and 44.7\u00a0\u00b0C (112.5\u00a0\u00b0F) on 10 January. On 13 January, the day of the fires, temperatures reached 45.6\u00a0\u00b0C (114.1\u00a0\u00b0F), which stood as the hottest day officially recorded in Melbourne for the next 70 years. (Unofficial records show temperatures of around 47\u00a0\u00b0C (117\u00a0\u00b0F) were reported on the Black Thursday fires of 6 February 1851).[7] The subsequent Victorian Royal Commission investigation of the fires recorded that Victoria had not seen such dry conditions for more than two decades, and its rich plains lay \"bare and baking; and the forest, from the foothills to the alpine heights, were tinder\". The people who made their lives in the bush were worried by the dry conditions, but \"had not lived long enough\" to imagine what was to come: \" the most disastrous forest calamity the State of Victoria has known.\" Fires had been burning separately across Victoria through December, but reached a new intensity  and \"joined forces in a terrible confluence of flame...\".[2]:\u200aIntroduction - Part 1\u200aon Friday, 13 January."

The Acheron, Tanjil and Thomson Valleys and the Grampians, were also hit. Five townships \u2013 Hill End, Narbethong, Nayook West, Noojee (apart from the Hotel), Woods Point \u2013 were completely destroyed and not all were rebuilt afterwards. The towns of Omeo, Pomonal, Warrandyte (though this is now a suburb of Melbourne, it was not in 1939) and Yarra Glen were also badly damaged.[citation needed] The Stretton Royal Commission wrote:[2]:\u200aIntroduction - Part 1 \"On [13 January] it appeared that the whole State was alight. At midday, in many places, it was dark as night. Men carrying hurricane lamps, worked to make safe their families and belongings. Travellers on the highways were trapped by fires or blazing fallen trees, and perished. Throughout the land there was daytime darkness... Steel girders and machinery were twisted by heat as if they had been of fine wire. Sleepers of heavy durable timber, set in the soil, their upper surfaces flush with the ground, were burnt through... Where the fire was most intense the soil was burnt to such a depth that it may be many years before it shall have been restored...\" An area of almost two\u00a0million hectares (four point nine\u00a0million acres) burned, 71 people killed, and whole townships wiped out, along with many sawmills and thousands of sheep, cattle and horses. According to Forest Management Victoria, during the bushfires of 13 January 1939: \"[F]lames leapt large distances, giant trees were blown out of the ground by fierce winds and large pieces of burning bark (embers) were carried for kilometres ahead of the main fire front, starting new fires in places that had not previously been affected by flames... The townships of Warrandyte, Yarra Glen, Omeo and Pomonal were badly damaged. Intense fires burned on the urban fringe of Melbourne in the Yarra Ranges east of Melbourne, affecting towns including Toolangi, Warburton and Thomson Valley. The alpine towns of Bright, Cudgewa and Corryong were also affected, as were vast areas in the west of the state, in particular Portland, the Otway Ranges and the Grampians. The bushfires also affected the Black Range, Rubicon, Acheron, Noojee, Tanjil Bren, Hill End, Woods Point, Matlock, Erica, Omeo, Toombullup and the Black Forest. Large areas of state forest, containing giant stands of Mountain Ash and other valuable timbers, were killed. Approximately 575,000 hectares of reserved forest, and 780,000 hectares of forested Crown land were burned. The intensity of the fire produced huge amounts of smoke and ash, with reports of ash falling as far away as New Zealand\"."

        "content": "The subsequent Royal Commission, under Judge Leonard Edward Bishop Stretton (known as the Stretton Inquiry), attributed blame for the fires to careless burning, campfires, graziers, sawmillers and land clearing. Prior to 13 January 1939, many fires were already burning. Some of the fires started as early as December 1938, but most of them started in the first week of January 1939. Some of these fires could not be extinguished. Others were left unattended or, as Judge Stretton wrote, the fires were allowed to burn \"under control\", as it was falsely and dangerously called. Stretton declared that most of the fires were lit by the \"hand of man\".[2][8] Stretton's Royal Commission has been described as one of the most significant inquiries in the history of Victorian public administration.[9] As a consequence of Judge Stretton's scathing report, the Forests Commission Victoria gained additional funding and took responsibility for fire protection on all public land including State forests, unoccupied Crown Lands and National Parks, plus a buffer extending one mile beyond their boundaries on to private land. Its responsibilities grew in one leap from 2.4 to 6.5\u00a0million hectares (5.9 to 16.1\u00a0million acres). Stretton's recommendations officially sanctioned and encouraged the common bush practice of controlled burning to minimise future risks.[2] Its recommendations led to sweeping changes, including stringent regulation of burning and fire safety measures for sawmills, grazing licensees and the general public, the compulsory construction of dugouts at forest sawmills, increasing the forest roads network and firebreaks, construction of forest dams, fire towers and RAAF aerial patrols linked by the Commissions radio network VL3AA[10] to ground observers.[2] The Commission's communication systems were regarded at the time as being more technically advanced than those of the police and the military. These pioneering efforts were directed by Geoff Weste.[11] Victoria's forests were devastated to an extent that was unprecedented within living memory, and the impact of the 1939 bushfires dominated management thought and action for much of the next ten years.[12] Salvage of fire-killed timber became an urgent and dominant task that was still consuming the resources and efforts of the Forests Commission a decade and a half later. It was estimated that over 6 million cubic meters of timber needed to be salvaged. This massive task was made more difficult by labour shortages caused by the Second World War. In fact, there was so much material that some of the logs were harvested and stockpiled in huge dumps in creek beds and covered with soil and treeferns to stop them from cracking, only to be recovered many years later.[11] Further major fires later in the 1943\u201344 Victorian bushfire season and another Royal Commission by Judge Stretton were key factors in the founding of the Country Fire Authority (CFA) for fire suppression on rural land.[9] Prior to the creation of the CFA the Forests Commission had, to some extent, been supporting the individual volunteer brigades that had formed across rural Victoria in the preceding decades.[9] The environmental effects of the fires continued for many years and some of the burnt dead trees still remain today. Large areas of animal habitat were destroyed. In affected areas, the soil took decades to recover from the damage of the fires. In some areas, water supplies were contaminated for some years afterwards due to ash and debris washing into catchment areas."

In mid-January, Sydney was ringed to the north, south and west by bushfires - from Palm Beach and Port Hacking to the Blue Mountains.[6] Following the weekend of Black Friday, The Argus reported that on 15 January, fierce winds had also spread fire to almost every important area of New South Wales, burning in major fronts on Sydney's suburban fringes and hitting the south coast and inland: \"hundreds of houses and thousands of head of stock and poultry were destroyed and thousands of acres of grazing land\".[13] On 16 January, The Sydney Morning Herald reported that disastrous fires were burning in Victoria, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory as the climax to the terrible heatwave: Sydney faced record heat and was ringed to the north, south and west by bushfires from Palm Beach and Port Hacking to the Blue Mountains, with fires blazing at Castle Hill, Sylvania, Cronulla and French's Forest.[4][6] Disastrous fires were reported at Penrose, Wollongong, Nowra, Bathurst, Ulludulla, Mittagong, Trunkey and Nelligen.[4] Canberra was facing the \"worst bushfires\" it had experienced, with thousands of acres burned out and a 72-kilometre (45\u00a0mi) fire front was driven towards the city by a south westerly gale, destroying pine plantations and many homesteads, and threatening Mount Stromlo Observatory, Government House, and Black Mountain. Large numbers of men were sent to stand by government buildings in the line of fire. While five deaths in New South Wales were reported, in Victoria the death toll had reached more than sixty.[4] In South Australia, the Adelaide Hills bushfires also swept the state, destroying dozens of buildings.[14]"

The deadly pattern continued with more major fires on Black Sunday on 14 February 1926 sees the tally rise to sixty lives being lost and widespread damage to farms, homes and forests. Considered in terms of both loss of property and loss of life the 1939 fires were one of the worst disasters, and certainly the worst bushfire event, to have occurred in Australia up to that time. Only the subsequent Ash Wednesday bushfires in 1983 and the Black Saturday bushfires in 2009 resulted in more deaths.[citation needed] In terms of the total area burnt, the 1974\u201375 fires burned 117\u00a0million hectares (290\u00a0million acres), equivalent to 15% of Australia's land.;[16] the Black Friday fires burned up 2\u00a0million hectares (4.9\u00a0million acres), with the Black Thursday fires of 1851 having burnt an estimated 5\u00a0million hectares (12\u00a0million acres)."

Five days later, the JTWC issued their first warning on the system as Tropical Depression 02W as the nascent system began coalescing.[1] On April 18, the system entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility, resulting in the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) naming the system Atang.[2] Later that day, the system intensified into a tropical storm, resulting in it being named Olive. Soon after, Olive crossed the Leyte Gulf and the Philippine Islands, which hindered intensification.[1] Olive would steadily intensify after it entered the South China Sea on April 20, being in an environment with good outflow aloft and warm Sea surface temperatures, resulting in it intensifying into a typhoon on 6:00 UTC on April 22. Olive would recurve due to a break in the subtropical ridge, peaking with sustained winds of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) the next day. Olive would accelerate to the east-northeast, steadily weakening due to intruding cool and dry air, resulting in the system becoming extratropical early on April 26.[1]"

One house was destroyed, and the area burnt exceeded 650 hectares (1,600 acres).[2] It began at about 2:30p.m. on Thursday 9 May amid unseasonably warm weather when a private burn-off north of Cherryville became out of control and began to burn east into inaccessible country.[3] Warm temperatures, high winds, and heavy fuel loads contributed to the spread of the fire. Firefighters were initially unable to fight the fire directly, due to the inaccessibility of the terrain.[1] Firefighters eventually managed to contain the fire around 5p.m. on 11 May, assisted by a change in the weather which brought approximately 10mm of rain.[4] The fire was notable in that it began over a week after the official fire-ban season ended. This prompted calls for the season to be extended into May; the Government announced on 12 May that a review of the policy would be conducted. However, concerns were raised that this would limit the ability of residents and the CFS to conduct fuel-reduction burns.[5][6]"

[1] Early the next day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) designated the disturbance as a tropical depression, with PAGASA assigning the local name of Cosme. [2][3] However the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) did not issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert until later that day. [4] The JTWC then designated the depression as 05W on May\u00a015. [5] On May\u00a016, both the JMA and the JTWC upgraded the depression to a tropical storm with the JMA designating it as Tropical Storm Halong and assigning the international number of 0804.[6][7] This was 12\u00a0hours after PAGASA had upgraded it to a tropical storm. [8] During that day Halong kept intensifying and was designated as a severe tropical storm early the next day by the JMA as it reached its peak wind speeds of 60\u00a0knots (70\u00a0mph 115\u00a0km/h). [9]  The JTWC then upgraded Halong to a typhoon with peak wind speeds of 70\u00a0knots (80\u00a0mph 130\u00a0km/h)) which made Halong a Category\u00a0one typhoon on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale.[1] Later on May\u00a017, Halong made landfall on the Philippine region of Pangasinan and travelled towards the northeast over Luzon.  While over land Halong weakened into a tropical storm with both the JTWC and the JMA downgrading Halong early the next day.[1][9] Later that day after reaching the Philippine Sea, Halong started to strengthen and intensify into a severe tropical storm.[9] However, it did not intensify any further, and on May\u00a019, weakened into a tropical storm. [9] Later that day, PAGASA issued their final advisory on Halong, as it moved out of their area of responsibility. The JTWC then issued their last advisory on Halong as it had begun its extratropical transition. The JMA then reported that it had completed its extratropical transition and issued their final advisory on the remnant low of Halong. The remnants of Halong dissipated on May\u00a024.[9]"

Most of the damages reported were in Northern Luzon.[13] Meanwhile, Mindoro and Panay islands were also affected as the storm-induced southwest monsoon brought rains and floods to those areas. In particular, a ferry in Mindoro was stranded as Cosme (still a tropical depression at that time) passed close enough to Mindoro on the night of May 15.[14] The Subic-Olongapo area, one of the economic zones of the Philippines, experienced power outages as the storm got closer to Zambales on May 17.[15] The province of Pangasinan, where the storm made its landfall, experienced waist-high floods and power outages as well.[16] Even the city of Dagupan (in Pangasinan) suffered the same fate with even stranded persons all over the city due to flooding.[17] The town of Sta. Cruz in Zambales had about 7,000 people homeless due to Cosme.[18] Overall, the hardest hit were Pangasinan and Zambales provinces.[19] Because the damage caused by the storm in Zambales is extensive even in infrastructure, repair was forced to be done on schools there as that time, classes are to resume in the next few weeks.[20] The storm also increased the prices of vegetables in Metro Manila, as the latter gets most of its vegetables from Northern Luzon.[21] Many places were flooded like what happened from Typhoon Ketsana. According to the final report on Cosme (Halong) released by the National Disaster Coordinating Council, 61 were reported killed, 33 wounded and three were left missing. People affected by Cosme numbered 1,496,635 persons in 1,510 barangays in five provinces. Damages to property totaled to PHP 4.712\u00a0billion, of PHP 3.721\u00a0billion were agricultural losses and PHP 992 million were destroyed infrastructure.[22] Pangasinan was the most damaged province as indicated by the report."

The bushfires in Warragamba were part of the longest official continuous bushfire emergency in NSW taking place between 21 December 2001 and 13 January 2002 and spreading across the state. Most of these fires were caused by lightning or arsonists. The fire behaviour was unusual in many areas due to extreme dryness of fuel and variable winds. The initial destruction in Warragamba and the Hawkesbury River area prompted a natural disaster declaration by the State Government.[1] On Christmas Day of 2001 over four thousand firefighters were battling over one hundred blazes across the state. A band of fire running from Campbelltown, New South Wales east to the coast was the firefighters main concern. This was the firefront that caused the damage to Warragamba and neighbouring town Silverdale, New South Wales as the fire sped sixty kilometres in six hours from the Lower Blue Mountains to the coast around Helensburgh, New South Wales.[2] Areas further south, such as the area around St. George's Basin and Jervis Bay were heavily affected by fires caused by stray embers from the main front, with many homes in the area being destroyed. Many local residents of the townships under threat battled the fires with garden hoses, as there were not enough fire-fighters.\nOne resident, Father John Evans battled to save the local parish church, only to see his own house burn down.[3] Hundreds of people were forced into an emergency evacuation from Warragamba.[2] The initial loss of electricity affected 4,500 homes in Warragamba and surrounding areas. The local electricity supplier, Integral Energy estimated the cost in the Warragamba and surrounding areas at 3 million dollars.[4] On 26 December 2001, the day after the fires swept through the town, Prime Minister John Howard visited the town and praised the work of volunteer firefighters.[2]"

It strengthened into a typhoon the following day, and Danas still continued to strengthen until it reached its peak with winds of 195 kilometres per hour (120\u00a0mph). It maintained its strength for 18 hours. It then began to head towards Japan. It quickly weakened and made landfall in Japan on September 11. After crossing the eastern portion of Honshu, Danas weakened into a tropical storm. On September 12, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. The name Danas was submitted by the Philippines and is an Austronesian verb meaning to experience or to feel. Danas brought heavy rain to Japan and spawned a tornado.

Convective organization continued to develop on that day, and both the Japan Meteorological Agency and JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical storm, designating it as Danas. Moving westward, due to a subtropical ridge located to its north, Danas rapidly intensified. The JTWC upgraded Danas to a minimal typhoon by 18:00 UTC on September 4, while the JMA did the same six hours later. As the typhoon began moving northward, satellite imagery depicted development of an eye that was small with good convective banding. Due to this, Danas intensified into a Category 2 typhoon. By 06:00 UTC of September 6, Danas reached peak intensity as a Category 4 typhoon; however, post-analysis after the season showed that Danas only peaked as a Category 3 typhoon with 1-minute sustained winds of 195 kilometres per hour (120\u00a0mph). The typhoon continued to keep its intensity for the next 18 hours, until its eye was covered by clouds. Danas headed westward[1] until a mid-latitude trough had weakened the subtropical ridge, causing the storm to move in a north-northeastward direction. The typhoon began to rapidly weaken, and by 00:35 UTC of September 11, Danas had made landfall[2] just to the southwest of Yokosuka. After crossing the eastern portion of Honshu, Danas weakened into a tropical storm.

Satellite imagery depicted an elongated low-level circulation with deep convection centered along the southwestern portion of the system. Strong wind shear, which normally inhibits cyclonic development, provided energy for further convective development around the system.[1] Tracking in a general northwestward direction, the low gradually developed northward outflow due to a tropical upper tropospheric trough (TUTT) located north of the disturbance.[2] Following further development, the Japan Meteorological Agency declared the system as a tropical depression at 0600\u00a0UTC on June\u00a014.[3] Later on June\u00a014, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) for the depression. Deep convection consolidated around the center of circulation and convective banding features developed along the periphery of the system.[4] Several hours later, the TCFA was canceled as the system rapidly degenerated, with convection mostly dissipating and an exposed low. Outflow significantly deteriorated as the system detached itself from the TUTT.[5] By this time, the JMA had ceased advisories on the depression.[6] Two days later, after tracking across Luzon, the system began to regenerate. Convection redeveloped around the low and outflow was reestablished to the south.[7] Early on June\u00a017, the JTWC issued a second TCFA as the system continued to organize.[8] By this time the system was nearly stationary and at 0600\u00a0UTC, the JMA declared that the low had developed into a tropical depression.[9] Several hours later, the JTWC designated the system as Tropical Depression 03W while the storm was situated about 705\u00a0km (440\u00a0mi) south-southwest of Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Little movement took place for the first few days of the storm's existence as weak steering currents were in place over the South China Sea.[10] Following further development of the depression, the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical storm late on June\u00a017.[11] At 0600\u00a0UTC on June\u00a018, the JMA classified the system as a tropical storm and gave it the name Linfa.[12] Limited poleward outflow hindered intensification for the remainder of June\u00a018. By this time, the storm began to increase in forward motion due to a strengthening subtropical ridge located east of Taiwan and a mid-latitude trough to the west.[13] Around 1200\u00a0UTC the following day, Linfa further intensified into a severe tropical storm.[14] A microwave satellite image of the storm depicted an eye-feature surrounded by deep convection.[15] Interacting with a nearby upper-level low, poleward outflow significantly improved late on June\u00a019, fueling further strengthening.[16] Slowly tracking in a general northward direction, Linfa continued to organize and by June\u00a020, the JTWC upgraded Linfa to a typhoon.[17] A small, ragged eye appeared on visible satellite images by this time and several hours later, the storm reached its peak intensity just below typhoon-status according to the JMA. Maximum sustained winds peaked at 110\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph 10-minute winds) and a barometric pressure of 975\u00a0hPa (mbar).[18][19] Later on June\u00a020, convection near the center of circulation began to decrease\u2013an indication of weakening\u2013and the eye was no longer visible. Upper-level wind shear rapidly increased to 55\u00a0km/h (35\u00a0mph), preventing re-intensification of the cyclone.[20] Taking a more northward track than anticipated, Linfa began to interact with land and was downgraded to a tropical storm by the JTWC on June\u00a021.[21][22] Around 1230\u00a0UTC, the storm made landfall in southern Fujian as a tropical storm with winds of 85\u00a0km/h (50\u00a0mph 10-minute winds).[23][24] Deep convection rapidly dissipated shortly thereafter due to interaction with land. Several hours later, the JTWC downgraded Linfa to a tropical depression.[25] The following day, the JMA also downgraded Linfa to a tropical depression as the storm moved away from the Chinese coastline.[26] The system later dissipated just offshore; a circulation was no longer evident on satellite imagery.[27]"

        "content": "Although Linfa was not forecast to directly impact the Philippines, the outer effects of the storm were anticipated to produce increased rainfall and large swells along western facing coastlines.[28] By June\u00a020, the Central Weather Bureau issued extremely heavy rain warnings, indicating 24-hour rainfall totals in excess of 130\u00a0mm (5.1\u00a0in) were anticipated, for most of Taiwan.[29] Beaches throughout Taiwan were closed due to rough seas and local officials inspected all public shelters to ensure they were stocked and prepared to provide for evacuees.[30] Later that day, a level 3 emergency was declared for eastern Guangdong Province and southern Fujian Province. The local governments in the provinces enacted their emergency response plans following this declaration.[31] On June\u00a021, officials in China closed Xiamen port and stated that it would resume operations once the storm passed.[32] Later that day 33,000 vessels sought refuge at port.[33] Following the issuance of a land warning, government offices and schools were closed throughout the island.[34] Officials sent 10 million text messages to residents throughout Fujian Province to warn them about the approaching storm.[35] In Hong Kong, public warning signal number one was raised for nearly 24\u00a0hours as Linfa briefly threatened the city on June\u00a020.[36] Officials also evacuated roughly 160,000 people from coastal areas in Fujian.[37] A total of 167 flights to and from Taiwan were canceled or delayed due to the storm.[38] On June\u00a021, large swells of up to 5.6\u00a0m (18\u00a0ft) caused a 498-tonne oil tanker, the Colombo Queen, to run aground in southern Taiwan. Rescue crews were unable to reach the ship as it was still in the storm.[39][40] Although no fuel was reported to have leaked, the ship struck a coral reef, damaging the coral.[41] Once Linfa passed, rescuers were able to reach the nine crew members on the ship. Officials estimated that it would take over a week to remove all 39,000 litres (8,600\u00a0imp\u00a0gal; 10,000\u00a0US\u00a0gal) of fuel from the tanker.[42] In Taiwan, two people were hit by fallen trees and two monks were struck by a wall that collapsed during a ceremony.[43] Rip currents in Taiwan resulted in one death after a boy went into the water unwatched. Six hikers also went missing. Power to all 505 residences of Chiangchun was also lost during the storm.[38] Average amounts of 150\u00a0mm (5.9\u00a0in) of rain were recorded across southeastern parts of Taiwan on June\u00a021.[44] The highest total was 350\u00a0mm (14\u00a0in) in Taitung.[45] Further rainfall of 150\u00a0mm (5.9\u00a0in) fell on June\u00a022, pushing totals over 450\u00a0mm (18\u00a0in) in isolated areas along southeastern areas.[46] In Kinmen County, 50 trees were downed, six billboards were destroyed and two homes lost their roofs. By June\u00a022, power companies reported that 2,834 residents had lost power in Wuqiu Township for several hours.[46] Severe damage was reported in the agricultural sector in Taiwan, leaving NT$400\u00a0million (US$12.1\u00a0million) in losses.[47] In mainland China, Linfa produced torrential rains, peaking at 488.1\u00a0mm (19.22\u00a0in) and triggering severe flooding.[48] Heavy rains also impacted Hong Kong, where more than 100\u00a0mm (3.9\u00a0in) fell over a three-day span.[49] Following a landslide, one person was killed.[50] Flood waters destroyed 100 homes and inundated 10,000 others as well as an estimated 32,000 hectares of farmland in Fujian Province.[48][51] In Taoyuan Town, a total of 191\u00a0mm (7.5\u00a0in) of rain fell within one hour, breaking a 200-year-old record in the town.[52] In Meizhou, Guongdong Province, flash flooding resulted in five additional fatalities after 413.7\u00a0mm (16.29\u00a0in) of rain fell within a nine-hour span.[53] This rainfall was higher than any recorded amount in the past 100 years in the region.[54] A total of 362 homes were destroyed in the town and infrastructure was severely damaged.[53] Additionally, an estimated 20\u00a0million people were affected by the storm.[55] Damages from Linfa in China amounted to \u00a5641\u00a0million ($93.8\u00a0million).[49]"

The storm developed on October 6, and tracked generally westward throughout its course. After crossing Luzon, the typhoon emerged into the South China Sea and reached its peak intensity, with sustained 10-minute winds of 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph), 1-minute winds of 130\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph), and a minimum barometric pressure of 960 millibars. The storm moved ashore in central Vietnam and dissipated after moving inland. The storm caused extensive damage throughout its course. In the Philippines, Dan left hundreds of thousands homeless and killed 58 people. Power outages were extensive in the Manila region. In Vietnam, the storm's high winds and heavy rains caused extensive damage and loss of life. More than 500,000 structures were damaged or destroyed and at least 43 people were killed across the country."

        "content": "On October 6, 1989, a tropical disturbance formed in the monsoon trough near the island of Chuuk. An advisory by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) assessed the system as having a \"poor\" chance to develop due to strong wind shear in the region.[nb 1] A day later, the potential of development was adjusted to \"fair\". On October 8, the wind shear relented and a well-defined band persisted near the storm's center of circulation. As a result, a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert was issued.[2] That same day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the storm as a tropical depression.[3][nb 2]  At 1200 UTC, the JTWC issued their first warning on Tropical Depression 29W. At the time, it was centered about 70\u00a0mi (110\u00a0km) northeast of Yap.[2] About 18 hours later, the depression was upgraded to a tropical storm and given the name Dan. The cyclone moved westward at 17 to 23\u00a0mph (27 to 37\u00a0km/h), and convection continued to mature. Outflow was good across most of the system, except the northwestern corner where it was restricted by interaction with a nearby typhoon.[2] Due to the cyclone's proximity to the Philippines, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration also monitored the storm, assigning it with the local name Saling.[5] The JMA upgraded it to a tropical storm on October 9; both agencies recognized it as a typhoon the next day after an eye became visible and outflow improved in the northwestern quadrant.[2][3] Dan made landfall on the southeastern coast of Luzon in the Philippines, and its center tracked just south of Ninoy Aquino International Airport.[2] Dan crossed over the island and emerged into the South China Sea, having lost its eye feature and weakened back into a tropical storm. Convection soon redeveloped as the storm moved northwestward through warm waters. The JTWC reports that Dan reattained typhoon status at 0000 UTC on October 12,[2] although according to the JMA it did so 24 hours earlier.[3] The typhoon continued to intensify, and the JTWC estimates that it reached its peak intensity at 0600 UTC, with 1-minute maximum sustained winds of 130\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph).[2] The JMA indicates that Dan peaked slightly afterward, with 10-minute sustained winds of 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure reading of 960 millibars.[3] The storm passed about 70\u00a0mi (110\u00a0km) south of Hainan Island and weakened somewhat. Increased wind shear further deteriorated the system as it approached the coast of Vietnam. The storm moved inland at around 1200 UTC on October 13,[2] at which point the JMA downgraded it to a severe tropical storm and the JTWC issued their final advisory on the disturbance.[2][3] The circulation ultimately dissipated over the mountainous terrain and its remnants continued to move westward into Laos.[2]"

In total, 682,699 people, or 135,245 families, were affected by the typhoon, and 49,972 houses sustained damage.[5] Monetary storm damage is placed at $59.2\u00a0million.[6] The storm triggered flooding and landslides, while high winds, estimated up to 160\u00a0km/h (99\u00a0mph) brought down trees and powerlines.[7] The second typhoon to strike the country within a week, Dan forced schools and government offices to close.[8] Approximately 250,000 people were left homeless,[9] and dozens of fishermen went missing offshore. In the Manila area, near-total power loss was reported.[10] President Corazon Aquino issued a \"state of calamity\" there and in surrounding areas.[9] In the wake of the storm, the nation's military provided $300,000 worth of food for residents in evacuation centers.[6] The Department of Social Welfare and Development also provided $371,000 worth of emergency relief assistance to 2,700 families displaced by the storm.[11] Despite the scale of damage from Dan and other typhoons in the region, no request for international assistance was made by the Philippine Government.[6] As the storm progressed westward, it buffeted Hainan Island with gale-force winds and exacerbated damage caused by Typhoons Angela and Brian.[9] Collectively, the three storms were responsible for 63 fatalities on the island, most of which were attributed to Brian.[12] Damage in Vietnam was also extensive.[2] The high winds, reportedly blowing at 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h), ripped roofs off houses. Large storm tides along the coast pushed flood waters ashore.[13] At least 43 people were killed and another 466 were injured by the storm throughout Vietnam. The most severe damage took place in H\u00e0 T\u0129nh Province where 34 fatalities took place. In the province alone, 43,000 homes were destroyed and another 500,000 were damaged. Extensive flooding across the province submerged 330,000 acres (130,000\u00a0ha) of crops and killed thousands of cattle. In H\u1ea3i H\u01b0ng Province, two people were killed and approximately 60\u00a0percent of the homes were damaged or destroyed. Another seven people perished in Th\u00e1i B\u00ecnh Province due to strong winds.[14]"

It was the fourth depression and the first typhoon of the season. The disturbance dissipated later that day however it regenerated early on April 30 within the southern islands of Luzon. It was then designated as a Tropical Depression during the next morning by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) and the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), with PAGASA assigning the name Dante to the depression. However the JTWC did not designate the system as a depression until early on May 2 which was after the depression had made landfall on the Philippines. Later that day Dante was upgraded to a Tropical Storm and was named as Kujira by the JMA. The cyclone started to rapidly intensify becoming a typhoon early on May 4, and then reaching its peak winds of 155\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph) (10-min), 215\u00a0km/h (135\u00a0mph) (1-min) later that day after a small clear eye had developed.

An upper level anticyclone just to the northwest was enhancing pole ward outflow.[3] During that day the disturbance developed further with improved convective banding in the northern quadrant, however interaction with land was a major hindrance.[4] Early on May 1, the disturbance was designated as a Tropical Depression by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) and the Japan Meteorological Agency, with PAGASA assigning the name Dante to the depression.[5][6] Later that day PAGASA declared that Dante had made landfall on the Bicol Region in Southeastern Luzon.[7] Early the next day the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the disturbance as whilst the low level circulation center had remained slow moving over southeastern Luzon the disturbance had a good outflow with convection starting to improve in terms of organization.[8] Later that morning the JTWC designated the disturbance as Tropical Depression 01W.[9] The Depression was being moved by the reverse oriented monsoon trough with a well formed low level circulation center with deep convective banding wrapping around the northern quadrant despite being close to land.[9][10] Later on May 2, both the JMA and the JTWC upgraded Dante to a Tropical Storm, with the JMA assigning the name of Kujira to the cyclone.[6][10] During the next day Kujira quickly intensified due to favorable sea surface temperatures with the JMA upgrading it to a Severe Tropical Storm later that day, before becoming a Typhoon early on May 4 by both the JMA and the JTWC as animated infrared imagery was showing the development of an eye feature.[6][11][12][13][14] Later that day both the JMA and the JTWC declared that Kujira had reached its peak wind speeds of 155\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph) (10-min) 215\u00a0km/h (135\u00a0mph) (1-min) after Kujira had formed a small round eye.[6][15] PAGASA then released their final advisory as Typhoon Kujira had moved out of the eastern edge of their area of responsibility as the typhoon had started to weaken due to convective banding around the low level circulation center beginning to unravel.[16][17] After moving out of PAGASA's area of responsibility Kujira continued to weaken as it developed a cloud filled eye with the cyclone starting its extra tropical transition during May 6.[18][19] Early the next day the JTWC downgraded Kujira to a Tropical Storm, while the JMA downgraded the typhoon to a severe tropical storm, as it had rapidly lost its vertical organization and was beginning to take on frontal characteristics, a sign that the cyclone was becoming extratropical.[6][20] As a result of this, the JTWC issued its final advisory on Kujira; however, the JMA kept issuing advisories on a weakening Kujira, until the agency downgraded it to an extratropical low later that day.[6][20] The extratropical low that was Kujira was then tracked by the JMA, until early on May 13, when the JMA reported that Kujira had dissipated.[6]"

The outbreak produced 29 tornadoes from Texas to North Carolina, killing 40 people and injuring 491, and causing $140 million in damage. The deadliest storm of the outbreak, as well as in the US in 1994, was an F4 tornado that devastated Piedmont, Alabama.[1] It struck the Goshen United Methodist Church right in the middle of the Palm Sunday service, collapsing the roof on the congregation and killing 20 people inside, including the Rev. Kelly Clem's 4-year-old daughter Hannah. Two other houses of worship were also destroyed mid-service. The supercell that formed this tornado tracked for 200 miles (322\u00a0km) to South Carolina."

        "content": "The SPC started forecasting the outbreak on March 26, highlighting the risk of severe thunderstorms over the area that would eventually be impacted. They issued a \"severe\" forecast for most of the Southern, and some of the Mid-Atlantic states, forecasting \"the potential for supercell storms, along with the possibility of tornadoes.\"[2] By the morning of March 27, it was apparent that a very strong and potent airmass had set up over the Gulf states, with the SPC issuing a moderate risk for most of Alabama, the southern half of Mississippi, and most of Louisiana in their morning outlook. The 6 AM CST (1200 UTC) 500 MB analysis showed a strong southwest flow of near 80 knots over the Southern U.S., while at the 850 MB level, there existed winds of near 50 knots coming out of the state of Louisiana.[3] At the surface, temperatures in Alabama, Mississippi, and Georgia were in the low 70's Fahrenheit, with dewpoints were in the upper 60's to low 70's.[2] CAPE values at Centreville, Alabama were nearing 1,200 j/kg with no cap to speak of. A surface front left by rain during the previous evening was situated over northern parts of Alabama, Mississippi, and Georgia. By 9 AM CST (1500 UTC), thunderstorms and severe weather were not only occurring along the boundary setup by the rain from the previous evening in the northern portions of Alabama and Mississippi, but further to the south as well. At 9:18 AM CST (1518 UTC), the SPC issued a tornado watch for Eastern Mississippi and Northern Alabama. The storms then rapidly intensified, with tornado warnings being issued by the Birmingham and Huntsville NWS offices before 11 AM local time. Both the deadly F4 tornado that struck the Goshen United Methodist Church in Cherokee County and the Marshall County F2 twister formed at about this time.[4] The SPC also issued a PDS Tornado Watch for all of Northern Georgia by 12 PM EST (1700 UTC), with the wording stating, \"This is a particularly dangerous situation with the possibility of very damaging tornadoes. Also, large hail, dangerous lightning and damaging thunderstorm winds can be expected.\" Severe storms and tornadoes tracked into the northern Georgia region by 12:42 EST, and tornadoes continued to track across northern Georgia during the afternoon. During the early-mid afternoon, analysis showed a very unstable airmass over the southern U.S., with CAPE values near 2,500 j/kg and SRH values of near 250 m2/s2 at Jackson, Mississippi. The 1800 UTC Centreville, Alabama sounding showed similar conditions, with CAPE over 2,500 j/kg and SRH values of over 500 m2/s2. This resulted in an Energy Helicity Index (EHI) value of 8.49, which is strongly supportive of tornadic thunderstorms. Based on these soundings, the SPC issued a High Risk for their 1930 UTC outlook, noting a rapidly destabilized atmosphere and winds being much stronger than what was originally forecasted.[5] Noting the presence of a shortwave trough that was tracking into Mississippi and Louisiana as well as rapidly falling pressures in advance of a frontal boundary, the SPC issued a tornado watch for eastern Louisiana and central Mississippi, however, there were no reported tornadoes in this region on March 27. The SPC, seeing that storms were tracking into the Carolinas, issued a tornado watch for portions of the western and central Carolinas, as well as the portion of northeast Georgia not already included in the prior tornado watch. Tornadoes continued to track along this area from the mid-late afternoon, with an F3 tornado striking parts of northeast Georgia and the upstate of South Carolina, injuring 12, and another tornado along the border region of North Carolina and South Carolina injuring 13. In Alabama, tornadoes continued in the central part of the state during the mid-late afternoon. An F1 tornado struck parts of Tuscaloosa County just after 4 PM. Funnel clouds were seen in Hueytown as a storm went over Jefferson County at around 4:30 PM local time. An F2 tornado was produced in Shelby County at 5:30 CST, damaging a high school and a residential neighborhood before destroying two mobile home parks. During the cleanup from the F4 tornado that struck Cherokee County, emergency responders had to take cover as another funnel cloud was spotted just before 6 PM CST. The storms also produced hail up to 3\u00a0in (7.6\u00a0cm) in diameter and winds around 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h). The storm system also left behind extensive flooding in Winston and Walker Counties, with $150,000 worth of damage done to roads and bridges in Walker County. The final tornado of the outbreak was reported just before midnight in Greenville County in South Carolina. The National Weather Service offices in Birmingham, Atlanta, and Athens did not stop issuing warnings until late at night on the 27th or early in the morning on the 28th, issuing 75 tornado warnings and 182 severe weather products overall. Overall, the outbreak of March 27, 1994 was not as synoptically evident as some of the past outbreaks that have occurred, as there was no deep surface low or trough present for forcing in the area where the storms occurred, and many of the ingredients necessary that were the cause of this outbreak were not able to be forecasted until the morning of the event.[6][7]"

With a 45-to-55-mile-per-hour (72 to 89\u00a0km/h) forward speed, the tornado first destroyed buildings east of Ragland before killing a woman on a campground west of Neely Henry Lake. Just prior to entering Calhoun County, the tornado destroyed 18 homes and 20 mobile homes.[8] Upon crossing the north side of Ohatchee the tornado threw a van into a ditch, killing a man inside and injuring three other occupants. After causing the death on U.S. Route 431, it passed through sparsely-populated, wooded land about 4 to 5 miles (6.4 to 8.0\u00a0km) west-northwest of Piedmont. As it passed north of Piedmont, the tornado struck the Goshen United Methodist Church in the former community of Goshen, killing 20 people in the church and injuring 92;[8] some sources say 90 were injured.[17] The tornado also destroyed two nearby churches, but killed no one in their congregations.[18] Parishioners in the Goshen United Methodist Church apparently received no warning[19] while attending services and some were crushed to death as the walls and roof collapsed upon them.[18] An inflow jet caused the south wall\u2014which, being 18 feet (5.5\u00a0m) tall and 60 feet (18\u00a0m) wide, was built solely of masonry block\u2014to collapse inward, so the timber-and-steel gable roof and other walls followed suit, crushing parishioners inside the sanctuary.[17] After striking the church, the tornado continued on and later dissipated 5 miles (8.0\u00a0km) northeast of Rock Run, near the Alabama\u2013Georgia state line. Overall, the tornado killed 22 people.[8]"

Upon touching down, the .125-mile (0.201\u00a0km) wide tornado uprooted large pines and oaks while causing F0 damage to five or six homes of \"mixed brick and wood construction.\"[10] The tornado then moved northeast as it snapped trees before intensifying to F1 strength about 10 miles (16\u00a0km) west of Cartersville. During this, the tornado initially shrunk to .06 miles (0.097\u00a0km) wide, but then widened again to .125 miles (0.201\u00a0km) as it passed through Cassville, with F1 damage primarily to the roofs of 10\u201315 homes. The tornado blew down 20 large trees and damaged power lines in Cassville.[10] Thereafter, the tornado increased greatly in size and intensity as it passed between White and Rydal, with the first and only F4 damage occurring in a rural area 15 miles (24\u00a0km) northwest of Canton. There, the 0.38-mile (0.61\u00a0km) wide tornado leveled \"five two-story brick and wood homes\" to the ground in the Indian Springs subdivision.[10] The tornado also severely damaged eight to 10 other homes and slightly damaged 12\u201315. Overall, the tornado was most destructive at Indian Springs and soon weakened as it continued northeast through wooded lands; however, its path briefly widened.[10] It killed two people in a trailer along Georgia State Route 140 in Bartow County and snapped 80-to-90-foot (24 to 27\u00a0m) tall pine trees nearby. Though the 1-mile (1.6\u00a0km) wide tornado impacted forested areas, it still caused major damage to 10 mobile homes and six permanent homes, as well as damage to four unspecified vehicles.[10] Henceforth, the tornado continued to weaken to F2 intensity and contracted to .75 miles (1.21\u00a0km) wide as it passed into Pickens County, severely damaging 10\u201315 chicken coops along with 20\u201325 homes of brick and wood construction.[10] It killed one more person in a trailer before lifting from the ground about 6 miles (9.7\u00a0km) east-southeast of Jasper. Ultimately, it caused almost $7 million (1994 USD) in losses to properties and businesses in Bartow County alone, with another $1.5 million in losses in adjourning Pickens County.[10] The tornado killed three people and over 500,000 chickens along its track and leveled \"thousands\" of trees, with over $10 million in losses to agricultural interests.[10]"

Though mainly impacting rural areas at first, it badly damaged four wood homes and blew down many trees with resultant F1 damage. The tornado appeared reddish to eyewitnesses as it passed through rugged terrain.[10] As it crossed near SR 100, the tornado produced major roof damage to a few homes and destroyed a pair of chicken coops. Widening to 0.5 miles (0.80\u00a0km) wide, the tornado acquired a multiple vortex structure as residents observed two or three funnels rotating around the main vortex.[10] In southern Floyd County, about 2 miles (3.2\u00a0km) east of Cave Spring, the multiple-vortex tornado snapped trees in half and badly damaged five double-wide mobile homes along with three or four frail wood homes. Afterward, the tornado strengthened to F2 intensity, causing more severe damage to wood homes, but soon contracted in size to .25 miles (0.40\u00a0km) wide and weakened into an F1 tornado.[10] However, as it neared to within 2.5 miles (4.0\u00a0km) southwest of Lindale, it widened yet again and rapidly strengthened into an F3 tornado as it passed through Leawood Estates. There, it reportedly leveled \"fifteen mixed single and two story mixed brick and wood homes of poor construction,\"[10] along with some homes that were being built. The tornado caused 30 injuries, including one of a man who was thrown 1,000 yards (0.57\u00a0mi) into the street across from his home. Residents reported continuous lightning preceding and during the passage of the tornado and were alerted by their dogs barking.[10] Some residents also reported a smaller tornado south of the primary one. After hitting Leawood Estates at maximum intensity, the tornado weakened back into an F2 tornado and shrunk to .25 miles (0.40\u00a0km) wide as it passed 6 miles (9.7\u00a0km) south of Rome. There, it badly damaged three poorly built wood homes, destroyed four mobile homes, and uprooted large trees.[10] Farther along, it decreased in size to just .125 miles (0.201\u00a0km) wide but caused significant damage to 15\u201320 homes of brick and wood construction. As it passed 7.2 miles (11.6\u00a0km) southeast of Rome, the tornado degenerated into an F0 tornado over wooded farmland while causing major roof damage to a few homes before dissipating.[10] According to the National Weather Service, the tornado destroyed 55\u201360 homes and did at least some damage to 140\u2013150 others, with total losses reaching $6,750,000."

Budget cuts in the 1970s had forced the National Weather Service to cut back on the expansion of new broadcast stations. Most urban and suburban areas in the country had sufficient coverage, but many rural areas had no coverage at all. After a visit to the Goshen site, then Vice President Al Gore pushed for further funding and expansion of the NOAA Weather Radio system, especially in rural areas. This was accomplished through an expansion of private-public partnerships, primarily by the National Weather Service leasing or using donated tower space from entities such as TV stations, public utilities, and state government agencies. Gore, also, pushed for facilities such as schools, hospitals, churches, and nursing homes to have weather radios on hand."

The fire burned, in difficult terrain, throughout 20\u201321 January without any serious impact. On 22 January, hot and dry conditions that had persisted for several days worsened. The fire spread rapidly in a southerly direction towards Dunkeld, south of Grampians National Park. The fire front reached the outskirts of Willaura (south-west of Ararat), before a strong but dry wind change took the fire back in the opposite direction. Winds of up to 120 kilometres per hour (75\u00a0mph) sent the fire northward extremely quickly, impacting a number of small communities along the eastern side of The Grampians, including Mafeking, Moyston, Barton, Jallukar and Pomonal. A man and his son died between Moyston and Pomonal when they were caught up in the fire.[1] The fire was eventually controlled approximately two weeks later, having burned nearly 47% of the Grampians National Park, as well as a significant amount of private property, a total of 184,000 hectares (450,000 acres). Approximately 25 homes were destroyed, mostly to the west of Moyston and around Pomonal.

In December 2021, especially towards the latter part of the month, high temperatures (in excess of 40\u00a0\u00b0C at certain points) and low rainfall led to dangerous conditions, conducive to large bushfires.[3] Low dew points, low humidity and low soil moisture levels have recently made firefighting more difficult overnight \u2013 ordinarily, fires would reduce in size and ferocity overnight, however recently, this has not been the case due to the aforementioned factors.[4] Total fire bans were declared for a wide-ranging area on 26 December and the days before, including the area where the fire began."

Weather conditions were harsh, with temperatures peaking at 43.5\u00a0\u00b0C during the day and wind gusts of up to 37\u00a0km/h recorded.[3] By 6.07pm, the Department of Fire and Emergency Services (DFES) had issued an emergency warning to those in Wooroloo, Chidlow and Gidgegannup.[6] Those in the emergency warning and watch and act zones were urged to evacuate \u2013 an area of approximately 2,479 hectares (6,130 acres). An evacuation centre was set up at the Mundaring Arena in Mundaring.[7] By 7.17pm, in excess of 155 hectares (380 acres) had been burned, stretching in a westerly direction from the starting point of the fire. The fire was moving fast in that direction.[8] 150 firefighters and aerial support were sent to the fire. The Shire of Mundaring Animal Pound was open and available to take domestic animals for residents who were evacuating the area, whilst the State Equestrian Centre was opened to accommodate animals from fire-affected areas.[9] The Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) forecast strong wind gusts of up to 60 kilometres per hour overnight, as well as temperatures of more than 28\u00a0\u00b0C. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reported that several structures had been burned.[9] By 9.06pm, DFES reported that more than 250 firefighters were attending the fire, as well as State Emergency Service (SES) and local government personnel. At this point, the bushfire was still moving fast in a westerly direction. DFES advised that residents of Warrigal Estate in Chidlow whom had not already evacuated that it was now too late to leave. The emergency warning zone encompassed the area bounded by Government Road, Old Northam Road, Lilydale Road and Needham Road, including Warrigal Estate in Wooroloo, Chidow and Gidgegannup. The watch and act zone encompassed the area bounded by Lilydale Road, Thomas Street, Elliott Road, Rosedale Road and Brompton Heights in Chidlow.

The emergency warning zone had been decreased in size to 760 hectares (1,900 acres), at this point encompassing the area bounded by Government Road, Old Northam Road, Forge Farm Riding School, Liberton Road and Jason Street, including Warrigal Estate. The Warrigal Estate was reportedly under threat by fire at the present moment, as noted in the 7.07am emergency warning update.[10] The watch and act zone encompassed the area aforementioned, as well as the balance of the former emergency warning zone. The advice zone remained mostly unchanged.[10] In addition to the 100 firefighters reported by DFES to be attending, SES, WA Police, St John Ambulance, the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions and the Shire of Mundaring were in attendance.[10] Wind gusts of up to 50\u00a0km/h were forecast for the morning by BOM, with high temperatures of 40\u00a0\u00b0C continuing. By 8.02am, the emergency warning update from DFES advised that the bushfire was now contained and controlled, whilst the Warrigal Estate was still under threat by embers.[14][15] Firefighters were reportedly patrolling the area and mopping up. Road closures at this point included Liberton Road between Stone Street and Needham Road, Needham Road between Liberton Road and Government Road, Lilydale Road between Breeze Road and Stone Street. Government Road between Needham Road and Old Northam Road had re-opened with significant amounts of water on the road.[10] DFES Incident Controller Adrian Hamill spoke to ABC Radio Perth, informing listeners that 167 hectares (410 acres) had now been burned, as well as one house, near to where the fire started, and several sheds. The Warrigal Estate was still under threat, however all houses in the estate appeared to have been saved.[16] By 11.12am, DFES issues an update to the emergency warning, which read that residences in Warrigal Estate, Forge Drive and Anvil Way may be under threat by embers.[17] 120 firefighters were reported to be in attendance at this point. The watch and act zone and advice zones remained mostly unchanged.[10] By 11.45am, DFES issued another update to the emergency warning. A community meeting at the Wooroloo Hall was scheduled for 1.00pm,[7] and a number of roads were re-opened, including Needham Road and Lilydale Road, in addition to Government Road, which was re-opened by 8.02 am. Liberton Road remained closed. There were few changes with regards to the bushfire after 11.45am and before 2.00 pm. At 2.00pm, DFES downgraded the alert level from emergency to watch and act as the bushfire was contained and controlled. The Mundaring Arena evacuation centre had been closed. Firefighters were reported to be on the scene and monitoring the situation. Embers were still threatening homes, so residents were asked to remain vigilant. News outlets reported that one house and six outbuildings (such as sheds) and a number of vehicles, including cars and trucks, had been burned.[18][19] The destroyed house was owned by Monique Leahy, and has been owned by the same family for almost 40 years.[20][21] By 7.12pm, DFES had again downgraded the alert level for the former watch and act area from watch and act to advice, whilst the balance of the former warning area was downgraded to all clear. All roads had been re-opened at this point. The Water Corporation advised that some properties in Wooroloo, Gidgegannup and Chidlow were without water. Power had been restored to approximately 120 homes in the area earlier in the day by Western Power.[14]"

The front that spawned the cyclone was almost completely dry until after it crossed the Gulf of Mexico, making this storm unique among large southeast snowstorms. Despite the slow start, a low formed and deepened rapidly off the Georgia coast as the cold front reached the Gulf Stream on January 27. Heavy snow quickly developed from the Carolinas to Pennsylvania as the low drifted north to the Outer Banks of North Carolina on the 28th. Strong high pressure to the north helped to cut the system off from the jet stream. As a result, the cyclone took three days to move up the East Coast of the United States, which was double the normal estimated time used by forecasters of that era for storm systems that move up the coast. Snow reached Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. by noon on January 28, and continued into the morning of January 29. Temperatures remained in the 20s Fahrenheit (-5 \u00b0C) through much of the event."

During the movie's intermission, the heavy, wet snow split the roof down the middle, bringing down the balcony as well as a portion of the weakened brick wall. Army Major George S.

Approximately 80 firefighters and three aircraft were required to bring the blaze under control by the following day.[45][46] Communities around Taree were also threatened by fire on 28 September; several sheds and outbuildings were destroyed by a blaze that burned 1,674\u00a0ha (4,140 acres).[43] Another fire ignited in coal tailings from local mining operations near Ruttleys Rd., Doyalson, during September; the hot-spots were observed by the RFS several weeks before, but could not be extinguished before hot conditions on 17 October.[47] The fire would eventually burn over 2,600\u00a0ha (6,400 acres) and impact property in Cams Wharf, Catherine Hill Bay, Lake Munmorah and Nords Wharf, destroying 4 houses and damaging a further 7.[3][48] 63-year-old retiree Walter Linder died of a suspected heart-attack while defending his home during the fire.[49] During October 2013, 1,162 fires were recorded in New South Wales, 19 of these being declared major incidents.[50] On 13 October, a small grass fire burned through the car park of the Aquatic Centre at Sydney Olympic Park, near the Rural Fire Service Headquarters, destroying 47 cars and a motorbike and damaging a further 33.[51][52] The evacuation plan of the Aquatic Centre\nwas employed and 500 to 1,500 people were safely moved away from danger by staff of the complex where the 2013 Buffalo Sports NSW All Schools Championships were taking place.[52] On the same day, two houses were destroyed and another damaged by a 180\u00a0ha (440 acres) fire that ignited in the Webbs Creek area, west of Gosford.[3][53][54] Three fires ignited around the Port Stephens area on 13 October, destroying a total of 4 houses, 9 industrial/commercial/primary production buildings, 24 outbuildings and eight vehicles over a 10-day period; a further 9 houses and 10 industrial/commercial/primary production buildings were significantly damaged, also.[9][55] The first fire, near Fingal Bay, burned 184\u00a0ha (450 acres).[9] The second fire, ignited by powerlines arcing in high winds near Brownes Rd. and Lemon Tree Passage Rd. in Salt Ash, burned 355\u00a0ha (880 acres) and destroyed four houses, a number of sheds, outbuildings, vehicles and boats.[9][56] The third fire, which ignited near Hank St. in Heatherbrae, burned 5,642\u00a0ha (13,940 acres) and impacted on property in Raymond Terrace, Tomago and Williamtown on 17 October when driven by winds of 45\u00a0km/h (28\u00a0mph), gusting up to 70\u00a0km/h (43\u00a0mph).[9][57] More than 500 residents registered for assistance at the King Park, Raymond Terrace bushfire evacuation centre during the Hank St. fire.[58] On 16 October, a fire\u2014later referred to as the State Mine fire\u2014ignited on the grounds of the Marangaroo Army base during an explosives exercise. Firefighters were unable to combat the fire due to the danger of unexploded ordnance in the area and the presence of a no fly zone above the base. The blaze rapidly spread into rugged, largely inaccessible, country containing heavy fuel loads.[10] Over a period of four weeks, the fire burned through 54,862\u00a0ha (135,570 acres) of scrub and forest, the majority in Wollemi and Blue Mountains National Parks.[10] Significant damage was caused to the infrastructure of the historic Zig Zag Railway, estimated to have cost A$3\u20134 million; eleven engines and carriages and numerous structures for accommodation and administration were destroyed.[59] A total of 5 houses were destroyed and one damaged across the fire ground\u2014including 2 destroyed in Mount Wilson, some 20\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi) from the point of ignition\u20147 businesses and numerous sheds and vehicles were also destroyed in Bell, Clarence, Lithgow, Mount Irvine and other communities affected by the fires.[3][10] The most destructive single bushfire in terms of property loss in the history of New South Wales ignited in the vicinity of Linksview Rd., Springwood, at about midday on 17 October.[60] A total of 3,631\u00a0ha (8,970 acres) of forest and private property was burned during the 27-day duration of the fire, which destroyed 195 houses and damaged a further 146 buildings in the communities of Faulconbridge, Mount Riverview, Springwood, Winmalee and Yellow Rock.[3][11] A significant amount of destruction occurred in the initial hours of the fire around Buena Vista Rd., Emma Pde., Heather Glen Rd., Moray St. and Purvines Rd. A number of houses were also destroyed in Paulwood Ave., close to St. Thomas Aquinas Primary School, which was evacuated to Winmalee Shopping Centre and destruction also occurred on Singles Ridge Rd., where the children of Rainbow Pre-School were evacuated and the playground was destroyed.[11] Also on 17 October, two other significant fires ignited; one near Mt. York Rd. in Mount Victoria and another near Hall Rd. in Balmoral. Over 22-day period the 'Mt. York Rd.' fire burned 9,383\u00a0ha (23,190 acres) of scrub and forest, the majority within the boundaries of the Blue Mountains National Park.[12] All property losses occurred on the first afternoon of the blaze; 10 houses were destroyed and a further 3 were damaged in St. George's Parade, Mount Victoria, and a number of smaller structures and vehicles were destroyed in other streets around the town.[3][12] From 18 to 24 October, there was concern that the fire could enter the Grose Valley and impact on Katoomba and the lower Blue Mountains, however a 5\u00a0km (3.1\u00a0mi) containment line, constructed by specialized and experienced RFS Remote Areas Firefighting Teams in a narrow ravine, prevented the fire from entering.[12] Over a 26-day period the 'Hall Rd.' fire burned 15,657\u00a0ha (38,690 acres) of forest within the Upper Nepean State Conservation Area and impacted the communities of Balmoral, Cordeaux-Dam and Yanderra; 2 houses were destroyed and another 2 were damaged.[3][61] The fire had a significant effect on infrastructure, closing the Hume Motorway\u2014creating a traffic jam reputed to have been 20\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi) in length\u2014and disrupting electrical supply to the water filtration plant for the Upper Nepean Catchment, which services four dams of Sydney's Water Catchment. Also threatened were Cordeaux colliery, a gas pipeline and communications tower.[61] On 24 October, a pilot contracted by the RFS died in a fixed-wing aircraft accident while fighting a fire in rugged terrain near Wirritin, approximately 40\u00a0km (25\u00a0mi) west of Ulladulla.[62] On 17 January, at least 50 fires were ignited in New South Wales by lightning strikes. The most destructive of these blazes burned 8,000\u00a0ha (20,000 acres) in and around Murraguldrie State Forest and impacted upon the communities of Carabost, Humula, Kyeamba and Little Billabong over a period of days; 5 houses and a number of non-residential structures were destroyed.[27][28][63][64] Significant damage was also caused to local forestry, costing about A$3 million to replace.[29] In addition, a fire near Bathurst burned through 300\u00a0ha (740 acres) of pine forest and fires near Minjary claimed over 2,675\u00a0ha (6,610 acres) of scrubland.[65]"

Between 7 November and 11 March, Total Fire Bans were declared in all or parts of the state on 17 days.[69] The most destructive fire in terms of property loss during the Victorian season ignited on 14 January near Pohlners Rd., Wartook, and burned into the Grampians National Park.[23] During the major run of the fire between 15 and 20 January, a 12\u00a0km (7.5\u00a0mi) wide pyrocumulus convection column of smoke and ash was created by the fire, generating its own weather pattern including lightning.[70] Over an 81-day period, the fire burned 55,100\u00a0ha (136,000 acres) of scrub, forest and pasture and impacted the communities of Brimpaen, Halls Gap, Heatherlie, Heathvale, Laharum, Ledcourt, Pomonal, Roses Gap & Wartook; 32 houses, 90 sheds, 300\u00a0km (190\u00a0mi) of fencing and 400\u00a0ha (990 acres) of plantations were destroyed by the fire and at least 4,000 head of livestock died during the blaze and after.[22][23][24] On 17 January, the body of a civilian woman was found in a property at Roses Gap\u2014her death was confirmed to have been fire related. Two additional civilians were admitted to hospital with injuries related to the fire.[71] The largest fire during the Victorian season ignited on 16 January as a number of separate fires\u2014the 'Goongerah complex' and 'Club Terrace' fires being the most serious\u2014in mountainous terrain of the Snowy River and Errinundra National Parks in the East Gippsland region.[72] A significant commitment of aircraft, including 9 helicopters and 5 fixed-wing aircraft, supported by an additional 6 RFS aircraft provided during February, were deployed to the fires in the remote region.[72] During a 70-day period, the smaller fires merged and burned 165,806\u00a0ha (409,720 acres) of scrub, forest and pasture and impacted the communities of Bonang, Goongerah and Tubbut; 9 houses, a number of sheds and 1,250\u00a0ha (3,100 acres) of crops and pasture were destroyed, and 100 head of livestock died.[22] A second complex of fires also ignited north of Glenaladale on 16 January. By 18 January these fires were 3\u00a0km (1.9\u00a0mi) south-west of the Glenaladale community, however all were contained the following day.[26] The fire broke containment lines on 9 February, a day with recorded temperatures of up to 41.7\u00a0\u00b0C (107.1\u00a0\u00b0F) and an average daily wind speed of 44\u00a0km/h (27\u00a0mph) in the area.[26] During a 67-day period, the blaze burned 6,727\u00a0ha (16,620 acres) of forest within the Mitchell River National Park and on private property, as well as impacting the communities of Fernbank, Fingerboards, Glenaladale and Mount Ray; 3 houses and 7 non-residential structures were destroyed and 1,000 head of livestock died.[22][26] Strong winds and high temperatures of on 9 February lead to the ignition of 78 separate fires, which resulted the issuing of 150 emergency warnings during the day.[31] The most serious fire to start during the day ignited when a tree fell on a powerline along Mickleham Rd., Mickelham.[73] The fire spread rapidly north and threatened 1,240 houses and 13,000 residents within the eventual footprint of the fire. At least 810 firefighters, supported by 15 aircraft, battled to contain the fire as it crossed the boundaries of 3 local government areas, and on 14 February the fire was declared under control.[31] During a 23-day period, the fire burned 22,877\u00a0ha (56,530 acres) of scrub, forest and private property and impacted the communities of Beveridge, Bylands, Chintin, Craigieburn, Darraweit Guim, Donnybrook, Kalkallo, Kilmore, Mickleham, Moranding & Wallan; 18 houses, numerous non-residential buildings, 1,600\u00a0km (990\u00a0mi) of fencing and 9,000\u00a0ha (22,000 acres) of pasture and horticulture were destroyed by the fire and at least 16,000 head of livestock died during the blaze and after.[22][31] A complex of fires also ignited around Morwell between 7\u20139 February, burning approximately 3,300\u00a0ha (8,200 acres) and impacting the 1,165\u00a0ha (2,880 acres) open cut portion of the Hazelwood coal mine managed by GDF Suez.[74][75] The coal dredgers and conveyor belts feeding the coal-fired generators were damaged by fire and were briefly shut down, and the fire also had a significant impact to the health of residents and firefighting personnel during its 45-day duration.[76][77] Of the 28 firefighting personnel who required medical assistance, 26 were treated for exposure to carbon monoxide; 14 from the CFA and 12 from GDF Suez.[78] General practitioner practices in Churchill, Moe, Morwell and Traralgon reported an increase in consultations related to respiratory conditions, including breathing difficulties, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation, coughing or throat irritations.[79] Between 9 February and 10 March, 46 calls related to respiratory problems were taken within Morwell and Traralgon by the Nurse-On-Call service; approximately 30 more than on the same period in years prior.[80] Other destructive fires that ignited across the state on 9 February included;"

It makes up the northeastern half of the Australian Alps (the other half being the Victorian Alps) and contains Australia's five tallest peaks, all of which are above 2,100\u00a0m (6,890\u00a0ft), including the tallest Mount Kosciuszko, which reaches to a height of 2,228\u00a0m (7,310\u00a0ft) above sea level.  The offshore Tasmanian highlands makes up the only other major alpine region present in the whole of Australia. The Snowy Mountains experience large natural snowfalls for several months of the year; with significant accumulation during May, June, July, August, September and October with the snow cover usually melting by November (although it can occasionally persist through high summer and the next autumn). It is considered to be one of the centres of the Australian ski industry during the winter months, with all four snow resorts in New South Wales being located in the region.[1]  The range is host to the mountain plum-pine, a low-lying type of conifer. The Alpine Way and Snowy Mountains Highway are the major roads through the Snowy Mountains region."

        "content": "The mountain range is thought to have had Aboriginal occupation for 20,000 years. Large gatherings were held in the High Country during summer for collective feasting on the Bogong moth. The area was first explored by Europeans in 1835, and in 1840, Edmund Strzelecki ascended Mount Kosciuszko and named it after the Polish patriot. High country stockmen followed who used the Snowy Mountains for grazing during the summer months. Banjo Paterson's famous poem The Man From Snowy River recalls this era. The cattle graziers have left a legacy of mountain huts scattered across the area. Today these huts are maintained by the National Parks and Wildlife Service or volunteer organisations like the Kosciuszko Huts Association. In the 19th century gold was mined on the high plains near Kiandra. At its height this community had a population of about 4,000 people, and ran 14 hotels. Since the last resident left in 1974, Kiandra has become a ghost town of ruins and abandoned diggings.[2] The Kosciuszko National Park came into existence as the National Chase Snowy Mountains on 5 December 1906.  In 1944 this became the Kosciuszko State Park and the Kosciuszko National Park in 1967.[3] Recreational skiing began at Kiandra in the 1860s and experienced a boom in the 20th century following the commencement of the construction of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Scheme between 1949 and 1976 which brought many European workers to the district and opened up access to the ranges."

        "content": "The discovery of gold at Kiandra (elevation 1,400\u00a0m or 4,600\u00a0ft), in 1859, briefly enticed a population of thousands above the snowline and saw the introduction of recreational skiing to the Snowy Mountains around 1861.[4] The Kiandra Goldrush was short-lived, but the township remained a service centre for recreational and survival skiing for over a century. Australia's first T-bar lift was installed at Kiandra in 1957, but the ski facilities were finally shifted up the hill to Selwyn Snowfields in 1978.[5] Steeper slopes and more reliable snows lie further to the south and in the 20th century, the focus of recreational skiing in New South Wales shifted southward, to the Mount Kosciuszko region.[6] The Kosciuszko Chalet was built at Charlotte Pass in 1930, giving relatively comfortable access to Australia's highest terrain.[7] In 1964, Australia briefly boasted the \"World's Longest Chairlift\", designed to carry skiers from the Thredbo Valley to Charlotte Pass, but technical difficulties soon closed the facility.[8][9] At 1,760\u00a0m (5,774\u00a0ft), Charlotte Pass has the highest village base elevation of any Australia ski resort and can only be accessed via over-snow transport in winter.[10] The growing number of ski enthusiasts heading to Charlotte Pass led to the establishment of a cafe at Smiggin Holes around 1939, where horse-drawn sleighs would deliver skiers to begin the arduous ski to the Kosciuszko Chalet.[11] It was the construction of the vast Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Scheme from 1949 that really opened up the Snowy Mountains for large scale development of a ski industry and led to the establishment of Thredbo and Perisher as leading Australian resorts.[11][12] The Construction of Guthega Dam brought skiers to the isolated Guthega district and a rope tow was installed there in 1957.[13] Skifields up by Kosciuszko's side were also established during this period, though their existence is now little realised. The Australian Alpine Club was founded in 1950 by Charles Anton. Huts were constructed in the \"Backcountry\" close to Mount Kosciuszko, including Kunama Hut, which opened for the 1953 season. A rope tow was installed on Mount Northcote at the site and opened in 1954. The site proved excellent for speed skiing, but the hut was destroyed in an avalanche, which also killed one person, in 1956.[14] Anton also recognised the potential of the Thredbo Valley for construction of a major resort and village, with good vertical terrain. Construction began in 1957.[12] Today, Thredbo has 14 ski-lifts and possesses Australia's longest ski resort run, the 5.9\u00a0km from Karel's T-Bar to Friday Flat; Australia's greatest vertical drop of 672\u00a0m; and the highest lifted point in Australia at 2037\u00a0m.[15][16] The last establishment of a major skifield in NSW came with the development of Mount Blue Cow in the 1980s. In 1987 the Swiss designed Skitube Alpine Railway opened to deliver skiers from Bullocks Flat, on the Alpine Way, to Perisher Valley and to Blue Cow, which also opened in 1987.[11] The operators of Blue Cow purchased Guthega in 1991, and the new combined resort later merged with Perisher-Smiggins to become the largest ski resort in the Southern Hemisphere.[17] In 2022, Perisher had 48 lifts covering 1,245 hectares and four village base areas: Perisher Valley, Blue Cow, Smiggin Holes and Guthega.[11]"

The range is perhaps best known for the Snowy Mountains Scheme, a project to dam the Snowy River, providing both water for irrigation and hydroelectricity. The project began in 1949 employing 100,000 men, two-thirds of whom came from thirty other countries during the post-World War II years. Socially this project symbolises a period during which Australia became an ethnic \"melting pot\" of the twentieth century but which also changed Australia's character and increased its appreciation for a wide range of cultural diversity. The Scheme built several temporary towns for its construction workers, several of which have become permanent: Cabramurra (the highest town in Australia); and Khancoban. Additionally, the economy of Cooma has been sustained by the Scheme.[citation needed] Townships at Adaminaby, Jindabyne and Talbingo were inundated by the construction of Lakes Eucumbene, Jindabyne and Talbingo.[18][19] Improved vehicular access to the High Country enabled ski-resort villages to be constructed at Thredbo and Guthega in the 1950s by ex-Snowy Scheme workers, who realised the potential for expansion of the Australian ski industry.[12] By 1974, 145\u00a0km (90\u00a0mi) of tunnels and 80\u00a0km (50\u00a0mi) of aqueducts connected the sixteen dams, seven power stations (two underground), and one pumping station.[20] The American Society of Civil Engineers has rated the Snowy Scheme as \"a world-class civil engineering project\". The principal lakes created by the scheme include: Lake Eucumbene, Blowering Dam, Talbingo Dam, Lake Jindabyne and Tantangara Dam."

The other four glacial lakes are Lake Albina, Lake Cootapatamba, Club Lake and Headley Tarn. During the last ice age, which peaked about 20,000 years ago in the Pleistocene epoch, the highest peaks of the main range near Mount Kosciuszko experienced a climate which favoured the formation of glaciers, evidence of which can still be seen today. Cirques moraines, tarn lakes, roche moutonn\u00e9es and other glacial features can all be seen in the area. Lake Cootapatamba, which was formed by an ice spilling from Mount Kosciuszko's southern flank, is the highest lake on the Australian mainland. Lake Albina, Club Lake, Blue Lake, and Hedley Tarn also have glacial origins.[23] There is some disagreement as to exactly how widespread Pleistocene glaciation was on the main range, and little or no evidence from earlier glacial periods exists. The 'David Moraine', a one kilometre long ridge running across Spencers Creek valley seems to indicate a larger glacier existed in this area at some time, however the glacial origin of this feature is disputed.[24] There is evidence of periglacial activity in the area. Solifluction appears to have created terraces on the north west flank of Mount Northcote.  Frost heave is also a significant agent of soil erosion in the Kosciuszko Area."

The 300-foot-wide, 75-foot-long (91\u00a0m \u00d7\u00a023\u00a0m) pit was made up of a 50-foot-deep (15\u00a0m) strip mine that had been cleared by Edward Whitney[clarification needed] in 1935, and came very close to the northeast corner of Odd Fellows Cemetery. There were eight illegal dumps spread about Centralia, and the council's intention in creating the landfill was to stop the illegal dumping, as new state regulations had forced the town to close an earlier dump west of St. Ignatius Cemetery. Trustees at the cemetery were opposed to the landfill's proximity to it but recognized the illegal dumping elsewhere was a serious problem and envisioned that the new pit would resolve it.[7] Pennsylvania had passed a precautionary law in 1956 to regulate landfill use in strip mines, as landfills were known to cause destructive mine fires. The law required a permit and regular inspection for a municipality to use such a pit. George Segaritus, a regional landfill inspector who worked for the Department of Mines and Mineral Industries (DMMI) became concerned about the pit when he noticed holes in the walls and floor, as such mines often cut through older mines underneath. Segaritus informed Joseph Tighe, a Centralia councilman, that the pit would require filling with an incombustible material.[7]"

DeKok surmises that the process\u2014setting it on fire\u2014was not specified because state law prohibited dump fires. Nonetheless, the Centralia council set a date and hired five members of the volunteer firefighter company to clean up the landfill.[2] A fire was ignited to clean the dump on May 27, 1962, and water was used to douse the visible flames that night. However, flames were seen once more on May 29. Using hoses hooked up from Locust Avenue, another attempt was made to douse the fire that night. Another flare-up in the following week (June 4) caused the Centralia Fire Company to once again douse it with hoses. A bulldozer stirred up the garbage so that firemen could douse concealed layers of the burning waste. A few days later, a hole as wide as 15\u00a0ft (4.6\u00a0m) and several feet high was found in the base of the north wall of the pit. Garbage had concealed the hole and prevented it from being filled with incombustible material. It is possible that this hole led to the mine fire, as it provided a pathway to the labyrinth of old mines under the borough. Evidence indicates that, despite these efforts to douse the fire, the landfill continued to burn. On July 2, Monsignor William J. Burke complained about foul odors from the smoldering trash and coal reaching St. Ignatius Church. Even then, the Centralia council still allowed the dumping of garbage into the pit.[7] Clarence \"Mooch\" Kashner, the president of the Independent Miners, Breakermen, and Truckers union, came at the invitation of a council member to inspect the situation in Centralia. Kashner evaluated the events and called Gordon Smith, an engineer of the Department of Mines and Mineral Industries (DMMI) office in Pottsville. Smith told the town that he could dig out the smoldering material using a steam shovel for $175. A call was placed to Art Joyce, a mine inspector from Mount Carmel, who brought gas detection equipment for use on the swirling wisps of steam now emanating from ground fissures in the north wall of the landfill pit. Tests concluded that the gases seeping from the large hole in the pit wall and from cracks in the north wall contained carbon monoxide concentrations typical of coal-mine fires.[7]"

        "content": "The Centralia Council sent a letter to the Lehigh Valley Coal Company (LVCC) as formal notice of the fire. It is speculated that the town council had decided that hiding the true origin of the fire would serve better than alerting the LVCC of the truth, which would most likely end in receiving no help from them. In the letter, the borough described the starting of a fire \"of unknown origin during a period of unusually hot weather\".[9] Preceding an August 6 meeting at the fire site, which would include officials from the LVCC and the Susquehanna Coal Company, Deputy Secretary of Mines James Shober Sr. expected that the representatives would inform him that they could not afford mounting a project that would stop the mine fire. Therefore, Shober announced that he expected the state to finance the cost of digging out the fire, which was at that time around $30,000 (roughly equivalent to $302,000 in 2023). Another offer was made at the meeting, proposed by Centralia strip mine operator Alonzo Sanchez, who told members of council that he would dig out the mine fire free of charge as long as he could claim any coal he recovered without paying royalties to the Lehigh Valley Coal Company. Part of Sanchez's plan was to do exploratory drilling to estimate the scope of the mine fire, which was most likely why Sanchez's offer was rejected at the meeting. The drilling would have delayed the project, not to mention the legal problems with mining rights.[7] At the time, state mine inspectors were in the Centralia-area mines almost daily to check for lethal levels of carbon monoxide. Lethal levels were found on August 9, and all Centralia-area mines were closed the next day.[citation needed]"

        "content": "Pressed at an August 12 meeting of the United Mine Works of America in Centralia, Secretary of Mines Lewis Evans sent a letter to the group on August 15 that claimed he had authorized a project to deal with the mine fire, and that bids for the project would be opened on August 17. Two days later, the contract was awarded to Bridy, Inc., a company near Mount Carmel, for an estimated $20,000 (roughly equivalent to $201,000 in 2023). Work on the project began August 22.[7] The Department of Mines and Mineral Industries (DMMI), who originally believed Bridy would need only to excavate 24,000\u00a0cu\u00a0yd (18,000\u00a0m3) of earth,[1][page\u00a0needed] informed them that they were forbidden from doing any exploratory drilling in order to find the perimeter of the fire or how deep it was, and that they were to strictly follow plans drawn up by the engineers[which?] who did not believe that the fire was very big or active. Instead, the size and location of the fire was estimated based on the amount of steam issuing from the landfill rock.[citation needed] Bridy, following the engineering team plan, began by digging on the northern perimeter of the dump pit rim and excavated about 200\u00a0ft (61\u00a0m) outward to expand the perimeter. However, the project was ultimately ineffective due to multiple factors. Intentional breaching of the subterranean mine chambers allowed large amounts of oxygen to rush in, greatly worsening the fire. Steve Kisela, a bulldozer operator in Bridy's project, said that the project was ineffective because the inrush of air helped the fire to move ahead of the excavation point by the time the section was drilled and blasted.[citation needed] Bridy was also using a 2.5\u00a0cu\u00a0yd (1.9\u00a0m3) shovel, which was considered small for the project.[citation needed] Furthermore, the state only permitted Bridy's team to work weekday shifts which were eight hours long and only occurred during the day time, commonly referred to as \"first shift\" in the mining industry.[10] At one point, work was at a standstill for five days during the Labor Day weekend in early September.[why?][citation needed] Finally, the fire was traveling in a northward direction, which caused the fire to move deeper into the coal seam. This, combined with the work restrictions and inadequate equipment, greatly increased the excavation cost. Bridy had excavated 58,580\u00a0cu\u00a0yd (44,790\u00a0m3) of earth by the time the project ran out of money and ended on October 29, 1962.[7]"

        "header": "Second excavation project",
        "content": "On October 29, just prior to the termination of the Bridy project, a new project was proposed that involved flushing the mine fire. Crushed rock would be mixed with water and pumped into Centralia's mines ahead of the expected fire expansion. The project was estimated to cost $40,000 (roughly equivalent to $403,000 in 2023). Bids were opened on November 1, and the project was awarded to K&H Excavating with a low bid of $28,400 (roughly equivalent to $286,000 in 2023).[7] Drilling was conducted through holes spaced 20\u00a0ft (6.1\u00a0m) apart in a semicircular pattern along the edge of the landfill. However, this project was also ineffective due to multiple factors. Centralia experienced an unusually heavy period of snowfall and unseasonably low temperatures during the project. Winter weather caused the water supply lines to freeze. Furthermore, the rock-grinding machine froze during a windy blizzard. Both problems inhibited the timely mixture and administration of the crushed-rock slurry. The DMMI also worried that the 10,000\u00a0cu\u00a0yd (7,600\u00a0m3) of flushing material would not be enough to fill the mines, thus preventing the bore holes from filling completely. Partially filled boreholes would provide an escape route for the fire, rendering the project ineffective.[7] These problems quickly depleted funds. In response, Secretary Evans approved an additional $14,000 (roughly equivalent to $141,000 in 2023) to fund this project. Funding for the project ran out on March 15, 1963, with a total cost of $42,420[1][page\u00a0needed] (roughly equivalent to $427,000 in 2023). On April 11, steam issuing from additional openings in the ground indicated that the fire had spread eastward as far as 700\u00a0ft (210\u00a0m),[7] and that the project had failed."

The second, costing $151,714, offered a smaller trench in an incomplete circle, followed by the completion of the circle with a flush barrier. The third plan was a \"total and concerted flushing project\" larger than the second project's flushing and costing $82,300. The state abandoned this project in 1963.[7]"

In 1979, locals became aware of the scale of the problem when a gas-station owner, then-mayor John Coddington, inserted a dipstick into one of his underground tanks to check the fuel level. When he withdrew it, it seemed hot. He lowered a thermometer into the tank on a string and was shocked to discover that the temperature of the gasoline in the tank was 172\u00a0\u00b0F (77.8\u00a0\u00b0C).[11] Beginning in 1980, adverse health effects were reported by several people due to byproducts of the fire \u2014 carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide \u2014 and low oxygen levels.[citation needed] Statewide attention to the fire began to increase, culminating in 1981 when a 12-year-old resident named Todd Domboski fell into a sinkhole 4\u00a0ft (1.2\u00a0m) wide by 150\u00a0ft (46\u00a0m) deep that suddenly opened beneath his feet in a backyard.[12] He clung to a tree root until his cousin, 14-year-old Eric Wolfgang, saved his life by pulling him out of the hole. The plume of hot steam billowing from the hole was measured as containing a lethal level of carbon monoxide.[5] Todd began suffering nightmares of the incident later in life, for which he turned to prescribed medication. He died of an overdose on February 4, 2022.[13]"

        "header": "Possible origins",
        "content": "A number of competing hypotheses have arisen about the source of the Centralia mine fire. Some of them claim that the mine fire started before May 27, 1962. David DeKok says that the borough's deliberate burning of trash on May 27 to clean up the landfill in the former strip mine ignited a coal seam via an unsealed opening in the trash pit, which allowed the fire to enter the labyrinth of abandoned coal mines beneath Centralia.[7] Joan Quigley argues in her 2007 book The Day the Earth Caved In that the fire had in fact started the previous day, when a trash hauler dumped hot ash or coal discarded from coal burners into the open trash pit. She noted that borough council minutes from June 4, 1962, referred to two fires at the dump, and that five firefighters had submitted bills for \"fighting the fire at the landfill area\". The borough, by law, was responsible for installing a fire-resistant clay barrier between each layer of trash in the landfill, but fell behind schedule, leaving the barrier incomplete. This allowed the hot coals to penetrate the vein of coal underneath the pit, lighting the subsequent subterranean fire. In addition to the council minutes, Quigley cites \"interviews with volunteer firemen, the former fire chief, borough officials, and several eyewitnesses\" as her sources.[3][page\u00a0needed][14] Another hypothesis is that the fire was burning long before the alleged trash dump fire. According to local legend, the Bast Colliery coal fire of 1932, set alight by an explosion, was never fully extinguished.[15] In 1962, it reached the landfill area. Those who adhere to the Bast Theory believe that the dump fire is a separate fire unrelated to the Centralia mine fire. One man who disagrees is Frank Jurgill Sr., who claims he operated a bootleg mine with his brother in the vicinity of the landfill between 1960 and 1962. He says that if the Bast Colliery fire had never been put out, he and his brother would have been in it and been killed by the gases.[7] Centralia councilman Joseph Tighe proposed a different hypothesis: that Centralia's coal fire was actually started by an adjacent coal-seam fire that had been burning west of Centralia's. His belief is that the adjacent fire was at one time partially excavated, but nonetheless, it set alight the landfill on May 27.[7] Another hypothesis arose from a letter sent to the Lehigh Valley Coal Company by the Centralia Council in the days after the mine fire was noticed. The letter describes \"a fire of unknown origin [starting] on or about June 25, 1962, during a period of unusually hot weather\". This may refer to the hypothesis of spontaneous combustion being the reason for the start of the landfill fire, a hypothesis accepted for many years by state and federal officials.[7]"

A few families opted to stay despite urgings from Pennsylvania officials.[18] In 1992, Pennsylvania governor Bob Casey invoked eminent domain on all properties in the borough, condemning all the buildings within. A subsequent legal effort by residents to have the decision reversed failed. In 2002, the U.S. Postal Service revoked Centralia's ZIP code, 17927.[4][19] In 2009, Governor Ed Rendell began the formal eviction of Centralia residents.[20] By early 2010, only five occupied homes remained, with the residents determined to stay.[21] In lawsuits, the remaining residents alleged that they were victims of \"massive fraud\", \"motivated primarily by interests in what is conservatively estimated at hundreds of millions of dollars of some of the best anthracite coal in the world\".[22] In July 2012, the last handful of residents in Centralia lost their appeal of a court decision upholding eminent domain proceedings and were again ordered to leave.[23] State and local officials reached an agreement with the seven remaining residents on October 29, 2013, allowing them to live out their lives there, after which the rights of their properties would be taken through eminent domain.[24] The Centralia mine fire also extended beneath the town of Byrnesville, a few miles to the south. The town had to be abandoned and leveled.[25] The Centralia area has now grown to be a tourist attraction.[26] Visitors come to see the smoke and/or steam on Centralia's empty streets and the abandoned portion of PA Route 61, popularly referred to as the Graffiti Highway.[27] As of April 2020, efforts to cover up Graffiti Highway by the private owner of the road were begun.[28] The abandoned highway was covered with dirt in April 2020, generally blocking public access to the road.[29][30] Increased air pressure induced by the heat from the mine fires has interacted with heavy rainfalls in the area, which rush into the abandoned mines to form Pennsylvania's only geyser, the Big Mine Run Geyser, which erupts on private property in nearby Ashland. The geyser has been kept open as a means of flood control.[31] The fire and its effects were featured in 2013 on America Declassified on the Travel Channel, on Radiolab's Cities episode, and on 99% Invisible's Mini Stories: Volume 18 episode.[32][18][33] The film Silent Hill draws on these events, although the film is based in West Virginia.[34]"

The fourth named storm and fifth tropical storm or hurricane of the season, Dorothy developed on August\u00a017 from a tropical wave to the east of the Lesser Antilles. It tracked west-northwestward throughout its entire duration, and despite forecasts of attaining hurricane status, Dorothy reached peak winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/)\u00a0\u2013 slightly below hurricane status. The storm struck Martinique on August\u00a020, and subsequently began a gradual weakening trend in the Caribbean Sea. On August\u00a023, Dorothy dissipated south of Hispaniola. Most significantly affected by the storm was Martinique, which received 26.8\u00a0in (680\u00a0mm) of rainfall in a 24\u2011hour period. The rainfall caused flooding and mudslides, resulting in about $34\u00a0million in damage (1970\u00a0USD); 186\u00a0homes were destroyed, and 700\u00a0people were left homeless. The flooding killed up to 50\u00a0people on the island.

Around the same time, thunderstorms increased in association with the cyclone, and forecasters remarked the potential for re-intensification over the western Caribbean Sea.[10] However, the storm became more disorganized, and on August\u00a023 Dorothy degenerated into a tropical wave.[1]"

In Martinique, the highest 24-hour total was 26.8 inches (680\u00a0mm) in Fourniols, which was twice the average rainfall for August. Additionally, the capital city of Fort-de-France reported 13.4\u00a0in (341\u00a0mm).[25] There, the rainfall broke all records for durations up to 24\u00a0hours; about 1 inch (25\u00a0mm) fell in 5\u00a0minutes, and in one hour a station reported 6.02 inches (153\u00a0mm).[26] The rainfall caused flooding and mudslides,[1] as well as rivers exceeding their banks;[27] several bridges collapsed during the storm, and many homes were washed away.[24] During the passage of the storm, sustained winds on the island reached 67 miles per hour (108\u00a0km/h), with gusts reaching 99 miles per hour (159\u00a0km/h) in the Caravelle peninsula.[28] Throughout the country, the storm destroyed 186\u00a0homes and left 700\u00a0people homeless.[27] The passage of Dorothy left heavy crop damage on the island, totaling 32\u00a0million\u00a0francs (1970\u00a0FRF, $5.8\u00a0million 1970\u00a0USD); a total of 3.75\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (9.7\u00a0km2) of banana crop was destroyed, and 2.16\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (5.6\u00a0km2) of sugar cane was destroyed. Damage on the island totaled 190\u00a0million\u00a0francs (1970\u00a0FRF, $34\u00a0million 1970\u00a0USD).[27] Tropical Storm Dorothy caused several deaths on Martinique, although the exact death toll is unknown. The National Hurricane Center reported 50\u00a0deaths,[1] although the post event report provided by the French meteorological agency reported 44\u00a0people dead or missing.[27] Most of the deaths were in Saint-Joseph, where 20\u00a0people drowned in the Rivi\u00e8re l'Or.[27] Floodwater rescues had been made difficult due to washed out roads and poor communications after the storm.[29] In addition to the deaths, several people were injured.[27] After the passage of the storm, Martinique was temporarily left isolated, when communications were downed with other nearby islands.[24] The French Red Cross distributed 500\u00a0blankets and one ton of condensed milk; the agency also sought international assistance.[29] Elsewhere in the Lesser Antilles, the storm caused flooding and mudslides in Dominica.[1] There, the storm caused one death, when flooding heavy rainfall washed out a bridge. Also, all of the capital city of Roseau lost power and water service due to the storm.[24] In neighboring Guadeloupe, the storm left much of the banana crop destroyed.[29] Later, after it entered the Caribbean Sea, small craft warnings were issued for the Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico.[7] In its review of the storm, the National Hurricane Center did not mention any damage in the Greater Antilles.[1]"

The disturbance developed over the western Caroline Islands, and persisted for two days until it was noted in a Significant Tropical Weather Advisory issued by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). It rapidly matured, and prompted a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert shortly thereafter. Enhanced upper-level outflow assisted the storm's intensification.[1] At 0600 UTC on September 28, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) recognized the storm as a tropical depression.[2] The JTWC issued their first advisory on the depression, designated 34W, at 0600 UTC on September 29.[1] However, at the same time, the JMA upgraded it to a tropical storm.[2] At 1800 UTC on September 29, the JTWC classified the depression as Tropical Storm Angela. The system initially tracking northwestward, Angela turned westward along the southern periphery of a subtropical ridge to the north. The tropical storm began to rapidly intensify,[1] and the JMA upgraded it to a severe tropical storm at 1800 UTC on September 30,[2] while the JTWC estimated that it had attained typhoon intensity.[1] The JMA then upgraded Angela to a typhoon shortly thereafter, and assessed it as having reached peak intensity on October 2, with 10-minute maximum sustained winds of 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 925 millibars.[2] Continuing westward, the typhoon attained super typhoon status four days later, and the JTWC reported that Angela peaked in strength on October 5. Between October 5 and October 6, Angela crossed the northern coast of Luzon in the Philippines.[1] The storm weakened after interacting with land, and the JTWC downgraded it to a typhoon on October 6 as it emerged into the South China Sea. An area of high pressure built over China, pushing Angela towards the southwest. Wind shear over the area weakened somewhat, and the typhoon re-intensified. However, as it passed south of Hainan, the cyclone again weakened due to the interaction with land. At 0600 UTC on October 10, Angela struck the coast of Vietnam and moved ashore. The JTWC issued their final advisory on the system at 1200 UTC,[1] at which time the JMA downgraded it to a severe tropical storm, to a tropical storm six hours later, and to a tropical depression early on October 11.[2]"

Following Bolaven and Sanba, Jelawat was the third typhoon directly hitting Okinawa Island in 2012. Jelawat, which means carp in Malaysian, is a type of freshwater fish. Jelawat reached peak intensity late on September 24 and maintained it for nearly two days. The typhoon passed through Okinawa Prefecture on September 29 and finally made landfall over Aichi Prefecture in Japan on September 30. Jelawat was the strongest typhoon for Okinawa Island in 2012 by observed winds, as it also killed 2 people in Japan.[1]"

        "content": "Late on September 17, a tropical disturbance formed east of Guam, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the system in the next two days, shortly before the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the low-pressure area to a tropical depression early on September 20.[2][3] Several hours later on September 20, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) upgraded the system to a tropical depression named Lawin, before JTWC also upgraded it to a tropical depression due to low vertical wind shear and improved equatorward outflow.[4][5] Soon, JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm and named it Jelawat, so did JTWC.[6] Since September 21, Jelawat moved southwestwards slowly by tracking along the southwestern extension of the subtropical ridge anchoring east of Japan. Despite favourable conditions, the storm has struggled to improve its organization.[7] When Jelawat was drifting westwards by a weak steering environment on September 22, it intensified into a severe tropical storm for excellent equatorward outflow because of speedy divergence to the south, and a tropical upper tropospheric trough cell northeast of the system started to improved its poleward outflow.[8] Later, the system began to form an eyewall with excellent equatorward outflow and good poleward outflow.[9] Based on the improved organization, both JMA and JTWC upgraded Jelawat to a typhoon early on September 23, before the system began to drift northwards due to a complex steering environment resulting from a trough over East Asia and a tropical depression (later becoming Severe Tropical Storm Ewiniar) in the east.[10][11] Eighteen hours later, JTWC upgraded Jelawat to a super typhoon after the system underwent explosive intensification, becoming a well-developed system with a 10-nautical-mile (19\u00a0km; 12\u00a0mi) eye and strong spiral banding.[12] Late on September 24, by low vertical wind shear and favourable outflow aloft across all quadrants, Typhoon Jelawat attained its peak intensity by the 10-minute maximum sustained winds reaching 110 knots (205\u00a0km/h, 125\u00a0mph) and the atmospheric pressure decreasing to 905\u00a0hPa (26.72\u00a0inHg). The typhoon also reached category 5 strength on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale, with a solid band of deep convection surrounding a 20-nautical-mile (37\u00a0km; 23\u00a0mi) eye.[13] Tracking northwestwards since September 25, Typhoon Jelawat entered an eyewall replacement cycle, and the process ended with a 25-nautical-mile (46\u00a0km; 29\u00a0mi) eye on the next day.[14] Having maintained peak intensity for nearly two days because of excellent radial outflow enhanced by a poleward stream, Jelawat weakened slightly from late September 26 to early September 27, yet the diameter of that larger eye became 40 nautical miles (74\u00a0km; 46\u00a0mi).[15] Later, the system tracked northward, for a trough over East China was eroding the subtropical ridge.[16] When approaching Okinawa, Jelawat began to move northeastwards by tracking along the western edge of the subtropical ridge on September 28, and JTWC downgraded the system to a typhoon for a slight elongation in the overall shape.[17] At the same time, Jelawat weakened slightly due to another eyewall replacement cycle, but radial outflow and improving poleward outflow into a deep mid-latitude shortwave trough helped the typhoon maintain intensity.[18] With a shrunken 7-nautical-mile (13\u00a0km; 8.1\u00a0mi) pinhole eye, Typhoon Jelawat passed through the west coast of Okinawa Island early on September 29, when the estimated 10-minute maximum sustained winds were at 90 knots (165\u00a0km/h, 105\u00a0mph).[19] Equatorward outflow has significantly hindered, as Jelawat started to gradually weaken; however, poleward outflow remained well-established and was linked to a deep mid-latitude trough directly to the north of the system.[20] Then, the typhoon accelerated northeastwards and moved into an area of strong southwesterly vertical wind shear, but jet-induced poleward outflow kept the system from rapid decaying.[21] Since September 30, Jelawat was fully embedded in baroclinic zone and began extratropical transition, as the convective banding was unraveling.[22] At 06Z, JTWC downgraded Jelawat to a tropical storm, for deep convection was sheared to the north.[23] The system made landfall over Aichi Prefecture in Japan at 10Z, when the estimated 10-minute maximum sustained winds were at 70 knots (130\u00a0km/h, 80\u00a0mph). Eight hours later, JMA downgraded Jelawat to a severe tropical storm when it was located in Iwate Prefecture, and JTWC issued the final warning on the system \t\nsimultaneously.[24] On October 1, JMA downgraded Jelawat to a tropical storm, shortly before becoming extratropical east of Kuril Islands. The extratropical cyclone strengthened and regained storm-force status on October 2, before the system crossed the International Date Line and began to weakened on October 3.[25][26]"

According to the Japan Meteorological Agency, the maximum gust produced by Typhoon Jelawat was at 62.6\u00a0m/s (225\u00a0km/h) in Miyagi Island of Uruma, Okinawa.[27] The maximum sustained winds were at 41.1\u00a0m/s (148\u00a0km/h) in Naha, ranked the tenth-strongest in that county seat and the largest city of Okinawa Prefecture on record. The storm also produced the maximum gust at 61.2\u00a0m/s (220\u00a0km/h) in Naha, ranked the third-strongest in that city on record.[28][29] Reports suggested that some 65 people were injured in the storm while 331,000 people remained without electricity. Strong winds flipped cars and uprooted trees. A four-ton truck was reportedly turned upside down by the winds causing a major roadblock in Naha. Flights and ferries connecting Okinawa to the rest of Japan were all cancelled.[30] Jelawat was known locally as Typhoon Seventeen. Up to 4,200 households in the regions of Higashi and Nago was asked to evacuate immediately.[31] Across Okinawa Prefecture, damage to agriculture amounted to \u00a51.7\u00a0billion (US$21.6\u00a0million).[32] In Japan, preparations for the storm started early on September 30. The storm was located nearly 220\u00a0km (140\u00a0mi) south of southwestern prefecture of Kochi, when officials warned the locals of strong wind, torrential rain, landslides and possible flash flooding. By then, Jelawat had already injured 96 people.[33] In Tokyo, several trains were cancelled and up to 300 flights to the city's Narita International Airport were cancelled. Up to 20 inches (510\u00a0mm) of rain was expected.[34] By October 1, one person had been killed and 140 other people were reportedly injured. Authorities in the central city of Nagoya have made it compulsory for 57,000 people to leave their homes in the wake of rising river levels in the city, which can cause significant flooding.[35] Among the dead was a 29-year-old man who was swept away by high waves while the typhoon was passing Okinawa. In Mie Prefecture, another 2,000 people were asked to evacuate. Waves as high as 10 metres (33\u00a0ft) were advised of. Meanwhile, in Tokyo, up to 500 millimetres (20\u00a0in) of rain was expected over the next 24 hours. Several other trains were cancelled and the total number of flights cancelled went up to 500.[36] By the night of October 1, a 56-year-old man who had been missing since the past 24 hours was confirmed dead, after he had drowned. Local news agency, NHK, reported that over 181 people were injured in the typhoon.[37] A further 11,000 were told to evacuate in the city of Ishinomaki in the country's northeast, Jiji Press reported. The local Meteorological agency predicted rainfall of up to 400 millimetres (16\u00a0in) in some areas in the 24 hours.[38] Total agricultural damage across the nation reached \u00a58.935\u00a0billion (US$115\u00a0million).[39]"

The first two tornadoes touched down after 10:00\u00a0p.m. CST on January 9 in Oklahoma and Louisiana. From there the progression of the twisters shifted eastward through the overnight and early morning hours, setting the stage for what would turn out to be a record-setting day on January 10. Texas saw five tornadoes between 1:30\u00a0a.m.\u20133:30\u00a0a.m., one tornado touched down in Arkansas at 6:00\u00a0a.m., Louisiana saw seven tornadoes between 5:30\u00a0a.m.\u20138:00\u00a0a.m. (killing one person), Mississippi had five tornadoes between 8:15\u00a0a.m.\u201310:00\u00a0a.m. (killing nine), and Illinois and Indiana each experienced three lunch-hour tornadoes. The tornadic line of storms then shifted into Alabama (killing one) and Florida during the afternoon and evening hours.[5] Mississippi and Alabama were the two states hardest hit by this outbreak. Alabama had the most twisters of any state with 13, but Mississippi saw the largest and deadliest tornado. An F4 tornado that tore through Pike, Lincoln, Lawrence, and Simpson Counties at 8:14\u00a0a.m. killed nine people and injured over 200, and severely damaged 38 blocks in the town of McComb. The 39 tornadoes on January 10 marked the most active tornadic day in January in U.S. history at that time.[6] The 52 tornadoes during January 1975 also set a U.S. record for the most tornadoes during that month. Both of these records were broken in January 1999.[7] After a calm day on January 11, four more tornadoes touched down in Florida and Georgia on January 12, killing one person in Florida. By the time the outbreak ended it had produced 45 tornadoes, killed 12\u00a0people, injured 377 and caused $42\u00a0million in damages.[5]"

It tracked west-northwestward for its first few days, steadily intensifying into a powerful typhoon by September\u00a029. Higos subsequently weakened and turned to the north-northeast toward Japan, making landfall in that country's Kanagawa Prefecture on October\u00a01. It weakened while crossing Honshu, and shortly after striking Hokkaid\u014d, Higos became extratropical on October\u00a02. The remnants passed over Sakhalin and dissipated on October\u00a04. Before striking Japan, Higos produced strong winds in the Northern Marianas Islands while passing to their north. These winds damaged the food supply on two islands. Later, Higos moved across Japan with wind gusts as strong as 161\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph), including record gusts at several locations. A total of 608,130\u00a0buildings in the country were left without power, and two people were electrocuted in the storm's aftermath. The typhoon also dropped heavy rainfall that peaked at 346\u00a0mm (13.6\u00a0in). The rains flooded houses across the country and caused mudslides.

A well-defined eye 15\u00a0km (9.3\u00a0mi) in diameter developed, and Higos rapidly intensified.[3] At 1200\u00a0UTC on September\u00a029, Typhoon Higos reached its peak intensity. The JMA estimated 10\u00a0minute maximum sustained winds of 175\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph),[4] and the JTWC estimated 1\u00a0minute winds of 250\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph), which made Higos a super typhoon. After having moved west-northwestward for several days, Higos slowed and began turning to the north while it was at peak strength. Its change in movement was due to an eastward-moving trough creating a weakness in the ridge. The typhoon accelerated to the north-northeast toward Japan and gradually weakened due to increasing wind shear.[2] At around 1100\u00a0UTC on October\u00a01, Higos passed just east of the Miura Peninsula with winds of 130\u00a0km/h (81\u00a0mph), about 30\u00a0minutes before making landfall in the eastern portion of Kanagawa Prefecture near Yokosuka.[4] Higos passed very near Tokyo around 1200\u00a0UTC that day,[3] becoming the third strongest typhoon to affect the city since World War II, according to the JTWC.[2] The typhoon weakened into a tropical storm while crossing Honshu. Higos briefly emerged over waters, before making a second landfall on Tomakomai, Hokkaid\u014d at 2100\u00a0UTC on October\u00a01. By that time, the storm was beginning to transition into an extratropical cyclone, and at 0600\u00a0UTC on October\u00a02 Higos completed the transition.[4] Simultaneously, the JTWC discontinued advisories.[2] The storm continued to the north before crossing Sakhalin.

Winds in Tokyo reached 94\u00a0km/h (58\u00a0mph).[9] Stronger wind gusts were reported in Hokkaido after Higos became extratropical, including a peak gust of 161\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph) in Urakawa.[3] Several stations across Japan reported record-high wind gusts.[10]  The typhoon also dropped torrential rainfall that peaked at 346\u00a0mm (13.6\u00a0in) in Hakone, Kanagawa; the same station reported a one-hour total of 80\u00a0mm (3.1\u00a0in).[9] The typhoon washed 25\u00a0boats ashore,[9] including a cargo ship on Izu-Oshima Island.[11] One woman was washed away by high surf.[7] A total of 2,254\u00a0houses were flooded in the country,[9] forcing thousands of people to evacuate.[7] Overall, 2,694\u00a0houses were damaged, and another 12 were destroyed.[9] Many houses lost their roofs,[3] and high winds left 608,130\u00a0buildings without power in Honshu,[12] along with thousands of power on Hokkaido.[2] Two people were electrocuted by downed power lines.[3] High rainfall caused mudslides near Tokyo, which destroyed a few buildings, and caused the Tama River to reach above-normal levels.[7] Across Japan, the typhoon disrupted transportation by forcing highways to be closed.[11] Storm debris injured several people, and a steel window frame struck and killed a man in Yokohama. A tree fell onto a car, injuring one person.[7] Insured damage in Japan totaled \u00a5261\u00a0billion ($2.14\u00a0billion in 2002\u00a0USD).[nb 4] In Iwate Prefecture, there was about \u00a58\u00a0billion ($73\u00a0million 2002\u00a0USD) in damage, mostly from damaged roads and public buildings. Agriculture damage in the prefecture exceeded \u00a52\u00a0billion ($18.3\u00a0million in 2002\u00a0USD) for the first time since Typhoon Mireille in 1991.[14] There were five deaths, and 108\u00a0people were injured;[9] this included 55\u00a0people who were injured in Tokyo.[2] After becoming extratropical, Higos affected the Kuril Islands and later Sakhalin.[11] Power was cut in 22\u00a0towns,[15] and ferry service was canceled.[11] On Sakhalin, high winds downed many trees, some of which blocked roads.[16] Six people were injured by fallen trees.[15] The remnants of Higos capsized two ships offshore Primorye, killing seven people.[17]"

September was the warmest on record for close to 75% of the state and 63 stations, with 100-year stations such as Broken Hill and Wilcannia more than 1\u00a0\u00b0C (1.8\u00a0\u00b0F) warmer than their previous record; all other areas of the state recorded temperatures in the warmest 10% of years. Widespread temperatures more than 6\u00a0\u00b0C (11\u00a0\u00b0F) above normal were recorded between 22 and 30 September. Warm, dry weather and strong winds during September contributed to significant early-season bushfire activity, particularly along the coastal strip. Fires were particularly prevalent on 10 and 26 September, with two homes destroyed in western Sydney, while several homes in northeast NSW were threatened and the M1 Motorway closed near Taree due to fires on 26 September.[13] In issuing its forecast for the October to December quarter on 25 September, the Bureau estimated the chance that the maximum temperature will exceed the long-term median maximum temperature are greater than 60% across most of southeast Australia, with odds greater than 70% in parts of the south and east coasts.[14] In the week leading up to the bushfires, temperatures in the Blue Mountains peaked at 34.6\u00a0\u00b0C (94.3\u00a0\u00b0F) at Springwood on 10 October; with peak windspeed measured at 46\u00a0km/h (29\u00a0mph) from the northwest, on 13 October.[15] At Lake Macquarie, the temperature peaked at 35.6\u00a0\u00b0C (96.1\u00a0\u00b0F) also on 10 October; with peak windspeed measured at 22\u00a0km/h (14\u00a0mph) also from the northwest on 13 October.[16] The Commissioner of the New South Wales Rural Fire Service, Shane Fitzsimmons AFSM, issued an extreme fire danger warning for greater Sydney (including the Blue Mountains and Central Coast), the greater Hunter, and Illawarra/Shoalhaven regions for 10 October.[17]"

Some properties were lost in the fire, most of them being on the outskirts of the Lithgow district, where the fire burned. It burned out most of the northern region of the Blue Mountains National Park, parts of Wollemi National Park, and triggered the evacuation of most of the Lithgow region. The communities affected included Bell, Berambing, Bilpin, Clarence, Dargan, Hartley Vale, Lithgow, McKellars Park, Mount Irvine, and Mount Wilson. The fire burnt out more than 55,000 hectares (140,000 acres) between Lithgow and Bilpin.[1][32] An investigation later revealed that the fire was caused by explosives training which was being carried out by the Australian Defence Force.[21] In 2013, a commission of inquiry as to the problems that led to the fire was begun before former Sydney judge, John O'Meally.[33] The iconic Zig Zag Railway was mostly destroyed by the State Mine fire.[34] Due to re-open in November, after closure following accreditation issues with the New South Wales Government, the railway suffered millions of dollars of damage which included ten passenger carriages, accommodation carriages, a near-complete new shower block and meals room, spare parts centre and workshop.

Springwood Hospital was evacuated as were a number of nursing homes and several hundred children from schools.\"[37] Affected streets were Singles Ridge Road and most of the streets that intersect it, as well as some other nearby streets.

Authorities were concerned that weather conditions forecast for 23 October could drive the now merged fire eastwards, with little chance of stopping it, resulting in potentially disastrous impacts on many towns in the Blue Mountains. Consequently, the NSW Government ordered the closure of every school and child care centre on 23 October, and urged all residents of the Blue Mountains who did not need to be in the mountains to leave early that day prior to 9am to prevent possible loss of life and traffic congestion should fire fighting equipment needed to be moved rapidly. Hundreds of mountains residents left either on the 22nd or very early morning the 23rd ensuring fire fighters could work without hassle. Fortunately the weather was not quite as bad as forecast and fire fighters were able to slow its progress with most of the fire activity taking place around the State Mine fire on the Bells Line of Road. The fire spread over 9,000 hectares (22,000 acres);[1] before being declared officially out by 13 November, with its cause attributed to strong winds with resultant powerline damage.[7]"

The main fire forced the closure of Masonite Road and Camfield Drive, but remained east of the Pacific Highway.[45] After a southerly wind change, the fire headed northeast, burning more of the Raymond Terrace and Williamtown bushland, surrounding Newcastle Airport and RAAF Base Williamtown on three sides, but remaining west of Medowie Road. At Campvale, north of Williamtown, the fire crossed Richardson Road burning much of the Campvale bushland. The fire eventually stopped after burning into the southwestern corner of Medowie, approximately 13\u00a0km (8\u00a0mi) from where it began.

On 19 October crews from fire authorities in Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania, the Australian Capital Territory and Queensland joined to assist NSW emergency services' teams.[58] Additional support was provided from fire authorities interstate again on 23 October. Approximately 2,000 firefighters, deployed on rotation, and 200 fire engines were operational in the Blue Mountains area alone.[59] The Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, confirmed on 19 October that bushfire-affected communities would have access to disaster assistance in nineteen local government areas.[50] As of 26\u00a0October\u00a02013[update], A$5.5\u00a0million had been raised via public appeals from The Salvation Army, the St Vincent de Paul Society, the Australian Red Cross, ANGLICARE Diocese of Sydney and the Blue Mountains City Council Mayoral Relief Fund,[6] asking for people to donate cash, rather than goods.[60] On behalf of the royal family, Charles, Prince of Wales, donated an undisclosed amount to the Australian Red Cross.[61] Personal messages of support and sympathy were received by the Governor of New South Wales from Australia's monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, and Pope Francis.[62][63][64] I would like to convey my heartfelt sympathy to all those who have been affected by the devastating bushfires across New South Wales. My thoughts are with the many people who have lost their homes or livelihoods in the fires, and I have great admiration for the fire fighters, volunteers and emergency services officers who are working tirelessly to contain the situation. Under the State Emergency and Rescue Management Act, 1989 (NSW), the Premier of New South Wales declared a state of emergency for thirty days, with effect on 20 October, empowering emergency personnel to evict residents and demolish fire-affected buildings.[11][12][65] Under the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment scheme, people affected were eligible for a A$1000 cash payment for adults and A$400 for each child, subject to certain conditions for residents within the Blue Mountains, Lithgow, Muswellbrook, Port Macquarie-Hastings, Port Stephens, Wingecarribee and Wyong local government areas.[66] A range of relief measures, including personal hardship and distress assistance, were made available by the NSW Government via the Ministry for Police and Emergency Services.[67] In the worst affected area of the Blue Mountains, the risk of asbestos contamination forced authorities to ban owners and the public from visiting houses destroyed by fire,[6] until clearance was given. A recovery centre was established at Springwood, an animal evacuation shelter at Hawkesbury Showground, and emergency authorities conducted numerous meetings in locations where fires threatened communities.[68] The NSW Government appointed Phil Koperberg to the position of Blue Mountains Bushfire Recovery Coordinator.[23][69]"

Australians are well used to the threat of bush fires, but nothing can prepare you for the moment when you return home to find your house and everything inside utterly gutted by fire. Several fires are still burning around Springwood. Relays of helicopters whirr through the smoky haze, dumping water to try and douse the flames. A drop in the temperature today has given fire fighters a window to try and get on top of the situation before the weekend, when the mercury is expected to rise again. It's only spring here. The fear is of a long and difficult summer fire season.

But what is absolutely clear is the science is telling us that there are increasing heat waves in Asia, Europe, and Australia; that there these will continue; that they will continue in their intensity and in their frequency. The Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, criticised earlier comments made by Australian Greens' MP Adam Bandt,[77][78][79][80] with Abbott stating on 17 October that \"Australia is a country which is prone to natural disaster but every time it strikes, it hurts and we grieve for all of those who are now hurting because of what's happened in NSW\".[81] Abbott dismissed the claims made by Figueres and in an interview on national radio stated that \"Climate change is real as I've often said and we should take strong action against it. But these fires are certainly not a function of climate change, they're a function of life in Australia.\"[82] Abbott's comments attracted a stern rebuke from former US Vice President Al Gore.[83][84] Well, it's not my place to get involved in your politics, but it reminds me of politicians here in the United States who got a lot of support from the tobacco companies and who argued to the public that there was absolutely no connection between smoking cigarettes and lung cancer. And for 40 years the tobacco companies were able to persuade pliant politicians within their grip to tell the public what they wanted them to tell them. And for 40 years the tragedy continued. And bushfires can occur naturally, and do, but the science shows clearly that when the temperature goes up and when the vegetation and soils dry out, then wildfires become more pervasive and more dangerous. That's not me saying it, that's what the scientific community says."

Multiple witnesses reported this multiple-vortex tornado to have been at least a quarter of a mile wide. The second tornado, rated F0, touched down southeast of Cherokee in Alfalfa County where it was spotted by a county sheriff's deputy. An F0 tornado was spotted by a state trooper and was on the ground for less than one minute near SH-11 west of Medford and caused no known damage.[23]"

The depression was located within an area of low to moderate wind shear under an upper-level anticyclone. Flaring convection was noted along the eastern portion of the developing system before the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert later that day.[2] Early on September\u00a017, the JTWC began issuing advisories on Tropical Depression 16W.[3] Located within a weak steering environment, the storm executed a clockwise loop[2] while quickly strengthening. Several hours after the JTWC issued their first advisory, the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm and gave it the name Yagi;[1] the name was contributed by Japan, and is the Japanese word for \"goat\".[2] Late on September\u00a018, the JMA upgraded Yagi to a severe tropical storm[1] while the JTWC classified the storm as a minimal typhoon.[3] Early on September\u00a019, the JMA upgraded Yagi to a typhoon.[1] After completing the loop, Yagi's track was influenced by a subtropical ridge located to the southeast of Japan.[2] The typhoon continued to intensify[4] and reached its peak intensity on September\u00a021 with winds of 195\u00a0km/h (121\u00a0mph) 10-minute winds) with a minimum pressure of 910\u00a0hPa (mbar), making it the strongest storm of the season according to the JMA.[1] At the same time, the JTWC classified Yagi as a Category 5 super typhoon with winds of 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph) 1-minute winds).[3][5] On September\u00a022, Yagi passed by the islands of Iwo Jima and Chichijima as the storm recurved towards the northeast.[1] With increasing wind shear, the typhoon began to weaken and also began to undergo an extratropical transition.[2] Late on September\u00a024, the JTWC classified the storm as an extratropical cyclone and issued their final advisory.[3] The JMA kept Yagi as a tropical system for another day as it weakened to a severe tropical storm. Early on September\u00a025, they classified it as extratropical. The remnants of Yagi continued towards the northeast and crossed the International Date Line on September\u00a027.

The tornado initially started in the Sainte-Marie Parish, New Brunswick around 1:00 PM AST before moving eastward towards Mill Creek, New Brunswick. From Mill Creek, the tornado followed the northern edge of the Buctouche River resulting in tree damage and crop damage over a 400 to 500 yards (370 to 460\u00a0m) wide path for 9 miles (14\u00a0km) before impacting Bouctouche, New Brunswick. As the tornado entered the town, it destroyed upwards of 100 buildings, including the Bouctouche Church. The tornado missed the St Mary's Church and the Presbyterian Church. As the tornado approached the coast, it destroyed various dwellings and shops near the ship-yard. The bridge that crosses Bouctouche River in the town was also destroyed alongside the new school. The number of people killed in the tornado ranges depending on the source; however, the general number ranges from five to eight fatalities with the tornado injuring many. In addition to the number of people injured and killed, the amount of destroyed dwellings resulted in many being homeless. The damage costs were estimated around US$100,000, which was a very high figure at the time.[1][2]"

        "content": "Typhoon Prapiroon, known in the Philippines as Tropical Storm Henry, was a minimal typhoon which caused deadly flooding in southern China in August 2006. Prapiroon developed out of a persistent area of convection accompanied by an area of low pressure on July 25 about 120\u00a0km (75\u00a0mi) west-southwest of Yap. Two days later, both the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and PAGASA classified the system as a tropical depression, with PAGASA giving it the local name 'Henry'. By July\u00a031, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified the system as Tropical Depression 07W. A strong subtropical ridge located to the north of the depression led to a west-northwest movement for most of the storm existence. A few hours after the JTWC began issuing advisories, the depression made landfall in Dilasag, Philippines. The next day, after crossing into the South China Sea, the depression was upgraded to a tropical storm and named Prapiroon. Several hours later, PAGASA issued their final advisory on the storm as it moved out of their area of responsibility. By the morning of August\u00a02, Prapiroon intensified into a typhoon and reached its peak intensity with winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph 10-min). The typhoon maintained this intensity until shortly before landfall near Shangyang, China at 12:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a03, where it weakened to a severe tropical storm. Prapiroon quickly weakened and dissipated early on August\u00a05. Severe flooding in the Philippines and China from Prapiroon killed 94 people and left 10 others missing. Over 20\u00a0million people were affected by the storm in China alone. Significant flight delays and cancellations in Hong Kong led to $1.9\u00a0million in compensation pay to travelers. About 30,000 homes collapsed and 140,000 others were damaged by the storm. Damages were estimated at $640,000 (2006\u00a0USD) in the Philippines and  $984\u00a0million (2006\u00a0USD) in China. The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement sought $4,825,791 (2006 USD) in funds for victims of the typhoon."

Satellite imagery indicated that a low level circulation had developed and was under an area of light to moderate wind shear.[1] The low traveled in a general northwest fashion as upper level outflow improved.[2] By July 27, the low deteriorated, becoming elongated, and convection remained disorganized.[3] However, as the low neared Central Luzon, Philippines, shower and thunderstorm activity near the center of the low increased,[4] and based on its organization, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system a tropical depression early that morning.[5] Shortly after, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) designated the system as Tropical Depression Henry.[6] As the depression neared the northern Philippines, wind shear increased, partially exposing the center of the system to the south.[7] At 02:30\u00a0UTC on June\u00a030, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert,[8] and at 00:00\u00a0UTC the next morning, the JTWC classified the system as Tropical Depression 07W.[9] Upon first becoming a tropical cyclone, the depression tracked towards the west-northwest due to a strong subtropical ridge located to the north of the system. A few hours later, the system made landfall in Dilasag, Philippines with winds of 55\u00a0km/h (35\u00a0mph 1-minute winds).[10] After being over land for most of July\u00a031, the depression relocated into the South China Sea and the JTWC determined that it intensified into a tropical storm.[11] At around 06:00 UTC, the JMA designated the storm Tropical Storm Prapiroon about 300\u00a0km (185\u00a0mi) northwest of Dagupan, Philippines,[5] a few hours later, PAGASA issued their final advisory on Tropical Storm Henry (Prapiroon) as it moved out of their area of responsibility.[6] Prapiroon gradually intensified as it moved towards the west-northwest at 24\u00a0km/h (15\u00a0mph),[12] and by that afternoon, the system had completely moved into the South China Sea.[13] By the nighttime hours, the JMA upgraded Prapiroon to a severe tropical storm, as they determined that the maximum sustained winds had reached 95\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph 10-minute winds).[5] By the morning of August\u00a02, the JTWC upgraded Prapiroon to a typhoon,[14] and a few hours later, the JMA upgraded Prapiroon to a typhoon.[5] Heading towards the northwest, Prapiroon reached its peak intensity early on August\u00a03. The JMA estimated that Prapiroon peaked with winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph 10-minute winds) with a minimum pressure of 970\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.64\u00a0inHg),[5] while the JTWC estimated that the storm peaked with winds of 130\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph 1-minute winds).[15] Prapiroon maintained this intensity for 12\u00a0hours before weakening slightly as it made landfall near Shangyang at 12:00\u00a0UTC.[5][16] At the time of landfall, the JMA downgraded Prapiroon to a severe tropical storm, with winds of 110\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph 10-minute winds)[5] while the JTWC analyzed Prapiroon to have had winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph 1-minute winds). Due to the interaction with land, the storm quickly weakened. Early on August\u00a05, both agencies issued their final advisories on Prapiroon as it dissipated over central Guangxi.[5][16]"

        "content": "Tropical Storm Marco was the smallest tropical cyclone on record by radius of winds from its center.[1] The thirteenth named storm of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season, Marco developed out of a broad area of low pressure over the northwestern Caribbean during late September 2008. Influenced by a tropical wave on October\u00a04, a small low-level circulation center developed over Belize. After crossing the southern end of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula and emerging into the Bay of Campeche, the low was declared Tropical Depression Thirteen early on October\u00a06. The depression quickly intensified into a tropical storm and was given the name Marco later that day. Marco reached its peak intensity with winds of 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h) early on October\u00a07. Around this time, tropical storm force winds extended 11.5 miles (18.5\u00a0km) from the center of the storm, making Marco the smallest tropical cyclone on record.[2][1] Around 1200\u00a0UTC, Marco made landfall near Misantla, Veracruz. The storm rapidly weakened after landfall, dissipating later that day. Due to its small size, Marco caused minimal damage; however, the storm's heavy rains led to floods up to 10 feet (3.05\u00a0m) deep that covered highways and damaged homes."

        "content": "Tropical Storm Marco originated in a broad area of low pressure that persisted over the northwestern Caribbean in early October, 2008. On October\u00a04, a tropical wave reached the same area, and the system spawned a circulation center over Belize. Development of the low was initially inhibited by its proximity to land. As the system neared the Bay of Campeche, convection quickly developed around the low. At 00:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a06, the low was designated as Tropical Depression Thirteen while located over Laguna de T\u00e9rminos.[1] A mid-level ridge located to the north of the depression led to movement in a general west-northwest direction. Forecasters anticipated intensification up until landfall because of the storm's well-developed outflow and the low wind shear and high sea surface temperatures in its path.[3] By 12:00\u00a0UTC, the small cyclone, with a cloud shield no more than 85 miles (137 kilometers) across, was upgraded to Tropical Storm Marco.[1] Favorable conditions for development allowed Marco to quickly intensify throughout the day on October\u00a06. Early on October\u00a07, Marco reached its peak intensity with winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 998\u00a0millibar (hPa; 29.47\u00a0inHg).[1] This was based on a reconnaissance mission into Marco which recorded flight-level winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h), corresponding to a surface wind speed of 61\u00a0mph (98\u00a0km/h). Following the quick increase in intensity, forecasters noted the possibility of Marco intensifying into a hurricane before making landfall.[4] The storm maintained a small area of deep convection, averaging 9.2 miles (14.8\u00a0km) in diameter, as it continued moving towards the west-northwest.[5] Shortly after reaching peak intensity, tropical storm force winds extended 11.5 miles (18.5\u00a0km) from the center of Marco.[6] At 12:00\u00a0UTC, the center of Marco made landfall near Misantla, Veracruz, with winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h).[1] Once inland, Marco rapidly weakened,[7] being downgraded to a tropical depression six hours after landfall. The small depression dissipated later that day over the mountains of Mexico.[1]"

Six oil wells and a natural gas processing plant were also shut down in Veracruz. The Mexican Secretariat of Communications and Transportation also closed the ports of Nautla and Alvarado to small vessels as a precautionary measure.[10] Upon landfall, heavy rains peaking at 7.9 inches (201 millimeters) in El Pujal, San Luis Potos\u00ed[13] and falling at rates up to 1\u00a0inch per hour (25.4\u00a0mm/h),[1] caused some flooding in coastal towns near Veracruz as people evacuated to higher ground.[14] The rains from Marco worsened flood situations in areas of Mexico already suffering from severe flooding.[10] Officials in Veracruz, in their post-storm damage survey, reported that two rivers, the Quilate and Tenoch, overflowed their banks due to rains produced by Marco.[15] One of these rivers left the towns of Minatitlan and Hidalgotitlan under 10\u00a0ft (3\u00a0m) of water.[10] Highways along the coast of Veracruz were also flooded.[16] Another 250 homes were flooded when a lake and a river overflowed their banks.[17] Thirteen municipalities within Veracruz were affected by Marco. In Vega de Alatorre, 77 people were evacuated to nearby shelters after their homes were inundated with water. Three landslides were also reported in Misantla Colipa; none of them caused damage.[18] In all, Marco's impact was light; minimal damage was recorded, and none of the estimated 400,000 people affected by the storm  sustained injury.[1][19] In the wake of Marco, the General Coordination of Civil Protection of the Ministry of the Interior declared a state of emergency for 48 municipalities in Veracruz.[20][21][22] Relief goods were distributed to the affected areas by October\u00a09. The Government of Mexico reported that 4,700 blankets, 2,900 mattresses, 5,554 bottles of water (each containing 500\u00a0milliliters), 260,000 boxes of milk, 250,000 packages of biscuits, and 12,400 boxes of school supplies had been distributed.[23] At 0052\u00a0UTC on October\u00a07, tropical storm force winds extended 11.5 miles (18.5\u00a0km) from the center of Marco. This made Marco the smallest tropical cyclone ever recorded, surpassing the previous record set on December\u00a024, 1974 by Cyclone Tracy, whose  tropical storm-force winds extended 30 miles (48\u00a0km).[2][1][24]"

Some passengers spent more than eight and a half hours in their planes after arriving at DTW.[2] In southern Ontario, Toronto Pearson International Airport was shut down, while numerous flights from Ottawa International Airport were canceled. A series of additional snowstorms over the next 10 days gave Toronto a total of 46 inches (118\u00a0cm),[3] a record monthly total for the month of January, prompting then-mayor Mel Lastman to infamously call in the Canadian Army to assist the snow removal with the city at a near standstill. As a result, the mayor and city, through the media endured ridicule from other parts of Canada more prone to such high snowfall amounts. The series of storms that hit Toronto were severe enough to be the winter Storm of the Century despite the fact they were more than one storm.[4] Rail service was halted or delayed, and highways were impassable.  Lake Shore Drive in Chicago was closed for the first time ever.[dubious \u2013 discuss][citation needed]  300 of the Chicago Transit Authority\u2019s 2600-series cars went out of service. Stranded travellers were accommodated in emergency shelters.  The bitterly cold temperatures created large ice floes on the inland waterways, causing shipping delays. Schools were closed for several days, and many businesses were closed as well. Of those that were able to remain open, stores selling snow removal equipment were doing a booming business. There was also a nationwide blood shortage since a high proportion of blood donations come from the Midwest and many could not make it to the hospital and donate during the storm or during the subsequent cold snap. In much of Northwest Indiana, blackouts occurred for days at a time. Porter County was without electricity for about 3\u00a0days total.

Up to 2 feet (61\u00a0cm) of snow fell in the Cascades, with up to 6 inches (15\u00a0cm) in the Puget Sound area.[2] The Sierra Nevada saw up to a foot and many valley locations recorded 4\u201310 inches (10\u201325 centimetres). In the Greater Vancouver Area and Vancouver Island, British Columbia, 6\u201320 inches (15\u201351 centimetres) of snow fell on November 26 and 27, with Abbotsford recording the heaviest amount at about 45\u00a0cm (about 1.5\u00a0feet).[3] At least 1 person was killed by the snowfall in British Columbia.[2] The Vancouver and Victoria areas normally get far more rain than snow, even during the winter months, due to the warm flow coming from the Pacific Ocean. Before the occurrence of the snowstorm however, it was all about the rain. The city of Vancouver was under a boil water advisory due to two of the main reservoirs overflowing. The snowstorm occurred because of another huge low-pressure system, but this time, colliding with an Arctic ridge resulted in extremely heavy snow and causing overnight temperatures to dip to well below seasonal values; \u221212\u00a0\u00b0C (10\u00a0\u00b0F) on the 28th and \u221211.6\u00a0\u00b0C (11.1\u00a0\u00b0F) on the 29th. Daily high temperatures hovered at a frigid \u22125\u00a0\u00b0C (23\u00a0\u00b0F) on the 28th as the Arctic ridge began to stabilize over the south coast. Drier air began to influence the coast with sunny breaks and isolated flurries beginning on the evening of the 27th and ending on the morning of the 29th. On the 30th, about 25\u00a0cm (8-10\u00a0inches) of snow was recorded to be on the ground at Vancouver International Airport.[4] In some areas of the lower mainlands hills/higher elevations such as West Vancouver, North Vancouver, Coquitlam, Burnaby Mountain and Maple Ridge the snow started earlier (some snow recorded as early as the 24th) and ended later (some snow recorded as late as 4 December) so the snow lasted much longer than the rest of the lower mainland as temperatures got very close to \u221218\u00a0\u00b0C (0\u00a0\u00b0F)."

Blizzard conditions were reported in Oklahoma, where Tulsa, Oklahoma picked up about 10 inches (25\u00a0cm) of snow, a record high snowfall so early in the season for that city. The storm continued to press northeastward late in the day on November 30, producing heavy snow and ice across most of Kansas and Missouri. The Wichita area received blizzard conditions, while Butler, Missouri picked up 15 inches (38\u00a0cm) of snow. Freezing rain and sleet caused widespread power outages in the St. Louis region, causing over \u00bd million customers (almost entirely Ameren) to be without power in Missouri and Illinois, for the second time in 1 year (see 2006 St. Louis Derecho), some of them not gaining power for a week.

In Peoria, Illinois, heavy snow caused the roof of a nursing home to collapse, injuring four people. The storm hit the Chicago area on the morning of December 1, its intensity peaking during the morning rush hour. Its expected impact caused over 450 flights to be canceled at O'Hare International Airport and 70 flights to be canceled at Midway International Airport. Additionally, hundreds of schools, colleges, and even workplaces, particularly in the collar counties, were closed for the day. 17 inches (43\u00a0cm) of snow fell in LaSalle and Peru, where blizzard conditions brought Interstate 80 to a standstill for much of the day. Chicago's northern and northwestern suburbs were particularly hard hit, where up to 15 inches (38\u00a0cm) of snow fell in McHenry and over a foot of snow fell over much of Lake County, Illinois, and northwestern Cook County. Snow fell at times at rates of over 1 to 2 inches (3 to 5 centimetres) throughout most of the Chicago area, and thundersnow was reported in several locations. Meanwhile, the city of Chicago only saw 6.2 inches (16\u00a0cm) of snow, thanks to warm air on the back side of the low which produced more of a slushy mixture and less snowfall. Blowing and drifting snow, in addition to below-freezing temperatures caused roads to continue to be hazardous for travel through the weekend. In southeast Wisconsin blizzard warnings were posted for much of the day on December 1 in Kenosha, Racine, and Milwaukee counties.  Genoa City, just north of the WI-IL border, saw over 14 inches (36\u00a0cm) of snow, while Milwaukee received 10.1 inches (26\u00a0cm) of snow. The highest total in the region was Kenosha, receiving 17 inches (43\u00a0cm) of snow. This area of southeast Wisconsin had not experienced a blizzard like this since the Blizzard of 1999.

On the morning of December 1, while heavy snow was battering the Midwest, large sections of the Northeastern United States saw temperatures in the 60\u201375\u00a0\u00b0F (16\u201324\u00a0\u00b0C) range. Including a record high for December 1 of 70\u00a0\u00b0F in Pittsburgh. Severe thunderstorms were forecast for Ohio, Pennsylvania, and parts of the Northeast megalopolis. Sure enough, heavy rain, strong winds, hail, and vivid lightning pelted the area, in addition to several tornadoes. One of the strongest tornadoes, an F2, struck Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, southwest of Scranton. An F1 tornado struck Greensburg, Pennsylvania at 11:40 am, east of Pittsburgh. Across Upstate New York, damaging thunderstorms resulted from an unprecedented temperature gradient and unusually strong jet stream winds over the area. Jet stream winds of 160\u00a0mph, and winds at the 1,000-foot level of as high as 70\u00a0mph crossed the area during the evening as an area of low pressure developed over the region and dragged a warm front northward. The Storm Prediction Center placed New York and Pennsylvania under a moderate risk for severe thunderstorms. Temperature contrasts were extreme along the warm front, with one area of Columbia County experiencing temperatures in the upper 30s. Two miles away, temperatures were in the upper 60s. Severe thunderstorms developed across the cold front in Central New York and moved east. The 5 pm observation at Albany ahead of these storms was a temperature of 42 degrees and a dewpoint of 40. Immediately ahead of these storms, temperatures skyrocketed into the 60s. There were multiple reports of windows of homes and cars fogging up from the rapid rise in temperature. Frequent lightning and damaging winds accompanied these storms which is unusual for the cold season in the Northeast. Large Hail, which is unheard of in the cold season was reported from these storms in Delaware and Columbia Counties. Trees and wires were reported downed in many areas, and in some cases Structural damage was reported. In Western Massachusetts, Tanglewood was especially hard hit. A microburst as high as 85\u00a0mph downed as many as 300 trees and caused $250,000 worth of damage. Severe damage was also reported in the vicinity."

It quickly spread and covered 250,000 hectares (620,000 acres) and destroyed the areas' livestock.  It is thought to be the greatest disaster in the area.[1] Three people were killed. 28 homes were destroyed in Tallong, 31 in Wingello. The fire was eventually stopped (or burnt out) near Nowra on the NSW South Coast.[3]"

At 06:00 UTC on July 24, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started tracking a tropical disturbance,[1] which the Japan Meteorological Agency classified as a tropical depression twelve hours later.[2][nb 3][nb 4] Around this time, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Luming.[5] At 22:00 UTC, a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert was issued based on satellite imagery that showed a well-organized system, although the low-level circulation remained exposed from the deep convection. Due to the sudden development of central dense overcast over the low-level circulation center, the JTWC issued its first warning on Tropical Storm Ofelia at 06:00 UTC on July 25, although post-season analysis from the JTWC indicated that Ofelia did not become a tropical storm until three hours later.[1] The JMA followed suit that evening.[6] Tracking west-northwestwards,[7] Ofelia slowly intensified.[8] Midday on July 26, the storm attained its peak intensity of 80\u00a0km/h (50\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 994\u00a0mbar (29.4\u00a0inHg). On the next day, the storm made landfall over Kyushu about 60\u00a0km (35\u00a0mi) east-southeast of Kagoshima[7] at peak intensity. Overland, the storm weakened to a tropical depression later on July 27.[6] After moving across southern Japan, Ofelia recurved northeastwards and became an extratropical cyclone over the Sea of Japan on July 28.[7] The JTWC ceased tracking the system that morning, with the JTWC doing the same a day later.[6]"

        "content": "In the first week of October 1997, westerly winds near the equator in the western Pacific Ocean produced troughs \u2013 extended areas of low pressure \u2013 at a low latitude in the northern and southern hemisphere. The system in the South Pacific eventually developed into Tropical Cyclone Lusi, while the trough in the northern hemisphere eventually spawned two systems \u2013 Typhoon Ivan formed to the west, and the system that would eventually become Typhoon Joan developed along the eastern periphery. By October\u00a010, the eastern system consisted of an area of poorly-organized convection, moving slowly to the northwest. On the next day, satellite imagery suggested a circulation had developed.[2] The system increased in size and the convection organized further, prompting the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)[nb 2] to initiate advisories on Tropical Depression 28W on October\u00a013.[2] Also on that day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA)[nb 3] estimated that a tropical depression had developed near the Marshall Islands.[4] After its development, the depression turned more to the west, intensifying into Tropical Storm Joan on October\u00a014. Early in the storm's duration, neither the JTWC nor most tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated significant strengthening beyond 1-minute winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph); this was due to a fairly weak monsoon trough and normal atmospheric pressures in the region. Late on October\u00a015, the JTWC upgraded Joan to typhoon status,[2] and the JMA followed suit the next day.[4] Over a 36\u2011hour period beginning at 1800\u00a0UTC on October\u00a015, the JTWC estimated that the pressure decreased by 100\u00a0mbar (3.0\u00a0inHg), or roughly 2.4\u00a0mbar (0.071\u00a0inHg) per hour; based on the agency's assessment, Joan underwent explosive deepening during that time, reaching an estimated minimum pressure of 872\u00a0mbar (25.8\u00a0inHg). Near peak intensity, Joan had a well-defined eye within a circular area of very deep convection, organized to such an extent that it warranted a Dvorak rating of at least T8.0, the highest number on the scale used to estimate tropical cyclone intensities via satellite imagery.[2] If the estimate were correct, it would make Joan among the top five Pacific typhoons on record.[5] On October\u00a017, the JTWC estimated 1-minute peak winds of 295\u00a0km/h (183\u00a0mph), making Joan a super typhoon, the ninth of the season.[2] By contrast, the JMA estimated peak 10-minute winds of 195\u00a0km/h (121\u00a0mph) with a pressure of 905\u00a0mbar (26.7\u00a0inHg).[4] While near peak intensity on October\u00a017, Joan was located about 2,100\u00a0km (1,300\u00a0mi) east of Typhoon Ivan, which had also reached super typhoon status; the JTWC later noted that it was \"the first observation of two tropical cyclones of such extreme intensity existing simultaneously in the Northwest Pacific.\" Despite the proximity to Ivan, the two typhoons did not undergo the Fujiwhara effect. The JTWC estimated that Joan weakened slightly after reaching peak winds,[2] although the JMA maintained the typhoon at peak intensity for nearly three whole days.[4] Joan gradually turned more to the northwest, passing between Anatahan and Saipan in the Northern Marianas Islands (NMI) on October\u00a018.[2] On October\u00a020, the JMA estimated that the typhoon began weakening,[4] and on the same day Joan turned sharply to the north. On the next day, Joan weakened below super typhoon intensity for the first time in 4.5\u00a0days, a record at the time based on JTWC analysis.[2] This record was later surpassed by Typhoon Fengshen in 2002 and Typhoon Ioke in 2006.[6][7] By October\u00a021, the typhoon had accelerated to the east and was quickly weakening.[2] The next day, Joan passed about 230\u00a0km (140\u00a0mi) north of the Japanese island of Iwo Jima.[8] On October\u00a024, the typhoon turned to the northeast while losing tropical characteristics,[2] and that day the JMA ceased tracking Joan.[4] The JTWC declared the typhoon as extratropical on October\u00a025 around the same time it crossed the International Date Line.[2] Former Typhoon Joan merged with a cold front and re-intensified while approaching the Aleutian Islands, and was noted by the Mariners Weather Log as an extratropical storm on October\u00a026.[9]"

Residents were slow to prepare for the typhoon, and as a result, three people were injured while boarding up their house during the arrival of the strong winds. The passage of Joan left the entire island of Saipan without power,[10] although electrical crews quickly worked to restore the outages. During the storm's passage, about 900\u00a0people stayed in shelters,[11] after the government opened six schools for residents.[12] In nearby Anatahan, Joan left heavy damage to boats, machinery, and public buildings. The typhoon damaged various crops, and monetary damage was estimated at $200,000 (1997\u00a0USD).[10] As a result of the damage, both islands within the NMI were declared disaster areas, which allowed residents and businesses to apply for federal loans through the United States Small Business Administration.[13] While passing between Saipan and Anatahan in the NMI, the eye of Joan was visible by NEXRAD from Guam, despite being 285\u00a0km (177\u00a0mi) north of the island.[2] An outer rainband moved across the island, producing 56\u00a0mm (2.2\u00a0in) of rainfall at Anderson Air Force Base and a wind gust of 66\u00a0km/h (41\u00a0mph) at the National Weather Service office in Tiyan.[10] Typhoon Joan produced waves as high as 7\u00a0m (23\u00a0ft) in the southern islands of Japan.[8] In Chichi-jima, the typhoon dropped 115\u00a0mm (4.5\u00a0in) and brought winds as strong as 91\u00a0km/h (57\u00a0mph).[14] The combination of strong winds and high waves on the island broke a boat from a moorings, causing it to capsize when the boat struck rocks. Of the five people on board, two swam safely to shore, two were reported missing, and one person was confirmed killed.[15] The extratropical remnants of Joan also produced high swells in Hawaii, with wave heights of 4.6\u00a0m (15\u00a0ft) along northern shores.[16]"

However, in November, Tasmania began its driest eight-month period since 1885, and by the end of January 1967 the luxuriant growth in the area had dried off. Though January was a cool month, hot weather began early in February, so that in the days leading up to 7 February 1967, several bush fires were burning uncontrolled in the areas concerned. Some of these fires had been deliberately lit for burning off, despite the extremely dry conditions at the time.[citation needed] Reports into the causes of the fire stated that only 22 of the 110 fires were started accidentally.[citation needed] Shortly before midday on the 7th, a combination of extremely high temperatures, (the maximum was 39\u00a0\u00b0C (102\u00a0\u00b0F)), very low humidity and very strong winds from the northwest led to disaster. Although this fire was by far the worst in loss of life and property in Tasmanian history, the meteorological conditions are common. McArthur's report on the fire notes that \"very similar conditions have occurred on three or four occasions during the past 70 years.\"[7]"

The 2009 Black Saturday bushfires north of Melbourne, and elsewhere in Victoria, in which 173 people died, share the same commencement date of 7 February. Australian National University history professor Tom Griffiths has described the 1967 fires as marking the advent of a \"new type\" of bushfire in which suburban areas of large cities were threatened, contrasting with earlier major fires which had solely occurred in rural areas.[8]"

A powerful Category 5 super typhoon, Elsie formed out of a tropical disturbance on October\u00a013, 1989, and initially moved relatively slowly in an area of weak steering currents. On October\u00a015, the storm underwent a period of rapid intensification, attaining an intensity that corresponds to a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale. After taking a due west track towards the northern Philippines, the storm intensified further, becoming a Category 5 super typhoon hours before making landfall in Luzon. After moving inland, the typhoon rapidly weakened to a tropical storm. Once back over water in the South China Sea, wind shear prevented re-intensifcation. Elsie eventually made landfall in Vietnam on October\u00a022 and dissipated the following day over Laos. In the Philippines, Elsie worsened the situation already left in the wakes of typhoons Angela and Dan. Although it was stronger than the previous two, Elsie caused far less damage due to the relatively sparse population in the area of landfall. During the storm's passage, 47 people were killed and another 363 were injured. Damages throughout the country amounted to $35.4\u00a0million and roughly 332,000 people were left homeless."

        "content": "Super Typhoon Elsie, the third typhoon to impact the Philippines within a 12-day span during 1989, originated from a tropical upper tropospheric trough (TUTT) over the western Pacific Ocean in mid-October. By October\u00a013, a tropical disturbance developed out of the system roughly 1,240 kilometres (770\u00a0mi) east-northeast of Manila, Philippines.[1] At this time, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began to monitor the system as a tropical depression.[2] Located between two other TUTT cells, the disturbance's outflow was enhanced, allowing it to intensify. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert late on October\u00a013. Early the following day, the disturbance was designated as Tropical Depression 30W as it began to stall in an area of weak steering currents between two subtropical highs.[1] Shortly after being declared a depression, the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical storm, giving it the name Elsie.[1] At the same time, the JMA also upgraded the depression to a tropical storm.[2] By October\u00a015, Elsie began to take a slow track to the west-northwest and intensified. Later that day, a short-wave trough passed to the north of the storm, again enhancing its outflow. This led to a period of rapid intensification, during which Elsie intensified from a tropical storm to the equivalent of a high-end Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale in a 24-hour span.[1] The JMA also upgraded Elsie to a typhoon, though they reported a much more gradual rate of intensification.[1] After strengthening further to Category 4 intensity, maximum winds leveled out for most of October\u00a017.[1] On October\u00a018, another period of intensification took place as the storm neared the northern Philippines. Early in the day, Elsie was upgraded to a super typhoon, a storm with winds of at least 240\u00a0km/h (150\u00a0mph). Hours before making landfall in Luzon, the storm attained its peak intensity as a Category 5 super typhoon with winds of 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph) and a barometric pressure of 898\u00a0hPa (mbar).[1] The peak intensity of Elsie was assessed by the JMA at the same time. They reported that the typhoon attained winds of 175\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph) 10-minute sustained) and a minimum pressure of 915\u00a0hPa (mbar).[2] The center of Elsie crossed the Philippine coastline at around 0300\u00a0UTC on October\u00a019.[1] Rapid weakening took place as the storm moved over the mountainous terrain of northern Luzon. Roughly nine hours after crossing the coastline, Elsie was downgraded to a tropical storm. The weakened storm continued its westward track as it entered the South China Sea along a monsoonal surge. This surge also helped to keep Elsie as a tropical storm due to increased wind shear over the northern portion of the cyclone.[1] The JMA, unlike the JTWC, did not downgrade Elsie to a tropical storm until October\u00a021.[2] Failing to re-intensify, Elsie eventually made landfall in central Vietnam on October\u00a022 and degenerated into a remnant-low-pressure system early the following day. The remnants of Elsie were monitored by the JTWC on satellite imagery for a short time until the former typhoon dissipated over Laos.[1]"

High winds also created deadly air-borne debris, including roofing and tree limbs.[7] Downed power lines across the northern provinces left most of Luzon without power.[6] Officials stated that about 61,300 homes were either damaged or destroyed by Elsie in the Philippines.[4] In the wake of the typhoon, roughly 332,000 people were left homeless.[6] Damages sustained by agriculture amounted to \u20b1105\u00a0million ($2,253,702).[3][5] In all, Typhoon Elsie killed 47 people and injured 363 others in the Philippines, and left roughly $35.4\u00a0million in damages.[4][5] Although Elsie brushed Hainan Island in China and made landfall in northern Vietnam, little damage was reported in these regions.[1] In addition to damages caused by Brian, Angela and Dan, roughly \u00a51.9\u00a0billion ($278.3\u00a0million) was left in damages.[8] Following the storm, the Red Cross and World Food Council (UNDRO) set up shelters and began assisting residents in need of food and shelter. Several thousand residents were provided food, clothing and shelter across the country in mass-feeding shelters. The UNDRO also contributed $461,000 in funds to the Philippines. Another $46,000 was provided by the Government of Norway and the Catholic Relief Services donated $50,000. The Government of Japan provided $300,000 and the Government of the United States donated $25,000 in response to the overall effects of Elsie and the three preceding storms. Two other non-governmental organizations, the Lutheran World Federation and World Council of Churches allocated $10,000 and $30,000, respectively, for the Philippines.[4] "

Originating from a tropical disturbance over the South China Sea on August\u00a019, Zita tracked westward as it quickly strengthened within a region of light wind shear, attaining winds of 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph) as it made landfall along the Leizhou Peninsula early on August\u00a022. Maintaining this intensity, the storm made a second landfall in northern Vietnam later that day before rapidly weakening over land. The remnants of Zita were last noted over extreme northwestern Vietnam on August\u00a024. Although a relatively weak system, Tropical Storm Zita caused significant damage in Southern China. There, seven people were known to have been killed by the storm and damage reached $433\u00a0million (1997\u00a0USD). However, a report from Dartmouth College states that 345 people were killed by the storm. In Vietnam, significantly less damage took place; no fatalities were reported and losses reached $5\u00a0million (1997\u00a0USD)."

By August\u00a020, a low-level circulation developed and deep convection persisted around the center. Situated within an easterly flow, the system tracked westward towards the southern Chinese island of Hainan as it strengthened. Later that day, a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert was issued for the disturbance;[1] around the same time, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began monitoring the system as a tropical depression.[2] Hours later, the JTWC classified the depression as Tropical Storm Zita, the 15th named storm of the season.[1] Early the next day, the JMA followed suit and upgraded Zita to a tropical storm according to ten-minute sustained wind standards.[2] Additionally, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration issued a few advisories on the system as it existed within their area of responsibility, during which time it was given the local Filipino name Luming.[3] Situated in a region with little to no wind shear, the storm's outflow quickly became established and banding features wrapped around the periphery. Despite Zita's proximity to China's coastline, it was able to intensify into a typhoon by August\u00a022, attaining winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph), equivalent to a Category\u00a01 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale. Strengthening continued until Zita made landfall along the Leizhou Peninsula around 0600\u00a0UTC with winds of 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph).[1] At landfall, the JMA assessed the storm to have been slightly weaker, estimating it to have peaked as a severe tropical storm with ten-minute sustained winds of 100\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph) and a barometric pressure of 980 mbar (hPa; 28.94\u00a0inHg).[2] Although the storm moved over land, it maintained its intensity as it entered the Gulf of Tonkin. Around 2200\u00a0UTC, Zita made its final landfall near C\u1ea9m Ph\u1ea3, Vietnam. Rapid weakening ensued as it moved further inland. Early on August\u00a023, the JTWC issued their final advisory on the storm as it weakened to a tropical depression.[1] However, the JMA continued to monitor Zita until it dissipated early on August\u00a024 over extreme northwestern Vietnam.[2]"

        "content": " Tropical Storm Erika was one of the deadliest and most destructive natural disasters in Dominica since Hurricane David in 1979. The fifth named storm of the 2015 Atlantic hurricane season, Erika developed from a westward-moving tropical wave while well east of the Lesser Antilles. Hostile conditions, including dry air and wind shear, inhibited significant development, and Erika failed to acquire sustained winds beyond 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h). Contrary to predictions of a northwesterly recurvature, the cyclone persisted on a westerly course and passed through the Leeward Islands and emerged over the Caribbean Sea on August\u00a027. Erika succumbed to adverse conditions the following day, dissipating as a tropical cyclone near the Dominican Republic. The remnant system persisted for several more days, moving into the northeastern Gulf of Mexico, before dissipating over Georgia on September\u00a03. Several islands experienced heavy rainfall during the passage of Erika, especially Dominica. The storm's asymmetric structure, coupled with the mountainous terrain of the island and ample moisture aloft, led to rainfall accumulations up to 33\u00a0in (850\u00a0mm). With grounds already saturated from antecedent rainfall, tremendous runoff quickly overwhelmed river basins and triggered catastrophic floods. Accompanying mudslides worsened the situation, temporarily damming the rivers before collapsing. Hundreds of homes were left uninhabitable and thousands of people were displaced; the entire town of Petite Savanne was evacuated and subsequently abandoned as a result of the storm. All told, 30\u00a0people died across the island in the nation's worst disaster since Hurricane David. The storm's devastating effects in Dominica prompted an influx of international assistance. Aid from multiple nations and intergovernmental organizations poured in to assist victims of the storm. Thousands of homes needed to be built or repaired, including 500\u20131,000 for the relocation of all of Petite Savanne's residents. Recovery in Dominica was halted in September\u00a02017 by Hurricane Maria, a Category\u00a05 hurricane that wrought far greater devastation on the island. In Guadeloupe, heavy rainfall in the vicinity of Basse-Terre caused flooding and mudslides, forcing roads to temporarily close. Approximately 250,000\u00a0people in Puerto Rico were left without electricity. The island experienced US$17.37\u00a0million[nb 1] in agricultural damage. In the Dominican Republic, a weather station in Barahona measured 24.26\u00a0in (616\u00a0mm) of rain, including 8.8\u00a0in (220\u00a0mm) in a single hour. About 823\u00a0homes suffered damage and 7,345 people were displaced. Five people died in Haiti, four from a weather-related traffic accident and one from a landslide. Total damage from Erika is estimated to be over US$500\u00a0million, with US$482.8\u00a0million in Dominica alone."

        "content": "On August\u00a020, 2015, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring a tropical wave over western Africa, near the Atlantic shore.[1] The disorganized system emerged over the Atlantic Ocean several hundred miles southeast of the Cape Verde Islands the following day.[2][3] Moving quickly west, the system bypassed the Cape Verde Islands to the south on August\u00a022,[4] but remained largely disorganized. A sharp trough developed within expanding deep convection on August\u00a023, though a well-defined circulation did not consolidate.[2] Organization of the low improved throughout the day as environmental conditions favored tropical cyclogenesis.[5] The trough acquired gale-force winds the following day and finally developed a closed circulation by 18:00\u00a0UTC. The formation of a closed low marked the transition into a tropical cyclone; accordingly, the system was classified as Tropical Storm Erika, the fifth named storm of the annual hurricane season. Upon its designation, Erika was situated roughly 1,035\u00a0mi (1,665\u00a0km) east of the Lesser Antilles.[2] The storm maintained a brisk westward trajectory, steered by a subtropical ridge to the north.[2][6] At the time of Erika's classification, forecast models diverged significantly on the potential future of the storm. Statistical guidance and the HWRF depicted a hurricane while the ECMWF and GFS showed a weaker system due to increasing wind shear. The models that intensified the storm indicated a more northerly track while those that kept it weaker had the system continuing along a westward course. Accordingly, the NHC noted low confidence in their five-day forecast for Erika.[6] This uncertainty ultimately reflected in above-average forecast errors when compared to all tropical cyclones, but roughly average for weak, poorly organized systems.[7] Throughout August\u00a025 and into early August\u00a026, the convective organization of Erika fluctuated due to wind shear and entrainment of dry air, periodically leaving the center of circulation devoid of convection.[8] Early on August\u00a027, Erika managed to intensify slightly, attaining its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) and a barometric pressure of 1,001\u00a0mbar (29.6\u00a0inHg).[2] Around  09:00\u00a0UTC, the disorganized center of Erika passed near the northern tip of Guadeloupe, before emerging over the eastern Caribbean Sea.[2] Convection remained poorly-organized and mostly confined to eastern portions of the cyclone, as it traversed the eastern Caribbean Sea.[9] Multiple circulation centers were noted during the overnight of August\u00a027\u201328, all rotating around a broad general center. One such center moved over St. Croix and produced gale-force gusts. Environmental conditions ahead of the storm became increasingly hostile, and forecasters at the NHC continued to note unusually high uncertainty in their forecasts.[10] Further structural degradation ensued on August\u00a028 as Erika approached the Dominican Republic. Based on data from Hurricane Hunters, Erika degenerated into a broad area of low pressure\u2014no longer meeting the definition of a tropical cyclone\u2014shortly after 12:00\u00a0UTC, near the southeastern coast of the Dominican Republic.[2] Operationally, the NHC maintained advisories on Erika until 13:30\u00a0UTC on August\u00a029.[11] It was also noted during those advisories that the center was completely devoid of convection, and whatever convection remained was reduced to the eastern half of the system.[12] Around 21:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a028, the remnants of Erika made landfall along the southeastern coast of the Dominican Republic.[13] The disheveled system emerged over the Windward Passage early on August\u00a029.[12] Thereafter, the system skirted the northern coast of Cuba and entered the Gulf of Mexico on August\u00a031. Turning northward, the disturbance eventually crossed northern Florida on September\u00a02, before dissipating over Georgia on the following day.[2]"

All non-essential government personnel were given administrative leave on August\u00a027. Owing to rough seas, local ports temporarily closed. Although airports remained open, several airlines cancelled flights.[15] A territory-wide curfew was imposed until the afternoon of August\u00a028.[16] Schools, ports, and beaches were closed across the Dominican Republic.[17] The Army of the Dominican Republic deployed 275\u00a0soldiers and alongside the nation's Air Force, assisted with the evacuation of residents. The Navy was placed on standby for potential search and rescue operations.[18] Officials in Haiti suspended air service, banned highway travel between departments, and ordered small watercraft to remain at port.[19] Evacuation shelters were opened across all departments and 254\u00a0prisoners were relocated from Gona\u00efves to three other facilities.[20]"

Orographic influence exacerbated rainfall rates, and this was further compounded with the formation of a temporary mesoscale low over the island as the primary circulation of Erika continued west.[50] More than 8\u00a0in (200\u00a0mm) of rain fell across the entire island in less than 48\u00a0hours, with an island-wide average of 24\u00a0in (610\u00a0mm).[nb 3] During the period of heaviest rain, average rainfall across the entire island exceeded 3.5\u00a0in (90\u00a0mm) per hour. Rates along the Macoucherie River reached 11\u00a0in (270\u00a0mm) per hour. The heaviest rain was concentrated around the nation's tallest mountain, Morne Diablotins, where an estimated 31 to 33\u00a0in (800 to 850\u00a0mm) fell. Rainfall across Morne Diablotin National Park generally exceeded 24\u00a0in (600\u00a0mm). A secondary peak accumulation of 26 to 28\u00a0in (650 to 700\u00a0mm) occurred in the southeastern part of the island around Morne Trois Pitons.[51] Observed accumulations include 17\u00a0in (430\u00a0mm) at Gleau Gommier,[52] 12.62\u00a0in (321\u00a0mm) at Canefield Airport, and 8.74\u00a0in (222\u00a0mm) at Douglas\u2013Charles Airport.[2] With grounds already saturated from nearly two weeks of rain prior to Erika, much of the precipitation did not penetrate the surface; in multiple watersheds, runoff exceeded 60\u00a0percent of accumulations.[51] Catastrophic flash flooding and mudslides ensued across the island,[2] resulting in Dominica's worst natural disaster since Hurricane David in 1979.[53][54] Across the island's rugged terrain, the mudslides temporarily dammed overflowing rivers creating a buildup of water. These earthen dams subsequently collapsed, leading to amplified flooding downstream. Flow rates in these localized events vastly exceeded values expected by International Commission on Large Dams modeling. A post-storm study of 16\u00a0rivers on the island revealed peak discharge values in excess of 1,000\u00a0m3/s along 5 rivers, with a maximum of 2,876\u00a0m3/s along the Malabuka River.[51] Nearly 17,000 of the nation's 71,293\u00a0people were severely impacted by the storm.[55] A total of 30\u00a0people were killed,[2] 20\u00a0others were injured, and 574\u00a0people were left homeless.[30][31] More than 890\u00a0homes were destroyed or rendered uninhabitable.[56] Infrastructure suffered tremendous damage: 6\u00a0percent of bridges and 17\u00a0percent of roads were wiped out. Furthermore, half of the nation's bridges and a quarter of its roads were damaged.[57] Total losses amounted to EC$1.3\u00a0billion (US$482.8 million), roughly 90\u00a0percent of Dominica's gross domestic product.[31] Dominica Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit stated in a national announcement on August\u00a028 that, \"The visual damage I saw today, I fear, may have set our development process back by 20 years\".[19] Flooding crippled transportation and communication, with eight bridges severely damaged or destroyed, leaving many areas of the island isolated.[31][58] Boetica and Delices remained cut-off by ground for more than three weeks.[59] More than 12\u00a0major rivers topped their banks.[60] Approximately 45\u00a0percent of residents lost electricity,[58] and almost the entirety of the water supply network was damaged.[31] Additionally, 50\u00a0percent of telephone service was lost.[58] Both Canefield and Douglas\u2013Charles airports were flooded, with water rising above a small airplane at the latter.[61] Douglas\u2013Charles Airport sustained more than EC$39.5\u00a0million (US$14.6\u00a0million) in damage and was closed until September\u00a018.[62][63] The main river running through Roseau, the nation's capital, burst its banks during the overnight of August 26\u201327, flooding surrounding areas.[64] One person was killed during a mudslide and one building collapsed in the city.[61][65] The small community of Petite Savanne was virtually destroyed, with 217\u00a0homes leveled and all residents forced to evacuate.[66][67] Twenty people died or were presumed dead in the village, accounting for two-thirds of the deaths attributed to Erika in Dominica.[2][68] Residents dug through mud and debris, often with their bare hands, to rescue those trapped and in many cases did so with nearby homes on the verge of collapse.[60] The village was isolated for several days and residents buried victims before help arrived.[69]"

Approximately 100\u00a0personnel were deployed for various relief measures, including search and rescue.[72] The Dominica Spa Health and Wellness Association worked in conjunction with the Trinidad-based Centre for Human Development to provide psychological support to victims;[73] eight trauma specialists were sent to Dominica.[74] The psychiatric unit of Princess Margaret Hospital conducted field assessments and provided emotional support to residents. In a report on September\u00a018, they noted that residents in Coulibistrie remained in a state of shock for weeks after Erika, with many struggling to begin the recovery process.[75] The Ministry of Health highlighted concerns over post-storm diseases, particularly from mosquitoes, due to a major increase in the usage of water storage containers.[76] An outbreak of Gastroenteritis ensued in the weeks following Erika, with 153\u00a0cases confirmed by September\u00a022.

This served as the primary means of aid until a 98\u00a0ft (30\u00a0m) Bailey bridge was constructed.[78] By April\u00a02016, the cost of infrastructure rehabilitation projects  reached EC$7\u00a0million (US$3\u00a0million).[79] Supplementing reconstruction efforts by China and the United Kingdom, the nation's government allocated a further EC$30\u00a0million (US$11\u00a0million) to enhancing road safety.[80] The Food and Agriculture Organization allocated EC$300,000 (US$110,000) for farmers in October.[81] Through June\u00a02016, the government provided victims with EC$5\u20136\u00a0million (US$1.8\u20132.2\u00a0million), primarily to cover shelters and food.[82]"

The IFRC's primary goal was to restore access to clean water; more than half a million litres of water was provided during the seven-month operation. In regards to health, psychosocial support was made available to 873\u00a0people, roughly half of the original goal. Hygiene awareness and distribution of kits proved successful, with all 1,000\u00a0kits supplied to those in need. The Dominican Red Cross mass-promoted the Red Cross First Aid mobile app to 8,000\u00a0phones, though only 399 people downloaded it. Cash grants of US$334\u2014by way of Visa debit cards\u2014were provided to 279\u00a0families to cover lost property. A total of 1,000\u00a0mattresses were provided to survivors and a request for additional beds was made; however, limited funds prevented fulfillment.[111] In March\u00a02017, the CDEMA approved a \u20ac9.6\u00a0million (US$10.5\u00a0million) plan to address gaps in Dominica's disaster response legislation uncovered during the response to Erika.[112]"

Parliamentary Representative Kenneth Darroux pleaded with residents to be understanding and patient with those whom were displaced.[114] Plans for a new settlement were established in February\u00a02016, with plans to build 500\u20131,000\u00a0homes.[113] The government provided displaced residents with EC$1,000 per family to handle rent.[115] Similarly, all residents of Dubique were forced to evacuate; they were relocated to temporary homes in Grand Bay provided by Venezuela.[113] Ten two- and three-bedroom homes were provided by the ADRA. Costs for resettlement and reconstruction exceeded EC$91\u00a0million (US$14.3\u00a0million).[116] Power was restored to all areas of the nation, except for Petite Savanne and Dubique, by September\u00a028.[117] Restoration to the nation's water system was completed in January\u00a02016; however, permanent systems were still to be constructed.[118] French organizations provided  \u20ac70,000 (US$77,000) for the reconstruction of two schools.[119] Repair of Douglas\u2013Charles airport was deemed a priority, though the first phase of rehabilitation for runways and aprons took more than a year to complete. In addition to repairs, greater flood defense systems were implemented, including dredging, flood walls, and river training.[120] Construction of 25\u00a0planned homes by the ADRA began in February\u00a02016, with projected completion in 2017; 50\u00a0volunteers were involved in the project.[121] In April\u00a02016, a library built in 1902 was converted into the \"Post Erika Reconstruction Center\", spearheaded by Baroness Patricia Scotland.[122] Contracts for roadway repairs between St. Joseph and Layou were signed that month.[115] In November\u00a02016, Dominica signed an agreement with the European Union for an \u20ac8.9\u00a0million (US$9.6\u00a0million) rehabilitation project.[123] In a join Dominica\u2013United Kingdom project, a new road from Loubiere to Bagatelle in southeastern Dominica was announced in March\u00a02017. The EC$100\u00a0million (US$37\u00a0million) plan would ensure the road could handle heavy rain events, with 12\u201314\u00a0culverts and 3\u00a0bridges. Furthermore, road edge failure issues were to be addressed.[124] On September\u00a018\u201319, 2017, Hurricane Maria struck Dominica as a Category\u00a05 hurricane, the first such storm of that intensity on record in the nation.[125] An estimated 98\u00a0percent of the island's structures were damaged or destroyed and agriculture was devastated.[126] The Assessment Capacities Project estimated total losses of EC$3.69\u00a0billion (US$1.37\u00a0billion), equal to 226 percent of Dominica's 2016 GDP.[127] A total of 65\u00a0fatalities have been confirmed across the island, including 34 who are missing and presumed to be dead.[128]"

The worst damage along its 6.9-mile-long (11.1\u00a0km) path was in midtown Tulsa (between South Sheridan Road and South Yale Avenue, near East 41st Street South), where several buildings had their roofs removed and outer walls collapsed. The 18-story Remington Tower office building (near Skelly Drive and 41st Street) underwent dramatic facade and window damage. Many offices in the building were further damaged by having equipment and furnishings inside sucked through the windows and falling to the ground below. The tornado also caused roof and structural damage to Promenade Mall and impacted infrastructure at the BOK Financial Corporation operations center (near 41st and Sheridan), rendering its online, mobile and automated telephone systems inoperable.  More than 7 people were rescued from T.G.I. Friday's at 41st and Yale Avenue, after the roof collapsed into the building.[9][10][11][12][13] This was the first tornado to hit the Tulsa area in the month of August since 1958 (and only the 3rd to strike the area since 1950), the tornado injured 26 people \u2013 with two seriously injured \u2013 in the east part of the city.  Even with the tornado detectable on radar, the Tulsa County Emergency Management Agency did not begin civil defense sirens in the area because the National Weather Service did not issue a tornado warning until 1:25\u00a0a.m., after which time an EF1 tornado had entered Broken Arrow, damaging multiple home roofs and several large tree branches.[14][15]  A second EF1 tornado hit east of Oologah at 1:32\u00a0a.m. CDT (06:32 UTC), damaging several trees, barns and a home, downing multiple telephone poles.[10][16]"

As the system continued to strengthen, the JMA upgraded the depression to a storm at 1200 UTC and named it Shanshan,[4] a girls' given name submitted by Hong Kong. The HKO did the same at the same time, upgrading the depression to a storm.[5] The storm quickly strengthened, being upgraded twice by the JMA on September 11, at 0600 UTC to a severe tropical storm and at 1800 UTC to a typhoon,[4] becoming the seventh official typhoon of the season. It then took on a more west-northwesterly track, weakening while undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle on September 14. However, it restrengthened, reaching its maximum intensity of 110 knots (200\u00a0km/h; 130\u00a0mph) from the JMA and 120 knots (220\u00a0km/h; 140\u00a0mph) from the JTWC before passing Iriomote on September 15.[6] Originally expected by the JTWC to pass to the east of Okinawa Island, a subtropical high-pressure ridge south of the main Japanese islands forced the storm to take a more westward track, pushing it towards Taiwan.[7] Shortly later, Shanshan passed directly over Iriomote. PAGASA issued their final advisory later on September 16. Peak intensity for Typhoon Luis as reported by PAGASA while it was in their area of responsibility was only 80 knots (150\u00a0km/h; 92\u00a0mph).[4] Shanshan made landfall on September 17 on the island of Ky\u016bsh\u016b. The HKO issued their final track forecast on the weakening typhoon later that day as it passed out of their area of responsibility, with the peak intensity while within HKO's area of responsibility set at 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph; 100\u00a0kn).[5] The JTWC declared the system extratropical shortly after. The JMA downgraded the typhoon to a severe tropical storm at 0000 UTC September 18. Just before crossing the island of Hokkaid\u014d, according to the JMA's best-track graphic, Severe Tropical Storm Shanshan became extratropical twelve hours later.[8] The extratropical storm was tracked by the JMA in their high seas marine warnings until September 22.[4]"

Okinawa was put under Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness (TCCOR) 1-E, which means that all outdoor activities are prohibited as there are sustained winds of at least 50 knots (93\u00a0km/h; 58\u00a0mph) in force, on September 16, with over 100 flights into and out of Naha International Airport on the island cancelled. Kadena Air Base moved various aircraft to other undisclosed locations in the Pacific.[11] Sasebo Naval Base declared TCCOR 1-E on September 17.[12] The USS Harpers Ferry (LSD-49) and USS Juneau (LPD-10) both left the base, while the USS Patriot (MCM-7) was moved to a wet berth.[13] Only one vessel, the USS Tortuga (LSD-46) remained in port for repairs,[11] because authorities thought that the ship could withstand the storm.[13] Elsewhere in Japan, some flights and Shinkansen bullet trains were delayed or cancelled.[14][15] In Miyazaki and Hiroshima prefectures, evacuation orders were issued for almost 170 families. In Ky\u016bsh\u016b, 10,000\u00a0people voluntarily evacuated their houses for higher ground. The island's seven main airports were closed, causing 41,900 passengers to be stranded when 357 flights were cancelled.[12] Ahead of an expected landfall on Hokkaid\u014d, the JMA warned residents of the possibility of high winds.[14] Typhoon warnings were issued for Jeju and the southern and eastern coasts of South Korea ahead of the storm. Passenger ships normally serving Jeju Island remained in port.[16] In Busan, ports were closed, and in Ulsan, 1,600 ships remained in port. In South Gyeongsang Province, authorities banned departures from the port at Tongyeong, stranding over 16,000 fishing boats.[16] The Korean Coast Guard said that a total of 52,000 ships remained at ports across the nation.

Eight vessels were reported to have capsized.[11] At Kadena Air Base, 2 inches (51\u00a0mm) of rain were reported, with a maximum gust of 63\u00a0mph (101\u00a0km/h) recorded.[12] Naha International Airport on Okinawa reported a recorded maximum wind gust to 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h).[12] In Motobu, Okinawa, high waves damaged the local port and swept 30 cargo containers to sea,[21] while in Okinawa City, six injuries were reported. One building in the city suffered a wall collapse, and at least 70\u00a0houses were damaged.[21] Off Ky\u016bsh\u016b, a Maldives-registered[22] car ferry capsized, killing one crew member.[18][23] A train was derailed,[14] possibly due to a tornado,[2] injuring five people.[23] On the island, an electrician in Fukuoka Prefecture died after an industrial container at his firm fell on top of him, crushing him.[22] A glass entrance of a supermarket in Nobeoka broke on impact with flying debris, killing one person. Elsewhere in the prefecture, a 42-year-old man died in his bedroom when it was crushed, while an elderly woman farmer died when she was hit by a fallen tree outside a greenhouse. Three other deaths were confirmed on the island.[22] Meanwhile, in Hiroshima Prefecture, a 50-year-old firefighter was killed when he drowned after being swept away by rising flood waters. A journalist went missing in similar circumstances, and was found dead a few days later.[14][15] In all, Typhoon Shanshan killed 11\u00a0people and injured over 260 others.[14][23] Shanshan is also credited with US$4.9\u00a0million worth of net losses in the third financial quarter for IPC Holdings, Ltd.[24]"

The next day before Maysak re-entered PAGASA's area of responsibility, the JMA reported that Maysak had weakened into a tropical storm and then into a tropical depression, and released their final full advisory on Maysak.[13][14] However the JTWC were reporting at this time that Maysak was still a tropical storm.[11] Maysak then moved back into PAGASA's area of responsibility later that day, at this time PAGASA thought that Maysak was still a tropical storm.[15] The JTWC downgraded Maysak to a tropical depression and released their final advisory early on November 10.[16] PAGASA also downgraded Maysak to a tropical depression at this time however they kept issuing warnings until early the next afternoon when they released their final advisory on Quinta.[17] On November 12, PAGASA started to reissue advisories on Quinta, and renamed the system Siony.[18] The JMA were also still monitoring Siony as a minor tropical depression at this time, whilst the JTWC assessed Maysak's remnants chances of regenerating into a significant tropical cyclone as fair.[19][20] Later that day the JTWC upgraded the remnants chances of regenerating as good and released a tropical cyclone formation alert.[21] Later that day PAGASA released their final advisory on tropical depression Siony as it had moved out of their area of responsibility and was moving towards Vietnam in the west.[22] Late the next day the JTWC cancelled the tropical cyclone formation alert as they had reassessed Maysak chances of forming into a significant tropical cyclone within 24 hours as poor.[23] Early the next day the JMA released their final advisory on tropical depression Maysak whilst later that morning the JTWC declared that Maysak had dissipated."

Many were built during the Great Leap Forward.[2][5][8][9][10] The construction of the dams focused heavily on the goal of retaining water and overlooked their capacities to prevent floods, while the quality of the dams was also compromised due to the Great Leap Forward.[2][5][8][9] The Banqiao dam had been designed for a calculated one in a thousand year rainfall event of 300\u00a0mm per day; however, more than the normal yearly rainfall (1,060\u00a0mm) fell in just one day near the typhoon center.[11][12] Some experts have also stated that the focus on peasant steel production during the Great Leap Forward, as well as a number of policies from the campaign to \"Learn from Dazhai in agriculture\", severely damaged the ecosystem and forest cover in the region, which was a major cause of the flood, and the government's mishandling of the dam failure contributed to its severity.[5][8] In the aftermath, various elements of the Chinese government concealed the details of the disaster until the 1990s, when the book The Great Floods in China's History (\u4e2d\u56fd\u5386\u53f2\u5927\u6d2a\u6c34), prefaced by former Minister of Water Resources Qian Zhengying, revealed details of the disaster to the public for the first time.[5][8][9][12][13] The official documents of the disaster were declassified in 2005 by the Chinese government.[9][12][14] In May 2005, the Banqiao Dam failure was rated #1 in \"The Ultimate 10 Technological Disasters\" of the world by Discovery Channel, outranking the Chernobyl disaster.[4][5][15]"

The runoff of Banqiao Dam was 13,000 m3 per second in vs. 78,800m3 per second out, and as a result 701 million m3 of water was released in 6 hours,[12] while 1.67 billion m3 of water was released in 5.5 hours at an upriver Shimantan Dam, and 15.738 billion m3 of water was released in total.[3] The resulting flood waters caused a wave 10 kilometers (6.2\u00a0mi) wide and 3\u20137 meters (9.8\u201323.0\u00a0ft) high in Suiping that rushed onto the plains below at nearly 50 kilometers per hour (31\u00a0mph), almost wiping out an area 55 kilometers (34\u00a0mi) long and 15 kilometers (9.3\u00a0mi) wide, and creating temporary lakes as large as 12,000 square kilometers (4,600\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). Seven county seats, Suiping, Xiping, Ru'nan, Pingyu, Xincai, Luohe, and Linquan were inundated, as were thousands of square kilometers of countryside and countless communities. Evacuation orders had not been fully delivered due to weather conditions and poor communications. Telegraphs failed, signal flares fired by Unit 34450 were misunderstood, telephones were rare, and some messengers were caught by the flood.[3] To protect other dams from failure, several flood diversion areas were evacuated and inundated, and several dams were deliberately destroyed by air strikes to release water in desired directions. The Nihewa and Laowangpo flood diversion areas downstream of the dams soon exceeded their capacity and gave up part of their storage on August 8, forcing more flood diversion areas to begin to evacuate.[3]"

The typhoon was blocked for two days before its direction ultimately changed from northeastward to westward.[28] As a result of this near stationary thunderstorm system, more than a year's worth of rain fell within 24 hours, which weather forecasts failed to predict.[12] New records were set, at 189.5 millimetres (7.46\u00a0in) rainfall per hour and 1,060 millimetres (42\u00a0in) per day, exceeding the average annual precipitation of about 800 millimetres (31\u00a0in).[12] China Central Television reported that the typhoon disappeared from radar as it degraded.[17] According to Xinhua, the forecast was for rainfall of 100\u00a0mm by the Beijing-based Central Meteorological Observatory.[12] After the flood, a summit of National Flood Prevention and Reservoir Security at Zhengzhou, Henan was held by the Department of Water Conservancy and Electricity, and a nationwide reservoir security examination was performed."

The storms also produced a family of tornadoes that moved through the area. At 9:20\u00a0a.m. the first tornado, rated an F2, touched down 6 miles north of New Bethlehem in Clarion County. It tracked southeast into Jefferson County through Langville. The tornado lifted 1.5 miles west of Oliveburg. The tornado uprooted trees and rolled a mobile home, about a mile north of Truttsburg, damaged some homes, farms, and crops, and downed extensive swaths of trees along its path. It was on the ground for about 10 miles and averaged 100 yards in width. At 9:45 am, just 5 minutes after the first tornado dissipated, a second F2 touched down 1.5 miles southeast of Punxsutawney. The tornado touched down in Jefferson County and traveled southeast into northeastern Indiana County northeast of Glen Campbell. In Jefferson county, damage was confined to trees. The tornado then strengthened and began to cause even more severe damage just east of Rossiter Here, the tornado tore the roof off of a barn that a child, who was playing outside, had sought shelter in. Three of the four walls of the barn also collapsed. The child was not injured, but a horse that was inside the barn was sucked out and thrown 75 feet into a field. The tornado then traveled up a hill and significantly damaged one mobile home and destroyed a second after carrying it at least 75 yards across a road and smashing it against a row of trees. Three people inside the mobile home were injured, one critically. By this time, the tornado had reached its peak intensity of high-end F2. A nearby wood-frame house was destroyed and dense areas of trees felled or snapped. About a dozen other homes sustained damaged in this area, 5 extensively. 30 pound cinder blocks from a garage were thrown approximately 300 yards up a nearby hill where a stronger suction vortex was noted. The tornado then tracked into Clearfield County, causing tree damage. The tornado then crossed Five Points into Cambria County across Glendale Lake in Prince Gallitzin State Park before ending 2 miles east of Frugality near the Blair County border, about 30 miles from its starting point. The storm damaged several mobile homes and farms in Five Points, picked a boat out the water on Glendale Lake and felled many trees in the park. A herringbone tree pattern was noted along with suction vortex damage to crops. Around 11:00 AM, another F2 tornado touched down 2 miles east of Colver in Cambria County and tracked 6 miles southeast before ending 1 mile west of Loretto. The path width was 100 yard wide. Two homes and a barn were destroyed, several roofs and a second barn were also damaged. A central suction vortex was visible in crop damage. At about the same time the tornado mentioned above formed, an F1 tornado touched down 2 miles northeast of Altoona in Blair County on Brush Mountain. This tornado moved southeast, taking down a swath of trees and caused and causing minor damage to homes along a 1.5 mile path near Sickles Corner. The path width was up to .5 miles wide. Several other tornadoes touched down across Pennsylvania, Maryland, and several other states later in the day. A total of 20 tornadoes touched down, injuring nine.[13][14]"

        "content": "Super Typhoon Kate was first identified by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) on October\u00a07, 1970, and by the Japan Meteorological Agency on October\u00a09, 1970 as a tropical disturbance near the Marshall Islands. The system tracked in a general westward direction and relocated itself further south during this period in response to Typhoon Joan wake to the northwest. By October\u00a013, convection sharply increased as the system entered a region of strong diffluence. The following day, the disturbance featured a marked increase in organization as thunderstorms continued to consolidate around the center of circulation. During the afternoon of October\u00a015, reconnaissance aircraft reached the storm and reported that it was already nearing typhoon status. Sustained winds were measured at 110\u00a0km/h (68\u00a0mph) along with a barometric pressure of 985\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.12\u00a0inHg).[2] At this time the storm was classified as Tropical Storm Kate, the 18th named storm of the 1970 season.[3] Additionally, the storm had begun developing an eyewall, an indication that the system was likely to intensify further. Over the following three days, the storm continued its westward track while gaining strength.[2] Throughout the day on October\u00a016, Kate underwent a period of rapid intensification. During this time, sustained winds increased from 140 to 215\u00a0km/h (87 to 134\u00a0mph), ranking Kate as a Category\u00a04 typhoon on the modern day Saffir\u2013Simpson Hurricane Scale.[4] Early on October\u00a017, reconnaissance planes flown into the typhoon measured the eye to be 18.5\u00a0km (11.5\u00a0mi) in diameter. Although winds were still increasing, the lowest pressure recorded in relation to Kate was measured at this time at 940\u00a0mbar (hPa; 27.7\u00a0inHg).[5] As the typhoon neared the southeastern Philippine island of Mindanao on October\u00a018, it further intensified. Just before making landfall roughly 45\u00a0km (28\u00a0mi) south of Davao City in the Davao Region, Kate attained its peak winds of 240\u00a0km/h (150\u00a0mph), classifying it as a super typhoon according to the JTWC.[4] As the storm moved over land, the eye abruptly shrank to 7.4\u00a0km (4.6\u00a0mi) in diameter but this feature dissipated hours later.[5] Due to the interaction with the mountainous terrain of the Philippines, Kate quickly weakened as it moved northwestward across the archipelago. By October\u00a019, the system had weakened to a tropical storm, less than 24\u00a0hours after attaining its peak winds.[4] Despite the notable weakening, the structure of the storm remained relatively intact as it moved over the Sulu Sea.[2] Throughout the day, the system briefly sped up before rapidly slowing near the South China Sea.[4] On October\u00a020, decreased interaction with land allowed Kate to re-attain typhoon status just before passing over Busuanga Island.[2] Continuing its northwest track, the typhoon slowly intensified and redeveloped a 37\u00a0mi (23\u00a0mi) wide eye. Late on October\u00a021, the JTWC assessed the storm to have re-attained Category\u00a04 intensity;[5] however, post-storm analysis indicated that sustained winds did not exceed 195\u00a0km/h (121\u00a0mph).[4] The following day, a ridge to the north of Kate prevented the system from tracking further north and prompted a west-southwestward track.[6] Gradual weakening took place over the following several days as Kate slowly neared the Indochina coastline. By October\u00a024, winds had decreased below 155\u00a0km/h (96\u00a0mph) and the eye became asymmetrical and partially open in the northeast quadrant.[4][7] On October\u00a025, the typhoon further weakened to a tropical storm just off the coast of Vietnam. Later that day, the system made its final landfall near Da Nang, Vietnam with winds of 100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph).[4][6] Rapid weakening ensued as Kate moved over the high terrain of southeast Asia, with the storm degrading to a tropical depression within six\u00a0hours of moving inland.[4] The system dissipated within the next 24\u00a0hours as it moved over the plateau region of Cambodia.[6]\nBoth JTWC and JMA released their final advisories as Kate dissipated over Vietnam."

Typhoons rarely hit the island, often curving northward and making landfall in the more northern parts of the country. When Kate made landfall in southern Mindanao, the large loss of life from the typhoon is thought to be related to the lack of tropical cyclone experience for its residents.[2] In southern Mindanao, over 5,000 houses and other such structures were damaged or destroyed by storm surge, heavy rains and strong winds produced by Typhoon Kate. Damage from the storm was estimated at $50\u00a0million, making it one of the costliest typhoons on record at the time. A total of 631 people were confirmed to have been killed by the storm and 284 others were listed as missing, ranking Kate as one of the deadliest typhoons to strike the Philippines at the time.[2] An American newspaper, The Lewiston Daily Sun (now known as the Sun Journal) incorrectly dubbed Kate as the deadliest typhoon to ever hit the Philippines, as typhoons Amy and Trix in the early 1950s had higher death tolls compared to Kate (991 and 995, respectively), as well as that the previous deadliest typhoon was a storm in the 1960s which killed 200 people in Manila (possibly referring to either Tropical Storm Lucille in 1960 or Typhoon Winnie in 1964).[8] Initial reports from the Red Cross indicated that at least 150 homes were destroyed within hours of Kate's landfall. Telecommunication was lost to much of the region as power lines were down after being pummeled by high winds.[9] Within a day of the storm's passage, the death toll had reached 13 with 29 others missing and was expected to increase.[10]"

Roughly 900 people were evacuated the first day after Kate by Marine Aircraft Group 16, and over 9,000 South Vietnamese were rescued by the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing, in Vietnam to fight the Vietnam War.[12]"

A steady intensification carried Tropical Storm Patsy's windspeeds up to 155\u00a0mph (250\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 918\u00a0mbar. It made landfall in Luzon with sustained winds of 130\u00a0mph (210\u00a0km/h) on November 19.[3] After emerging in the South China Sea, Patsy remained at tropical storm strength. It struck Vietnam during the Vietnam War as a weak tropical storm on November 22. The 8-day-old cyclone dissipated shortly after its final landfall. US$80\u00a0million ($403\u00a0million in 2005) in damage was reported to have been caused by Patsy, though the total was likely higher.

Warm waters and weakened shear allowed the storm to organize into Tropical Depression 27W on November 14 near the Marianas Islands. A strong ridge to its north forced it westward, where it upgraded to tropical storm status later on November 14, receiving the name Patsy.[2] When Patsy was just barely above the threshold of tropical storm-strength, it slowed and passed just north of Saipan. Patsy continued to steadily intensify, reaching typhoon strength on November 16, 200\u00a0miles (322\u00a0km) northwest of Guam. The typhoon peaked at 155\u00a0mph (250\u00a0km/h) on November 18.[2] Its inflow became disrupted by the Philippines to its west, and Patsy hit Luzon on November 19 with winds of 130\u00a0mph (210\u00a0km/h), making it the 3rd strong typhoon to strike the island since September and made a direct hit over the National Capital Region of Metro Manila, then known as the Greater Manila area, catching many offguard. After crossing the Philippines and weakening to a Category\u00a02, Patsy traversed the South China Sea, where cooler waters kept the system from strengthening. This caused the cyclone to continue a weakening trend until it was downgraded to a tropical storm on November 20. On November 22, Patsy struck Vietnam as a 45\u00a0mph (70\u00a0km/h) tropical storm, and dissipated soon after.[2]"

        "content": " Typhoon Ike, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Nitang, was the second deadliest tropical cyclone in the 20th century in the Philippines. Ike originated from an area of disturbed weather southeast of Guam on August\u00a021, 1984, and five days later, developed into a tropical depression. Following an increase in organization, the depression attained tropical storm intensity on August\u00a027. Initially tracking west-southwest, the storm gradually gained strength as wind shear resulted relaxed and Ike became a typhoon on August\u00a030. Continuing to rapidly intensity, Ike turned west and attained peak intensity on September\u00a01, with the Japan Meteorological Agency estimating winds of 170\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph). At around 14:00\u00a0UTC that day, Ike made landfall on the northeastern tip of Mindanao. The cyclone emerged into the South China Sea on September\u00a03 as a tropical storm before re-intensifying into a typhoon and moving onshore Hainan. Ike then struck the Chinese mainland as a tropical storm in Guangxi and dissipated on September\u00a06. During its formative stages, Ike brushed Guam, although its compact size reduced the extent of damage. Typhoon Ike also struck the Philippines a mere four days after Tropical Storm June inundated the northern portion of the Philippines and also was suffering from the nation's worst economic crisis since independence in 1946. It also left a path of destruction in the Philippines that at the time was unparalleled in its modern history. Most of the deaths were in the province of Surigao del Norte, where around 1,000\u00a0died, 330\u00a0others were wounded, and 80% of structures along with 27\u00a0towns were flattened. Typhoon Ike was considered the worst typhoon to affect the province in 20\u00a0years. Roughly 90% of homes in Surigao City were leveled, leaving 90,000\u00a0individuals homeless. Throughout Negros Island, over 4,000\u00a0dwellings were destroyed, resulting in nearly 75,000\u00a0people homeless after a river burst its banks. In the province of Bohol, Ike was the deadliest natural disaster in the province's history, with 198\u00a0fatalities in addition to 89,000\u00a0homes damaged or destroyed. Overall, 1,426\u00a0people were killed as a result of the typhoon in the archipelago. At the time, Ike was the deadliest typhoon to hit the country during the 20th\u00a0century, surpassing the previous record of Typhoon Amy in 1951. A total of 1,856\u00a0people were injured. Furthermore, 142,653\u00a0homes were damaged and 108,219\u00a0others were destroyed. Nationwide, damage was estimated at $230\u00a0million, including $76.5\u00a0million from crop damage and $111\u00a0million from property damage. Following the storm, Philippines authorities initially distributed $4\u00a0million in aid but refused international aid. However, authorities reversed its decision on September\u00a08 due to lack of local resources and started accepting foreign aid. In all, over $7.5\u00a0million was donated to the country to provide relief. Ike was the worst tropical cyclone to strike the Guangxi province in China since 1954, where 14\u00a0people were killed. Across the country, around 13,000\u00a0structures were damaged or destroyed. Nationwide, 46\u00a0people were killed and 12,000\u00a0ha (29,651\u00a0acres) of sugar cane were destroyed. About 1,315,420\u00a0kg (2,900,000\u00a0lb) of vegetables were lost. Elsewhere, two people were killed and seven were listed missing in Thailand due to flash flooding."

        "content": "The origins of Typhoon Ike can be traced back to an area of disturbed weather first identified as part of the region's monsoon trough southeast of Guam on August\u00a021. Over the next few days, the disturbance failed to develop as a result of inhibiting wind shear which remained over the area. However, the shear quickly abated on August\u00a025, allowing for convection to build and persist over the system's center of circulation;[1] this prompted the Japan Meteorological Agency\u00a0(JMA) to classify the system at 06:00 UTC on August 26 as a tropical depression.[2][nb 1] Later that day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center\u00a0(JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the system, following a rapid increase in the system's organization.[1] Tracking generally northward, it continued to improve in organization and became more compact,[1] allowing both the JMA and the JTWC to upgrade the system to Tropical Storm Ike on August\u00a027.[4][nb 2] Ike's track northward brought it 165\u00a0km (105\u00a0mi) southwest of Guam before the tropical storm stalled and turned towards the west-southwest on August\u00a028 as a result of a subtropical ridge to its north. Initially, persistent wind shear limited intensification,[1] but data from the JTWC suggested that Ike briefly attained typhoon status on August\u00a029.[6] By August\u00a030, an upper-level anticyclone became established over the system, resulting in favorable conditions aloft, and Ike entered a second intensification phase.[1] At midday, both the JTWC and JMA estimated that Ike attained typhoon status.[4] On August\u00a031, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Nitang.[7] Now assuming a more westerly bearing, Ike continued to rapidly strengthen;[1] at 12:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a01, the typhoon reached its peak intensity with winds of 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph) and a barometric pressure of 950\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.05\u00a0inHg) as analyzed by the JMA.[2] Meanwhile, the JTWC estimated maximum intensity of 235\u00a0km/h (145\u00a0mph).[4] With maximum intensity, Ike made landfall on the northeastern tip of Mindanao at around 14:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a01,[8] taking 30\u00a0hours to track across the southern extent of the Philippines. The cyclone emerged into the South China Sea on September\u00a03, but due to land interaction,[1] both the JTWC and JMA reported that Ike had weakened to a tropical storm upon its emergence.[4] The storm tracked northwestward across the South China Sea over the next few days.[1] Ike regained its former typhoon classification on September 3, according to the JTWC,[6] and on September\u00a04, according to the JMA.[2] Several hours later, data from a Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicated that Ike had developed a 55\u00a0km (35\u00a0mi) wide eye.[1] The JMA estimated that it reached a secondary peak intensity on September\u00a04 with winds of 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph) and a pressure of 955\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.20\u00a0inHg), only slightly weaker than its peak strength[4] while the JTWC estimated a secondary peak of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph).[6] The combination of increased wind shear induced by a trough passing to the storm's north and the typhoon's proximity to land caused Ike to weaken. The storm made a September\u00a05 landfall on Hainan as a minimal typhoon. The storm continued to weaken after crossing Hainan, with both the JTWC and JMA estimating that it moved into the Chinese mainland as a tropical storm while it was located 110\u00a0km (68\u00a0mi) southeast of Nanning.[1][4] Thereafter, Ike quickly weakened inland and dissipated on September\u00a06.[1][4]"

Hundreds of cargo ships left port to escape the typhoon. In Zhanjiang, sandbagging operations took place in an effort to construct a barrier against Ike's storm surge. Hundreds of thousands of residents evacuated from coastal areas.[11] Offshore, four foreign oil companies evacuated workers off of drilling rigs in the South China Sea.[12] Further north, in Hong Kong, a No 1. hurricane signal was issued on September 4 and later that day was upped to a No 3. hurricane signal, but this signal was dropped once the storm dissipated inland.[8]"

Fresh water shortages occurred after power was lost in Surigao City.[27] To the southwest in Mainit, numerous homes were swept away after Lake Mainit overflowed its banks,[28] leading to the deaths of over 200\u00a0people.[27] On nearby Nonoc Island, 101\u00a0were killed, primarily due to drownings,[26] and all but 20\u00a0houses of the 2,000 on the island were demolished.[29] Provincewide, 330 people were wounded[30] and 70% of homes, mostly made of wood,[31] and 80% of buildings were destroyed,[8] which resulted in 480,000\u00a0homeless.[32] Typhoon Ike was considered the worst typhoon to affect the province in 20\u00a0years.[33] Further south, in the province of Surigao del Sur, 16 people perished.[34] Ten boats sunk offshore the capital city of Manila, where more than 6,000\u00a0residences were destroyed.[35] However, the capital was spared the inner core of the typhoon.[27] Elsewhere, in Cebu, thousands of refugees stayed in town halls and churches during the storm;[36] 10\u00a0people were injured by flying debris and another 12\u00a0went missing on the island.[37] Strong winds snapped power lines in Cebu, resulting in a power outage that impacted the entire province and halted all radio broadcasts in the prefecture.[38] Off of Cebu City, 10\u00a0ferries sunk due to the strong waves generated by Ike. Roads connecting Cebu City to 44\u00a0peripheral towns were blocked by fallen trees and severe flooding.[37] Throughout the province, 90,000\u00a0people were left homeless[25] and damage totaled at least $6.8\u00a0million.[27] Throughout Negros Island, over 4,000\u00a0dwellings were destroyed, displacing nearly 75,000\u00a0people.[39][40] The Ilog River, the longest on Negros Island, burst its banks and sent a deluge of mud, water, and debris to the municipalities of Kabankalan and Ilog.[41] Across the province of Negros Occidental, 120\u00a0people died,[42] including 50 in Kabankalan[28] and 2 in the nearby community of San Carlos.[42] In Negros Oriental, 60\u00a0others died[42] and 29 were initially reported missing.[43] Across Mindanao Island, 305 people were killed. A total of 29\u00a0people were killed in the province of Agusan del Norte.[44] Six people died in the province of Misamis Oriental.[28] Five others died in Camiguin.[34] In the Bohol province, the death toll reached 198, making Ike the deadliest natural disaster in the province's history.[45][46] Province-wide, 938\u00a0public\u00a0schools, poultry and livestock, churches, bridges and other public buildings were destroyed or damaged. Around 89,000\u00a0houses were damaged or destroyed,[46] which resulted in 58,000\u00a0people homeless.[42] In Mabini, 14\u00a0fatalities were reported while Guindulman suffered the worst effects in the province. Both the Inabanga and Loboc Rivers swelled and flooded their respective towns for days forcing church services to be held at their convents due to heavy deposits of mud in the church proper.[46] In other provinces across the region, twenty-four died in Leyte, two other fatalities occurred in Aklan,[33] and three people were killed in Iloilo.[34] Nationwide, 1,426\u00a0people were killed as a result of the typhoon,[8] making Ike the deadliest typhoon to hit the country in the 20th century at the time, surpassing the previous record of Typhoon Trix in 1952.[47] This mark would be eclipsed, however, by Tropical Storm Thelma in 1991.[48] A total of 1,856\u00a0people were hurt.[49] Furthermore, 108,219\u00a0houses were destroyed while an additional 142,653 homes were damaged. In all, damage was estimated at $230\u00a0million. Crop damage was placed at $76.5\u00a0million,[50][nb 4] with damage to coconut plantations totaling $61\u00a0million.[51] Property damage on the islands reached $111\u00a0million.[8]"

The storm brought 76\u2013127\u00a0mm (3.0\u20135.0\u00a0in) of rain to most of the affected areas, with locally higher amounts. Thirteen fishermen were overcome by the 7.6\u20139.1\u00a0m (25\u201330\u00a0ft) swells off the coast of Weizhou Island.[53] Across the Guangdong, 2,000\u00a0houses were destroyed.[52] In the Guangxi near the storm made landfall, the storm destroyed zones of homes, factories, and boats,[54] especially in the coastal towns of Beihai, Qinzhou, and Fancheng.[55] In nearby Nanning, half of the city was left without power, one building collapsed, and four hundred fifty trees were uprooted.[8] There, 13\u00a0people were killed[56] and two people were severely wounded.[51] Provincewide, 14\u00a0people were killed, with six others rendered missing[8] while 12,000\u00a0ha (29,651 acres) of sugar cane was destroyed.[51] Ike was considered the worst typhoon to strike the province since 1954.[57] Nationwide, numerous trees and power lines were downed by the storms' high winds and an estimated 13,000\u00a0structures were damaged or destroyed. A total of 46 people were killed by the remnants of Ike in central China.[53] There were also reports of 13\u00a0people missing.[58] An estimated 12,000\u00a0ha (29,650 acres) of sugar cane were destroyed and about 1,315,425\u00a0kg (2,900,000\u00a0lb) of vegetables were lost.[59] A minimum sea level pressure of 1,009\u00a0mbar (29.8\u00a0inHg) was recorded at the Hong Kong Royal Observatory. A peak wind gust of 89\u00a0km/h (55\u00a0mph) was reported on the island of Tai O. A peak sustained wind of 54\u00a0km/h (34\u00a0mph) was recorded on Lei Yue Mun. Tate's Cairn measured 24.2\u00a0mm (0.95\u00a0in) of rain, the highest total within the vicinity of Hong Kong from September 4 to 6. In the western portion of Hong Kong, one woman was injured by a fallen wooden plank. Nearby, a scaffolding and hoardings were blown down at a construction site. Otherwise, no damage was reported in Hong Kong.[8]"

Although Ike passed somewhat near the island, the storm's compact size during its formative stages mitigated any damage. Despite being near typhoon intensity at the time, a station on Nimitz Hill only documented winds of 30\u00a0km/h (19\u00a0mph), with higher gusts.[1] The outer rainbands of the typhoon brought unseasonably heavy rains to Thailand.[60] There, four people were reported missing and ten were injured after water from an overflowing dam tipped over a bus.[34] Two people were killed and three were rendered missing due to flash flooding in Bangkok.[52] Elsewhere, the outer extremities of Ike produced light rainfall and light breezes on Okinawa, peaking at 3.8\u00a0mm (0.15\u00a0in) in Ibaruma,[61] most of which fell in an hour.[62]"

Imelda Marcos, the wife of president Ferdinand Marcos, flew to Surigao City to personally hand out relief supplies.[64] Ferdinand Marcos warned on television for profiteers and looters to not \"take advantage of the situation\".[33] Nevertheless, the typhoon set the stage for protests against Marcos and his handling of the storm throughout the country for the rest of the month.[65] The president set aside $4\u00a0million for relief work but initially refused any international aid.[66] Despite this, the League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies appealed in Switzerland for $800,000 in emergency aid for victims of the typhoon.[26] The Philippines Air Force delivered 907,185\u00a0kg (2,000,000\u00a0lb) of food, medicine, and clothes.[67] According to officials, 92\u00a0health teams backed by 17\u00a0army medical units were fielded; these teams distributed $1.66\u00a0million worth of medicine.[32] The Philippine Red Cross disturbed food to 239,331\u00a0people, or 44,247\u00a0families.[68] The mayor of Suriago City applied for national aid since the city's residents faced starvation.[47] On September\u00a09, President Marcos ordered $100,000 worth of cash to seven province governors, and released $555,000 with the intent of rebuilding Suriago City.[69] A task force was also sent up by him to speed up the recovery process.[67] On September\u00a08, the nation abandoned its policy of refusing foreign aid, citing a lack of resources due to the country's poor economy.[70] The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs gave an emergency grant of $50,000. UNICEF provided $116,000 worth of vitamins and medicine and an additional $116,950 in cash, as well as 28\u00a0t (31 short tons) of milk powder. They later provided vegetable seeds, dried fish, and garden fertilizer. The World Health Organization provided $7,000 worth of aid. Furthermore, the United Nations Development Programme awarded the country $30,000 in cash. The European Economic Community provided 330 short tons (300\u00a0t) of milk and $367,650 worth of cash.[68] In the middle of September, the United States approved $1\u00a0million in aid to the archipelago. Japan also sent a $500,000 check.[71] Australia awarded almost $500,000 worth of cash and food. New Zealand donated 22,680\u00a0kg (50,000\u00a0lb) of skimmed milk. The Norwegian Red Cross provided $58,500 in aid while the European Economic Community awarded just over $7,000 in cash. Belgium also provided three medical kits. The Swiss Red Cross awarded a little under $21,000 in cash. Germany provided slightly more than $50,000 in cash. France provided roughly $11,000 in donations to the nation's red cross. The Red Cross Society of China donated $20,000 in cash. Indonesia provided $25,000 worth of medicine. The United Kingdom granted $74,441 in aid. Overall, Relief Web reported that over $7.5\u00a0million was donated to the Philippines due to the storm.[68] Starting on September\u00a011, a massive relief item airlift was planned to assist the region.[72] Due to Tropical Storm June, 19 provinces had already been placed under a state of emergency. Following Ike, three other provinces were placed under a state of emergency.[72] Due to both Ike and June, 25 of the nation's 73 provinces were declared a disaster area.[42] Because of the destruction in the Philippines, the name Ike was retired and was replaced by Ian.[73] The name Nitang, was also retired, and was replaced by Ningning.[74]"

        "content": " Typhoon Agnes, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Undang, was the fourth final tropical cyclone to affect the Philippines during the 1984 Pacific typhoon season. An area of disturbed weather developed near the equator and the Caroline Islands on October\u00a028. Following an increase in organization, the cyclone was designated a tropical storm on October\u00a031. After tracking northwest initially, Agnes turned west-northwest the next day, a course that the system would maintain for the rest of its lifetime. Agnes intensified into a typhoon on November\u00a02, and on November\u00a04, attained peak intensity. The storm then made landfall on Samar Island, part of the Philippines, at that intensity. The storm weakened over land, but re-intensified over the South China Sea; Agnes obtained a secondary peak intensity on November\u00a06. The next day, Typhoon Agnes moved ashore Vietnam while still at typhoon intensity. The storm rapidly deteriorated over land and dissipated by November\u00a08 over Thailand. Typhoon Agnes was the final of a series of tropical cyclones to affect the Philippines that season, following June, Ike, and Warren. Agnes brought widespread damage to several provinces across the central section of the archipelago. In the Iloilo province, 230 people were killed and four others were injured. Provincewide, a total of 21\u00a0homes were flattened, resulting in 1,326\u00a0homeless people. Damage in the province amounted to at least $5\u00a0million. Approximately 20% of the rice crop was destroyed in Iloilo. In the Capiz province, 265\u00a0people died and property damage amounted $25\u00a0million (1984 USD). Around 80% of houses in Roxas, located in Capiz, were damaged and 100\u00a0people were killed. Throughout Panay Island, four hundred forty-eight fatalities were reported, at least eight people were injured, five bridges were destroyed, and thirty-five schools were demolished. A total of 4,014\u00a0homes were destroyed; consequently, over 24,000\u00a0people lost their homes. Across the Philippines, 895\u00a0people died due to Agnes, with 272 people listed missing and 2,526\u00a0others wounded. A total of 491,968\u00a0people were evacuated to shelter in 27\u00a0provinces. More than 200,000\u00a0homes were destroyed while 163,056\u00a0other dwellings were damaged. Damage in the country totaled $90.7\u00a0million, with $19.1\u00a0million from crops and $56.9\u00a0million from public infrastructure. In Vietnam, the typhoon severely affected the rice harvest and winter crop cultivation. The B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh Province suffered the brunt of the typhoon, where 134\u00a0people died and 289\u00a0sustained injuries. There, 400\u00a0schools and 230\u00a0nurseries were flattened. Throughout the country, the storm destroyed 271,000 hectares (670,000 acres) of farmland."

        "content": "Typhoon Agnes originated from an isolated area of convection located near the equator on October\u00a028. Satellite imagery indicated a possible low pressure area near 149\u00b0 E. Although the disturbance was not attached to the monsoon trough, an upper-level anticyclone became situated aloft, providing the system with strong ventilation.[1] Midday on October\u00a030, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started tracking the system,[2] with the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgrading the system to a tropical depression on the same day.[nb 1][4] Late on October\u00a031, shower activity increased drastically in both coverage and organization as the disturbance tracked northwest. Early the next day, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. Shortly thereafter, a Hurricane Hunter aircraft investigated the system and found winds of 95\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph); these winds were significantly higher than intensity estimates from the Dvorak technique. At 06:00 UTC on November\u00a01, the JTWC issued its first warning on the system, upgrading it to a tropical storm and naming it Agnes.[1] The JMA also classified Agnes as a tropical storm at this time.[nb 2][6] Although Agnes initially continued to track northwest,[1] passing through the Caroline Islands,[7] by the evening of November 1, Agnes moved northward enough to feel the effects of a subtropical ridge anchored to its north, causing the storm to turn west-northwest. Despite its asymmetric structure,[1] the JTWC classified Agnes as a typhoon midday on November\u00a02.[2] The storm began to rapidly intensify on November 3, with the JMA upping Agnes to a severe tropical storm at 00:00\u00a0UTC, and to a typhoon six hours later. Meanwhile, the JTWC elevated the intensity to 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph), which would make it a Category\u00a03 hurricane on the United States-based Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (SSHWS). That afternoon, however, the typhoon began to level off in strength.[6] Around this time, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Undang.[8] After developing a small 10\u00a0km (6\u00a0mi) wide eye, at 18:00\u00a0UTC on November\u00a04, the JTWC increased the winds to 225\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph), equal to Category 4 intensity on the SSHWS, its peak intensity.[1] At the same time, the JMA estimated peak intensity of 195\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 925\u00a0mbar (27.3\u00a0inHg).[4] Shortly after attaining maximum intensity, the typhoon continued west-northwest and made landfall 10\u00a0km (6.2\u00a0mi) south of Borongan on Samar Island. Land interaction resulted in a weakening trend as it crossed the archipelago; however, due to its brisk forward motion, the JTWC reported that Agnes was still a typhoon when it emerged into the South China Sea,[1] though the JMA estimated it weakened into a severe tropical storm over land.[6] Over water, Agnes re-intensified, with the JMA designating it a typhoon again on the morning of November\u00a06.[4] Later that day, the agency estimated the storm attained its secondary peak intensity of 135\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph). Meanwhile, the JTWC estimated that the storm regained winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph), an intensity that the storm would maintain until Agnes made its second landfall on November\u00a07 40\u00a0km (25\u00a0mi) north of Qui Nh\u01a1n in Vietnam. Rapid weakening occurred over land, and at 00:00\u00a0UTC on November\u00a08, the JTWC ceased following Agnes[1] as it had tracked into Thailand.[7] Thirty hours later, the JMA followed suit.[4]"

Serving as a standalone sequel to Twister (1996), it stars Daisy Edgar-Jones, Glen Powell, Anthony Ramos, Brandon Perea, Maura Tierney, and Sasha Lane. It follows clashing groups of storm chasers who investigate a tornado outbreak in Oklahoma. Talks for a sequel to Twister began in 2020, with Kosinski pitching an idea to Universal and Helen Hunt, who starred in the original, also expressing interest in a follow-up that was ultimately rejected. Several directors were approached before Chung was hired in December 2022. The cast joined in early-2023 and filming taking place around Oklahoma that summer, with a brief hiatus due to the SAG-AFTRA strike. Twisters premiered at the Cineworld Leicester Square in London on July 8, 2024, and was released internationally by Warner Bros. Pictures on July 10 and in the United States by Universal Pictures on July 19. It received generally positive reviews from critics and has grossed $370\u00a0million worldwide."

        "content": "Kate Carter works in Oklahoma with her storm chaser friends Javi, Addy, Praveen, and her boyfriend, Jeb. Alongside a Dorothy V doppler, the team launches barrels of sodium polyacrylate beads into a tornado in hopes of reducing its intensity and securing funding for further research. However, the attempt is unsuccessful due to the tornado suddenly intensifying into an EF5, killing Jeb, Addy and Praveen while Kate survives, the latter blaming herself for underestimating the tornado and quitting storm chasing and the experiment altogether. Five years later, Kate works at a NOAA office in New York City. Javi, now working for mobile tornado radar company Storm Par, offers Kate a one-week position with his team to test a new tornado scanning system using phased-array radar. Kate initially declines but has a change of heart after Javi sends a news report about a tornado destroying a town without warning and assuring her that they have a chance to save lives. Kate and Javi join the Storm Par team in Oklahoma, which includes Javi's business partner Scott. Popular YouTube storm chaser Tyler Owens, known as the \"Tornado Wrangler\", also arrives in Oklahoma from Arkansas looking to capitalize on a predicted tornado outbreak. Tyler is joined by his crew of Boone, Dani, Dexter, and Lily, as well as British journalist Ben. Storm Par and Tyler's crew chase an EF1 tornado that has touched down in a nearby wind farm. Kate suffers a panic attack causing her to drive away, rendering her unable to help Javi set up the final scanner. The team tracks another storm which produces another EF1, that also produces a satellite that splits off. Storm Par chases the Satellite after noticing that it is intensifying. The Satellite intensifies into an EF3, and takes out the scanner. Kate and Javi barely escape and drive to the nearby tornado-ravaged town of Crystal Springs to help recovery efforts, along with Tyler's crew. Having initially dismissed Tyler and his team as glory hounds, Kate is surprised to learn they use merchandise profits to aid tornado victims, while also learning that Storm Par investor Marshall Riggs profiteers from Javi's project by purchasing tornado-damaged land at very low prices and re-selling them for exorbitant amounts. That night, Tyler invites Kate to a nearby rodeo in Stillwater, where they begin bonding. When a large EF4 tornado hits, Kate, Tyler, and several others take shelter in an empty motel pool, but a motel employee and two other guests are killed. In the aftermath, Kate confronts Javi about Riggs' intentions and claims Javi is ignorant to the victims being exploited, causing an offended Javi to thoughtlessly blame her for their friends' deaths. Distraught, Kate abandons Javi and retreats to her mother's farm in Sapulpa. Tyler follows her and uncovers Kate's previous research regarding the tornado disruption experiment five years ago. Kate initially declines Tyler's offer to help retry the experiment due to her guilt and trauma, but later accepts when Tyler points out that her experiment can still give people a fighting chance against tornadoes. The next day, they release the beads into a passing EFU tornado, but it fails to dissipate. Using scanning data provided by Javi, who shows up at Kate's childhood home to apologize to her, Kate is able to hypothesize a change in the experiment to correct a previous oversight, namely adding silver iodide. The team tracks another tornado near El Reno. The tornado becomes rain-wrapped, and nearly hits Javi and Scott. They are nearly killed but they escape just as the tornado catches fire after hitting an oil refinery. The tornado explodes in size, becoming a mile-wide EF5 that begins shifting towards El Reno. As Kate and the Wranglers head into town, Javi decides to follow them, but Scott attempts to pressure him into continuing their mission for Riggs. Enraged, Javi abandons Scott by the road and quits his partnership with Riggs, finally seeing how callous Riggs and his team are. In El Reno, Kate, Tyler, and their team, learning that all shelters are full, evacuate the remaining townspeople into a nearby movie theater when a derailed streetcar and debris traps Tyler. As Kate struggles to free him, Javi arrives just in time to help save Tyler before a water tower nearly collapses on them. With the theater not having a basement and unable to withstand a direct hit from the tornado, Kate drives Tyler's truck into the tornado's center. She fires the silver iodide into the tornado, and after a brief struggle with the controls, she successfully launches the polyacrylite beads, but the vehicle is overturned. The tornado rips the theater open, sucking out two people and nearly sucking Lily and Tyler out as well right as the measures take effect, and the tornado dissipates. The team rescues Kate and celebrates the experiment's success. Sometime later, as Kate waits at the airport for her flight back to New York City to gain funding for further research, Tyler shows up. Tyler chases Kate to stop her from leaving and they reconcile. Upon learning that flights have been delayed because of strong winds, the two swiftly depart for the storm. A closing montage shows that Ben's story focused on Kate and that Kate, Tyler, and Javi have joined in a new tornado radar business."

        "content": "In 2020, Joseph Kosinski met with Amblin Entertainment and the Kennedy/Marshall Company to pitch a follow-up to the 1996 film Twister revolving around a \"new generation\" of storm chasers.[4]:\u200a5\u200a In June 2020, Universal Pictures announced it was meeting with writers to develop the reboot, with Frank Marshall attached as a producer and Kosinski in early negotiations as director.[5] Around the same time, the studio rejected plans from Twister actress Helen Hunt to direct a sequel. That version, written by Hunt, Rafael Casal, and Daveed Diggs, who collaborated on the television series Blindspotting, would have followed \"all black and brown storm chasers\", members of a rocket science club at a historically black college and university.[6][7] In October 2022, Amblin, Universal, and Warner Bros. met with directors for Twisters, a sequel being fast-tracked for an early 2023 production start after Steven Spielberg, an executive producer of the original film, expressed enthusiasm for a script by Mark L. Smith. Filmmaking couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi, Travis Knight, and Dan Trachtenberg were in talks to helm the project, Kosinski having dropped out to direct F1 (2025). The studio reportedly wanted Hunt to reprise her role, with the hopes of the story focusing on the daughter of her and Bill Paxton's characters.[8] In December 2022, Lee Isaac Chung was hired to direct the now standalone sequel.[10] Chung's pitch to Marshall, Spielberg, and executive producer Jay Sandberg included a presentation that intercut footage from Twister and his own Minari, a semi-autobiographical indie drama that cost $2\u00a0million, specifically a scene in which characters experience a tornado watch.[9][11][12] Chung credited his time at Lucasfilm directing an episode of The Mandalorian as accustoming him to projects with visual effects and noted growing up in tornado alley as inspiration.[11][13] In preparation for Twisters, he revisited the original film; Spielberg's Jaws (1975) and War of the Worlds (2005) (described by him as \"movies about powerful forces of nature or monstrous things coming at you or looming above you\"); \"driving movies\" such as The French Connection (1971) and Gone in 60 Seconds (2000); and Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai (1954) and Ran (1985) (for inspiration in capturing weather through camera movement).[4]:\u200a9\u200a[14] Character dynamics were influenced by the films of Frank Capra and Howard Hawks, especially It Happened One Night (1934) and The Big Sky (1952).[12][15] Chung was inspired to approach Glen Powell for a lead role after seeing an appearance of his on an episode of the morning show Today; Powell was contacted while filming Anyone but You (2023) in Australia to do a chemistry read with Daisy Edgar-Jones over Zoom.[4]:\u200a13\u201314\u200a[16] Edgar-Jones suggested that her character, Kate, have a camera, in reference to the documentary Fire of Love (2022) about volcanologists Katia and Maurice Krafft; the character was partially inspired by Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz (1939).[14] Cast members attended a \"weather boot camp\" to learn about tornadoes from meteorologists and storm chasers. The program was organized by meteorologist and former NOAA analyst Kevin Kelleher, a technical advisor on both Twister films.[4]:\u200a6,\u200a12\u200a[17] Paxton's son, James, has a cameo as a motel guest who tries driving away from a tornado.[18][19]"

        "content": "Principal photography was initially set for the state of Georgia, outside Atlanta, for budgetary reasons. Instead, it commenced in May 2023 in Oklahoma, where the story takes place, marking Chung's return to the state after Minari.[4]:\u200a9\u201310\u200a[20][21] The move cost the crew work days and resulted in the removal of some storm sequences.[21] Filming was to take place at Prairie Surf Studios for 40 days and in metro Oklahoma City for 50 days.[22] Ultimately, the shoot took 60 days, approximately 70 percent of which was spent capturing driving scenes.[4]:\u200a9\u200a[17] Other locations included the towns of Burbank, Calumet, Cashion, Chickasha, Fairview, Hinton, Kingfisher, Kremlin, El Reno, Midwest City, Okarche, Pawhuska, and Spencer.[22][23] Filming was suspended in July due to the SAG-AFTRA strike.[24] As six weeks of prep time were necessary to resume production, despite only having three weeks of material to film, the crew began prepping sets before the strike was over.[4]:\u200a11\u200a Production resumed with the strike's conclusion in November and wrapped the following month.[25][26] Dan Mindel was the cinematographer.[4]:\u200a29\u200a Patrick Sullivan, who worked on the original film's art department, was the production designer.[4]:\u200a22 Twisters was shot on 35 mm film, at Chung's request after receiving support from Spielberg and Mindel, with Panavision XL and handheld Arri 435 and 235 cameras, using Panavision T-Series, C-Series and Primo anamorphic lenses.[4]:\u200a30\u200a[11] In preparation for the film, Mindel watched Westerns, road films, and films produced during the Golden Age of Hollywood set in rural America. He listed The Last Picture Show (1971) as an influence on the film's \"Americana\" style. Dailies were processed in Los Angeles, so the crew could not review their footage for several days. To maintain continuity, Mindel aimed to film under overcast weather, unless the script asked for blue skies.[4]:\u200a30\u200a Because the shoot occurred during tornado season, delays were frequent.[27] \"It was happening every three days or so,\" Chung recalled, \"We were always getting shut down\u2014lightning, wind storms, and then storms that were producing tornadoes came through as well.\"[28] Challenges arose in El Reno due to heat waves, lightning storms, and strong winds, as well as the presence of \"a jet engine on set that you could barely talk over\" and the need for a bright, hot key light to produce the \"feeling of a storm-like sky\", according to Chung.[21] A set of an El Reno farmer's market was destroyed by a storm with 80-mile-per-hour winds, forcing the crew to rebuild it so they could destroy it again for a scene.[4]:\u200a26\u201327\u200a[27] The production recruited a former military meteorologist to monitor weather conditions with a squad of radar watchers, and film safety experts enforced protocols for shutting down production and sheltering when necessary.[4]:\u200a10\u201311 The prologue was shot during the first week. It utilized practical effects such as hail, rain, and wind machines to simulate the storm, though the overpass that characters hide under was enclosed in blue screen. While parts of the sequence were filmed on location, the overpass was rebuilt on a makeshift studio backlot near Prairie Surf Studios.[4]:\u200a21,\u200a28\u200a Three locations\u2014Crystal Springs, Stillwater, and El Reno\u2013are ravaged in the film by tornadoes. Scenes set in El Reno were filmed on location, while a 4-block stretch of land in Chickasha stood in for Crystal Springs and Midwest City portrayed Stillwater.[4]:\u200a23\u201327\u200a Early versions of the script had the Stillwater tornado surround a college baseball game, but Chung suggested changing it to a rodeo.[4]:\u200a24\u200a The pool of the motel where characters take shelter was constructed for the film; a hole was dug out of the motel's lawn and, since the pool is empty, no plumbing was required. After the shoot, the pool was removed and the hole was filled to restore the lawn.[4]:\u200a26\u200a The theater sequence was shot on soundstages at Prairie Surf, using vintage seats from a closed Colorado movie theater; exterior shots were filmed in El Reno.[4]:\u200a27\u200a[12] It was Chung's decision for the characters to be viewing Frankenstein (1931), a reference to Universal's \"monsters\" franchise.[12][29] Kate's mother's farmhouse was located in the town of Howe. The accompanying barn was initially a metal shed, which the art department skinned with wood from Missouri to resemble an Oklahoma barn. The barn's interior was built at Prairie Surf.[4]:\u200a27\u200a Two versions of the ending were filmed; one where Kate and Tyler kiss, and the one in the film, in which they do not. Spielberg suggested the non-kiss take to solidify that Kate's character arc was about her returning passion for storm chasing.[30][31]"

The tornado in the finale was inspired by the 2013 El Reno tornado, the 2021 Western Kentucky tornado, and a wedge tornado that struck Kansas in 2023.[4]:\u200a33\u201334\u200a[12] Scott R. Fisher and Ben Snow were the special and visual effects supervisors, respectively. Special effects included wind fans running at around 70 miles per hour; two jet engines operating further away from the sets at 170-to-180 miles per hour; dump tanks; high-pressure pneumatic water cannons; and polyacrylamide for hail. Visual effects were handled by Industrial Light & Magic.[4]:\u200a34\u201335\u200a Terilyn A. Shropshire was the editor.[32] Chung said the most challenging part about making Twisters was balancing the tone because he wanted to entertain audiences while simultaneously taking the natural disasters seriously due to their real-world impacts.[21] In June 2023, amid filming, The Oklahoman reported the production budget for Twisters as nearing $200\u00a0million.[22] In July 2024, the budget was listed as $155\u00a0million before print and advertising costs.[33][34]"

In addition, the studio partnered with radio personality Bobby Bones. Sporting events were significant in raising awareness to the film. Universal worked with NASCAR for co-branded promo as well as MLB, Copa Am\u00e9rica, and WWE. The 30-second television spot broadcast during Super Bowl LVIII amassed 29.2\u00a0million views in a day and was among the year's most-watched Super Bowl trailers. Commercials for the film aired during events for All Elite Wrestling, NASCAR, the Olympic Trials, UEFA Euro Cup, UFC, and the WNBA. Universal strategically put tickets on sales during the first game of the 2024 NBA Finals, made content with Dodge RAM and Wrangler, and had the cast participate in a cross-country promotional tour that exceeded New York and Los Angeles and made stops in Dallas, Chicago, and Miami. Special screenings were held in Oklahoma and military bases, and discussions were held between the cast and meteorologists. As a result of the marketing, Deadline Hollywood noted that the film's top-grossing cities during its opening weekend were Dallas, Houston, Phoenix, Atlanta, Oklahoma City, and San Antonio, and that theater chains in Middle America like B&B Theatres and Santikos Theatres surged over annual norms.[45] The publication also said the film's \"not political\" standing (by not referring to climate change) appealed to \"red states\"; despite it, PostTrak reported that of opening weekend moviegoers, 16% were registered Democrats while 7% were registered Republicans.

The website's consensus reads: \"Summoning a storm of spectacle and carried along by the gale force winds of Glen Powell's charisma, Twisters' forecast is splendid with a high chance of thrills.\"[60] According to the website, critics felt that Chung added \"more substance\" to the film and praised the film's visuals and \"unexpectedly well-handled romantic twist\", calling it a \"rousing piece of summer blockbuster cinema\".[61] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 65 out of 100, based on 57 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.[62] Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\u2013\" on an A+ to F scale, the same score as the first film, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it 4.5 out of five stars.[34] Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph gave it a score of five out of five, writing that it \"vastly improves on [the original] in all regards\".[63] Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Jordan Hoffman gave the film a \"A-\" grade, saying \"There's a ton of technobabble that you have to take on faith, but Jones and Powell do more than sell it; they make it compelling\".[64] IndieWire's David Ehrlich gave the film a \"B+\" grade and said \"And for all of the unearned goodwill that Twisters extends to viral content creators, it still makes one of this summer's most emphatic arguments in favor of the big screen experience\".[65] Donald Clarke of The Irish Times gave it a rating of three out of five, explaining that \"A sequel, while no masterpiece, feels perfectly serviceable in the era of lore-addicted trash such as Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire\".[66] Owen Gleiberman of Variety gave the film a mixed review. He praised the performances of Powell and Edgar-Jones, but suggested the film was not as innovative as the original film given the prevalence of the Internet and actual videos of tornadoes freely available. He wrote, \"Staring up at the tornadoes in Twisters, I felt like I'd already seen something exactly like them \u2014 and that when it comes to footage of actual tornadoes, I'd already seen something more incredible\".[67]"

A scientific review in The New York Times pointed out impossibilities with the film's mechanism for dissipating tornadoes, observing that the method suggested would require many tons of the chemicals used and require a much longer period.[69] A professor at Texas A&M University also remarked: \"it's highly unlikely that the small-scale methods depicted in the movie would have any real impact on tornadoes. To my knowledge, no one is actively pursuing such an approach\".[70] An article in Wired noted that the \"twin\" tornadoes featured in the film do occur in real-life as multiple-vortex tornadoes, drawing comparison to the Dunlap, Indiana tornado during the 1965 Palm Sunday tornado outbreak.[71] Writer Margaret Renkl criticized the film for not mentioning the link between climate change and the increasing frequency and intensity of tornadoes.[72] Despite Smith's intent for the screenplay to incorporate the effects of climate change, Chung explained his decision to avoid explicitly referring to climate change as wanting \"to make sure that we are never creating a feeling that we're preaching a message.\"[73][74] According to Chung, Universal wanted him to put forward a clear message about climate change, but scientific advisors on the project suggested that he be more measured, because the link between tornado severity and climate change remains unclear.[75][76]"

During the fires, the Shire of Esperance experienced two significant fires and a complex of fires; 128,000 hectares (320,000 acres) were burnt by the Cascades fire, 18,000 hectares (44,000 acres) were burnt by the Merivale fire, and 164,000 hectares (410,000 acres) were burnt by the Cape Arid complex of fires.[1][7] On 17 November, during the major run of the Cascades fire, four civilian fatalities occurred in vehicles traveling on Griggs Road in Scaddan.[1][8][9][10][11][12][13] As of 2020[update], the Cascades fire was equally the worst bushfire in Western Australia in terms of human fatalities along with the Willow Springs/Nannup[14] fire of January 1958.[5] The Cascades fire destroyed Scaddan town hall, one house, 16 non-residential structures and dozens of vehicles in the communities of Grass Patch, Salmon Gums and Scaddan.[3][15] There was also significant damage to rural produce; approximately 4,500 head of livestock died and 30,000 hectares (74,000 acres) of crop\u2014constituting about 500,000 tonnes of grain\u2014were burnt.[2][16][17] In addition, the Merivale fire destroyed 2 houses in Stockyard Creek, and the Cape Arid complex destroyed significant areas of Western Ground Parrot habitat\u2014reportedly up to 90%\u2014prompting discussion that the critically endangered parrot could \"...\u00a0become the first bird in at least 200 years to become extinct in Western Australia\".[1][18][19][20]"

This represented a 2015 harvest that was far above the 5 year average, even accounting for the \"...\u00a0hundreds of thousands of tonnes\" of grain lost during the fire.[21][22][25] The winter rains were followed by an unusually dry and warm spring, which rapidly dried out the unharvested crops and other plant material.[22] Statewide average temperatures in Western Australia during October were +3.28\u00a0\u00b0C above average and the highest on record, and rainfall was generally light across the Esperance region at 6\u20138 millimetres (0.24\u20130.31\u00a0in).[21][26] Temperature observations were similarly elevated in November, at +1.78\u00a0\u00b0C above average and the second warmest on record.[27]"

The fire moved rapidly once it had entered private property; during its major south\u2013east run on the afternoon of 17 November, the Cascades fire is estimated to have spread at a rate of 15\u201323 kilometres per hour (9.3\u201314.3\u00a0mph), fueled by the heavy harvest fuel loads, and to have traveled approximately 70 kilometres (43\u00a0mi) over a five-hour period.[7][15] The Cascades fire is estimated to have reached a peak intensity of around 45,000kW/h, described in the Major Incident Report as; ...\u00a0the hottest grassland fire in WA's recorded history, and possibly in Australia's recorded history.[15] At 13:10 AWST the DFES warning for the Cascades fire was upgraded to \"watch and act\", and the warning was reported by the Experance Express within the hour, however an \"emergency warning\" was not issued for the fire until 17:50 AWST, some two hours after the fire impacted Griggs Rd., 50\u201360 kilometres (31\u201337\u00a0mi) from the point of ignition. All four civilians fatalities from the Cascades fire occurred at approximately 15:50 AWST, when the fire front impacted Griggs Rd. between Cascade and Scaddan.[8][11][12][46][47] The Cascades fire crossed the Coolgardie\u2013Esperance Highway at approximately 17:50 AWST and impacted the community of Scaddan, where the majority of structural damage occurred.[47] The DFES superintendent for Goldfields-Esperance, Trevor Tasker, witnessed the fire front impacting the highway and created a road block, preventing an estimated 100 cars\u2014containing approximately 200 tourists and locals\u2014from driving into the flames; police in Norseman prevented traffic entering the area impacted by fire from the opposite direction.[48] Scaddan farmer Chris Reichstein used a speed tiller[Note 3] to cut a firebreak several meters wide through burning crops and stubble along the eastern edge of the fire front, preventing the fire front from crossing into bushland where it \"...\u00a0could have burned for weeks\".[49] Ninety minutes after the fire front had traversed the highway and impacted Scaddan township, the fire was upgraded to \"Level 3\", a designation that effectively grants the DFES command and control of the incident.[Note 4][41] By mid\u2013evening, between 100 and 150 people from Scaddan and Grass Patch had evacuated to Salmon Gums Recreation Centre, and at approximately 22:00 AWST the area under threat was expanded to include Red Lake and Salmon Gums.[8] On 17 November, the Merivale fire also moved rapidly in a south\u2013east direction, and DFES warnings were upgraded to \"watch and act\" level at 11:55 AWST. Fire conditions peaked during the afternoon, with the Esperance station recording an astonishingly low relative humidity of 2% at 15:00 AWST and a wind gust of 83 kilometres per hour (52\u00a0mph) from the west-north-west at 16:12 AWST.[50] A wind change shifted the direction of fire spread to north\u2013east at approximately 18:00 AWST, and an \"emergency\" warning was issued at 21:04 AWST, after the fire had crossed Cape Le Grand Rd.[18] Two houses were destroyed in the Stockyard Creek area during the night.[18][51] The ability of crews to control the Merivale fire was hampered by the vegetation and the varying terrain in the area, which included swamps, lakes and dune systems as well as several blue gum plantations.[52]"

The Esperance District complex of fires was downgraded to \"Level 1\" and the DFES transitioned control for the recovery effort of the Cascades and Merivale fires to Local Government, and the recovery effort for the Cape Arid complex of fires was transferred to the Department of Parks and Wildlife (DPAW) on 26 November.[2]"

Esperance shire had two channel systems intended for use during incidents; the BFB network and the DFES command network, however the DFES command network was not able to be used during the initial days of the incident, or 17 November major runs by the fires, due to a faulty antenna.[81] In response to the failures during the fires, the construction of two mobile phone towers\u2014in the Grass Patch and Salmon Gums townships respectively\u2014was expedited by the Shire of Esperance in early December 2015.[82] The electorate of O'Connor, in which the impacted communities are located, also received up to A$54 million as part of a federal mobile blackspots program.[Note 7][84]"

However, constraints on time and resources meant that only 5 kilometres (3.1\u00a0mi) of the interface was burned, of which a mere 1 kilometre (0.62\u00a0mi) turned out to be in the eventual path of the fire.[89] The authority of farmers to clear and manage land\u2014particularly areas designated UCL\u2014was a \"...\u00a0contentious issue\" in the Esperance area, and several landholders were prosecuted for clearing land in contravention the state regulations.[85] Landholders offered to enter the UCL where the Cascades fire ignited and use graders to contain the fire before the catastrophic conditions on 17 November, however the regulations and administrative bureaucracy concerning UCL prevented them from doing so.[87][90] Mick Fels, the WA Farmers Esperance-Ravensthorpe zone president and an Esperance-area farmer whose property borders a reserve, described to the ABC his experience advocating for \"...\u00a0two or three years, at every level, to get DPAW to put a firebreak against [his] boundary fence\u00a0...\" however his efforts were \"...\u00a0unsuccessful\".[79][85] Fels hoped to see firebreak control and fuel reduction responsibilities transferred from DPAW and DFES, and back to local communities.[79] The fuel load on private property before the fires was described as \"...\u00a0enormous\", with wheat crops ranging from 4\u20135 tonnes per hectare; Esperance-region families who had been \"...\u00a0farming this land for more than 100 years\" described the 2015 harvest as \"...\u00a0the best crop ever.\"[55][62][91] The yields marked a great increase from the 2 tonnes per hectare considered a \"good crop\" in the Esperance-region decades prior, and the Major Incident Report noted; Changes in farming practices in the Esperance region have resulted in more widespread and higher yield cropping areas, creating higher fuel loads across a larger area prior to harvest.[92]"

During a grievance debate on 7 April 2016, Dr. Graham Gibson Jacobs MP introduced before the WA Legislative Assembly his concerns about resource allocation, with particular focus on the absence of aerial support and the decision by the state operations centre that the Esperance area did not require additional resources in the face of the catastrophic conditions on 17 November.[43] Aerial assistance for firefighters did not arrive until 18 November, as all available aerial assets\u2014two fixed-wing water bombing aircraft\u2014were deployed some 470 kilometres (290\u00a0mi) away in Albany in preparation for catastrophic conditions in that area of the region.[40][43][95] A pair of fixed-wing \"crop spraying\" agricultural aircraft operated by private contractors in the Esperance area were offered for aerial support suppression tasking; officially, regulatory constraints and contract management capacity prohibited their deployment.[43][96] Comments by Liam Bartlett, printed in a 29 November Perth Now article, suggest that pilots may have been \"...\u00a0more than ready to take to the skies\u00a0...\" however the pilots were \"...\u00a0threatened with a loss of license if they flew near the blaze\u00a0...\" and therefore were not able to not assist.[40] The nearest airstrip to the Cascades foreground was 50 kilometres (31\u00a0mi) south in Esperance township, and the MIR publication cast doubt over whether aerial suppression would have been effective in controlling the run of the Cascades fire in catastrophic conditions.[95] In addition, during a statement to the Commonwealth Senate on 25 November 2015, Hon. Senator Christopher Back discussed \"...\u00a0questions as to whether personnel were able to go into crown land reserves after the lightning strike had started the fires.\" The senator stated there was \"...\u00a0never a circumstance in which volunteer brigade members could not go into crown land owned by the Commonwealth to suppress, fight and mitigate major fires if life and property are at risk.\"[7]"

Following this, a number of bush fires already burning throughout the region flared up and began moving quickly through dry vegetation, making it difficult for firefighters to control.[6][7] The local government areas of Bundaberg, Gladstone, Rockhampton and Mackay were most seriously affected by the fires.  This included the communities of Deepwater, Baffle Creek, Rules Beach, Agnes Water, Oyster Creek, Captain Creek, Winfield, Mount Larcom, Ambrose, Gracemere, Kabra, Stanwell, The Caves, Campwin Beach, Sarina Beach, Finch Hatton, Eungella and Bloomsbury.[8][9][10][11][12][13][14] There was one fatality during the event when a man was killed by a falling tree while clearing a firebreak on a property near Rolleston in the Central Highlands Region.[15] Nine dwellings, and 27 sheds were destroyed by the fires while another 17 dwellings, 72 sheds and 28 vehicles sustained damage.[1] Approximately 1.4 million hectares was burnt out during the event, destroying sugarcane and banana crops as well as 110,000 hectares of the Eungella National Park.[1][16] According to Queensland Government statistics, the fires were fought by 4,200 firefighters, including 1,200 brought in from other Australian states, with 59 aerial firefighting aircraft used to drop 12 million litres of suppressant onto the fires in a bid to stop them spreading.[1] More than 70 schools and early education centres were closed during the fires, including Mount Larcom State School where an agricultural shed was destroyed when a fire front arrived at the township.[1][17] During the fires, residents of Bloomsbury were critical of the apparent lack of support and direction from Mackay Regional Council in relation to a bushfire burning in their area.[14]  However, Mackay mayor Greg Williamson said the council had not received any request for assistance at Bloomsbury but were aware there were rural fire brigades on the ground attempting to save properties.[14]"

The driver was fined $5000 after pleading guilty to misconduct with regard to a corpse."

Laskar said the storm was due to an unstable atmosphere caused by excessive heat and humidity. \"It is quite normal in the pre-monsoon season,\" he added.[2] The severity of the storm was likely due to wind pulling the moisture from the Bay of Bengal northward to north Bihar, where it converged with another cloud formation to form a 20\u00a0km tall cloud mass.[12] The cool air in the clouds was met by hot air rising from the ground, which caused the storm to start rotating.[12] Although thunderstorms had been predicted, the severity of the storm was unexpected.[1] Although not a tropical cyclone, the storm brought back memories of Cyclone Aila, which killed 155 people in the same area in May 2009.[11] One eyewitness described the storm: \"It was all dark. I thought it was the end of the world and we were going to die.\"[13] Locals received no warning of the impending storm, and were mostly sleeping when the storm hit, increasing the casualties.[14] Out-dated equipment with limited capabilities was blamed for the lack of warnings.[15] The storm spawned a large tornado,[16] which lasted about 20 minutes.[12] It was the first tornado recorded in Bihar history.[15] Tornadoes are a very rare occurrence in India \u2013 the last one was in 1998.[15] Radar equipment which could have provided early warning had arrived in the area, but had not yet been installed because the building to house it was still under construction.[15] The storm occurred during a heat wave with temperatures greater than 40\u00a0\u00b0C (104\u00a0\u00b0F) reported.[11] West Bengal regional weather office director Gokul Chandra Debnath said that the heatwave \"could have been a catalyst ... that triggered the tornado\".[16] The amount of damage caused directly by the tornado is unknown.[15]"

The state government has failed.\"[25] The CPM and other left parties accused Dasmunshi and Bandopadhyay of \"playing politics at the cost of human lives\".[25] Janata Dal (United) leader Sharad Yadav demanded that the House have a more thorough discussion on the matter.[24]"

In Karandighi, hundreds of protesters squatted on the highway, closing it down for three hours on 15 April.[32] Protests were also held in Raniganj.[32] On 16 April, \"Thousands of villagers staged angry protests in front of government offices [in Karandighi and Hemtabad] demanding more relief materials and assaulted officials when they came to open the offices,\" according to West Bengal relief minister Mortaza Hossain.[30] Riot police had to be dispatched to both Karandighi and Hematabad.[30] In Hemtabad, angry villagers attacked the block development building and shut down the Raiganj-Balurghat state highway for 30 minutes.[23] Raids on several rural offices were reported in the North Dinajpur district on 16 April.[23] Accusations of corruption were made in Karandighi and Raiganj, with some storm victims claiming they received only part of their promised relief payments.[31] In Karandighi, anger lead to looting and later violence.  Shortly after 2pm IST on 15 April, a delivery of 500 tarpaulin sheets arrived.[31] Villagers seeing that the supply would not be enough for everyone in need decided to take matters into their own hands.[31] Some protesters jumped a wall, broke into the godown, and looted the tarpaulins.[30] Police were called in, but were blocked from entering the facility by protesters.[31] One looter remarked \"What else could I have done? The government is not helping us so we have to help ourselves.\"[31] Just after noon on 16 April, an angry mob attacked Panchayat Pradhan Badal Singh and began to beat him.[23] One of the perpetrators said he couldn't control his anger when he saw that Singh \"was distributing the [tarpaulin] sheets only to his party supporters.\"[23] Throughout the North Dinajpur district, panchayat leaders have fled their homes after being attacked by angry villagers.[25] On 19 April, protesters blocked National Highway 34 at Panisala in the Raiganj subdivision.[33] Others surrounding the panchayat office demanding more relief.[25] The police fired shots into the air to scare the crowd off the highway after it was shut down for about an hour.[33] According to one report, the Socialist Unity Centre of India (Communist) was responsible for organising the road block.[33] Later that evening, at 5:30pm IST, 1,500 people who had been dispersed earlier attacked the police at Sitgram.[25] Three sub-inspectors were badly beaten and two police vehicles pushed into a ditch before the crowd was dispersed with tear gas and shots fired into the air.[25] District magistrate Ramanuj Chakrabarty claimed that \"the distribution of relief has picked up\" and that the attack \"was politically motivated.\"[25]"

The shires from Coffs Harbour to Tweed Heads and inland to Casino and Kyogle were declared a State of Emergency on January 7, as 68 fires raged.[4] On 29 December, the Dept of Bushfire Services was monitoring more than a dozen fires around the state, and homes were threatened in Turramurra by a fire in the Lane Cove River reserve, and a scrub fire had briefly cut off the holiday village of Bundeena in the Royal National Park south of Sydney.[5] On the south coast, fires ignited at Pretty Beach in the Murramarang National Park on 5 January, threatening Bendalong and Manyana, where hundredsd were evacuated. Other fires lit in the Morton National Park, and areas near Ulladulla and Sussex Inlet, where a house was lost on 7 January, while buildings burned at Dolphin Point, Ulladulla and the Princes Highway was cut near Burril Lake. The towns of Broulee and Mossy Point came under threat from a fire west of Mogo. Thousands of homes under threat in Batemans Bay and surrounds was considered safe by 10 January. The Waterfall fire forced evacuations in Helensburgh.[6] Flames first struck the Sutherland Shire in Sydney's south on 5 January, when a fire, probably deliberately lit, burned out of the north east corner of the Royal National Park damaging houses at Bundeena and along Port Hacking. Back burning protected property, but nearly all 16,000 hectares of the national park was burned. Homes were lost at Menai, Illawong, Bangor and Alfords Point. On Saturday the 8th, the fire swept into the suburbs of Como and Jannali where more than 100 buildings would be destroyed, including two schools a church and a kindergarten.[7][8] The Como/Jannali fire burnt 476 hectares and destroyed 101 houses - more than half of the total homes lost in New South Wales during the January emergency period.[9] Also on 8 January, fires had reached to within 1.5km of Gosford city centre, and some 5000 people had been evacuated over that weekend with homes destroyed at Somersby and Peats Ridge.[10] A fire was reported in the northern end of the Lane Cove National Park on 6 January. The blaze went on to consume 320 hectares of the Park and burn down 13 houses in 48 hours, racing down the river valley impacting West Pymble, West Killara, Lindfield,  Macquarie Park, and the Northern Suburbs Crematorium.[11] By Friday, January 7, fires were raging to the north and south of Sydney and in its suburbs, leaving only local resources to be sent against suspicious fires that broke out in isolated country on the Bells Line of Road in the Blue Mountains, and spread quickly. By the following day, the Mount Wilson fire was raging out of control out of the Grose Valley, with 30 metre high flames, it consumed homes at Winmalee and Hawkesbury Heights. Roads through the Mountains were cut. On Sunday the \"Battle of Bilpin\" wave after wave of helicopters dumped water and saving further property loss, before conditions eased on Monday allowing massive back burning operations.[12] The Age newspaper reported on 7 January that one quarter of NSW was under threat in the worst fires seen in the state for nearly 50 years, as hundreds of firefighters from interstate joined 4000 NSW firefighters battling blazes from Batemans Bay to Grafton. Fires in the Lane Cove River area at Marsfield, Turramurra, West Pymble and Macquarie Park were threatening hundreds of homes, and the fire in the Royal National Park south of Sydney raged toward Bundeena, where rescue boats evacuated 3100 people caught in the path of the fire. With the Prime Minister Paul Keating on leave, Deputy Prime Minister Brian Howe, ordered 100 soldiers to join firefighting efforts, and placed a further 100 on standby.[13] A suspicious fire ignited at Cottage Point in Kuringai Chase National Park on 7 January and spread to burn down 30 houses and 10,000 hectares of the Park, with 3000 elsewhere. Major backburning protected the surrounding suburbs but smothered Sydney in smoke.[14] By 9 January, more than 16,000 people were on standby for evacuation from the Lower Blue Mountains. Thousands of people were sleeping on the football field at the Central Coast Leagues Club, after the evacuation of Kariong, Woy Woy, Umina, Ettalong and Brisbane Waters. Much of Gosford, Kariong and Somersby had been evacuated, along with Terrey Hills. Homes at Menai, Sutherland, Chatswood, Lindfield, Turramurra, Macquarie Park and Sydney's northern beaches had been lost. 60 fires were burning on the north coast, as firefighters battled infernos over 30 hectares from Coffs Harbour to the Queensland border. Fires were approaching towns in the Blue Mountains including Blackheath and in the Shoalhaven, including Ulladulla.[15] By 15 January, about 450 square km had been burned in the Gosford area and fires in the Gospers Mountain/Wollemi National Park and west of the Kulnura and Mangrove Mountain were still causing ongoing concern for Gosford. Arsonists had lit blazes in the area, including a Mangrove Mountain fire threatening the city.[16] Thirteen houses were destroyed in suburbs around Lane Cove National Park and 42 were destroyed around Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, Garigal National Park and the Royal National Park, 9 houses including a Youth hostel were destroyed in Hawkesbury Heights in the Blue Mountains."

A heatwave in early January 1939 ensured the fuel load was very dry and particularly susceptible to fire. The fires were finally extinguished when thunderstorms arrived during Saturday evening of 14 January. Damage was assessed at \u00a3650,000, including the destruction of ninety houses. There were no deaths, but the fire highlighted the inadequacy of South Australia's fire-fighting capability. Six thousand city volunteers had helped to combat the fires, using mainly branches and wet bags. As a result, the Emergency Fire Service was set up, the precursor to the modern Country Fire Service.[1]"

        "content": " Typhoon Fengshen was the strongest storm of the 2002 Pacific typhoon season.[1] It developed on July\u00a013 from the monsoon trough near the Marshall Islands, and quickly intensified due to its small size. By July\u00a015, Fengshen attained typhoon status, and after initially moving to the north, it turned toward the northwest. On July\u00a018, the typhoon reached its peak intensity of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph 10\u2011minute winds), according to the Japan Meteorological Agency. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center estimated peak winds of 270\u00a0km/h (165\u00a0mph 1\u2011minute winds), and the agency estimated that Fengshen was a super typhoon for five days. This broke the record for longest duration at that intensity, previously set by Typhoon Joan in 1997, and which was later tied by Typhoon Ioke in 2006. While near peak intensity, Typhoon Fengshen underwent the Fujiwhara effect with Typhoon Fung-wong, causing the latter storm to loop to its south. Fengshen gradually weakened while approaching Japan, and it crossed over the country's \u014csumi Islands on July\u00a025 as a severe tropical storm. The typhoon washed a freighter ashore, killing four people and forcing the other 15\u00a0crew members to be rescued. In the country, Fengshen dropped heavy rainfall that caused mudslides and left $4\u00a0million (\u00a5475\u00a0million 2002\u00a0JPY),[nb 1] in crop damage. There was an additional death in the country. After affecting Japan, Fengshen weakened in the Yellow Sea to a tropical depression, before moving across China's Shandong Peninsula and dissipating on July\u00a028."

        "content": "Late on July\u00a013, a tropical depression developed near the Marshall Islands northeast of Kwajalein Atoll.[1][2] The cyclone quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Fengshen just six hours after forming.[1] On July\u00a014, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)[nb 2] initiated warnings on Fengshen just two hours after first monitoring the disturbance.[2] By that time, the system consisted of a distinct circulation with developing convection, located in an area of weak wind shear.[4] The storm initially moved northwestward, emerging from the monsoon trough as a small cyclone. Quick intensification followed, and an upper-level low to the northwest assisted in providing outflow.[2] After a 13\u00a0km (8\u00a0mi) wide eye developed,[4] the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA)[nb 3] upgraded Fengshen to a typhoon on July\u00a015 to the southwest of Wake Island;[1] the JTWC also upgraded the storm the same day.[2] On July\u00a016, Fengshen turned sharply westward due to a subtropical ridge to its northwest, and it maintained that movement for the next four days.[2] By late on July\u00a018, the JMA estimated that Fengshen attained maximum sustained winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph 10\u2011minute),[1] around the same time the JTWC upgraded the storm to a super typhoon.[2] After maintaining its peak intensity for 24\u00a0hours, Fengshen weakened slightly and began a turn to the northwest.[1] The weakening was possibly due to an eyewall replacement cycle, and although previously it was a small storm, the typhoon gradually increased in size.[4] Around that time of its weakening, Fengshen began undergoing the Fujiwhara effect with Typhoon Fung-wong; the latter looped to the south of Fengshen and dissipated on July\u00a029.[4] On July\u00a021, Fengshen began re-intensifying, and the JMA reported that the typhoon again reached winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph 10\u2011minute).[1] At around the same time, the JTWC estimated winds of 270\u00a0km/h (165\u00a0mph 1\u2011minute). Fengshen retained much of its intensity until July\u00a022, being a super typhoon for five days.[2] This set the record for greatest duration at the intensity, surpassing the previous record of 114\u00a0hours set by Typhoon Joan in 1997;[4] Fengshen's record was later tied by Typhoon Ioke in 2006.[5] After several days as a powerful typhoon, Fengshen began a weakening trend due to decreased outflow and dry air.[4] It weakened below super typhoon status after being at that intensity for five days.[2] On July\u00a024, Fengshen turned more to the west while passing to the south of mainland Japan, and the next day it weakened below typhoon intensity. At 1145\u00a0UTC on July\u00a025, Fengshen made landfall on Yakushima in Japan's \u014csumi Islands, while a severe tropical storm. The next day, the storm passed a short distance southwest of Jeju Island offshore South Korea. After entering the Yellow Sea, Fengshen weakened into a tropical depression,[1] and on July\u00a027 the JTWC discontinued advisories,[2] after much of the convection had dissipated.[4] The JMA continued tracking the system, and Fengshen made landfall on China's Shandong Peninsula late on July\u00a027. The next day, the depression dissipated over the Bohai Sea.[1]"

Most of the precipitation fell in a 24\u2011hour period, and the heaviest 1\u00a0hour total was 52\u00a0mm (2.0\u00a0in) in Taira, Toyama. The highest winds in Japan was 101\u00a0km/h (63\u00a0mph) recorded in K\u014dchi Prefecture.[11] The storm left about 8,200\u00a0homes in Kagoshima Prefecture without power.[12] High rainfall caused at least six mudslides, one of which damaged a county road.[7][13] A total of 20\u00a0homes were damaged in the country,[11] and 200\u00a0families were evacuated.[14] High rains damaged 5,699\u00a0hectares (14,083\u00a0acres) of crop fields, totaling $4\u00a0million (\u00a5475\u00a0million 2002\u00a0JPY).[nb 4][7][13] Fengshen killed one person and severely injured another person in the country.[11] The remnants of Fengshen produced heavy rainfall in northeastern China. The storm affected the capital city of Beijing, becoming the first storm to produce significant impact there since Typhoon Rita in 1972. In a two-day period, a station in the city reported 41.4\u00a0mm (1.63\u00a0in) of rainfall. The heaviest rainfall was in Jilin province, where 104.9\u00a0mm (4.13\u00a0in) was recorded in Yushu.[4]"

The Greek army was ordered to help motorists by delivering food, water, and blankets. Around 3500 people were saved from the ring road but 1200 cars remained stuck due to freezing conditions.[19] Fifteen passengers were injured when operators tried to pull a train stuck in the snow and carrying about 200 passengers.[20][21] The Hellenic National Meteorological Service reported that a landspout occurred on Andros due to the storm.[22] Due to the instability of the cold air passing through warm waters above the Aegean Sea, the weather front also caused thundersnows in the regions of Euboea and Attica and a snowspout in Andros.[23][24][25][26] In addition, very low temperatures were recorded in Greece; the lowest was recorded in Lefkochori, Phthiotis at \u221218.1\u00a0\u00b0C (\u22120.6\u00a0\u00b0F).[27] Further north, Montenegro set a national low temperature record of \u221233.4\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221228.1\u00a0\u00b0F).[1] Elpis went as far as Israel by starting with heavy rain in the North and coastal areas.[28][29] Snow fell throughout the day in Mount Hermon, northern Golan Heights and in the mountains of northern and central Israel, including in Safed and Jerusalem in the early hours of January 27, 2022.[30]  Three people died in Israel from carbon monoxide poisoning.[31]"

In this area, abutting the intersection of I-65 and US 31, hundreds of homes were completely destroyed, many of which were completely swept away, despite being well-built. Some of the homes built into hillsides even had their cinder-block basement walls swept away, and at least one home was reportedly annihilated, with even its foundation said to be missing. Many trees in the area were snapped and debarked and vehicles were thrown and destroyed. A pair of dump-trucks were thrown through the air as well. Ted Fujita followed the tornado and supercell from an airplane and while surveying damage; he rated the Smithfield tornado F5, but initially considered assigning a rating of F6.

Extreme morning temperatures coupled with strong north-westerly winds contributed to the breakout of numerous fires in Adelaide Hills, Jamestown, Waterloo, Kingston and Millicent. Most were caused by sparks from powerlines in the wind.[4] Around 1,000 Emergency Fire Service volunteers from 60 brigades were tasked to the fires, but were overwhelmed. At 10am, the EFS head office requested urgent public assistance. Around 2,500 citizens volunteered. The fires were contained by 9:30pm, thanks largely to a fortuitous change in the weather and widespread public assistance.[4] The fires resulted in two deaths, destroyed 40 homes and numerous other buildings, and caused more than A$4\u00a0million worth of property damage, most notably the destruction of the Governor's summer residence at Marble Hill. Governor Robert George, his family and staff were lucky to escape with their lives. The Premier, Sir Thomas Playford, also narrowly escaped death, sheltering with five other men in a patch of hoed earth near Cherryville.[5] The burnt area was estimated at as much as 160,000 hectares (600\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) stretching from One Tree Hill to Strathalbyn;[1] however, other sources put the area at closer to 39,000 hectares (150\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[2]"

        "content": " Typhoon Alex, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Etang,[1] affected the Taiwan, China, and South Korea during July\u00a01987. Typhoon Alex developed from the monsoon trough that spawned a tropical disturbance late on July\u00a021 southwest of Guam which organized into a tropical depression shortly thereafter. The system steadily became better organized, and the next day, a tropical depression had developed. Satellite intensity estimates gradually increased, and on July\u00a023, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Alex. After initially tracking west-northwest, Tropical Storm Alex started tracking northwest. An eye developed on July\u00a024, and on the next day, Alex was classified as a typhoon, when Alex attained its peak intensity of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 970\u00a0mbar (29\u00a0inHg). Alex weakened while tracking more northward, though interaction with Taiwan resulted in a more westward track starting on July\u00a027. The storm struck near Shanghai as a tropical storm, and weakened over land, although it remained identifiable through August\u00a02. Across Taiwan, the storm inflicted minor damage and one person was killed. In the province of Zhejiang, Alex damaged or destroyed over 200\u00a0fishing\u00a0boats, wiped out 22\u00a0bridges, snapped 32\u00a0power\u00a0lines, and flooded four reservoirs. Damage there exceeded US$1.8\u00a0million. In Jiaxing, at least 121,405 hectares (300,000 acres) of farmland were flooded. Nation-wide, 125\u00a0people were killed and roughly 200 were wounded. Close to 700\u00a0homes were demolished while roughly 200\u00a0fishing\u00a0boats were damaged. Across South Korea, the storm dumped heavy rainfall, with daily totals of 300\u00a0mm (12\u00a0in) in some places, triggering flooding and landslides."

        "content": "Typhoon Alex developed in the western edge of the Western Pacific monsoon trough which stretched 2,500\u00a0km (1,555\u00a0mi) near the 10th parallel north from the Carolina Islands to the International Date Line. Late on July\u00a021, satellite imagery first detected a tropical disturbance 370\u00a0km (230\u00a0mi) to the southwest of Guam,[2] which prompted the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) to upgrade the system to a tropical depression.[3][nb 1][nb 2] At 06:00\u00a0UTC on the next day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began to follow the system as the disturbance had developed curved banding features. A rapid increase in both convection and organization followed, and at 18:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a022, satellite imagery showed the development of a central dense overcast, with Dvorak intensity estimates supporting an intensity of 50\u00a0km/h (30\u00a0mph). At 19:30\u00a0UTC, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert despite satellite imagery only detecting a broad, ill-defined low-level circulation, with a minimum barometric pressure of 1005\u00a0mbar (29.68\u00a0inHg). By 00:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a023, Dvorak intensity estimates reached T2.5/65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph) and a ship to the north of the system reported winds of 55\u00a0km/h (35\u00a0mph), which resulted in the JTWC declaring the system a tropical depression.[2] Initially, the depression was tracking west[6] and was forecast by the JTWC to track across the Philippine Islands. This was in agreement with most tropical cyclone forecast models showing the storm track across the archipelago and the turning northward in the general direction of China, although the JTWC eventually shifted the track further north into the Luzon Straits. At 06:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a023, the JTWC upgraded the depression into Tropical Storm Alex,[2] with the JMA doing the same six hours later. Late the next evening, the JMA upgraded Alex to a severe tropical storm[3] as satellite images showed the center of the storm moving under the deep convection after previously being exposed to its northeast. Continuing to slowly intensify,[2] Alex turned northwest.[6] It developed an eye between 15:00\u00a0UTC and 18:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a024. The next morning the JTWC declared Alex a typhoon while also estimating that the storm attained its peak intensity of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph).[2] Upon becoming a typhoon, Alex was located 220\u00a0km (135\u00a0mi) east of the northern tip of Luzon. By this time, most forecast models showed a northward movement east of Taiwan due to a weakness in a subtropical ridge south of Japan and the presence of a surface front across the east coast of Asia.[2] On the evening of July\u00a025, the JMA classified Alex as a typhoon while also reporting that Alex obtained its peak intensity of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph) and a minimum pressure of 970\u00a0mbar (29\u00a0inHg).[3] Although satellite images continued to depict a warm spot, suggesting the presence of an eye,[2] both the JMA and JTWC estimated that Alex fell below typhoon intensity on July\u00a026;[7] however, according to the JMA, Alex briefly re-intensified back to a typhoon that evening.[3] Alex turned north in response to the aforementioned front, passing 55\u00a0km (34\u00a0mi) east of Taipei. Interaction with the high terrain of Taiwan caused Alex to deflect west, striking Wenzhou as a weakening tropical storm[2] on the evening of July\u00a027.[6] The storm rapidly dissipated over land according to the JTWC,[2] although the JMA continued to track Alex as a minimal tropical storm[3] when it moved back over open water in the Sea of Japan on the evening of July\u00a028. Even though Alex failed to regenerate according to the JTWC,[2] the JMA continued to track the system as a tropical depression through August\u00a02.[3]"

A 35-year-old man was crushed to death by a falling wall in Keelung due to strong winds.[8] Air and train services were also disrupted.[9] Typhoon Alex lashed the Chinese province of Zhejiang for fourteen hours. The storm damaged or demolished more than 200\u00a0fishing\u00a0boats, wiped out 22 bridges, snapped 32\u00a0power\u00a0lines, and flooded four reservoirs. The cities of Wenzhou and Jiaxing were the hardest hit, with as much as 290\u00a0mm (11.4\u00a0in) of rain falling. Damage in the area exceeded US$1.8\u00a0million.[10] In the former, 34 people were killed.[11] In Jiaxing, a minimum of 121,405\u00a0ha (300,000 acres) of farmland were flooded.[10] Throughout the suburbs of Shanghai, north of where the storm moved ashore 32\u00a0individuals sustained injuries and 400 homes were damaged or destroyed.[12] More than 100 pigs were killed there.[13] One person was killed in a tornado spawned by the typhoon in Shanghai.[14] Overall, 125\u00a0people were killed and roughly 200 were wounded. Approximately 700\u00a0homes were destroyed along with 27,000\u00a0ha (66,720 acres) of crops. Around 200\u00a0fishing\u00a0boats were damaged.[6] Following the storm, local army troops and civilians assisted in rescue work in Zhejiang.[10] Under the anticipation that Alex would directly strike South Korea, typhoon warnings were posted for the coastline. After forecasts shifted west,[15] the warning was lowered to a high wind warning.[16] Affecting a country inundated by a series of systems that started with Typhoon Thelma,[17] \nthe storm deluged the country with up to 300\u00a0mm (12\u00a0in) of rainfall in a single day. This resulted in serious flooding, landslides, and loss of life.[2]"

The tornado slowly chewed its way from northwest to southeast through Manson. The tornado was on the southwest side of a large southeast-moving thunderstorm complex; thus, it was surrounded on three sides by clear skies (in fact, the sun was shining) and was highly visible. Severe damage was done to the central business district with 25 of the 35 business either destroyed or severely damaged. The middle school was also destroyed as were about 110 homes. Another 139 homes were damaged. The General Telephone Company exchange building for Manson was completely destroyed - the first time this had ever happened in Iowa. It was reported that the storm was like a lawn mower going through the city, and afterwards one could see from one end of the city to the other when looking up the damage track.[4] There was about 30 minutes warning and the tornado sirens were sounded well before the arrival of the tornado. The fact that it was still daylight also contributed to the relatively low death count from this destructive storm."

The crater's existence was first discovered during an oil-drilling wildcatting expedition in the 1930s. At one time, it was thought to be the biggest impact by an object from outer space in North America, until subsequent studies revealed larger examples. The impact event was also once theorized to have led to the extinction of the dinosaurs, or contributed to it as a fragment of the Chicxulub meteor, until tests by the U.S. Geological Survey in 1991 and 1992 proved that it was too old by 9 million years. Not much remains due to glacial till which has filled in the crater and has made it undetectable at ground level. However, due to this infilling it is one of the best preserved impact sites on Earth. The impact crater measures approximately 24 miles (39\u00a0km) in diameter and the city of Manson is located near the center of the impact site."

Augur announced the selection of a site three miles (5\u00a0km) west of Crow Creek Crossing for a U.S. Army fort to protect the railroad.[9] The Union Pacific Railroad platted its Crow Creek Crossing townsite on July 5, 1867.[10] Residents named the town Cheyenne for the Cheyenne Native American people.[11] On August 8, 1867, the Town of Cheyenne, Dakota Territory was incorporated, and on August 10, 1867, H. M. Hook was elected as Cheyenne's first mayor.[11] The tracks of the Union Pacific Railroad reached Cheyenne on November 13, 1867, and the first train arrived the following day.[10] Cheyenne grew so quickly it gained the nickname of \"Magic City of the Plains\".[8] On September 8, 1867, the United States Army established Fort D.A. Russell in honor of Brigadier General David Allen Russell.[9] Initially a cavalry encampment, construction of the fort began the following month.[8] The fort was renamed Fort Francis E. Warren in 1930 in honor of the first Governor of the State of Wyoming, Francis E. Warren.[12] The fort was transferred to the new United States Air Force and was renamed Francis E. Warren Air Force Base in October 1949.[12] On July 25, 1868, the United States organized the Territory of Wyoming.[13] Territorial Governor John Allen Campbell arrived in Cheyenne on May 7, 1869, and named Cheyenne the temporary territorial capital.[14] Cheyenne has remained the only capital of Wyoming.  On December 10, 1869, the first session of the Wyoming Territorial Legislature met in Cheyenne.[14]  That day, the legislature passed and Territorial Governor Campbell signed an act to re-incorporate the Town of Cheyenne, Wyoming Territory, and an act granting women the right to vote, the first U.S. state or territory to grant suffrage to women.[14] On July 10, 1890, the Territory of Wyoming was admitted to the Union as the State of Wyoming.[15] The Wyoming State Capitol was constructed between 1886 and 1890, with further improvements being completed in 1917. The Cheyenne Regional Airport was opened in 1920, initially serving as a stop for airmail. It soon developed into a civil-military airport, serving DC-3s and various military craft. During World War II, hundreds of B-17s, B-24s, and PBYs were outfitted and upgraded at the airfield. Today, it serves a number of military functions, and as a high-altitude testbed for civilian craft.[16]"

A fierce wind arose, gathering strength and velocity from hour to hour, until about noon it blew with the violence of a tornado.

It is believed that the disaster began in Plenty Ranges when a couple of bullock drivers left logs burning unattended, which set fire to long, dry grass affected by the recent drought. The year preceding the fires was exceptionally hot and dry and this trend continued into 1851.[3]"

Survivors claimed the air was so full of smoke and heat that their lungs seemed to collapse. The air was so dark it made the roads seem bright.[1]\nPastures and plains became shrivelled wastelands: water-holes disappeared, creeks dried up, and trees turned into combustible timber. Clouds of smoke filled the air; forests and ranges became one large \"sheet of flames\".[1] The hot north wind was so strong that thick black smoke reached northern Tasmania, creating a murky mist, resembling a combination of smoke and fog.[4] Homes, crops and gardens were consumed by the rushing fire leaving a quarter of Victoria in a heap of desolate ruins. The community fled to water to escape the suffocating air around them, returning after everything was over to the sight of \"blackened homesteads\" and the charred bodies of animals that could not escape. The weather at sea was even \"more fearful than on shore\".[1] The intense heat could be felt 32\u00a0km (20\u00a0mi) out to sea where a ship came under burning ember attack and was covered in cinders and dust.[5] Eventually, a southerly breeze and light rain cooled the surface.[1]"

Fully one half of the timber in this neighbourhood has been burned or blown down, and all the grass has been burnt.[6] The catastrophic fire caused the loss of human life, cattle, and land for miles and affected many regions including Portland, Plenty Ranges, Western Port,[7] the Wimmera and Dandenong districts, Gippsland, and Mount Macedon. Farms across the region were destroyed, along with a number of settlements in Gippsland, Western Port, Geelong, Heidelberg and east to Diamond Creek and Dandenong. Three men from Mount Macedon died. Overall, the disaster resulted in the death of twelve people, one million sheep, and thousands of cattle over 60 to 80 kilometres (40 to 50\u00a0mi). The initial response to the calamity was a public meeting held on 11 February 1851 at Geelong. The community came together to discuss relief efforts for those affected, especially for citizens who lost everything. To assist the poor, many even cancelled outstanding debts."

        "content": "Intense bushfires are not uncommon in southern Australia. The region is one of the three most fire-prone in the world. Within the last two hundred years, the area has experienced and documented at least twenty-five major fires, beginning with Black Thursday in 1851. The intensity of these fires is due in part to natural fuels, such as sclerophyll forests in the region. While adapting to cope with drought and predators, the trees' leaves turn into prime fuel for fires. They become tough as protection from dry conditions and to increase the efficiency of nutrient use. They also develop tough spikes and chemicals to protect themselves from small animals. The leaves' tough surface allows them to last longer and build up on the forest floor and the chemical makes them flammable. The abundance of flammable fuel can cause an inferno with a single spark.[8] The area's disturbance regime has shaped the landscape by causing the plant communities to evolve and develop mechanisms to aid in speedy recovery. The native species of the Australian bush, for example, have developed post fire seed release and smoke exposure germination. Other plants, such as acacia, eucalyptus,[9] and Monotoca elliptica[10] have adapted to survive in dry, nutrient poor soil.[8] Acacia oncinocarpa and Eucalyptus miniata, for example, and perennial herbs all have adaptive mechanisms that enable them to live in fire-prone areas of Australia. Both the acacia (a small spreading shrub) and eucalyptus (an overstorey tree) can regenerate from seeds and vegetatively regenerate new shoots from buds that escape fire. Reproduction and seed fall occur during the eight dry months. Due to the area's frequent fires, the seeds are usually released onto a recently burnt seed bed.[11] Perennial herbs survive fire by avoidance. They make up the understorey and grow during seasons with lower temperatures and more rainfall. By dying back in the summer they avoid most fires. During a fire, they have a bulb or root mass that lives underground, and only the dead stems and leaves burn, so the plant survives and begins to grow again the following year.[8]"

        "content": " The South Saskatchewan River[1] is a major river in the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. The river begins at the confluence of the Bow and Oldman Rivers in southern Alberta and ends at the Saskatchewan River Forks in central Saskatchewan. The Saskatchewan River Forks is the confluence of the South and North Saskatchewan Rivers and is the beginning of the Saskatchewan River. For the first half of the 20th century, the South Saskatchewan would completely freeze over during winter, creating spectacular ice breaks and dangerous conditions in Saskatoon, Medicine Hat, and elsewhere. At least one bridge in Saskatoon was destroyed by ice carried by the river. The construction of the Gardiner Dam in the 1960s, however, lessened the power of the river by diverting a substantial portion of the South Saskatchewan's natural flow into the Qu'Appelle River. By the 1980s many permanent sandbars had formed due to the lowering of the level of the river. From the headwaters of the Bow River, the South Saskatchewan flows for 1,392 kilometres (865\u00a0mi). At its mouth at Saskatchewan River Forks, it has an average discharge of 280 cubic metres per second (9,900\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s) and has a watershed of 146,100 square kilometres (56,400\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), 1,800 of which are in Montana in the United States and 144,300 square kilometres (55,700\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in Alberta and Saskatchewan.[2]"

The waters of these two rivers, in turn, originate from winter snowpack and rainfall in the Rocky Mountains near the British Columbia and Montana border.  Glacier and snowmelt from the Rocky Mountains and foothills contributes nearly 90% of the annual flow, with most of that contribution during July and August.[3] The Red Deer River is a major tributary of the South Saskatchewan merging 16 kilometres (10\u00a0mi) east of the Alberta-Saskatchewan border. The Lake Diefenbaker reservoir was created with the construction of the Gardiner and Qu'Appelle River dams in Saskatchewan. Water from the South Saskatchewan flowing through the dams provides approximately 19\u00a0percent of the hydro-electricity generated by SaskPower.[4] Downstream from the dam the river flows north through Saskatoon and joins the North Saskatchewan River east of Prince Albert at the Saskatchewan River Forks \u2014 thus forming the Saskatchewan River. For approximately 60 kilometres (37\u00a0mi) near Saskatoon, the Meewasin Valley Authority is responsible for conservation of the river environment. Numerous lakes in the Saskatoon area were formed by oxbows of the South Saskatchewan River, most notably Moon Lake and Pike Lake.[3] A 2009 report,[5] produced by WWF-Canada which analysed the river flow on ten major Canadian rivers reported that the South Saskatchewan River was the most at risk. Climate change, agricultural and urban infrastructure water use, and dams producing hydroelectricity, have all combined to reduce the flow of the South Saskatchewan River by 70\u00a0percent. Developers and governments have been cautioned to protect and restore the river with sustainable projects and limit water diversion.[6] Dickson Dam regulates water supply downstream on the Red Deer River; the Bassano Dam and 11 other dams divert water on the Bow River and in the Bow River basin; and the Oldman River Dam and Waterton-St. Mary Headworks System manage water flow downstream of the Oldman River.[7] The proposed Meridian dam 30 kilometres (19\u00a0mi) west of Leader and 95 kilometres (59\u00a0mi) north east of Medicine Hat was cancelled due to project costs outweighing the irrigation benefits.[8][9]"

        "content": " Tropical Storm Odile was a late season tropical storm that formed during the 2008 Pacific hurricane season and affected parts of southern Mexico. A tropical depression formed on October 8, and became Tropical Storm Odile 18 hours later. The storm paralleled the south coast of Mexico, with the center located only several miles offshore. After peaking in intensity, increasing southeasterly vertical wind shear induced a trend of rapid weakening on the storm. Correspondingly, Odile was downgraded to a tropical depression early on 12 October, subsequently degenerating into a remnant low about 55\u00a0mi (85\u00a0km) south of Manzanillo, Colima. From thereon, the low proceeded slowly south-southwestward before dissipating on October 13. Since Odile stayed at sea, its effects along coastlines were limited. The most notable damages were caused by flooding along the southern coast of Mexico, mostly in Chiapas, Oaxaca, Guerrero and Michoac\u00e1n. The exact amount of damage, however, remains unknown, and no fatalities were reported as a result of the storm."

        "content": "A tropical wave emerged off the west coast of Africa on September 23, and merged with the southern end of a decaying frontal system over the Caribbean Sea.[1] The combined disturbance gradually split, with the northernmost section eventually becoming Tropical Storm Marco.[1] The southernmost end moved into the eastern Pacific, which then immediately showed signs of organization.[1][2] The system stalled just south of El Salvador throughout October 5,[1] where it came under the influence of strong vertical wind shear.[3][4] The circulation slowly drifted east-northeastward and became absorbed by a neighboring tropical wave, with the broad resultant low re-curving to the west-northwest.[4] In response to relaxing shear aloft, convection redeveloped around the newly formed center of circulation.[1][5] It subsequently acquired a sufficiently organized structure and post-analysis found that a tropical depression formed at around 1200\u00a0UTC on October\u00a08.[1][6] Upon developing, the depression was designated as Sixteen-E about 120\u00a0mi (195\u00a0km) south-southwest of San Salvador, El Salvador,[1] and operationally, advisories were initiated at 2100\u00a0UTC \u2014 9 hours after post-analytic estimates of formation.[7] Despite being in an area with favorable conditions, lack of inner core organization proved difficult for rapid deepening to occur, and initially, model guidance did not forecast any significant strengthening.[6] Contrary to expectations, satellite imagery showed a gradual increase in organization later that evening. Bands of convection deepened in the southern quadrant, indicating that the storm was steadily strengthening.[8] Located just to the south of a large mid-level ridge over Mexico, the system was steered toward the west-northwest, proceeding within a favorable environment.[1][8] Based on the improved appearance on satellite imagery, it is estimated the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Odile at 0600 UTC on October 9 about 330\u00a0mi (530\u00a0km) southeast of Puerto \u00c1ngel, Mexico.[1][9] Shortly after attaining tropical storm status, Odile began to develop a small area of central dense overcast, and upper-level cirrus outflow became well-defined within the western semicircle of the storm.[10] Convective banding organized to the south and southwest of the circulation, leading Dvorak T-numbers to estimate an intensity of at least 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h). Based on this estimate, the NHC noted a high chance of further intensification into a minimal hurricane.[10] Odile maintained its intensity, as upper-level outflow of the circulation was reduced to the northeast.[11] Although wind shear initially dislocated the circulation from the main convection, a large burst of convection allowed Odile to intensify slightly further to peak winds of 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h) at around 0600 UTC on October 10.[1][12][13][14] Odile closely paralleled the Mexican coastline.[15] The intensification did not last long, in fact, the convection associated with Odile diminished in the afternoon and its rainbands became rather distorted.[16] Another cluster of convection sprung up that evening, this time with cloud tops colder than \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C (\u2212112\u00a0\u00b0F).[17] The circulation center was well embedded within the convection.[18] As a consequence of the slightly improved organization, Odile had a stronger interaction with the easterlies aloft, therefore increasing forward movement speed.[18] Later that day, a reconnaissance aircraft passed through Odile and observed a rather weak and disorganized tropical cyclone, resulting  in meteorologists at the NHC to change its forecasts.[19] Early on October 12, Odile made its closest approach to coastline of Mexico, only about 50\u00a0mi (80\u00a0km) offshore of Guerrero, Mexico.[1] Increasing southeasterly vertical wind shear took toll on the system.[20] Furthermore, around 0600\u00a0UTC, NHC confirmed that Odile weakened into a tropical depression.[1] The last advisory regarding Odile was issued later that day stating that it has subsequently degenerated into a remnant low-pressure area, a swirl of low-level clouds.[21] The remnants of Odile meandered slowly south-southwestward before completely dissipating on October 13.[1]"

A very large storm, Lan was the twenty-first tropical storm and ninth typhoon of the annual typhoon season. It originated from a tropical disturbance that the United States Naval Research Laboratory had begun tracking near Chuuk on October 11. Slowly consolidating, it developed into a tropical storm on October 15, and intensified into a typhoon on October 17. It expanded in size and turned northward on October 18, although the typhoon struggled to intensify for two days. On October 20, Lan grew into a very large typhoon and rapidly intensified, due to favorable conditions, with a large well-defined eye, reaching peak intensity as a \"super typhoon\" with 1-minute sustained winds of 249\u00a0km/h (155\u00a0mph) \u2013 a high-end Category 4-equivalent storm \u2013 late on the same day. Afterward, encroaching dry air and shear caused the cyclone to begin weakening and turn extratropical, before it struck Japan on October 23 as a weaker typhoon. Later that day, it became fully extratropical before it was absorbed by a larger storm shortly afterward. Lan caused significant impacts in Japan, with over 380,000 evacuations occurring in Japan, and the cancellations of several domestic flights. In total, approximately 17 deaths were attributed to the typhoon, mainly due to flooding from its rainbands. Damage totals were estimated to have been at least US$2\u00a0billion (2017 USD), making it one of the costliest typhoons to have struck Japan."

        "content": "The United States Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) initially mentioned a tropical disturbance over Chuuk on October 11.[1] After the slow consolidation, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert to the elongated system early on October 14,[2] shortly after the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started to monitor it as a low-pressure area.[3] The agency upgraded it to a tropical depression almost one day later and began to issue tropical cyclone warnings since 06:00 UTC on October 15.[4][5] In the afternoon, the JTWC also upgraded it to a tropical depression assigning the designation 25W, which formative but shallow convective bands had become more organized, and symmetrically wrapped into a defined low-level circulation center.[6] About three hours later, the JMA upgraded it to the twenty-first Northwest Pacific tropical storm in 2017 and assigned the international name Lan, when it was located approximately 310\u00a0km (190\u00a0mi) to the northeast of Palau.[7] Early on October 16, the JTWC upgraded Lan to a tropical storm based on T-number 2.5 of the Dvorak technique,[8] shortly before it entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility and received the name Paolo from PAGASA.[9] In an area of low to moderate low vertical wind shear, convection over Lan's center was occasionally displaced, but strong poleward outflow enhanced by a tropical upper tropospheric trough (TUTT) as well as sea surface temperature (SST) over 30\u00b0C with high ocean heat content (OHC) contributed to the intensification,[10] resulting in being upgraded to a severe tropical storm by the JMA at around 00:00 UTC on October 17.[11] Soon, the westward system became quasi-stationary due to a weakening subtropical ridge to the north.[12] When Lan developed into the ninth typhoon of 2017 at around 18:00 UTC,[13] it had turned slowly northward under the steering influence of a building steering ridge to the southeast and east.[12] Early on the next day, the JTWC also upgraded it to a typhoon.[14] although it later became partially exposed for a half of day.[15][16] At 12:00 UTC on October 18, the JMA reported that Lan had become a large typhoon, with a diameter of about 1,310\u00a0km (810\u00a0mi).[17] Despite favorable conditions, Lan had struggled to intensify for two days, even while growing larger in diameter.[17][18] Lan started to rapidly intensify thanks to excellent outflow, particularly poleward, which gradually formed a large and symmetric eye with a diameter of 60\u00a0mi (97\u00a0km).[19] The JMA indicated that the typhoon had reached its peak intensity at around 18:00 UTC, with the central pressure at 915\u00a0hPa (27.0\u00a0inHg) and ten-minute maximum sustained winds at 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph);[20] the JTWC also reported that Lan had intensified into a super typhoon at the same time.[19] Early on October 21, when Lan accelerated north-northeastward along the western periphery of the deep layered subtropical ridge, the JTWC reported that its one-minute maximum sustained winds reached 250\u00a0km/h (155\u00a0mph), a high-end category 4 of the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale, ranging from T6.5 to T7.0 of the Dvorak technique.[21] For increasing vertical wind shear, Lan began to weaken and undergo the extratropical transition early on October 22 with significant erosion of its eyewall, after maintaining the super typhoon status as well as peak intensity for over one day. Despite excellent poleward outflow tapping into the mid-latitude westerlies over Japan, the satellite imageries revealed cold-air stratocumulus streaming southward over the western semi-circle of the typhoon, which was associated with advection of cooler, drier air.[22] As the result, the once large eye was quickly filled, and Lan was exhibiting frontal characteristics.[23] At 03:00 JST on October 23 (18:00 UTC on October 22), Lan made landfall over Omaezaki, Shizuoka Prefecture in Japan,[24] with ten-minute maximum sustained winds at 150\u00a0km/h (93\u00a0mph) and one-minute maximum sustained winds at 165\u00a0km/h (103\u00a0mph), equivalent to a Category 2 hurricane.[25] At that time, its diameter of gale winds had expanded to approximately 1,700\u00a0km (1,100\u00a0mi).[26] Three hours later, Lan weakened to a severe tropical storm.[27] Lan entered the Pacific Ocean shortly before 09:00 JST (00:00 UTC) and continued accelerating northeastward within the westerlies, displaying a well-defined frontal structure with an exposed, broad center and rapidly decaying deep convection sheared to the northeast.[28] The JMA reported that Lan had become extratropical at 06:00 UTC,[29] although the JTWC issued a final warning three hours before and even declared an extratropical cyclone about 12 hours earlier.[28][25] A new extratropical low absorbed the former typhoon late on the same day and explosively intensified into a 934\u00a0hPa (27.6\u00a0inHg) system east of the Kamchatka Peninsula, on October 24.[30][31][32]"

It was surpassed in 2021, when the Marshall Fire destroyed over 1,000 homes in Boulder County, in Superior and Louisville.[5] The evacuation area covered 94,000 acres (147\u00a0sq\u00a0mi; 380\u00a0km2) acres, 13,000 homes and 38,000 people. Three shelters were established in the area, including Elbert County Fairgrounds, which accepted humans, pets, and large animals. Two other shelters were designated for large animals only. On June 13, the Denver Post reported, 457 firefighters were working the fireline, including agencies around the fire, the Colorado Air National Guard, and select personnel from fire suppression teams on Fort Carson and the nearby United States Air Force Academy. Of note, 3 x UH-60 and 3 x CH-47 from 2-4 GSAB along with some crews from 3-4 AHB (4th Combat Aviation Brigade) were instrumental in providing immediate response to assist in fighting the fires.

Cell phone video he captured shows the fire started as a small, localized event. The record heat and high winds quickly spread the flames to several hundred acres. As of June 20, the investigation into the cause and timeline of events continued.[9][10] The National Weather Service in Pueblo, Colorado issued notices for severe fire weather starting at 2:00\u00a0p.m. on June 12, with low humidity, high winds, and temperatures approaching 90\u00a0\u00b0F (32\u00a0\u00b0C) expected to drive the fire. As of 4:50\u00a0a.m., the evacuation area stood at 55 square miles, with firefighters from agencies around the state of Colorado being mobilized, as well as helicopters and military aircraft. In the afternoon hours of June 12, the fire exploded in size driven by dry winds, jumping fire lines and spreading out to the east, north, and west. Evacuation areas were expanded from El Paso County into Douglas and Elbert Counties, and west to Interstate 25. Some evacuation shelters were forced to evacuate due to smoke. Firefighters experienced additional frustrations with intrusions of road closures on Highway 83, Walker Road, and Evans Road, according to scanner traffic observed by The Gazette. Also observed by reporters over the scanner were instances of news media helicopters violating closed airspace above the fire, creating hazardous situations and the potential for an air disaster.[citation needed] Heavy smoke being pushed by the south/south-easterly winds covered most of the populated areas of Douglas County and pushed into other Denver suburbs. Fire investigators confirmed that lightning had been ruled out as a cause of the fire. The investigation centers just north of Shoup Road near Darr Drive, an area with many homes in a heavily wooded area.[11]"

It was also released that 1,205 homes were still unaffected by the fire, and 38,000 residents had been evacuated from 13,000 homes so far.[12] The National Weather Service predicted a third day of hot, dry, windy weather for the fire area, especially in late afternoon. Isolated thunderstorms were expected. Already the most destructive fire in Colorado history,[13] the fire remained at zero containment throughout the day with weather forecasts showing no natural relief in sight. By late Thursday morning, the fire had also severed the broadcast transmission line for 740 AM KVOR, which operates a transmitter in the evacuation zone. As a result, crews were unable to enter the area to repair the transmission line. The Gazette reported that KVOR moved to 1300 AM, a sister station. By 5:00\u00a0p.m., containment of the fire increased to five percent, and the acreage increased to 15,700 acres (24.5\u00a0sq\u00a0mi; 64\u00a0km2).[13] Sheriff Terry Maketa reported two fatalities were discovered, and the victims appeared to have died while attempting to evacuate their home.[2] Dry lightning and thunderstorms were also reported forming in the area, including one sparking a brief-lived sister fire north of Cripple Creek. Maketa announced on Friday morning that 19 more homes burned, totaling 379[14] and in the evening, his office further updated this number to 419.[15]"

        "content": "As of Friday, June 21, the fire was completely contained, but the total number of homes lost had risen to 509, and Sheriff Maketa stated that the assessed value of the lost homes totaled about $90 million.[24] The number was revised upward the next day to 511 homes lost.[21] As of June 20, 2013, the cost for fighting the fire was estimated at $9,323,955.[25] At the completion of the first of four parts of the Black Forest assessment in early July, the El Paso County Accessor's office reported that the fire destroyed 486 homes \u2014 fewer than the sheriff's department's initial estimate of 511 \u2014 and damaged 37, causing $85,444,052 in damage.    Sixteen members of the office, who have been working full-time on the fire, must now put dollar amounts to lost outbuildings, commercial structures and, perhaps most costly, trees. A treeless lot sells for about 30 percent less than one with pristine trees, and buyers will pay about 15 percent less for a lot with damaged trees. The assessor's office came up with its totals after on-site inspections of 2,400 parcels. \"We will probably have to review Black Forest in a year or two because we have no guarantee that those trees that were damaged are going to make it,\" county assessor Mark Lowderman said. Authorities continued to investigate the cause of the fire, which killed a married couple, Marc Allen Herklotz, 52, and his wife, Robin Lauran Herklotz, 50, who were attempting to flee the area. The bodies were discovered Thursday June 13 in what was the garage of a home that the blaze had leveled. They were next to a car with its doors open. The car's trunk was packed full of belongings. The sheriff's office, which said the fire's cause was not natural, has executed search warrants and conducted interviews.[6][26]"

The outbreak produced 99 confirmed tornadoes, which killed a total of 10 people. The Storm Prediction Center (SPC) issued multiple elevated outlook throughout the sequence, including a rare high risk for March 12, which would end up being the most intense day of the outbreak, producing 62 in total. 11 F3 tornadoes were tallied, and a violent F4 tornado touched down in Monroe County, Missouri, becoming the strongest of the outbreak. Multiple tornado emergencies were issued for tornadoes throughout the outbreak as well. An intense F3 tornado that affected the towns of Renick and Maddison in Missouri killed 4 people and injured dozens others, becoming the deadliest of the sequence. Multiple of the tornadoes were long-tracked in nature, with 6 of them having paths exceeding 30 miles (48\u00a0km). One particular supercell thunderstorm during the outbreak persisted for many hours and progressed in excess of 800 miles (1,300\u00a0km) through Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, and extreme southern Michigan.[citation needed] The onslaught of supercells responsible for the sequence also produced hundreds of damaging wind gust and hail accompanied the storms. These additional elements caused millions in damage and multiple injuries, in addition to two fatalities which were as a result of a weather-related automobile accident and a fire started by lightning.[2] In addition to the tornadic fatalities, this sequence was responsible for 182 tornadic injuries, most of them concentrating in Missouri and Illinois, the hardest hit states by the outbreak. The total damage by the severe weather caused by this outbreak was in excess of $1\u00a0billion.[1]"

        "content": "Beginning on March 9, the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) issued a moderate risk, spanning across northern and central portions of Dixie Alley, reaching into western Tennessee and western Kentucky. A slight risk was given to the surrounding area, reaching into the Ohio Valley, and to the east, including sections of north-central Georgia and the Florida Panhandle. While wind shear patterns and instability were conductive for the development of supercells and possibly strong tornadoes, the event was forecast to materialize as a major derecho event. Still, the elevated helicity values reaching 300\u00a0m2/s2, and elevated dew points reaching into the 60s, aided the issuance of a large 15%, hatched risk for strong/F2+ tornadoes throughout the moderate risk area. However, an even larger 45% hatched risk for damaging winds was placed throughout many of the same areas, forecasting the risk for the serial derecho to materialize.[3] As the event unfolded, multiple tornadoes were reported, including a damaging F2 that caused significant damage in the Morton and Fair Oaks towns of Arkansas. However, the main event was a widespread derecho that prompted hundreds of severe damaging wind gusts throughout the main risk area.[4] Tens of thousands of people also lost electricity throughout the region. Two non-tornadic deaths happened on March 9, one by damaging wind, and another that was killed after a lightning bolt ignited a house fire.[2][5] A slight risk was issued for many of the same areas on March 10, though only a 2% risk for tornadoes was issued, mostly in two corridors in the Ark-La-Tex region extending into Missouri, and another one mostly in Mississippi and west-central Alabama. The main risk was expected to be hail, and as the evening advanced, dozens of large hails reports came in from the aforementioned areas. However, no tornadoes touched down in this area, though one F0 did occur all the way in California, causing damage near the town of Encinitas in San Diego County.[6][7] A much more substantial tornado event materialized on March 11. The SPC again issued a moderate risk for severe weather, primarily driven by a 45% hatched risk for large, destructive hail, centered in Missouri and Arkansas, though it extended into extreme eastern Oklahoma and southwestern Illinois. However, elevated wind shear valued ranging from 50 to 70kt, and steep mid-level lapse rates meant the environment was favorable for supercells, so a 10%, hatched risk for strong tornadoes was introduced for the area, as any supercell that could remain discrete would be capable of sustaining and producing strong tornadoes. The most favorable window for severe weather was expected to be overnight in the 00z to 06z timeframe, meaning that any tornadoes that could develop would end up being difficult to see.[8] As the night progressed, multiple supercells popped up in Oklahoma, eventually advancing throughout the risk area. Hundreds of damaging hail reports occurred on this area. However, as the supercells entered the more favorable environment for tornadoes, multiple of them became tornadic, resulting in multiple strong to intense tornadoes. One particular long-tracked supercell produced a tornado family in southeastern Missouri, which included a deadly F3 that killed two people in Perry County during its 53.5\u00a0mi (86.1\u00a0km) path, which crossed into Illinois, before dissipating near the town of Tamaroa. The supercell had produced a long-tracked, damaging F2 previous to this one, as it travelled through Reynolds, Iron, and Madison counties. Another supercell near this one produced another intense F3 in the town of Festus, Missouri, before crossing into Illinois. The tornadoes were accompanied by very large hail, some as large as softballs, before the day came to a close."

        "content": "The next day, on March 12, conditions became even more favorable for the development of severe weather. The SPC, in its 1630 UTC outlook, introduced an incredibly rare high risk for many of the same areas from the day prior, with the main corridor being placed in eastern Kansas, most of Missouri, southeastern Iowa, and central Illinois.[9] The high risk was driven by the elevated probabilities of long-tracked, strong to intense tornadoes, all along the main high risk corridor. A 30% hatched risk for F2+ tornadoes was given to this corridor as a result. A 45% hatched risk for large hail was also placed throughout the risk area, as any supercells capable of tornadoes would also produce large hail on their track. A potent upper-level trough, progressing along a strong 100-120 kt jet stream, in an area deepened by a progressing surface low in Oklahoma and Kansas, was the driving factor for the intense convective activity later in the evening/overnight hours. Additionally, sufficient moisture aided by dew points in the 60s, convective available potential energy (CAPE) values in the 1,500\u20133000\u00a0J/kg range, and very favorable low-level wind shear further destabilized the atmosphere, making it even more favorable for sustained supercells, capable of all hazards. However, a capping inversion in place for most of the day limited convective initiation at first, keeping all the necessary ingredients at bay. However, after the cap moved in the evening, multiple lines of powerful supercells began to form, soon entering the primed environment for tornadoes. As such, two PDS tornado watches were issued for most of the risk area, highlighting the elevated probabilities for intense tornadoes to develop in these areas.[10][11] As the morning advanced, severe weather, spearheaded by severe wind, affected the Kansas City Metropolitan Area, with significant wind and hail damage to many homes and businesses, but only two tornadoes in the far northwestern part of the area.[12] Significant damage was also reported at the University of Kansas in Lawrence and at the Great Wolf Lodge Indoor Water Park. Numerous airplanes also flipped over at the Kansas City Downtown Airport.[13] As the evening advanced, the main line of supercells began to take shape, eventually becoming a widespread line, being responsible for many of the tornadoes throughout the remainder of the day. One exceptionally long-lived supercell thunderstorm was responsible for many of the tornadoes on March 12. This storm began in the morning over northern Oklahoma before embarking on a nearly 800 miles (1,300\u00a0km) journey northeast across southeastern Kansas, Missouri during the afternoon and early evening, into Illinois during the mid-to-late evening, through Indiana by the late evening, and into lower Michigan where it lost severe characteristics more than 17.5\u00a0hours after inception. This supercell lasted the longest and travelled the furthest than any other in history. The city of Springfield, Illinois saw two strong tornadoes track directly through the city from this storm. It also did damage near Sedalia, Columbia, and Mexico, Missouri. The deadliest tornado from this outbreak sequence came from another supercell; an F3 which killed 4 people near the town of Renick, Missouri. The strongest tornado, spawned by this same supercell, was a rare double tornado rated F4, but fortunately it remained over mainly rural countryside. Multiple other tornadoes came from this intense line, including multiple strong to intense tornadoes in the western region of the main risk area, in Oklahoma and Arkansas, where F3 tornadoes struck the towns of Twin Oaks, Oklahoma, and areas southwest of Bentonville, Arkansas. The storms progressed into the overnight hours and into early morning on March 13, before the main of storms finally came to an end. A moderate risk for severe weather was issued by the SPC on March 13, as a severe damaging wind event was expected to materialize in the Ohio Valley area extending into the Great Lakes region. A 45% hatched risk for damaging wind gusts was issued for this whole area, with an accompanying 10% unhatched risk for tornadoes.[14] An slight risk for severe weather, alongside a 5% chance for tornadoes extended into Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee. As the day progressed, the expected wind event did not materialize, though some weak tornadoes did occur in the southern regions of the risk area. Fifteen more tornadoes were reported on March 13 in Alabama and Mississippi before the system finally weakened and the severe weather came to an end.[15]"

        "content": " Typhoon Ma-on, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Ineng, was a large and powerful typhoon that affected southern Japan in July 2011. It was the sixth named storm and second typhoon of the 2011 Pacific typhoon season. Originating from an area of low pressure near Wake Island on July\u00a09, the precursor to Ma-on gradually developed as it moved westward. By July\u00a011, it had become sufficiently organized to be declared a tropical depression, although the cyclone's circulation remained broad. Over the following days, Ma-on gradually intensified and attained typhoon status on July\u00a014. Favorable environmental conditions allowed for additional strengthening, and the storm ultimately attained peak ten-minute sustained winds of 175\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph) on July\u00a016. After turning northward in response to a weakening subtropical ridge, the typhoon underwent a series of eyewall replacement cycles that caused it to weaken. On July\u00a019, Ma-on struck Shikoku before turning southeastward and moving back over water. Slow weakening continued as Ma-on succumbed to the effects of high wind shear. The system ultimately became extratropical on July\u00a024, and was last noted by the Japan Meteorological Agency a week later near the Kamchatka Peninsula. Initially, Ma-on posed a slight threat to the Mariana Islands and prompted the issuance of tropical storm warnings. However, the system remained far away from the area and only produced scattered rainfall. In Japan, hundreds of people evacuated from mudslide-prone areas. Torrential rains produced by the storm, estimated at more than 1,200\u00a0mm (47\u00a0in), led to widespread and damaging floods. Five people perished as a result of Ma-on, and damage reached \u00a53.9\u00a0billion (2011\u00a0JPY, $50\u00a0million 2011\u00a0USD)."

        "header": "Meteorological history",
        "content": "The origins of Ma-on were from an area of convection that meandered near Wake Island on July 9.[1] The disturbance slowly consolidated and developed a low-level circulation. Based on the presence of low wind shear and generally favorable environmental conditions, tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated that the system would develop into a tropical cyclone.[2] Early on July 11, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert,[3] and a few hours later the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) reported the formation of a tropical depression about halfway between Wake Island and the Northern Marianas Islands.[4][5] The JTWC followed suit and initiated advisories on Tropical Depression 08W.[6] The depression tracked westward due to a ridge to its north.[7] Its circulation was initially broad and ill-defined, with patches of disorganized convection due to dry air. The depression was able to intensify due to generally favorable conditions,[8] and the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Ma-on at 0600\u00a0UTC on July\u00a012.[9] Gradually the thunderstorms became concentrated around the center, despite restricted outflow to the north and west. Ma-on intensified at a slower than climatological rate, although an eye feature became evident by early on July\u00a013.[10] At 0000\u00a0UTC that day, the JMA upgraded Ma-on to a severe tropical storm,[11] and 24\u00a0hours later the storm intensified into a typhoon to the northeast of the Northern Marianas.[12] By that time, it was also located about 970\u00a0km (600\u00a0mi) southeast of Iwo Jima. A ragged eye became apparent on satellite imagery, and after developing an anticyclone aloft, its outflow became much better defined.[13] By July\u00a015, Typhoon Ma-on had a well-defined eye with the strongest convection in its southern periphery. It continued intensifying, and the JTWC estimated 1-minute sustained winds of 220\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph).[14] Late on July\u00a015, Ma-on weakened slightly due to stronger wind shear, which caused its eyewall to break apart in the northwest quadrant.[15] It re-intensified the next day after an eyewall replacement cycle commenced.[16] At 0600\u00a0UTC on July\u00a016, the JMA estimated peak 10-minute sustained winds of 175\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph) while the typhoon was located about 1,185\u00a0km (736\u00a0mi) southeast of Okinawa.[17] Around that time, Ma-on began a motion to the northwest due to a weakening of the subtropical ridge,[18] and it briefly entered the area warned by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA); the agency gave it the local name Ineng.[19] Late on July\u00a017, Ma-on underwent another eyewall replacement cycle and weakened, despite developing improved outflow and convection in the northern quadrant.[20] The typhoon's large size prevented re-intensification\u00a0\u2013 gale force winds extended 370\u00a0km (230\u00a0mi) east of the center. In addition, the intrusion of dry air diminished thunderstorms in the western periphery. By July\u00a018, Ma-on reached the western extent of the ridge and began a motion to the north toward Japan.[21] The next day, it turned to the northeast as it paralleled the Japan coastline just offshore.[22] At around 1400\u00a0UTC on July\u00a019, Ma-on made landfall on Shikoku as a minimal typhoon. Turning to the east, the typhoon weakened to a severe tropical storm before moving over the southern tip of the Kii Peninsula early on July\u00a020.[12] After emerging from the country, Ma-on turned to the southeast. Increased wind shear displaced the convection to the east, although slight re-intensification was expected.[23] However, the JTWC downgraded Ma-on to a tropical depression on July\u00a021 after the storm lost much of its convection.[24] The circulation became ill-defined, and the JTWC discontinued advisories on July\u00a022, noting the system was in the process of dissipation.[25] However, the JMA maintained Ma-on as a severe tropical storm until July\u00a023, by which time the storm had turned to the northeast.[26] The storm became extratropical on July\u00a024 near the Kuril Islands, lasting another seven days before dissipating east of the Kamchatka Peninsula.[12]"

The heavy rainfall caused flooding and mudslides that blocked roadways and forced evacuations.[33] In Japan, the typhoon was forecast to strike areas affected by the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. Officials prepared by installing a cover to prevent rain contamination.[34] Ultimately, there still was rain contamination, and Ma-on's passage produced 2,000\u00a0tons of radioactive water.[35] Before the storm struck Japan, officials in Miyakonoj\u014d, Miyazaki advised the evacuation of about 900\u00a0people in areas prone to mudslides.[36] At least 300\u00a0airline flights were canceled due to the storm.[37] The typhoon also caused delays in the nation's rail system.[38] Nippon Oil stopped shipping oil during the storm.[39] As Ma-on moved across Japan, it produced winds of 108\u00a0km/h (67\u00a0mph), along with heavy rainfall of up to 1,200\u00a0mm (47\u00a0in).[40] Rainfall in a 24\u2011hour period reached 860\u00a0mm (34\u00a0in) in Umaji, K\u014dchi, which set a 24\u2011hour rainfall record and exceeded the average July precipitation by 265.5\u00a0mm (10.45\u00a0in).[37] The rains flooded houses and roads in the region.[41] High rains closed several expressways, and in Shizuoka Prefecture, a blocked road stranded 96\u00a0mountain climbers.[38] Strong winds left about 11,000\u00a0people without power on Shikoku Island.[41] The combination of winds and rain damaged the 385\u2011year\u2011old Nij\u014d Castle in Kyoto. The typhoon injured 60\u00a0people,[40] and killed five people.[42] One of the deaths was from a man who drowned while checking on his boat during the storm.[43] Damage was estimated at \u00a53.9\u00a0billion (2011\u00a0JPY, $50\u00a0million 2011\u00a0USD).[42] Following Ma-on's passage, temperatures decreased across Japan, which led to a marked decrease in heat stroke deaths. Throughout the month, heat stroke deaths were 70% less than in July 2010.[44]"

It is the state's 11th-largest incorporated city, with a population of 80,308 in the 2020 census.[2] The city is the main component of the Warner Robins metropolitan statistical area, including Houston, Peach, and Pulaski counties, which had a census population of 201,469 in 2020. It is a component of the Macon\u2013Warner Robins\u2013Fort Valley combined statistical area, with an estimated 2018 population of 423,572. Robins Air Force Base, a U.S. Air Force maintenance and logistics complex that was founded as the Warner Robins Air Depot in 1942, is located east of the city limits. The base's expansion and the suburbanization of nearby Macon have led to the city's growth in the post-World War II era."

        "content": "Warner Robins was founded in 1942 when the small farming community of Wellston was renamed for General Augustine Warner Robins (1882\u20131940) of the United States Army Air Corps, which later became the United States Air Force.[5] It was incorporated as a town in 1943 and as a city in 1956.[6] The 1940 census shows that the community of Wellston was sparsely populated and inhabited primarily by farmers and their families. Its most notable landmark was a stop on the railroad line. Wellston also had a small sawmill and a grocery store. Peach orchards covered parts of the surrounding land. This changed during World War II. The War Department made plans to build an air depot in the Southeast. With the assistance of influential U.S. Representative Carl Vinson, Wellston community leader Charles Bostic \"Boss\" Watson worked with officials in Macon to make a bid to locate this air depot in Houston County. In June 1941, the U.S. government accepted this offer, which included 3,108 acres (12.58\u00a0km2) of land.[7] This air force base was initially called Wellston Army Air Depot when it opened in 1942. The first commander was Colonel Charles E. Thomas. He wanted to name this depot in honor of his mentor Augustine Warner Robins, who was called by his middle name, Warner. Regulations prevented him from doing this, which required the base to be named after the nearest town. Not deterred by this, Colonel Thomas persuaded Boss Watson and the other community leaders to rename the town of Wellston. So on September 1, 1942, the town was given the new name of Warner Robins.[8] Soon thereafter, on October 14, 1942, the base was renamed to become Warner Robins Army Air Depot. The city has a unique name, shared with no other town in the United States. Robins Air Force Base is not within the city limits of the town but is across U.S. Highway 129 (Georgia State Highway 247), which serves as a boundary between the base and the city. In 2018, First Solar announced a project for a 200-megawatt, 2,000-acre (8.1\u00a0km2) solar panel facility in Twiggs County east of Warner Robins. The facility would be the largest solar facility in the southeast.[9]"

It moved due east and immediately became strong as it moved into Witmer Manor and Webers Landing. A total of 22 cottages were destroyed or badly damaged while 30 others sustained minor damage. All five injuries from the tornado occurred here before the tornado passed north of Wolcottville. From there, the tornado weakened and skipped along a non-continuous damage path. Scores of homes and barns were damaged as the tornado passed over Blackman Lake, Northern South Milford, Woodland Park, Big Long Lake, Shady Nook, Gravel Beach, Timberhurst, and Taylor Lake. Damages in LaGrange County totaled $2.5 million. The tornado then crossed into Steuben County, continuing to skip and damage homes and barns as it moved through Turkey Creek and passed north of Hudson and Ashley. As it approached Forest Park north of Hamilton it touched down solidly again and intensified. It then struck Forest Park before crossing Hamilton Lake and striking Oakwood and Circle Park. Two cottages were destroyed, several more were unroofed, and a car with four occupants was thrown in Hamilton Lake, although none of these events resulted in any casualties. It then moved back into rural areas before crossing into Ohio. Damages in Steuben County reached $2.5 million. In Williams County, Ohio, the tornado turned northeastward, passing through the northwest side of Edon. Damage here was severe as multiple farmhouses and barns were demolished or extensively damaged. After passing Edon, the tornado quickly weakened and dissipated. Losses in Ohio totaled $25,000. The tornado was on the ground for at least 38 minutes, traveled 33.4 miles (53.8\u00a0km), was 800 yards (730\u00a0m) and caused $5.025 million in damage. Five people were injured.[4][45][46][47]"

It crossed over Walker Creek, Pigeon Creek, and East Pigeon Creek, before reaching its peak intensity as it tore into Clarkridge. A church, a store, and two homes were destroyed before the tornado moved into Missouri. Throughout Arkansas, the tornado damaged 50 other buildings, injured one, and caused $2.5 million in damage. The tornado then moved into Missouri and turned northeastward, heavily damaging multiple farm homes and buildings as it crossed over the Norfolk Lake and passed through the south side of Udall. It then moved through mostly rural areas before striking Egypt Grove and Hocomo, causing additional heavy damage, although it was beginning to weaken by this time. The tornado caused some additional damage before dissipating just within the city limits of South Fork. Throughout Missouri, nine people were injured, and damage was estimated at $1 million. The tornado was on the ground for a least an hour and 15 minutes, tracked 43.8 miles (70.5\u00a0km), was 333 yards (304\u00a0m) wide, and caused $3.5 million in damage.

Multiple buildings and homes were extensively damaged, including a three-story brick building that lost its top two floors and two two-story brick buildings that had extensive damage. Trees and power lines were downed, an airplane was destroyed at the Madisonville Municipal Airport in nearby Anton, and cars were damaged by flying debris. All three injuries from this tornado occurred near or in town and losses totaled $2.5 million alone. From Madisonville, the tornado weakened and turned eastward, causing lesser, but still considerable damage as it hit Northern Millport as well as the towns of Bremen Station and Bremen. From there, it began to skip as it hit the town of Moorman, unroofing the Moorman High School gym and destroying a small home. Damage was also observed in Centertown, Beaver Dam, Mt. Pleasant, Arnold, Dogwalk, and Neafus before the tornado finally dissipating in Peth. The tornado was on the ground for an hour and five minutes, tracked 58 miles (93\u00a0km), and was 880 yards (800\u00a0m) (one source says 1,320 yards (1,210\u00a0m)) wide.

The most destructive and lethal infernos broke out on 23 August, expanded rapidly and raged out of control until 27 August, until they were finally put out in early September. The fires mainly affected western and southern Peloponnese as well as southern Euboea. The death toll in August alone stood at 67 people.[5] In total 85 people lost their lives because of the fires, including several fire fighters.[3][4][5] Some of these firestorms are believed to be the result of arson while others were merely the result of negligence.[6] Hot temperatures, including three consecutive heat waves of over 40\u00a0\u00b0C (105\u00a0\u00b0F),[7] and severe drought rendered the 2007 summer unprecedented in modern Greek history.[3] From the end of June to early September, over 3,000 forest fires were recorded across the nation.[3] Nine more people were killed in blazes in June and July.[3] A total of 2,700\u00a0square\u00a0kilometers (670,000\u00a0acres) of forest, olive groves and farmland were destroyed in the fires, which was the worst fire season on record in the past 50 years.[8][9] Of the total of 2,700\u00a0km2, 1,500\u00a0km2 (370,000\u00a0acres) were burnt forests in Southern Greece alone which meant that 4% of Greece's total forest area burnt in 2007 alone.[8][10] Many buildings were also destroyed in the blaze. The fire destroyed 1,000 houses and 1,100 other buildings, and damaged hundreds more.[11]"

Overall, the mountain of Parnitha suffered a burnt area of 38,000 acres (153.8\u00a0km2),[12] making it one of the worst recorded wildfires in Attica since the Penteli fire of July 1995.[13] The magnitude of the devastation was unforeseen. Environmental studies in Greece report that the Athenian microclimate will significantly change to warmer during the summer season, and flooding is now a very probable danger for the northern suburbs of the city.[1] Mount Parnitha was considered the 'lungs' of Athens;[13] following its considerable burning, both the city and local flora and fauna are expected to feel the consequences.[13] Other affected areas included Pelion,[13] Agia[13] and Melivoia, Skourta, Dafni, and Pyli."

In Peloponnese, the fire burnt many villages and accounted for 60 deaths.[19] Six people were reported to have been killed in the town of Areopoli.[19][20] In Zacharo, one of the worst hit areas, more than 30 people were found dead by firefighters while searching burning cars and homes.[19] Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis declared a state of emergency for the whole country and requested help from fellow members of the European Union.[20][21] Multiple countries responded to the call and sent help. Additionally, 500 Greek soldiers were sent in the affected areas.[22] Another 500 Greek soldiers were called up bringing the total to 1,000 military personnel involved in the fire fighting. On 25 August 2007, fires broke out on Mount Hymettus and in the suburb of Filothei in Athens. Officials said these fires were the result of arson, as the firefighters found many bottles with gasoline in affected areas. Arson is also suspected for the fires in Peloponnese, as more than 20 fires started at about the same time.[19] Two fires broke out in Keratea and one in Markopoulo Mesogaias in East Attica on 25 August 2007.[19][23] The first fire was not under control until the following day, while the second was put out quickly.[23] The Keratea fire had a length of 12 kilometres (7\u00a0mi) and a man was hospitalised with second degree burns.

He also stated that the country is facing an asymmetric threat, a military term used for terrorist attacks.[48] While some fires are believed to have been caused by environmental factors, others clearly were not.[6] The fires could have been deliberately started as a way to get around Greek law which forbids property development on areas designated as forest land and to pull benefit from Greece's unique position as the only EU country without a full land registry system.[6][45][49] A substantial reward has been offered for anyone providing information which leads to the arrest of an arsonist.[49] Greek police announced the capture of three arson suspects: A 65-year-old man from Areopolis was charged with arson and murder relating to the fire which killed at least 6 in this area.[6][20] Also, in northern Kavala, two youths had been detained on suspicion of arson.[6][20][22] Greek government press minister Theodoros Roussopoulos confirmed on 27 August that 61 people had been arrested on suspicion of involvement in arson, seven of these being retained in custody. On 27 August 2007, PASOK leader George Papandreou accused the government of insinuating that his party is involved in the fires and called on Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis to produce any evidence that would support there was such an organized plan.[50] Heavy criticism directed towards the government for its handling of the crisis, with the Greek press forming a chorus in ridiculing the incompetence of the country's officials, was accentuated in September by the reported discovery of steps aimed at giving a green light to property developers in the ravaged region.[51]"

People at the camp reported having five minutes between sighting the funnel cloud and touch down at the camp. Some reports indicated that a relay hub that would have alerted the scouts sooner was temporarily inoperable as it had been struck by lightning and was in a restart sequence when the original warning was issued.[citation needed] The actual sounding of the tornado siren at the camp was due to manual activation of the camps siren from a staff member in the Mutual of Omaha Welcome Building. According to a camp counselor, nearly all the injuries and fatalities happened when a small cabin that some campers took shelter in was destroyed by the tornado.  The Scouts were split into two groups for the event and had taken shelter in two different buildings when the storm hit.[7]  The tornado was one of 28 reported in that time period, spread across eastern Kansas and into Nebraska, Iowa, and Minnesota.[9]  Many of the injuries were reported to have happened when a brick fireplace in the northern shelter, where the Scouts were taking cover, was destroyed by the tornado winds.[4] A truck parked outside was thrown through the air and may have struck the building.[5] The tornado killed Josh Fennen, 13; Sam Thomsen, 13; Ben Petrzilka, 14, all from Omaha and Aaron Eilerts, 14, from Eagle Grove, Iowa.[8] The Scouts' first aid training was immediately used. MSNBC asked Ethan Hession, 13, \"You said, 'If it had to happen it is good it happened at a Boy Scout Camp.' Why would you at the age of 13 say such a thing?\"  Hession replied, \"Because we were prepared. We knew that shock could happen. We knew that we need to place tourniquets on wounds that were bleeding too much. We knew we need to apply pressure and gauze. We had first-aid kits, we had everything.\"[10] The Boy Scouts at the camp, including some injured, immediately began to administer first aid and assist their injured fellow campers.  The chief of the local volunteer department, Ed Osius, said, \"It\u2019s the scouts that saved a lot of lives.\"[5]\nAccording to the local Omaha World-Herald, the wounded were taken to several locations. Surviving Boy Scouts were taken to West Harrison High School in nearby Mondamin, Iowa to wait for their parents to pick them up. Some boys reportedly waited up to five hours.[7] The Omaha Police Department helicopter conducted an infrared scan of the camp early in the morning on June 12, despite the fact that as of 12:00 midnight CST all people have been accounted for.[12] A police lieutenant suggested it may just be as a precaution. As many as 42 Scouts remained hospitalized the following morning with wounds ranging from cuts and bruises to major head trauma."

They set up triage and were taking care of one another and saved many lives before emergency responders arrived\".[7][14] Later in the day on June 12, both governors were joined by Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff, who toured the devastated camp and afterwards expressed the condolences of U.S. President George W. Bush to the families of the dead Scouts.[15]  Chertoff said he was \"particularly touched by the finest young people from this region being caught up in the\u00a0...\u00a0terrible tragedy\", adding that, \"the reaction of the Boy Scouts was in the best tradition of what they're being taught.\"[6] Chief Scout Executive Bob Mazzucca planned to visit the council and help assist families of the Scouts,[16] and has launched an appeal to fellow Scouts for relief funds.[17] On September 8, 2008, Lieutenant Governor of Nebraska Rick Sheehy presented the first\u2013ever Be Prepared Local Hero award to the Mid-America Council Pahuk Pride Class of 2008 because of their preparation for and taking care of each other during and after the tornado struck.[18] On September 13, 2008, those who died in the storm were presented the Spirit of the Eagle Award, a posthumous award from the Boy Scouts of America.[19] Also on September 13, 2008, the Boy Scouts of America's National Court of Honor awarded 121 medals for heroism to Scouts and Scout leaders for their actions during the tornado: 75 Medals of Merit, 30 Heroism awards, 7 Honor Medals, and 9 Honor Medals with Crossed Palm.[20][21]"

In a press conference on June 12, 2008, Lloyd Roitstein, Scout Executive with the Mid-America Council of the Boy Scouts of America is quoted as saying, \"Absolutely not\" to a question about whether the camp grounds had a tornado shelter.[22] On June 13, 2008, the Omaha World-Herald quoted Roitstein as saying \"One of the things you learn in Scouting, one of the skills you learn is what happens when you're out in the wilderness and severe weather. \"And we teach them of course to go to the lowest-lying area, go into a ditch and get down as low as you can. Because when you're out hiking in the mountains or canoeing down a river or whatever, there are no storm shelters.\" The lack of tornado shelters is a topic of debate. Bryan and Arnell Petrzilka of Omaha, whose son Ben was killed in the storm, are heading a project to add tornado shelters to the Little Sioux Ranch and possibly others in the area. A fund for donations has been set up with the Omaha State Bank.[23]"

Also, ranchers explained that it would be of no use for them to set their ranches on fire (which account for about 20 or 30% of the islands area, the rest being public lands), since soybean prices didn't make farming on the Delta attractive, and the fires damage the land for its use for livestock grazing.[25][26] Criminal charges were brought against several ranchers.[26][27] On the other hand, several Environmental organizations pointed that the fires were started by ranchers to renew graze, as they do every year, but with the difference that in 2020 the drought made those fires bigger and easier to grow, which caused the shift so rapidly.[27] The government credited this theory, blaming the fires on ranchers.[28][29][30]"

Two of the top ten rivers by discharge are tributaries of the Amazon river. The Amazon represents 20% of the global riverine discharge into oceans.[26] The Amazon basin is the largest drainage basin in the world, with an area of approximately 7,000,000\u00a0km2 (2,700,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[3] The portion of the river's drainage basin in Brazil alone is larger than any other river's basin. The Amazon enters Brazil with only one-fifth of the flow it finally discharges into the Atlantic Ocean, yet already has a greater flow at this point than the discharge of any other river in the world.[27][28]"

It later became known as Rio Amazonas in Spanish and Portuguese. The name Rio Amazonas was reportedly given after native warriors attacked a 16th-century expedition by Francisco de Orellana. The warriors were led by women, reminding de Orellana of the Amazon warriors, a tribe of women warriors related to Iranian Scythians and Sarmatians[29][30] mentioned in Greek mythology.\nThe word Amazon itself may be derived from the Iranian compound * ha-maz-an- \"(one) fighting together\"[31] or ethnonym * ha-mazan- \"warriors\", a word attested indirectly through a derivation, a denominal verb in Hesychius of Alexandria's gloss \"\u00b7\u00ba\u00c5\u0152\u00ba\u0152\u00b1\u0152\u2202\u0152\u00b1\u0152\u222b\u0152\u00a8\u0153\u00c5\u0152\u00b1\u0152\u03a9\u00ac\u2211 \u0153\u00c4\u0152\u00f8\u0152\u00aa\u0152\u00b5\u0152\u00ba\u0152\u00b5\u00b7\u00f8\u00f1\u0152\u03a9. \u0152\u2020\u0152\u2260\u0153\u00c5\u0153\u00c9\u0152\u00b1\u0152\u03c0\" (\"hamazakaran: 'to make war' in Persian\"), where it appears together with the Indo-Iranian root * kar- \"make\" (from which Sanskrit karma is also derived).[32] Other scholars[who?] claim that the name is derived from the Tupi word amassona, meaning \"boat destroyer\".[33]"

        "content": "During what many archaeologists called the formative stage, Amazonian societies were deeply involved in the emergence of South America's highland agrarian systems. The trade with Andean civilizations in the terrains of the headwaters in the Andes formed an essential contribution to the social and religious development of higher-altitude civilizations like the Muisca and Incas. Early human settlements were typically based on low-lying hills or mounds. Shell mounds were the earliest evidence of habitation; they represent piles of human refuse (waste) and are mainly dated between 7500\u00a0BC and 4000\u00a0BC. They are associated with ceramic age cultures; no preceramic shell mounds have been documented so far by archaeologists.[36] Artificial earth platforms for entire villages are the second type of mounds. They are best represented by the Marajoara culture. Figurative mounds are the most recent types of occupation. There is ample evidence that the areas surrounding the Amazon River were home to complex and large-scale indigenous societies, mainly chiefdoms who developed towns and cities.[37] Archaeologists estimate that by the time the Spanish conquistador De Orellana traveled across the Amazon in 1541, more than 3 million indigenous people lived around the Amazon.[38] These pre-Columbian settlements created highly developed civilizations. For instance, pre-Columbian indigenous people on the island of Maraj\u221a\u2265 may have developed social stratification and supported a population of 100,000 people. To achieve this level of development, the indigenous inhabitants of the Amazon rainforest altered the forest's ecology by selective cultivation and the use of fire. Scientists argue that by burning areas of the forest repeatedly, the indigenous people caused the soil to become richer in nutrients. This created dark soil areas known as terra preta de \u221a\u2260ndio (\"Indian dark earth\").[39] Because of the terra preta, indigenous communities were able to make land fertile and thus sustainable for the large-scale agriculture needed to support their large populations and complex social structures. Further research has hypothesized that this practice began around 11,000 years ago. Some say that its effects on forest ecology and regional climate explain the otherwise inexplicable band of lower rainfall through the Amazon basin.[39] Many indigenous tribes engaged in constant warfare. According to James S. Olson, \"The Munduruku expansion (in the 18th century) dislocated and displaced the Kawah\u221a\u2260b, breaking the tribe down into much smaller groups\u00a0... [Munduruku] first came to the attention of Europeans in 1770 when they began a series of widespread attacks on Brazilian settlements along the Amazon River.\"[40]"

Another Spanish explorer, Francisco de Orellana, was the first European to travel from the origins of the upstream river basins, situated in the Andes, to the mouth of the river. In this journey, Orellana baptized some of the affluents of the Amazonas like Rio Negro, Napo and Jurua.\nThe name Amazonas is thought to be taken from the native warriors that attacked this expedition, mostly women, that reminded De Orellana of the mythical female Amazon warriors from the ancient Hellenic culture in Greece (see also Origin of the name)."

After 170\u00a0km (106\u00a0mi), the Coca River joined the Napo River (at a point now known as Puerto Francisco de Orellana); the party stopped for a few weeks to build a boat just upriver from this confluence. They continued downriver through an uninhabited area, where they could not find food. Orellana offered and was ordered to follow the Napo River, then known as R\u221a\u2260o de la Canela (\"Cinnamon River\"), and return with food for the party. Based on intelligence received from a captive native chief named Delicola, they expected to find food within a few days downriver by ascending another river to the north. De Orellana took about 57 men, the boat, and some canoes and left Pizarro's troops on 26 December 1541. However, De Orellana missed the confluence (probably with the Aguarico) where he was searching supplies for his men. By the time he and his men reached another village, many of them were sick from hunger and eating \"noxious plants\", and near death. Seven men died in that village. His men threatened to mutiny if the expedition turned back to attempt to rejoin Pizarro, the party being over 100 leagues downstream at this point. He accepted to change the purpose of the expedition to discover new lands in the name of the king of Spain, and the men built a larger boat in which to navigate downstream. After a journey of 600\u00a0km (370\u00a0mi) down the Napo River, they reached a further major confluence, at a point near modern Iquitos, and then followed the upper Amazon, now known as the Solim\u221a\u00b5es, for a further 1,200\u00a0km (746\u00a0mi) to its confluence with the Rio Negro (near modern Manaus), which they reached on 3 June 1542. Regarding the initial mission of finding cinnamon, Pizarro reported to the king that they had found cinnamon trees, but that they could not be profitably harvested. True cinnamon (Cinnamomum Verum) is not native to South America. Other related cinnamon-containing plants (of the family Lauraceae) are fairly common in that part of the Amazon and Pizarro probably saw some of these. The expedition reached the mouth of the Amazon on 24 August 1542, demonstrating the practical navigability of the Great River. In 1560, another Spanish conquistador, Lope de Aguirre, may have made the second descent of the Amazon. Historians are uncertain whether the river he descended was the Amazon or the Orinoco River, which runs more or less parallel to the Amazon further north. Portuguese explorer Pedro Teixeira was the first European to travel up the entire river. He arrived in Quito in 1637, and returned via the same route.[43] From 1648 to 1652, Portuguese Brazilian bandeirante Ant\u221a\u2265nio Raposo Tavares led an expedition from S\u221a\u00a3o Paulo overland to the mouth of the Amazon, investigating many of its tributaries, including the Rio Negro, and covering a distance of over 10,000\u00a0km (6,200\u00a0mi). In what is currently in Brazil, Ecuador, Bolivia, Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela, several colonial and religious settlements were established along the banks of primary rivers and tributaries for trade, slaving[citation needed] , and evangelization among the indigenous peoples of the vast rainforest, such as the Urarina. In the late 1600s, Czech Jesuit Father Samuel Fritz, an apostle of the Omagus established some forty mission villages. Fritz proposed that the Mara\u221a\u00b1\u221a\u2265n River must be the source of the Amazon, noting on his 1707 map that the Mara\u221a\u00b1\u221a\u2265n \"has its source on the southern shore of a lake that is called Lauricocha, near Hu\u221a\u00b0nuco.\" Fritz reasoned that the Mara\u221a\u00b1\u221a\u2265n is the largest river branch one encounters when journeying upstream, and lies farther to the west than any other tributary of the Amazon. For most of the 18th\u201a\u00c4\u00ec19th centuries and into the 20th century, the Mara\u221a\u00b1\u221a\u2265n was generally considered the source of the Amazon.[44]"

It is estimated that from 30% to 40% of the population of Gr\u221a\u00a3o-Par\u221a\u00b0, estimated at 100,000 people, died.[46] The population of the Brazilian portion of the Amazon basin in 1850 was perhaps 300,000, of whom about 175,000 were Europeans and 25,000 were slaves. The Brazilian Amazon's principal commercial city, Par\u221a\u00b0 (now Bel\u221a\u00a9m), had from 10,000 to 12,000 inhabitants, including slaves. The town of Man\u221a\u00b0os, now Manaus, at the mouth of the Rio Negro, had a population between 1,000 and 1,500. All the remaining villages, as far up as Tabatinga, on the Brazilian frontier of Peru, were relatively small.[47] On 6 September 1850, Emperor Pedro II of Brazil sanctioned a law authorizing steam navigation on the Amazon and gave the Viscount of Mau\u221a\u00b0 (Irineu Evangelista de Sousa) the task of putting it into effect. He organised the \"Companhia de Navega\u221a\u00df\u221a\u00a3o e Com\u221a\u00a9rcio do Amazonas\" in Rio de Janeiro in 1852; in the following year it commenced operations with four small steamers, the Monarca ('Monarch'), the Camet\u221a\u00b0, the Maraj\u221a\u2265 and the Rio Negro.[47][48] At first, navigation was principally confined to the main river; and even in 1857 a modification of the government contract only obliged the company to a monthly service between Par\u221a\u00b0 and Manaus, with steamers of 200 tons cargo capacity, a second line to make six round voyages a year between Manaus and Tabatinga, and a third, two trips a month between Par\u221a\u00b0 and Camet\u221a\u00b0.[47] This was the first step in opening up the vast interior. The success of the venture called attention to the opportunities for economic exploitation of the Amazon, and a second company soon opened commerce on the Madeira, Pur\u221a\u222bs, and Negro; a third established a line between Par\u221a\u00b0 and Manaus, and a fourth found it profitable to navigate some of the smaller streams. In that same period, the Amazonas Company was increasing its fleet. Meanwhile, private individuals were building and running small steam craft of their own on the main river as well as on many of its tributaries.[47] On 31 July 1867, the government of Brazil, constantly pressed by the maritime powers and by the countries encircling the upper Amazon basin, especially Peru, decreed the opening of the Amazon to all countries, but they limited this to certain defined points: Tabatinga \u201a\u00c4\u00ec on the Amazon; Camet\u221a\u00b0 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec on the Tocantins; Santar\u221a\u00a9m \u201a\u00c4\u00ec on the Tapaj\u221a\u2265s; Borba \u201a\u00c4\u00ec on the Madeira, and Manaus \u201a\u00c4\u00ec on the Rio Negro. The Brazilian decree took effect on 7 September 1867.[47] Thanks in part to the mercantile development associated with steamboat navigation coupled with the internationally driven demand for natural rubber, the Peruvian city of Iquitos became a thriving, cosmopolitan center of commerce. Foreign companies settled in Iquitos, from where they controlled the extraction of rubber. In 1851 Iquitos had a population of 200, and by 1900 its population reached 20,000. In the 1860s, approximately 3,000 tons of rubber were being exported annually, and by 1911 annual exports had grown to 44,000 tons, representing 9.3% of Peru's exports.[49] During the rubber boom it is estimated that diseases brought by immigrants, such as typhus and malaria, killed 40,000 native Amazonians.[50] The first direct foreign trade with Manaus commenced around 1874. Local trade along the river was carried on by the English successors to the Amazonas Company\u201a\u00c4\u00eethe Amazon Steam Navigation Company\u201a\u00c4\u00eeas well as numerous small steamboats, belonging to companies and firms engaged in the rubber trade, navigating the Negro, Madeira, Pur\u221a\u222bs, and many other tributaries,[47] such as the Mara\u221a\u00b1\u221a\u2265n, to ports as distant as Nauta, Peru. By the turn of the 20th century, the exports of the Amazon basin were India-rubber, cacao beans, Brazil nuts and a few other products of minor importance, such as pelts and exotic forest produce (resins, barks, woven hammocks, prized bird feathers, live animals) and extracted goods, such as lumber and gold."

        "content": "Since colonial times, the Portuguese portion of the Amazon basin has remained a land largely undeveloped by agriculture and occupied by indigenous people who survived the arrival of European diseases. Four centuries after the European discovery of the Amazon river, the total cultivated area in its basin was probably less than 65\u00a0km2 (25\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), excluding the limited and crudely cultivated areas among the mountains at its extreme headwaters.[51] This situation changed dramatically during the 20th century. Wary of foreign exploitation of the nation's resources, Brazilian governments in the 1940s set out to develop the interior, away from the seaboard where foreigners owned large tracts of land. The original architect of this expansion was president Get\u221a\u222blio Vargas, with the demand for rubber from the Allied forces in World War II providing funding for the drive. In the 1960s, economic exploitation of the Amazon basin was seen as a way to fuel the \"economic miracle\" occurring at the time. This resulted in the development of \"Operation Amazon\", an economic development project that brought large-scale agriculture and ranching to Amazonia. This was done through a combination of credit and fiscal incentives.[52] However, in the 1970s the government took a new approach with the National Integration Program (PIN). A large-scale colonization program saw families from northeastern Brazil relocated to the \"land without people\" in the Amazon Basin. This was done in conjunction with infrastructure projects mainly the Trans-Amazonian Highway (Transamaz\u221a\u00a5nica).[52] The Trans-Amazonian Highway's three pioneering highways were completed within ten years but never fulfilled their promise. Large portions of the Trans-Amazonian and its accessory roads, such as BR-317 (Manaus-Porto Velho), are derelict and impassable in the rainy season. Small towns and villages are scattered across the forest, and because its vegetation is so dense, some remote areas are still unexplored. Many settlements grew along the road from Bras\u221a\u2260lia to Bel\u221a\u00a9m with the highway and National Integration Program, however, the program failed as the settlers were unequipped to live in the delicate rainforest ecosystem. This, although the government believed it could sustain millions, instead could sustain very few.[53] With a population of 1.9 million people in 2014, Manaus is the largest city on the Amazon. Manaus alone makes up approximately 50% of the population of the largest Brazilian state of Amazonas. The racial makeup of the city is 64% pardo (mulatto and mestizo) and 32% white.[54] Although the Amazon river remains undammed, around 412 dams are in operation on the Amazon's tributary rivers. Of these 412 dams, 151 are constructed over six of the main tributary rivers that drain into the Amazon.[55] Since only 4% of the Amazon's hydropower potential has been developed in countries like Brazil,[56] more damming projects are underway and hundreds more are planned.[57] After witnessing the negative effects of environmental degradation, sedimentation, navigation and flood control caused by the Three Gorges Dam in the Yangtze River,[58] scientists are worried that constructing more dams in the Amazon will harm its biodiversity in the same way by \"blocking fish-spawning runs, reducing the flows of vital oil nutrients and clearing forests\".[57] Damming the Amazon River could potentially bring about the \"end of free flowing rivers\" and contribute to an \"ecosystem collapse\" that will cause major social and environmental problems.[55]"

Such studies continued to be published even as recently as 1996,[59] 2001,[60] 2007,[21] and 2008,[61] where various authors identified the snowcapped 5,597\u00a0m (18,363\u00a0ft) Nevado Mismi peak, located roughly 160\u00a0km (99\u00a0mi) west of Lake Titicaca and 700\u00a0km (430\u00a0mi) southeast of Lima, as the most distant source of the river. From that point, Quebrada Carhuasanta emerges from Nevado Mismi, joins Quebrada Apacheta and soon forms R\u221a\u2260o Lloqueta which becomes R\u221a\u2260o Hornillos and eventually joins the R\u221a\u2260o Apur\u221a\u2260mac. A 2014 study by Americans James Contos and Nicolas Tripcevich in Area, a peer-reviewed journal of the Royal Geographical Society, however, identifies the most distant source of the Amazon as actually being in the R\u221a\u2260o Mantaro drainage.[24] A variety of methods were used to compare the lengths of the Mantaro river vs. the Apur\u221a\u2260mac river from their most distant source points to their confluence, showing the longer length of the Mantaro. Then distances from Lago Jun\u221a\u2260n to several potential source points in the uppermost Mantaro river were measured, which enabled them to determine that the Cordillera Rumi Cruz was the most distant source of water in the Mantaro basin (and therefore in the entire Amazon basin). The most accurate measurement method was direct GPS measurement obtained by kayak descent of each of the rivers from their source points to their confluence (performed by Contos). Obtaining these measurements was difficult given the class IV\u201a\u00c4\u00ecV nature of each of these rivers, especially in their lower \"Abyss\" sections. Ultimately, they determined that the most distant point in the Mantaro drainage is nearly 80\u00a0km farther upstream compared to Mt. Mismi in the Apur\u221a\u2260mac drainage, and thus the maximal length of the Amazon river is about 80\u00a0km longer than previously thought. Contos continued downstream to the ocean and finished the first complete descent of the Amazon river from its newly identified source (finishing November 2012), a journey repeated by two groups after the news spread.[62] After about 700\u00a0km (430\u00a0mi), the Apur\u221a\u2260mac then joins R\u221a\u2260o Mantaro to form the Ene, which joins the Perene to form the Tambo, which joins the Urubamba River to form the Ucayali. After the confluence of Apur\u221a\u2260mac and Ucayali, the river leaves Andean terrain and is surrounded by floodplain. From this point to the confluence of the Ucayali and the Mara\u221a\u00b1\u221a\u2265n, some 1,600\u00a0km (990\u00a0mi), the forested banks are just above the water and are inundated long before the river attains its maximum flood stage.[47] The low river banks are interrupted by only a few hills, and the river enters the enormous Amazon rainforest."

The river systems and flood plains in Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela, whose waters drain into the Solim\u221a\u00b5es and its tributaries, are called the \"Upper Amazon\". The Amazon proper runs mostly through Brazil and Peru, and is part of the border between Colombia and Peru. It has a series of major tributaries in Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, some of which flow into the Mara\u221a\u00b1\u221a\u2265n and Ucayali, and others directly into the Amazon proper. These include rivers Putumayo, Caquet\u221a\u00b0, Vaup\u221a\u00a9s, Guain\u221a\u2260a, Morona, Pastaza, Nucuray, Urituyacu, Chambira, Tigre, Nanay, Napo, and Huallaga. At some points, the river divides into anabranches, or multiple channels, often very long, with inland and lateral channels, all connected by a complicated system of natural canals, cutting the low, flat igap\u221a\u2265 lands, which are never more than 5\u00a0m (16\u00a0ft) above low river, into many islands.[63] From the town of Canaria at the great bend of the Amazon to the Negro, vast areas of land are submerged at high water, above which only the upper part of the trees of the sombre forests appear. Near the mouth of the Rio Negro to Serpa, nearly opposite the river Madeira, the banks of the Amazon are low, until approaching Manaus, they rise to become rolling hills.[47]"

At \u221a\u00ecbidos, a bluff 17\u00a0m (56\u00a0ft) above the river is backed by low hills. The lower Amazon seems to have once been a gulf of the Atlantic Ocean, the waters of which washed the cliffs near \u221a\u00ecbidos. Only about 10% of the Amazon's water enters downstream of \u221a\u00ecbidos, very little of which is from the northern slope of the valley.

These hills are cut down to a kind of terrace which lies between them and the river.[63] On the south bank, above the Xingu, a line of low bluffs bordering the floodplain extends nearly to Santar\u221a\u00a9m in a series of gentle curves before they bend to the southwest, and, abutting upon the lower Tapaj\u221a\u2265s, merge into the bluffs which form the terrace margin of the Tapaj\u221a\u2265s river valley.[64]"

The definition of where exactly the mouth of the Amazon is located, and how wide it is, is a matter of dispute, because of the area's peculiar geography. The Par\u221a\u00b0 and the Amazon are connected by a series of river channels called furos near the town of Breves; between them lies Maraj\u221a\u2265, the world's largest combined river/sea island. If the Par\u221a\u00b0 river and the Maraj\u221a\u2265 island ocean frontage are included, the Amazon estuary is some 325\u00a0km (202\u00a0mi) wide.[65] In this case, the width of the mouth of the river is usually measured from Cabo Norte, the cape located straight east of Pracu\u221a\u222bba in the Brazilian state of Amap\u221a\u00b0, to Ponta da Tijoca near the town of Curu\u221a\u00df\u221a\u00b0, in the state of Par\u221a\u00b0. A more conservative measurement excluding the Par\u221a\u00b0 river estuary, from the mouth of the Araguari River to Ponta do Navio on the northern coast of Maraj\u221a\u2265, would still give the mouth of the Amazon a width of over 180\u00a0km (112\u00a0mi). If only the river's main channel is considered, between the islands of Curu\u221a\u00b0 (state of Amap\u221a\u00b0) and Jurupari (state of Par\u221a\u00b0), the width falls to about 15\u00a0km (9.3\u00a0mi).

However, the Amazon has been reported as being anywhere between 6,275\u00a0km (3,899\u00a0mi) and 6,992\u00a0km (4,345\u00a0mi) long.[4] It is often said to be \"at least\" 6,575\u00a0km (4,086\u00a0mi) long.[3] The Nile is reported to be anywhere from 5,499 to 7,088\u00a0km (3,417 to 4,404\u00a0mi).[4] Often it is said to be \"about\" 6,650\u00a0km (4,130\u00a0mi) long.[20] There are several factors that can affect these measurements, such as the position of the geographical source and the mouth, the scale of measurement, and the length measuring techniques (for details see also List of rivers by length).[4][5] In July 2008, the Brazilian Institute for Space Research (INPE) published a news article on their webpage, claiming that the Amazon River was 140\u00a0km (87\u00a0mi) longer than the Nile. The Amazon's length was calculated as 6,992\u00a0km (4,345\u00a0mi), taking the Apacheta Creek as its source. Using the same techniques, the length of the Nile was calculated as 6,853\u00a0km (4,258\u00a0mi), which is longer than previous estimates but still shorter than the Amazon. The results were reached by measuring the Amazon downstream to the beginning of the tidal estuary of Canal do Sul and then, after a sharp turn back, following tidal canals surrounding the isle of Maraj\u221a\u2265 and finally including the marine waters of the R\u221a\u2260o Par\u221a\u00b0 bay in its entire length.[61][23] According to an earlier article on the webpage of the National Geographic, the Amazon's length was calculated as 6,800\u00a0km (4,200\u00a0mi) by a Brazilian scientist. In June 2007, Guido Gelli, director of science at the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), told London's Telegraph Newspaper that it could be considered that the Amazon was the longest river in the world.[67] However, according to the above sources, none of the two results was published, and questions were raised about the researchers' methodology. In 2009, a peer-reviewed article, was published, concluding that the Nile is longer than the Amazon by stating a length of 7,088\u00a0km (4,404\u00a0mi) for the Nile and 6,575\u00a0km (4,086\u00a0mi) for the Amazon, measured by using a combination of satellite image analysis and field investigations to the source regions.[4]\nAccording to the Encyclop\u221a\u00b6dia Britannica, the final length of the Amazon remains open to interpretation and continued debate.[3][23]"

        "content": "The Amazon basin, the largest in the world, covers about 40% of South America, an area of approximately 7,050,000\u00a0km2 (2,720,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). It drains from west to east, from Iquitos in Peru, across Brazil to the Atlantic. It gathers its waters from 5 degrees north latitude to 20 degrees south latitude. Its most remote sources are found on the inter-Andean plateau, just a short distance from the Pacific Ocean.[68] The Amazon River and its tributaries are characterised by extensive forested areas that become flooded every rainy season. Every year, the river rises more than 9\u00a0m (30\u00a0ft), flooding the surrounding forests, known as v\u221a\u00b0rzea (\"flooded forests\"). The Amazon's flooded forests are the most extensive example of this habitat type in the world.[69] In an average dry season, 110,000\u00a0km2 (42,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of land are water-covered, while in the wet season, the flooded area of the Amazon basin rises to 350,000\u00a0km2 (140,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[65] The quantity of water released by the Amazon to the Atlantic Ocean is enormous: up to 300,000\u00a0m3/s (11,000,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s) in the rainy season, with an average of 209,000\u00a0m3/s (7,400,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s) from 1973 to 1990.[70] The Amazon is responsible for about 20% of the Earth's fresh water entering the ocean.[69] The river pushes a vast plume of fresh water into the ocean. The plume is about 400\u00a0km (250\u00a0mi) long and between 100 and 200\u00a0km (62 and 124\u00a0mi) wide. The fresh water, being lighter, flows on top of the seawater, diluting the salinity and altering the colour of the ocean surface over an area up to 2,500,000\u00a0km2 (970,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in extent. For centuries ships have reported fresh water near the Amazon's mouth yet well out of sight of land in what otherwise seemed to be the open ocean.[28] The Atlantic has sufficient wave and tidal energy to carry most of the Amazon's sediments out to sea, thus the Amazon does not form a true delta. The great deltas of the world are all in relatively protected bodies of water, while the Amazon empties directly into the turbulent Atlantic.[25] There is a natural water union between the Amazon and the Orinoco basins, the so-called Casiquiare canal. The Casiquiare is a river distributary of the upper Orinoco, which flows southward into the Rio Negro, which in turn flows into the Amazon. The Casiquiare is the largest river on earth that links two major river systems, a so-called bifurcation."

        "content": "Not all of the Amazon's tributaries flood at the same time of the year. Many branches begin flooding in November and might continue to rise until June. The rise of the Rio Negro starts in February or March and begins to recede in June. The Madeira River rises and falls two months earlier than most of the rest of the Amazon river. The depth of the Amazon between Manacapuru and \u221a\u00ecbidos has been calculated as between 20 and 26\u00a0m (66 and 85\u00a0ft). At Manacapuru, the Amazon's water level is only about 24\u00a0m (79\u00a0ft) above mean sea level. More than half of the water in the Amazon downstream of Manacapuru is below sea level.[75] In its lowermost section, the Amazon's depth averages 20 to 50\u00a0m (66 to 164\u00a0ft), in some places as much as 100\u00a0m (330\u00a0ft).[76] The main river is navigable for large ocean steamers to Manaus, 1,500\u00a0km (930\u00a0mi) upriver from the mouth. Smaller ocean vessels below 9000 tons and with less than 5.5\u00a0m (18\u00a0ft) draft can reach as far as Iquitos, Peru, 3,600\u00a0km (2,200\u00a0mi) from the sea. Smaller riverboats can reach 780\u00a0km (480\u00a0mi) higher, as far as Achual Point. Beyond that, small boats frequently ascend to the Pongo de Manseriche, just above Achual Point in Peru.[63] Annual flooding occurs in late northern latitude winter at high tide when the incoming waters of the Atlantic are funnelled into the Amazon delta. The resulting undular tidal bore is called the pororoca, with a leading wave that can be up to 7.6\u00a0m (25\u00a0ft) high and travel up to 800\u00a0km (500\u00a0mi) inland.[77][78]"

        "content": "The Amazon River originated as a transcontinental river in the Miocene epoch between 11.8 million and 11.3 million years ago and took its present shape approximately 2.4 million years ago in the Early Pleistocene. The proto-Amazon during the Cretaceous flowed west, as part of a proto-Amazon-Congo river system, from the interior of present-day Africa when the continents were connected, forming western Gondwana. 80 million years ago, the two continents split. Fifteen million years ago, the main tectonic uplift phase of the Andean chain started. This tectonic movement is caused by the subduction of the Nazca Plate underneath the South American Plate. The rise of the Andes and the linkage of the Brazilian and Guyana bedrock shields,[clarification needed] blocked the river and caused the Amazon Basin to become a vast inland sea. Gradually, this inland sea became a massive swampy, freshwater lake and the marine inhabitants adapted to life in freshwater.[79] Eleven to ten million years ago, waters worked through the sandstone from the west and the Amazon began to flow eastward, leading to the emergence of the Amazon rainforest. During glacial periods, sea levels dropped and the great Amazon lake rapidly drained and became a river, which would eventually become the disputed world's longest, draining the most extensive area of rainforest on the planet.[80] Paralleling the Amazon River is a large aquifer, dubbed the Hamza River, the discovery of which was made public in August 2011.[81]"

It is the largest species of river dolphin, and it can grow to lengths of up to 2.6\u00a0m (8.5\u00a0ft). The colour of its skin changes with age; young animals are gray, but become pink and then white as they mature. The dolphins use echolocation to navigate and hunt in the river's tricky depths.[88] The boto is the subject of a legend in Brazil about a dolphin that turns into a man and seduces maidens by the riverside.[89] The tucuxi (Sotalia fluviatilis), also a dolphin species, is found both in the rivers of the Amazon basin and in the coastal waters of South America. The Amazonian manatee (Trichechus inunguis), also known as \"seacow\", is found in the northern Amazon River basin and its tributaries. It is a mammal and a herbivore. Its population is limited to freshwater habitats, and, unlike other manatees, it does not venture into saltwater. It is classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.[90] The Amazon and its tributaries are the main habitat of the giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis).[91] Sometimes known as the \"river wolf,\" it is one of South America's top carnivores. Because of habitat destruction and hunting, its population has dramatically decreased. It is now listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), which effectively bans international trade.[92]"

Also present in large numbers is the notorious piranha, an omnivorous fish that congregates in large schools and may attack livestock. There are approximately 30 to 60 species of piranha. The candir\u221a\u222b, native to the Amazon River, is a species of parasitic fresh water catfish in the family Trichomycteridae,[97] just one of more than 1200 species of catfish in the Amazon basin.

Meanwhile, in 2022, the region's severe drought, has led to a devastating increase in water temperatures, reaching 39.1 degrees Celsius, causing the demise of 125 Amazon river dolphins.[102] This event displays the deteriorating environmental conditions and indicates the increasing vulnerability of the river's ecosystem. In recent years, the Amazon River has experienced historically low water levels, the lowest in over a century.

        "content": " Typhoon Flo, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Norming, was a long-lived typhoon that brought destruction to much of Japan during September\u00a01990. Flo originated from an area of convection that first formed to the southeast of the Marshall Islands on September\u00a07. Five days later, the disturbance obtained tropical depression status, and on September\u00a013, intensified into a tropical storm. Tracking west-northwest as it rounded a subtropical ridge, Flo slowly deepened, and on September\u00a015, became a typhoon. After developing an eye, Flo began to rapidly intensify, and on September\u00a017, Flo attained peak intensity. Shortly thereafter, the typhoon began to recurve to the northeast towards Honshu in response to deepening troughs to the northwest and north of the system, which resulted in a weakening trend due to increased vertical wind shear despite remaining over warm water. On September\u00a019, Flo made landfall on southern Honshu, becoming the first typhoon to hit the Kii Peninsula in 11\u00a0years, and thereafter started to transition into an extratropical cyclone. The extratropical remnants of Flo were last noted on the morning of September\u00a022. Typhoon Flo was the strongest system to affect Japan since 1959. For a period of three days, the typhoon dropped heavy rainfall across much of the Japanese archipelago, which inflicted damage in 44 of 47\u00a0prefectures. The typhoon also passed just east of Okinawa, coming close enough to drop heavy rainfall. There, four people were killed, four were hurt, and five vessels sunk. On the northeastern side of Shikoku Island, in Kagawa Prefecture, two people were killed, 1,748\u00a0homes were damaged, and another 116\u00a0homes were destroyed. Across the Amami Islands, 13\u00a0people were killed, 29\u00a0others were hurt, 917\u00a0homes were damaged, and an additional 446\u00a0houses were destroyed, resulting in 2,327\u00a0homeless individuals. In Okayama Prefecture on the main Japanese island of Honshu, ten people perished and nine others were injured. There, 2,810\u00a0homes were demolished, 4,675\u00a0others were damaged, and Flo was the worst typhoon to strike the prefecture since 1964. While damage in Tokyo was slight, 260,000\u00a0passengers were stranded after 117\u00a0trains along the T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen line were disrupted. Due to a prolonged period of heavy rain, partially caused by Flo, rainfall was 300% of normal in some locations on the island as of mid-September\u00a01990 while sunshine time was a mere 64% of average in Hokkaido Prefecture. Overall, 40\u00a0fatalities were reported and 131\u00a0others sustained injuries. A total 16,541\u00a0houses were destroyed while 18,183\u00a0others were flooded. Additionally, 413\u00a0ships sunk and 10,365\u00a0acres (4,195\u00a0ha) of farmland were damaged. The typhoon flooded or cut roads at 418\u00a0locations and railroads at 31\u00a0spots while there were also greater than 450\u00a0landslides. A total of 337\u00a0flights were canceled by Japan's four major airlines (Japan Airlines, All Nippon Airways, Japan Air System, and Air Nippon) affecting around 33,000\u00a0passengers. Moreover, 245\u00a0trains were halted, leaving almost 300,000\u00a0stranded. Monetary damage amounted to \u00a5132\u00a0billion or US$918\u00a0million across the country.[nb 1]"

        "content": "The origins of Typhoon Flo can be traced to an area of convection that first formed to the southeast of the Marshall Islands on September\u00a07. At 06:00\u00a0UTC the next day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started tracking the system[1] while it was located about 430\u00a0km (270\u00a0mi) east-southeast of Guam. Initially, the disturbance tracked generally west-northwest[2] as it remained weak. Over the next four days, the storm's convective structure slowly improved caused by an expansion of its equatorial outflow channel while also turning westward - on a course typical of a straight runner.[1] On September\u00a012, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a tropical depression.[3][nb 2] Following the disturbance's development of a well-defined upper-level center and an additional increase in organization, aided by the subtropical jet the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert at 05:30\u00a0UTC that day. At 18:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a012, the JTWC declared the system a tropical depression.[1] Six hours later, the JMA upgraded the depression into a tropical storm,[3] with the JTWC followed suit based on Dvorak classifications of T2.5/65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph).[1] Around this time, Flo began to track west-northwest at a pace of 23\u00a0km/h (14\u00a0mph) under the influence of a subtropical ridge to the north. Flo initially intensified at the climatological rate of one T number per day,[1] and at 06:00 UTC on September\u00a014, the JMA upgraded Flo to a severe tropical storm. Early the following day, both agencies classified Flo as a typhoon,[5][nb 3] although operationally the JTWC did not upgrade Flo into a typhoon until 06:00 UTC, when the storm developed a small but circular eye. After becoming a typhoon, Flo began to rapidly intensify.[1] Over the ensuing 36\u00a0hours, the JTWC estimated that Flo deepened by 130\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph).[7] Midday on September\u00a016, the JTWC upgraded Flo into a super typhoon, which is defined by the JTWC as a tropical cyclone with winds of at least 240\u00a0km/h (150\u00a0mph), although satellite intensity estimates suggested that Flo was even stronger. At 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a017, the JTWC raised the intensity of the typhoon to 265\u00a0km/h (165\u00a0mph), equal to Category\u00a05 status on the United States-based Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (SSHWS); the basis for this was flight level observations from a Hurricane Hunter aircraft. Shortly thereafter, a dropsonde from the aircraft measured a barometric pressure of 891\u00a0mbar (26.3\u00a0inHg).[1] Around this time, the JMA estimated the typhoon peaked in intensity, with winds of 225\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph) and a pressure of 890\u00a0mbar (26\u00a0inHg).[3] Around the time Flo peaked in intensity, the typhoon began to recurve to the northeast in response to a deepening mid-latitude shortwave trough to the northwest, which induced a break in the subtropical ridge. At 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a018, the JTWC estimated that the typhoon weakened back to a tropical storm. Weakening continued due to increased vertical wind shear, although the warm waters of the Kuroshio Current helped Flo maintain some of its intensity. Typhoon Flo accelerated northeastward towards Honshu in response to a trough passing north of the system.[1] Around 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a019,[5] the storm made landfall on southern Honshu,[1] with the JTWC and JMA reporting winds of 170\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph) and 160\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph) respectively at the time of landfall.[5] After passing over Japan, Flo began to transition into an extratropical cyclone.[1] At 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a020, the JMA declared Flo extratropical,[3] while the JTWC downgraded it to a tropical storm. Six hours later, the JTWC issued their last warning on the system because it had completed its extratropical transition.[1] The extratropical remnants of Flo were last noted on the morning of September\u00a022.[3]"

The 13th storm and 7th typhoon of the 2003 Pacific typhoon season, Dujuan developed on August\u00a027 to the east of Taiwan. It initially moved to the northwest, slowly intensifying into a tropical storm while drawing moisture and rainfall over the Philippines. On the island of Luzon, one person was killed and areas were flooded. Dujuan quickly intensified after turning and moving quicker to the west-northwest, developing an eye. It reached peak winds of 150\u00a0km/h (93\u00a0mph) on September\u00a01, and shortly thereafter passed just south of Taiwan. There, Dujuan left 590,000\u00a0people without power, killed three, and caused NT$200\u00a0million (NWD, $115\u00a0million USD) in crop damage.[nb 1] While moving through the South China Sea, the typhoon developed concentric eyewalls. Dujuan weakened to severe tropical storm status before making landfall on September\u00a02 in southern China, just east of Hong Kong near Shenzhen, Guangdong. The storm dissipated the next day after causing 40\u00a0deaths and \u00a52.3\u00a0billion (CNY, US$277\u00a0million) in damage. Most of the deaths were in Shenzhen where the storm moved ashore, and the city experienced a near-total power outage."

        "content": "On August\u00a025, an area of convection persisted on satellite imagery on August\u00a025. The thunderstorms pulsed and became better organized by August\u00a027.[2] That day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA)[nb 2] estimated that a tropical depression formed southeast of the Japanese island of Okinotorishima,[3] or about 520\u00a0km (320\u00a0mi) northwest of Guam. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)[nb 3] also estimated a tropical cyclone formed on August\u00a027. With a ridge to the north, the depression tracked slowly to the southwest.[5] The system gradually organized while developing improved outflow to the south, although a tropical upper tropospheric trough to the north caused wind shear.[2] On August\u00a029, the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Dujuan,[3] although the JTWC had upgraded a day prior.[5] That day, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) began issuing advisories as the storm approached the region, naming it Onyok.[1] Shortly after it was named, Dujuan quickly intensified after an upper-level low to the northwest improved outflow to the north.[5] On August\u00a030, the ridge to the north built eastward, causing the storm to slow and turn more to the northwest.[5] That day, an eye developed in center,[2] and the JMA upgraded Dujuan to typhoon status. Subsequently, the typhoon accelerated to the west-northwest and later to the west. On September\u00a01, the JMA estimated Dujuan attained peak 10\u2013minute sustained winds of 150\u00a0km/h (93\u00a0mph).[3] Around the same time, the JTWC assessed peak 1\u2013minute winds of 230\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph), making it the equivalent of a Category\u00a04 on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale. While near peak intensity, the center of Dujuan passed about 45\u00a0km (28\u00a0mi) south of the southern tip of Taiwan.[5] While moving westward through the South China Sea, the typhoon weakened slightly after its peak intensity due to an eyewall replacement cycle.[2] Radar from the Hong Kong Observatory indicated an inner eye about 20\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi) in diameter, and an outer eye about 100\u00a0km (62\u00a0mi) in diameter.[6] At around 1200\u00a0UTC on September\u00a02, Dujuan made landfall just east of Hong Kong,[3] near Shenzhen.[6] The JMA estimated the typhoon had weakened into a severe tropical storm by the time of landfall,[3] while the JTWC estimated winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph).[5] It was considered the strongest typhoon to strike the Pearl River Delta since Typhoon Hope in 1979.[7] Dujuan rapidly weakened while continuing westward through China, dissipating on September\u00a03 over Guangxi.[3]"

Flash flooding in Metro Manila covered roads, causing traffic jams. Dangerous conditions caused many schools to close.[8] The typhoon destroyed one house, and one person was killed in the country.[9] While in the vicinity, Dujuan produced gusts of 100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph) on Yonaguni, a Japanese subdivision of Okinawa. Strong winds and high waves disrupted marine and airline traffic, with two flights canceled.[10] Rainfall on Okinawa reached about 18\u00a0mm (0.71\u00a0in).[11] On August\u00a031, officials in Taiwan issued a sea warning, advising for boats to avoid the Bashi Channel.[12] Schools in southern Taiwan were closed, and transport was disrupted. The Ministry of National Defense canceled a military exercise due to the storm.[13] In Taiwan, the typhoon dropped heavy rainfall that reached 628\u00a0mm (24.7\u00a0in) in Pingtung County, and several other locations reported over 200\u00a0mm (7.9\u00a0in). Sustained winds reached 176\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph) on Orchid Island offshore southeastern Taiwan, where gale-force winds were recorded for 13\u00a0hours and gusts reached 271\u00a0km/h (168\u00a0mph). The typhoon was so strong that it destroyed the anemometer there. On the island of Taiwan, winds peaked at 87\u00a0km/h (54\u00a0mph) at Dongshi, while gusts peaked at 184\u00a0km/h (114\u00a0mph) in a mountainous region of Nantou County.[2] The typhoon left about 590,000\u00a0people without power at some point on the island. Transport was disrupted, and there was about NT$200\u00a0million (TWD, US$115\u00a0million).[nb 4] Dujuan killed three people and injured eight in southern Taiwan;[6] one was a drowning in the Penghu islands, and another occurred when a man was blown out of his window in Taipei.[15] Before Dujuan made its final landfall, the Hong Kong Observatory initially issued a standby warning signal, and eventually raised it to a number\u00a09 signal, the second-highest out of 10, for the first time since Typhoon York in 1999.[6][16] The threat of the storm caused 360\u00a0flights to be canceled or delayed at Hong Kong International Airport,[6] and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange was closed.[2] Officials opened 27\u00a0shelters for residents, housing over 120\u00a0people.[16] Winds in the territory briefly reached typhoon status, or 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph), at Lau Fau Shan. Rainfall reached over 90\u00a0mm (3.5\u00a0in) on Lantau Island.[6] Dujuan caused minor flooding and two small landslides In Hong Kong, the typhoon knocked down 85\u00a0trees and caused a power outage affecting 300\u00a0people in Yuen Long. Dujuan injured 24\u00a0people in the territory,[6] and four fishermen were missing and presumed drowned after their boat sank.[2] Despite the close passage, damage was minor in Hong Kong.[7] During the height of the storm, three people stole $1.3\u00a0million (USD) worth of jewelry, watches, and clothing from a store.[17] On the Chinese mainland, Dujuan produced 183\u00a0mm (7.2\u00a0in) of rainfall in Puning in Guangdong, of which 131\u00a0mm (5.2\u00a0in) fell in 24\u00a0hours. In Fujian province, winds reached 144\u00a0km/h (89\u00a0mph) in Quanzhou, and in Guangdong, winds peaked at 179\u00a0km/h (111\u00a0mph) in Shenzhen.[2] In Shenzhen near where Dujuan made landfall, 90% of residents lost power,[6] after strong winds knocked down power lines,[18] although it was quickly restored.[7] Also in the city, 20\u00a0people were killed,[18] 16 of whom due to the collapse of a half-finished building that they were constructing.[7] Officials had opened 272\u00a0emergency shelters before the storm's arrival, housing 4,950\u00a0people.[19] In Huizhou, nine people were killed, and another three people died in Shanwei from the storm.[18] Across Guangdong, the typhoon damaged roads, water and power systems, and telecommunication networks. About 139,000\u00a0ha (340,000 acres) of crops were damaged in the province,[2] and 54,000\u00a0homes were destroyed.[20] In Macau, 30\u00a0flights were delayed at Macau International Airport, and two bridges were closed. In Fuzhou in Fujian province, the storm knocked down 500\u00a0trees.[2] Overall damage in China was estimated at \u00a52.3\u00a0billion (CNY, US$277\u00a0million),[nb 5] and across Guangdong, the typhoon injured about 1,000\u00a0people and killed 40\u00a0people.[6]"

Crossing the country on June\u00a06, the system moved over the South China Sea and attained typhoon status. Late on June\u00a08, Dot reached its peak intensity with winds estimated at 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph). The system weakened slightly the next day before making landfall in Hainan Island. A weakened storm then entered the Gulf of Tonkin before striking northern Vietnam and dissipating on June\u00a012. Throughout its course, Typhoon Dot produced heavy rains in the Philippines, China and Vietnam, resulting in significant damage and eight fatalities. The most severe impacts took place on Hainan Island where 1,400 homes were destroyed and another 60,000 were damaged. In Vietnam, Dot exacerbated flooding triggered in late May by Tropical Storm Cecil."

        "content": "In early June\u00a01989, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began monitoring a tropical disturbance that developed over the southern Philippine Sea.[nb 1] Over the following two days, convection associated with this system increased and became better organized. This development prompted the issuance of a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on June\u00a04 as the system moved just north of Palau.[2] By this time, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a tropical depression.[3][nb 2] Early on June\u00a05, the JTWC followed suit and issued their first advisory on Tropical Depression 05W, at which time the system was situated roughly 555\u00a0km (345\u00a0mi) southwest of the island of Samar in the Philippines.[2] Due to the cyclone's proximity to the Philippines, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration also monitored the storm, assigning it with the local name Kuring.[5] Tracking generally towards the west-northwest, the depression intensified into a Tropical Storm and was given the name Dot, 12\u00a0hours before making landfall in Samar on June\u00a06.[2] Crossing over the central Philippines and the Sibuyan Sea, Tropical Storm Dot grew in size and intensity. By June\u00a07, the storm entered the South China Sea and acquired a brief northerly component to its track. At the time, forecasters at the JTWC anticipated that Dot would interact with an approaching weather front and track north of Hainan Island. The front failed to materialize, however, and the storm resumed a west-northwesterly track. Owing to low wind shear and warm waters, Dot attained typhoon status on June\u00a08. Following the development of an eye, the storm reached its peak intensity later that day as a Category\u00a03 equivalent typhoon on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale, with maximum sustained winds estimated at 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph).[2] By the morning of June\u00a09, the JMA assessed Dot to have attained ten-minute sustained winds of 150\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph) and a barometric pressure of 955\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.2\u00a0inHg).[3] Gradual weakening occurred as Dot neared Hainan Island on June\u00a09. The typhoon subsequently made landfall near Sanya on June\u00a010 and weakened to a tropical storm. Later that day, the storm emerged into the Gulf of Tonkin before making its third and final landfall near Hai Phong, Vietnam. Once onshore, Dot quickly degraded over the mountainous terrain of northern Vietnam, and was last noted on June\u00a012.[2][3]"

        "content": "Tropical Storm Dot produced widespread rainfall in the Philippines, leading to several landslides. In Toledo City, the Carmen copper Concentrator had to temporarily shut down after a landslide disrupted the facility's water supply. As a result, the Atlas Consolidated Mining and Development Corporation lost approximately 272,000\u00a0kg (600,000\u00a0lb) of copper.[5] Across Hainan Island, the storm produced heavy rains and damaging winds that left eight cities without power or telephone service.[6] Throughout Hainan, about 1,400 homes were destroyed and 60,000 more were damaged. Press reports indicated that two people died as a result of Typhoon Dot while another was listed as missing. Overall, damage in Hainan reached 170\u00a0million Renminbi (US$45.1\u00a0million).[7] Three rescue teams were deployed to the region to assist in recovery efforts.[6] In nearby Guangxi Province, heavy rains caused additional flooding that destroyed 300 homes and injured eight people. However, these rains also helped alleviate drought conditions in the region.[7] At Tai Mo Shan in Hong Kong, sustained winds from Dot reached 79\u00a0km/h (49\u00a0mph) and gusts peaked at 110\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph). More than 55,000 hectares (140,000 acres) of crops were flooded, the majority of which were rice fields.[7] Roughly two weeks after Tropical Storm Cecil devastated parts of Vietnam,[8] Dot caused further flooding along the Red River Delta. Portions of Hanoi were inundated with up to 1\u00a0m (3\u00a0ft). Winds up to 116\u00a0km/h (72\u00a0mph) reportedly affected coastal areas near where the typhoon moved ashore.[9] Nearly 162,000 hectares (400,000 acres) of rice fields were submerged by the storm. At least six fatalities were attributed to the storm in Vietnam, and many more were injured.[10]"

        "content": " The 2010 New Year's Eve tornado outbreak was a three-day-long tornado outbreak that impacted the central and lower Mississippi Valley from December\u00a030, 2010 to January\u00a01, 2011. Associated with a low pressure system and a strong cold front, 37\u00a0tornadoes tracked across five states over the length of the severe event, killing nine and injuring several others. Activity was centered in the states of Missouri and later Mississippi on December\u00a031. Seven tornadoes were rated EF3 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale; these were the strongest during the outbreak. Non-tornadic winds were recorded to have reached as high as 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) at eight locations on December\u00a031, while hail as large as 2.75\u00a0in (7.0\u00a0cm) was documented north-northeast of Mansfield, Missouri. Overall, damage from the outbreak totaled US$123.3\u00a0million, most of which was related to tornadoes.[2][failed verification] This is the most prolific tornado outbreak in Missouri in the month of December.[3] The United States Storm Prediction Center first noted a possible New Year's Eve severe weather event as early as December\u00a025, 2010. These forecasts gained confidence as the event approached, with a focus on the Ozarks and adjacent areas. Supercells developed in this area during the night of December\u00a030 and tracked across central Missouri, producing several tornadoes and large hail. However, the bulk of activity during the outbreak was a result of a long line of supercells that tracked from Oklahoma to Illinois, producing five EF3\u00a0tornadoes. One of these tracked through northwestern Arkansas, killing four. Another tore through eastern sections of Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri, destroying 159\u00a0homes and causing US$90\u00a0million in damage, making it the costliest tornado of the outbreak. A separate cluster of storms later developed in Louisiana before tracking into Mississippi, producing several tornadoes across southern and central regions of the state on January\u00a01."

        "content": "The Storm Prediction Center (SPC) began to note the possibility that a severe weather event could develop on December\u00a030 as early as December\u00a025, 2010. Nonetheless, the predictability of the event was too low as the event was several days out.[4] As the anticipated event grew closer, confidence in the forecast slowly increased, though uncertainties in the timing and extent of the tornado outbreak still existed.[5] These uncertainties remained through December\u00a029 with forecasts calling for only marginal hail and possibly damaging gusts. However, the SPC indicated that discrete tornadic supercells and more severe thunderstorms could result from atmospheric conditions deviating slightly from the forecast.[6] In contrast, forecasts were more confident in a widespread outbreak of severe weather for New Year's Eve; the SPC issued a slight risk outlook for much of the Lower Mississippi Valley and the Ozarks as a result.[7] Atmospheric conditions remained only marginally conducive for the development of thunderstorms on the morning of December\u00a030.[8] Throughout the day, moisture was drawn from the Gulf of Mexico northward into the Ozarks region. However, the presence of a capping inversion prevented thunderstorms from developing.[9] During the evening of December\u00a030, an area of strong wind shear developed near the Ark-La-Tex and southeastern Oklahoma area well ahead of a nearing cold front, providing a focal point for potential storm development.[10] Late that day, scattered thunderstorms developed over eastern Oklahoma and northern Arkansas, producing significant hail.[11] Over the next few hours and into December\u00a031, these storms would intensify as they moved into southwestern Missouri, producing four tornadoes.[12] The first tornado watch issued in association with the severe event was issued at 07:06\u00a0UTC on December\u00a031 as these storms tracked across the Ozarks.[13] After a few hours, these supercell thunderstorms lessened in strength as they neared the Greater St. Louis metropolitan area.[14] While the cluster of thunderstorms was tracking through Missouri, a new squall line with embedded supercells developed across eastern Oklahoma and Kansas, demarcating a dry line boundary. Although linear storm systems tend to indicate strong wind events and not tornadoes, these storms tracked eastward into southwestern Missouri and eventually produced several tornadoes.[15] A long-tracked EF3 developed from one of these supercells and struck Cincinnati, Arkansas.[16] At 13:31\u00a0UTC on December\u00a031, a tornado watch was issued for much of Missouri and portions of Arkansas and Illinois.[17] Most of the tornadoes during the outbreak stemmed from this line of storms as they moved through Missouri and Illinois throughout the day.[12] At around noon, a new cluster of disorganized showers formed over eastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi.[18] Although these storms were initially weak, they gradually intensified into supercells as the day went on.[19] Additional supercells quickly developed over Louisiana and eventually spread in coverage over Mississippi,[20][21] resulting in the development of several tornadoes.[22] Reaching their peak strength over Mississippi, the storms gradually lost their intensity as they tracked eastward late on December\u00a031 and into January\u00a01, 2011.[23] By the morning hours of January\u00a01, severe activity had become restricted to the Florida Panhandle and southern Alabama; the last tornado watch issued in association with the 2010\u00a0New Year's Eve tornado outbreak was issued for those regions at 15:56\u00a0UTC that day.[24]"

Four cars were displaced by 20\u201350\u00a0yd (18\u201346\u00a0m) and a nearby home sustained significant roof damage and broken windows; this resulted in an EF2\u00a0rating for the tornado within Adair County.[27] Damage in Adair County totaled $60,000. At 12:08\u00a0UTC, the tornado crossed the Oklahoma-Arkansas border and moved into Benton County, Arkansas.[25] At 12:10\u00a0UTC, the tornado tracked into Cincinnati, Arkansas, where it reached its peak intensity. Winds were estimated as high as 142\u00a0mph (229\u00a0km/h) and the tornado widened to a width of 300\u00a0yd (270\u00a0m), making the tornado a low-end EF3\u00a0at this location.[27][28] Several homes were destroyed or heavily damaged in the southwestern areas of the town. Numerous trees and power poles were knocked down or uprooted. Two people were killed when a mobile home was destroyed, while another person died as he was tending cattle when the barn he occupied collapsed. Seven others were injured in Cincinnati. The tornado continued to widen as it trekked northeastward, reaching a maximum width of 500\u00a0yd (460\u00a0m). Several permanent homes were heavily damaged northeast of Cincinnati, and a number of chicken houses, mobile homes, outbuildings, and power poles were destroyed. One woman was critically injured after her mobile home was destroyed; she died of her injuries at a hospital four days later.[28] Damage in Cincinnati and surrounding areas within Benton County reached $1.5\u00a0million.[25] After 12:17\u00a0UTC, the tornado's position fluctuated between Benton and Washington counties in northwestern Arkansas. Permanent houses were damaged and mobile homes were destroyed. Numerous trees were uprooted or snapped while many other power poles were snapped. Two people were injured following the destruction of a mobile home within the Ozark National Forest in Benton County, while another person was injured west of Tontitown, Arkansas in Washington County.[28] The tornado finally dissipated northwest of Tontitown at 12:27\u00a0UTC after causing four deaths and 10 injuries.[25][28] Overall, the tornado caused $1.835\u00a0million in damage, which was the sixth costliest total during the tornado outbreak.[25]"

The warning covered ten counties in Missouri and Illinois straddling the Mississippi River and included St. Louis.[29] Shortly after the warning's issuance, two EF1\u00a0tornadoes tracked across Jefferson and St. Louis counties, causing extensive tree damage and minor property damage. However, the most destructive tornado from the passing squall line touched down at 17:48\u00a0UTC east-northeast of Murphy, Missouri in northern Jefferson County. Initially, the tornado was an EF0 with a path width of 40\u00a0yd (37\u00a0m) and lifted before touching down again just north of Route 30 near the Jefferson-St. Louis county line. Small trees and minor roof damage occurred at the point of this second touch down before the tornado moved northeastward into St. Louis County, where the tornado caused a bulk of its damage and was at its strongest.[25] A large subdivision near Route\u00a030 sustained minor roof and tree damage, which was rated as EF0\u00a0intensity. However, as the tornado was intensifying through the neighborhood, three homes to the subdivision's east suffered more considerable roof and siding damage and was assigned an EF1\u00a0damage intensity rating. The tornado then crossed Route 141, where it blew a Honda CR-V into a highway barrier; the driver of the vehicle suffered critical injuries and died 11 days later from those injuries. After crossing the highway, a number of buildings were damaged including a church, elementary school, and parsonage. Damage in this area was rated as EF2 due to the partial debarking of a nearby tree. Minor tree damage occurred as the tornado moved through Fenton Park and tracked over the Meramec River.[25] After crossing the river, the tornado weakened to EF1\u00a0strength, damaging several homes while also leaving behind an interrupted damage path. The tornado crossed I-270 before rapidly intensifying at around 17:56\u00a0UTC. Numerous trees were uprooted while many homes sustained considerable damage. Six homes were unroofed and one was destroyed and shifted from its foundation; this damage was rated high-end EF3. At the time, the tornado was 0.25\u00a0mi (0.40\u00a0km) wide. The tornado weakened to EF1\u00a0intensity afterwards, causing more minor damage to a strip mall and several homes. Six power poles were knocked down shortly before the tornado lifted at 18:00\u00a0UTC in western Crestwood, Missouri.[25]"

Approximately 7\u00a0mi (11\u00a0km) west of Levelland, Texas, the winds downed four power poles, sparking a fire that burned nearly 2,000 acres (810 hectares) of grassland before it was finally contained;[30] the fire caused US$20,000\u00a0in damage.[31] In Allen, Oklahoma, strong winds associated with one supercell caused an estimated US$20,000 in damage after damaging the carport, chimney, and roof of a house.[32] Hail and strong winds were also reported elsewhere in eastern Oklahoma and southeastern Kansas. Widespread and damaging wind gusts and hail later crossed into northwestern Arkansas, causing US$175,000\u00a0in damage. Several buildings and homes were destroyed by the strong winds; similar impacts were seen in Missouri and Illinois.[25] In Mississippi, rainfall totals between 1\u20134\u00a0in (25\u2013102\u00a0mm) were widespread. The highest precipitation total was 5.58\u00a0in (142\u00a0mm) south of Grace, Mississippi.[22] In Scott County, residents were forced to evacuate out of Forest and Morton due to flash floods that caused $470,000\u00a0in damage. Similarly, the inundation washed out roads and flooded cars in Winona. Overall, flood damage in Mississippi amounted to US$1.135\u00a0million.[25]"

The fire began at about 11:00 local time on 2 December 2010, and spread quickly, consuming much of the Mediterranean forest covering the region. With a death toll of 44, it was the deadliest civil disaster in Israeli history until the 2021 Meron stampede. Those killed included 36 Israel Prison Service members, most of them new recruits,[3][4] as well as three senior police officers, among them the chief of Haifa's police,[5] and three firefighters, among them a 16-year-old volunteer.[6] More than 17,000 people were evacuated, including several villages in the vicinity of the fire, and there was considerable property and environmental damage.[7] The fire appeared to be caused by human activity near the Druze town of Isfiya. On 6 December a 14-year-old resident of the town told police that he had inadvertently started the fire with a nargila coal.[8] The teen's father argued that his son was witnessed in school at the time and could not have started the blaze.[9] The fire was followed by a wave of arsons throughout Israel and the West Bank. These fires, which initially created confusion regarding the source of the Carmel blaze, were all extinguished within a few hours of being lit.[10][11] The motivation for the attacks was not immediately clear. Israeli police have referred to some of these fires as arson.[12] Government officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman, called on other countries to help assist in firefighting efforts, and the Israel Defense Forces mobilized troops for the same purpose.[3][13] The fire was defeated on 5 December after raging for 77 hours, a little over three days.[14][15]"

Over the years, many fires have occurred on Mount Carmel, among them many which devastated hundreds of thousands of acres of forest. One such as that was the Mount Carmel forest fire of 1989 which destroyed about 3,200 dunams (320\u00a0ha; 790 acres) of forest. Israel had been experiencing an unusually warm autumn and dry conditions;[16] previous spring and summer months were also exceptionally hot. It was originally speculated that the fire was caused by the burning of an illegal garbage dump and spread due to the dry conditions and strong winds. Haifa's Mayor Yona Yahav stated that the problem was known and it was \"just a matter of time until a calamity occurred\".[3] Israel Police suggested that the fire was caused due to a bonfire that was lit by local residents and not extinguished properly and in time.[17] However, they stressed that the investigation of the incident is in its early phases and cautioned against drawing premature conclusions.[10] On 4 December, police arrested two adolescent brothers from the Druze town of Isfiya on suspicion of having caused the fire through negligence. Their family denied the accusation.[18] On 5 December, the Haifa Magistrate Court extended the brothers' remand for three days,[10] and on 6 December the court released them from custody under restrictive conditions. There were unconfirmed reports of the teens having hurled burning waste products during a picnic. The same day, police announced that they had arrested two additional youths from Isfiya the previous night, and that more arrests could be expected soon.[19] In the evening of 6 December, police announced that a 14-year-old resident of Isfiya admitted to inadvertently starting the fire. The teen told investigators that after smoking a nargila, he threw a lit coal into an open area and was so shocked by the result that he returned to school without telling anyone what he had done.[12] Druze Member of Knesset Ayoob Kara, a resident of Isfiya near where the fire broke out, had said on the evening of 2 December that he had received information that the fire was a terror act. MKs Ya'akov Katz and Michael Ben-Ari also cited the possibility that the fire was an act of terrorism and called for an investigation.[20]"

The Israeli Air Force used an unmanned aerial vehicle for reconnaissance and intelligence collection. Use of other aircraft was prohibited because of a decade-old decision that prohibits military aircraft from being used in such a situation.[32] Israel requested help from various countries, including the United States.[33] Turkey and Greece offered to send assistance to fight the fire. Greece was the first country to respond, sending 4 CL-415 aircraft supported by 1 C-130H with technicians and equipment to Ramat David Airbase. Greece also sent 1 more CL-415 and 1 C-130H with firefighters the next day. Turkey sent two firefighting aircraft, which started to extinguish fire in the early hours of December 3.[34] The Netherlands sent four fire extinguisher-aircraft, which could do their job as early as Monday, the 6th of December,[35] since Benjamin Netanyahu asked the Netherlands, as well as Belgium, Germany, Finland, Norway, and Russia specifically for help. The Swiss Air Force provided three Cougar Helicopter with fire fighting capabilities.[36] Cyprus[37] dispatched a helicopter and a plane to assist in the fire-fighting effort. Russia sent one Ilyushin Il-76 (capable of holding up to forty tons of water) and two Be-200 special firefighting planes.[38][39][40] Countries that offered help include Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Croatia,[41] Cyprus, France,[42] Jordan, Romania, Spain[43][44] with four seaplanes and the United Kingdom who sent two Royal Air Force helicopters.[45] Italy and Egypt also offered firefighting planes.[44][46] Netanyahu said he had a \"warm\" discussion with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, who offered any assistance he could to help Israel with the fire, even though the U.S. was trying to restart peace talks between the Israelis and Palestinians that broke down in September over the issue of construction West Bank settlements.[47] The Palestinian Authority sent several fire trucks to help extinguish fires near the Israeli-Arab localities of Tayibe and Barta'a;[48] on Sunday, December 5, 21 Palestinian firefighters joined the efforts in the Carmel Forest area itself.[49] Senior Palestinian Authority security official Ahmed Rizek Abu Rabia said: \"This is a human catastrophe. The Palestinian side is offering all the help it can through official channels.\"[48] On December 4, the Israeli government decided to hire Evergreen's Boeing 747 Supertanker to help extinguish the blaze.[50] The plane landed at 01:00 at Ben Gurion International Airport. The plane took off and at about 11:00 it released its first cargo of water. Later in the day it made a second sortie, dropping fire retardant. The Turkish assistance was considered surprising, due to the strain on the Turkish\u2013Israeli relationship since the Turkish Gaza flotilla raid.[35]\nAt a Security Cabinet meeting, Netanyahu thanked Turkish Prime Minister Erdo\u011fan (and others) for their offer to help, saying he \"hopes this will be the beginning of better relations between our two countries\".[47]"

On August 29, Lionrock turned towards the northwest due to a high pressure system located east of Japan, putting it on an unprecedented path towards the northeastern region of the country.[6] Right before weakening into a severe tropical storm at 18:00 JST (09:00 UTC) on August 30, Lionrock made landfall near \u014cfunato, a city in Iwate Prefecture, Japan with winds of 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h).[7] This makes Lionrock the first tropical cyclone to make landfall over the Pacific coast of the T\u014dhoku region of Japan since the Japan Meteorological Agency began record-keeping in 1951.[8] Lionrock's track was unusual due to the fact that the storm approached Japan from the southeast and made landfall along the east coast of the country. Most typhoons that hit Japan approach from the south or the southwest before moving northward across the archipelago.[9] In fact, the only other storm to take a similar track was Typhoon Mac in 1989, which also approached from the southeast and struck Japan's Kant\u014d region along its east coast.[10]"

It was the latest occurrence of the Southeast Asian haze, a long-term issue that occurs in varying intensity during every dry season in the region.[10] It was caused by forest fires resulting from slash-and-burn practices, principally on the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Kalimantan, which then spread quickly in the dry season.[11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19] On 4 September 2015, the Indonesian National Board for Disaster Management stated that six Indonesian provinces had declared a state of emergency due to the haze; these were Riau, Jambi, South Sumatra, West Kalimantan, Central Kalimantan and South Kalimantan.[20] On 14 September, a state of emergency was again declared in Riau, this time by the Indonesian government.[16][21] Thousands of residents of Pekanbaru, Riau's capital, fled to the nearby cities of Medan and Padang.[22][23] On 24 October, the Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) hit a record high of 1801, recorded in the province of Central Kalimantan.[24][25] More than 28 million people in Indonesia alone were affected by the crisis, and more than 140,000 reported respiratory illness.[9][26] According to a 2016 Harvard-Columbia University study, the haze caused more than 100,000 additional deaths, most of them (> 90,000) in Indonesia.[27][28]  But later, the claim was refuted by Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysian health authorities.[29] The haze caused by the Indonesian forest fires has been shown to increase haze related illnesses, such as upper respiratory illnesses and acute conjunctivitis, in Singapore.[30] The Indonesian government estimated that the haze crisis would cost it between 300 and 475 trillion rupiah (up to US$35 billion or S$47 billion) to mitigate.[31] School closures due to the haze were implemented in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore; these affected nearly four million students in Malaysia alone.[32][33][34] Among the events disrupted or even cancelled due to the haze were the 2015 FINA Swimming World Cup in Singapore and the Kuala Lumpur Marathon in Malaysia. Heavy rains in Sumatra and Kalimantan in the last days of October 2015 significantly reduced the size and number of fires, and improved the air quality in most affected areas.[2][3][35][36] In turn, the NEA of Singapore stopped issuing haze advisories from 15 November 2015."

        "content": "Indonesia has struggled for years to contain forest fires, especially in the islands of Sumatra and Kalimantan. In September 2014, Indonesia ratified the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution. It is the last ASEAN country to do so.[37] The agreement calls on Indonesia to take steps to solve the problem through its own efforts or through international co-operation, or else face legal action based on the impact of the haze on its south-east Asian neighbours.[38] In 2014, Singapore also passed laws that allow it to prosecute people and firms that contribute to the haze.[39] In early August 2015, although Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Myanmar, and Vietnam met to discuss the haze problem, Indonesia did not join the talks.[40]"

        "header": "Causes",
        "content": "The fires are caused by firms and farmers using slash-and-burn practices as a inexpensive means to clear their land of unwanted vegetation. Sumatra and Kalimantan possess large areas of peatland, which is highly combustible during dry season. Peat, which is made up of layers of dead vegetation and other organic matter, contributed heavily to carbon emissions because of the substance's high density[41] and carbon content. The haze was particularly severe in 2015 due to the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon, which caused drier conditions, causing the fires to spread more.[42] Research published in the Environmental Research Letters stated that 59% of fire emissions in Sumatra and 73% in Kalimantan originated from \"outside timber and palm oil concession boundaries\".[43] Environmental rights activists added that palm oil activities were still involved in the burning.  Firstly, land clearing by burning is cheap and is more often chosen by companies than any other land-clearing method. Secondly, most companies want to avoid spending money on reforestation. Any company which obtains a license for forest lands must replant them from a fund provided by the government.[44] Most companies do not replant, and to avoid detection, they burn the land. Thirdly, the companies revitalise palm plantations by cutting or burning old palm trees that are no longer productive. The regulation stipulates that such burning must be done on a bed of concrete to avoid spreading the fire, but to reduce costs, most companies do not do this.[44]"

NASA said that the 2015 haze crisis could become the worst one recorded in the region, possibly outstripping the 1997 crisis, which cost an estimated nine billion US dollars.[51]"

In late September, the province of Central Kalimantan measured a record high of 2,300 on Indonesia's PSI. On 2 October, Central Kalimantan was still experiencing a very high PSI of 1,801, such that firefighting helicopters were unable to water-bomb certain areas due to low visibility.[24] By mid-late October the burning hotspots, increasing sharply in number, had even spread to Indonesia's Papua region. The Terra Aqua satellite also discovered 63 hotspots in Maluku and 17 in North Maluku. 1,545 hotspots were detected in Indonesia, although the exact number couldn't be ascertained as the haze covering the region was too thick. The Nusa Tenggara Islands also had hotspots: around 67 in East Nusa Tenggara and 25 in West Nusa Tenggara.[63] Dozens of flights were cancelled in Timika, West Papua. Both the Moluccas Islands and Sulawesi were covered by haze. In Sulawesi, around 800 hotspots were discovered by BPBD, a disaster mitigation agency. There were 57 hotspots in West Sulawesi, 151 in South Sulawesi, 361 in Central Sulawesi, 126 in Southeast Sulawesi, 47 in Gorontalo and 59 in North Sulawesi. The city of Palu was covered by haze from nearby Kalimantan, causing some flight delays. In Java, forest fires burned in West Java and Mount Merapi, Central Java. A forest fire, which trapped hikers and killed at least seven of them on Mount Lawu in Magetan Regency in East Java, was later reported to have been caused by a bonfire.[64] This incident caused local areas to be evacuated. The haze in Palangkaraya was so thick that it turned the air yellow and exceeded the 'dangerous' threshold by 10 times. The annual parliamentary meeting was interrupted, as the smoke from outside entered the room, causing all of the politicians to use masks and tissues in the room.[65][66] Most schools in the affected area were closed until further notice due to the haze. In Riau and Palembang, students were advised to go to school only twice a week. Sometimes they did not even go to school for a whole week due to the haze, causing wide concern among parents and government officials. At least ten companies, seven of which are foreign companies, were declared as the prime suspects for fire in Sumatra and Kalimantan. Two of the companies' certificates were suspended by the government. Indonesian president Joko Widodo ordered all hospitals and puskesmas (community health clinics) to be open for 24 hours. On 20 October, there were 825 new hotspots in Sumatra, with the visibility in Riau deteriorating to 50 meters. Around 66 flights in Pekanbaru were cancelled. At noon, the haze worsened as the air became yellow.[67] The Government of Riau, later made a statement that the haze crisis has killed their citizens slowly by suffocating them. On 21 October, it was reported that the number of people with respiratory problems had risen to 78,829 in Riau alone. Many reported they suffered from dizziness and sore eyes. Most of the victims killed by the haze were students and newborn babies.[68] A nine-year-old third-grade student died because of the smoke and the doctors and nurses who tried to save the child reported that the child's lungs were fully filled with smoke. A 15-month-old baby also died in Jambi. The photos of the dead body, taken with the baby's mother, went viral on Facebook.[69][70] The haze crisis also interrupted the search for a missing Eurocopter EC130 with five people on board in Lake Toba. The sole survivor reported that the cause of the crash was the haze."

        "content": "As of 3 October, the Philippine island of Cebu suffered its seventh straight day of haze. Therefore, it was suspected, although not confirmed, that the haze was originating from Indonesian and not local sources, possibly as a result of monsoon winds blowing north-east from fires in Indonesia towards the direction of the central Philippines.[49][84] As a result, some Philippine aircraft had difficulties landing at Mactan\u2013Cebu International Airport. Visual Flight Rules in the country were suspended, so that \"only airline operations using airplanes with instrument flying capabilities are allowed to take off and land\".[85] The Philippines at first did not believe haze from Indonesia was reaching the country,[85][86] but later suspected it was due to the fact that the haze did not disappear within a day as per the usual haze that is particular to the region of Cebu City.[49] Gerry Bagtasa, an atmospheric scientist, however concluded that the haze in Cebu was both from Indonesian and local sources due to several factors including effects by Typhoon Koppu, locally known as Typhoon Lando, and the north-east monsoon. The interaction made a pocket of air above Cebu where a visible haze accumulated. Bagtasa said that the haze had already reached the island of Mindanao and other parts of Visayas when it was reported in Cebu but was too thin to be visible.[87] By mid-October, haze from Indonesia had reached Mindanao. On 20 October, it was reported that the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) in Southern Mindanao had been monitoring the haze for days. The weather body said that haze had been visible in Davao City since 17 October. Typhoon Koppu and the north-east monsoon were linked to the haze affecting Mindanao. Haze was also reported in the cities of Cagayan de Oro, General Santos, Iligan, Davao, and Zamboanga.[88][89] Haze affected operations of airports in Mindanao and Visayas.[90] It was also observed in Metro Manila since 23 October although as of 25 October it was not linked to sources from Indonesia but to local pollution. At 12:00 (GMT+8) on 25 October, the research monitoring station in University of the Philippines Diliman recorded a PM2.5 measurement of above 150 micrograms, which is deemed as \"hazardous\".[91] There were concerns about haze from Indonesia reaching Metro Manila and it was theorised that this could happen if another typhoon hit the country.[92]"

Thunderstorms and rain had improved the situation in the afternoons of the 15th and 16th, while a change in prevailing wind direction improved the situation from the 20th to the 22nd. The haze deteriorated again on the evening of the 23rd and the morning of the 24th as denser haze from Sumatra was blown into the country by prevailing southerly winds.[98] On 24 September, the PSI reading at 7 p.m. rose into the \"hazardous\" range for the first time in 2015 with a reading of 313. It rose further to 317 at 8 p.m., which prompted the Ministry of Education (MOE) to close all primary and secondary schools on the 25th due to the worsening haze conditions.[34] The haze deteriorated further during the small hours, reaching a record high for the year at 5 a.m. with a reading of 341. However, the 3-hour PSI quickly fell back into the \"moderate\" range at 1 p.m. the next day. The PSI had been hovering at the unhealthy range from the late afternoon to the evening, and the MOE announced schools to reopen on 28 September 2015. Since that day, PSI levels have remained at the unhealthy range, even rising up to very unhealthy on a few occasions.[99] On 24 September 2015, Ministry of Manpower (MOM) lodged a police report over a hoax post on social media (WhatsApp and Facebook) that claimed it had declared a \"voluntary non-work day\" on Friday, 25 September 2015 as a result of the haze.[100][101][102] On 25 September 2015, the government, for the first time, named five firms: Asia Pulp and Paper, Rimba Hutani Mas, Sebangun Bumi Andalas Wood Industries, Bumi Sriwijaya Sentosa and Wachyuni Mandira as responsible for the haze and instructed them to take measures to extinguish fires on their land, not to start new ones, and to submit action plans on how they would prevent future fires. The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources stressed that the haze was a man-made problem that should not be tolerated. Under Singapore's Transboundary Haze Pollution Act, those guilty can be fined up to $100,000 a day, capped at $2 million, for causing unhealthy haze. Some of the 2015 FINA Swimming World Cup's events on 3 October 2015 were cancelled as the PSI was in the 'unhealthy' range.[103] On 19 October 2015, the 1-hour PM2.5 concentration reached a record high of 471\u03bcg/m3 for the West region at 11 p.m., while the South region was at 301\u03bcg/m3 . This was a sharp increase as the highest 1-hour PM2.5 concentration in Singapore at 9 p.m. was 164\u03bcg/m3 . The National Environment Agency attributed this to \"denser haze from the sea areas south of Singapore being blown in by the prevailing south-south=easterly winds\".[104]\nThunderstorms in the morning of 28 October 2015 brought respite from the haze when the PSI dropped from 61 to 26 at 9 a.m. The National Environment Agency (NEA) announced that they would stop issuing daily haze advisories from 15 November 2015 onwards.[105] The 2015 haze crisis in Singapore was considered as the most serious haze episode for Singapore as it lasted for a long time. It was also the first time the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) deployed a Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) Chinook helicopter and 34 SAF personnel to help fight the ongoing forest fires in Sumatra, Indonesia.[106]"

They explained that foreign aid had been blocked,[134] even though the government had shown an inability to combat the fires itself, and that sub-standard masks were handed out to locals.[135][136][137] The Indonesian government was also criticised for promising to cut CO2 emissions by 20% but failing to provide any commitment to zero deforestation as the country has overtaken Brazil in terms of deforestation.[138] Indonesia has received a new record from the Guinness World Records as the country with the fastest destruction of forest due to fire. During the crisis, Indonesia surpassed the United States as the second largest producer of CO2 in the world due to the haze,[139] just behind China. The haze, which sent air pollution levels up to 'very unhealthy' levels in neighbouring Malaysia and Singapore, also affected the Pacific nations of Guam, Palau and the Northern Marianas. Guam's Office of Homeland Security and Civil Defence spokesperson Jenna Gaminde warned the public to expect the haze to reduce visibility and adversely affect those with respiratory issues. Western Melanesia was currently susceptible to winds from Typhoon Koppu and Champi pulling smoke plumes from vast fires in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. The World Resources Institute said in an October report that since early September, carbon emissions from the fires had exceeded average US daily output on 26 out of 44 days.[140][141] If the haze continues until next year, the haze could be the worst haze crisis in Southeast Asia since the 1997 Southeast Asia haze.[142] Robert Field, a NASA scientist from Columbia University, stated: If the forecasts for a longer dry season hold, this suggests 2015 will rank among the most severe events on record.[51] Weak enforcement of environmental laws have been criticised; in previous forest burnings, many of the perpetrators, who mostly comprised employees of Indonesian palm oil companies, had been caught with strong evidence of criminal activity but still managed to escape from getting heavier penalties.[56] A group of Malaysians gathered in front of the Indonesian embassy in Kuala Lumpur to show their protest over Indonesia's illegal fires.[143] In Thailand, around 50 Thais held a peaceful protest in front of the Indonesian consulate in Songkhla to demand that the Indonesian government expedite their action in combating the fires.[144] Another 20 Thais representing the \"Hatyai-Songkhla Residents Affected by Haze from Indonesia\" group also sent a letter to the Indonesian consulate asking Indonesia to take responsibility and give its commitment to solve the issue.[145] Tensions also arose with Singapore when Singapore's largest supermarket NTUC FairPrice withdrew paper products made by an Indonesian company, Asia Pulp & Paper (APP) as APP was named as one of the companies responsible for the haze.[134][146]"

The 2015 offer included three C-130 aircraft, one Chinook helicopter and a Singapore Civil Defence Force team.[160] The offer to deal with the crisis was again reiterated to Indonesia in September when Singapore was then affected by the haze.[161] At first, Indonesia accepted the offers[162] but rejected it under a recent statement by its Environment and Forestry Minister as confirmed by its ministry's chief spokesman, Mr Eka Soegiri.[154] Singapore has since reiterated the offer according to its former Minister for Environment and Water Resources, Dr Vivian Balakrishnan.[163] Dr Vivian also delivered Singapore's national statement at the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Summit 2015 on 27 September 2015 at the UN Headquarters in New York US.

In the statement, Minister Balakrishnan also called for closer regional and international co-operation on the issue of transboundary haze pollution in Southeast Asia.[164] On 7 October 2015, after the haze had affected parts of Southeast Asia for more than a month, Indonesia finally accepted Singapore's offer to help.[165] Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the request was sent via the Indonesian embassy in Singapore. Thailand \u2013 Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha ordered its Foreign Ministry co-operate closely with neighbouring countries to tackle the chronic problem that has gripped parts of Southeast Asia.[108] He also instructed officials in each affected province to spray water in the air to help improve visibility and to supply masks to the public.[108] Thailand has said that they would push for ASEAN-level efforts to combat the haze.[144] The Thai government has also offered them help in tackling the haze problem according to its Foreign Ministry deputy permanent secretary Vitavas Srivihok, as the Indonesian envoy had admitted his country's efforts alone were not enough to stop the fires.[166]"

        "content": "Forest fires caused by humans in the Himalayan state of Uttarakhand have been a regular event. Since the formation of the state in 2000, more than 44,518 hectares (110,010 acres) of forest land have been lost to fire.[2] Some fires during 1921, 1930, and 1942 have been associated with popular movements against the then British government's forestry policies and as a call for independence. Most of these fires occur in the chir pine (Pinus roxburghii) zone which is prone to fire. But the pine itself is resistant to the fire. Instead of harming them, these fires help in their regeneration by reducing coverage of broad-leaf trees, which leads to an increase in the land covered by chir pine and oak. The broad-leaved forest is dominated by oak species, including Banj oak (Quercus leucotrichophora). Resin is harvested from these pines, and fires are often intentionally set to remove the carpet of pine needles that come in the way of harvesting activity.[8] In June 1981, a blanket ban was introduced against the felling of standing trees 1000\u00a0meters above sea level, a ban that prohibits the removal of pine trees in the areas where they are invading. Apart from accidental fires, several causes and motivations for setting fires have been noted, which include encroachment on forest lands and concealing illegal timber extraction. Major illicit timber trade relies on pine forests since they are often used for construction.[7] A major cause of the fires was attributed to the record high temperatures and severe lack of rainfall due to a dry winter.[9] The Uttarakhand forest fires also came as India suffered one of its worst droughts in years, with the government noting that over 330 million were affected by water shortages.[10]"

        "content": "The forest fires began on February 2, 2016, and went initially unnoticed for several weeks,[11] while Parliament was in a state of outrage over the presidential rule which had been imposed on Uttarakhand[12] Consequently, these fires went largely unchecked and spread from the pine forests on the slopes of the sub-Himalayan region to the oak and broadleaf forests which resulted in heavy clouds of smoke that changed the usually blue skies to grey. This smoke affected tourism within the state and fearing bad publicity, the locals did not report the fires.[citation needed] The conservationist Ela Smetacek started a public awareness campaign to highlight the damage from the fires calling on the Indian government to address the issue. Her Facebook post was shared over 58,000 times as it showed the entire hillsides ablaze with walls of flames engulfing even the tallest trees.[13] The campaign gathered widespread support from social media users and Indian media which led to a series of claims and counter-claims between the environment minister, the conservationist, and other activists ensued, as Smetacek blamed the timber and builder mafia for the purposely-lit fires, stating that 1,300 fires could be seen from satellite pictures and that an arson attack across the state was evident.[14] The post demanding the fires be recognized as a national emergency, and the need of immediate deployment of NDRF teams, led to the government taking action, deploying the National Disaster Response Force and making use of Indian Air Force Mi-17 helicopters fitted with Helicopter bucket (bambi buckets) to douse the fires with water. Seven fatalities were reported as of 4\u00a0May\u00a02016[update].[3] The Pinegrove School, a boarding school at Kasauli, was evacuated as fires had reached its compound walls.[15] Tourism and wildlife at the Jim Corbett National Park and Rajaji Tiger reserve regions were affected.[16] Various other locations in these Himalayan states of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh are tourist attractions in summer, and they now face heavy air pollution.[17] The forest fires also disrupted the functioning of the Kalka\u2013Shimla Railway line.[18] On 3 May, the forest department estimated the monetary losses at approximately \u20b929 lakh (US$35,000). The estimate is based on the standard rule book followed by the department with empirical formulae for such calculations. Various ecologists and environmental activists have disregarded the estimate, noting that it does not take into account ecological and wildlife losses. They added that these fires have also destroyed vegetation which holds rainfall, which might result in floods in the monsoon season.[19] Scientists of the Govind Ballabh Pant Institute of Himalayan Environment and Development formed a team to survey the area and study the effects of the fires on the melting of glaciers.[20] Ecologists suggested that clearing of forest floors of the fallen pine leaves, which are readily combustible, should be undertaken by the forest department as well as locals on a grassroots level to prevent such major fire outbreaks. Production of biomass briquettes from these pine needles should be promoted, serving as a source of fuel as well as a solution to prevent wildfires.[21][22] On 30 April, the National Disaster Response Force was deployed for rescue operations in the Kumaon and Garhwal areas. Around 6,000 personnel from the Forest Department were deployed. As of 30\u00a0April\u00a02016[update], 922 incidences[spelling?] of fire were reported affecting around 2,000 hectares (4,900 acres) of forest area.[7] The Mi-17 helicopters of the Indian Air Force with  Helicopter bucket (bambi buckets) were used to douse the fires with water. However, the heavy smog that developed in the area affected the aerial operations of the army.[23] The affected area later increased to around 3,500 hectares (8,600 acres), extending into Himachal Pradesh. The regions saw rainfalls on 3 May ranging from 7mm to 11mm, which helped in controlling the fire.[3] Soaring temperatures reignited the forest fires on 18 May 2016 covering an area of nearly 180 hectares of green land spreading over 111 districts. Rangers and Divisional Forest Officers rush to the spot and extinguish the fire as soon as possible to reduce the damage done. This was the result of the temperatures of Uttarakhand which were about 4 to 5 degrees higher than the average temperatures at this time of the year. According to government sources, the forest fires combined have destroyed nearly 4,048 hectares of land, in 1,857 incidents.[1] Subsequently, the World Bank granted 500 crores rupees (US$75M) to the Uttarakhand forest department to research the cause of the forest fires, which was later increased[24] by \u20b9600 crores (US$90M).[25] The Indian central government later announced a series of funds amounting to over \u20b950,000 crores (US$7.5B) to go towards afforestation across the state of Uttarakhand and the country.[26]"

        "header": "Controversy and long term impact",
        "content": "Reports were published in the local media which variously blamed both the local people and timber companies for the forest fires. Environmental journalist Bahar Dutt blamed the television media for their \"Delhi centrist world view\" that disregarded the historical and ecological natural causes of fire, due to the high density of pine trees that increases the fire hazards.[27] Various tourism-related associations suggested that the exaggerated representation of the fires by the media could reduce tourism, a major part of the state economy. Part of a team of conservationists and biologists who studied the private and state forests since 1950, Smetacek maintained forest fires did not occur naturally in the geographical topography of the region concerned. Natural fires are not seen anywhere in Indian forests, she added. The introduction of pine trees by the British caused a more volatile fuel to the (man-made) fires.[28] Fires directly destroy biodiversity and have indirect long-term impacts, including the encouragement of fire and pioneer species. It has been suggested that the dark carbon dust emitted by the fires deposited on Himalayan glaciers could hasten the glaciers' melting. This could affect the hydrology of the rivers that are a source of water for human populations in northern India.[29] The average temperature of northern India saw an increase of 0.2\u00a0\u00b0C.[20] Concern over forest fires in Uttarakhand has been increasing in the country and Indian Supreme Court took cognizance of the issue and issued strict measures to be implemented by the centre and the state governments.[30]"

The blaze, also called the Great Thumb Fire, the Great Forest Fire of 1881 and the Huron Fire, killed 282 people in Sanilac, Lapeer, Tuscola and Huron counties. The damage estimate was $2,347,000[2] in 1881, equivalent to $74,100,455 when adjusted for inflation. The fire sent enough soot and ash up into the atmosphere that sunlight was partially obscured at many locations on the East Coast of the United States. In New England cities, the sky appeared yellow and projected a strange luminosity onto buildings and vegetation. Twilight appeared at 12 noon. September 6, 1881, became known as Yellow Tuesday or Yellow Day because of the ominous nature of this atmospheric event.[3]"

In 1917, Michigan purchased its first tractor for firefighting."

        "content": "A relatively cool and dry air mass was being pushed in from the north by means of a cold front, into warm and unstable air from the southern United States. Severe weather had already affected northeastern Ontario the evening before with this same cold front. During the late morning of the 7th the front had stalled across the Bruce Peninsula, where newer convection produced a couple of weak F1 tornadoes near the towns of Wiarton and Tara.[2] It has been speculated that a large outflow boundary associated with these particular storms may have interacted with the lake breeze fronts, thus resulting in the Woodstock and Stratford tornadic supercells later that day. The Ontario Storm Prediction Centre in Toronto issued a severe thunderstorm watch for southwestern Ontario at 3:40 pm. The first thunderstorms of the afternoon began forming over Lake Huron before coming ashore in southern Bruce County (Toll, 1980). Storm motion was primarily to the southeast, and as these storms quickly began to intensify, reports of large hail began to pour in. A severe thunderstorm warning was issued at 6:15pm for Oxford, Perth County and Waterloo Region (Toll, 1980). A broken line of intense thunderstorms propagated toward Highway 401 with the two most intense storms located near Stratford and Embro. At this point, a tornado touchdown was mere minutes away as they began to morph into the powerful supercell variety, possibly a result of convergence along the Lake Erie and Lake Huron breeze fronts."

        "content": "At 6:18pm, the supercell thunderstorm located near Stratford spawned a tornado a couple of kilometres south of that town. Moving to the southeast at approximately 60\u00a0km/h, it quickly became stronger and as it passed north of Hickson some twenty minutes later, its path had widened to 1 kilometre as the tornado attained F4 intensity. Farm homes and outbuildings along the path were leveled by the tornado. The path began to curve towards the east-northeast thereafter as the tornado began to weaken (Newark, 1979). It dissipated approximately four kilometres east of Bright at 6:56pm, after some 30 kilometres on the ground.[1] At around 6:52 pm, a separate supercell thunderstorm northeast of Embro dropped a tornado near the village of Golspie. As it approached the city of Woodstock within the next ten minutes, the tornado quickly widened to over half a kilometre and took on the appearance as a dark stovepipe or wedge tornado, not unlike those witnessed in the Midwestern United States (Grazulis, 1991). As many as 300 structures sustained damage in a four-kilometre track from Ingersoll Road through Sixth Avenue to Parkinson Road and approaching Highway 401. A church and a school near the intersection of Highway 401 and Norwich Avenue were both destroyed (Toll, 1980). Trees that remained standing were partially debarked and, in a few instances, straw and other small objects were found embedded into the trunks. Among some of the other oddities were a pond in Southside Park that was reportedly sucked dry by the tornado, and a fourteen-foot aluminum boat carried for almost a kilometre. Crossing Highway 401 it blew a tractor-trailer rig into the centre median, badly injuring the driver (Toll, 1980). After the tornado left Woodstock, it is suspected that the tornado grew to its maximum size. As it passed over the town of Oxford Centre (a hamlet of 250 at the time)[1] the damage path width had reached 1 kilometre. Within two minutes, thirty homes were destroyed, along with the local church and community centre in Oxford Centre (Toll, 1980). The towns of New Durham and Vanessa met a similar fate shortly thereafter, at 7:19 and 7:37pm respectively. A partially filled, forty-foot silo constructed of concrete six inches thick, toppled over on a farm somewhere between Oxford Centre and New Durham. The two deaths were in the New Durham area. A 51-year-old man was killed instantly after being thrown some 200 feet from his two-ton vehicle, and a woman died after being hit with flying glass (Toll, 1980). At this point, the funnel had been on the ground for over twenty minutes and was easily over a mile wide. During this stretch of the tornado's path, two vehicles on two separate farms were tossed nearly a kilometre. In addition to the powerful tornado at hand, hail the size of tennis balls fell north of its track, destroying entire tobacco fields on dozens of farms (Newark, 1979). Eyewitnesses also reported that the tornado was preceded by intense and nearly constant lightning unlike any they had seen before (Toll, 1980). Plowing southeastward, the tornado damaged several more homes in the north end of Waterford at 8:00pm before dissipating southeast of that town, after nearly 60 kilometres on the ground.[1] As this tornado was at its maximum intensity somewhere between Oxford Centre and Vanessa, eyewitnesses reported seeing a satellite tornado, which accompanied the main circulation (Toll, 1980). On the ground for twenty kilometres, this satellite vortex was comparatively weaker (probably of F0 or F1 intensity) and paralleled the Woodstock tornado track as it moved southeast. All thunderstorm activity in southwestern Ontario ended by 9:30pm as the cold front moved south of Lake Erie."

        "content": "Following the two violent tornadoes which hit Oxford County and surrounding area, over a thousand people were left homeless, 350 homes were rendered uninhabitable, and two people were dead in addition to 142 injuries.[3] Farmsteads over a century old were completely wiped off the map in some instances.[1] Given the immense amount of damage at hand, the number of people affected, and the relative lack of effective weather warnings, it is remarkable that so few were killed. In yet another remarkable twist, all manner of debris carried by the Woodstock tornado began appearing near the shores of Lake Erie (Toll, 1980). Canceled cheques, dollar bills, photographs, pieces of insulation, and even plywood were among some of the items discovered. The city of Woodstock was enduring a recession during the late 1970s and this tornado strained the already reduced municipal budget. Assistance manifested itself in a variety of ways during the following weeks and months. People made homeless found short-term residence with neighbours whose homes were less damaged. Ambulances from all over the region (Kitchener, Tillsonburg, London, St. Thomas, and Simcoe) converged on the towns and farms hit hardest by the tornadoes. Local Mennonites also played a significant role in the rebuilding process, with hundreds working tirelessly each day to repair the farming communities of Oxford Centre, New Durham, and Vanessa.[1] The local government and those of surrounding counties sent thousands of dollars in relief. The city of Toronto donated $50,000 with Brant County sending $25,000 and the town of Stratford giving $10,000 (Toll, 1980). Businesses also set up food and clothing drives for those who lost their homes. Local radio stations set up a 10-hour radio segment called Operation Rebuild which raised almost half a million dollars, a relatively large amount of money for the time. The London Free Press distributed a booklet immortalizing the disaster, aptly titled Tornado. Over 50,000 copies were sold for $2.00 each. The Government of Ontario also granted $9 million in relief funds by the end of the year (Toll, 1980)."

        "content": "The Stratford and Woodstock tornadoes were both rated on the Fujita scale as F4 tornadoes, the second-highest rating. Up until that time, an F4 tornado had not been recorded in southern Ontario since the May 1953 Sarnia Tornado. Following these 1979 tornadoes, there was another violent tornado outbreak in the Barrie and Grand Valley six years later. As of 2015 there hasn't been an F4 or higher storm that has struck southern Ontario. Comparing the 1953, 1979, and 1985 tornadoes, the Woodstock event was at least as damaging as the Sarnia one. In both instances, photographs display typical F4 damage to frame homes and farm outbuildings, where only piles of rubble remained. While it is unlikely that the 1979 storm was as powerful as the 1946 Windsor\u2013Tecumseh tornado (where it has been speculated that F5 damage took place), the most glaring difference was that of path width. Whereas the damage paths of the 1946, 1953, and 1985 tornadoes remained under one kilometre, the Woodstock one was more massive in size. In some cases its width approached one mile, likely making it one of the largest tornadoes documented in Canada alongside the July 1987 Edmonton tornado. Environment Canada places the 1979 Woodstock tornado as the eleventh worst in the country's history."

The tornado began in the Pilot Point area, where farm homes were shifted off of their foundations. The tornado widened and strengthened into a very violent F5 and swept away numerous farms west of Farmington and Howe. Later along the path, the tornado narrowed to around 60 yards (180\u00a0ft) wide as it tore through Sherman. 50 homes were destroyed in town, 20 of which were obliterated and swept away. An iron-beam bridge was torn from its supports and twisted into pieces, and one of the beams was driven several feet into the ground.[7][10] Bodies were found up to 400 yards (1,200\u00a0ft) from their home sites, and a trunk lid was carried for 35 miles (56\u00a0km). Headstones at a cemetery were shattered, and a 500-pound stone was carried for 250 yards. Trees in the area were completely debarked with some reduced to stumps, and grass was scoured from lawns in town.[10] At least 200 people were injured, and bodies of the victims were transported into the courthouse and a vacant building. Several bodies were recovered from a muddy creek.[11] 73 people were killed by this single tornado, one of the worst on record in North Texas and the Red River Valley region, in particular the Texoma region.

Damage in Seneca alone was estimated at $250,000 (1896 USD) where most of the homes, the fairgrounds and other small structures sustained at least heavy damage, if not complete destruction.[12][13][14] The damage path was two miles wide at Reserve, and only three buildings were left undamaged at that location. The tornado damaged 50 homes and destroyed 20 others on the north side of Sabetha. Many farms were entirely swept away along the path as well, some of which were reportedly left \"as bare as the prairie\".[7] The tornado continued into Nebraska, where four people died and damage occurred on the south side of Falls City.

Entire farms were leveled, and debris from homes was found up to 12 miles (19\u00a0km) away. Trees were completely debarked along the path as well, with even small twigs stripped bare in some cases. Homes were swept away in Thomas, including one that was obliterated with the debris scattered up to 10 miles away.

Twenty-two people were killed in Ortonville, ten in Oakwood, three in Thomas, four north of Oxford and three in Whigville with others in rural areas. Nine of the fatalities were in a single home in Ortonville.[16][17] Other killer tornadoes on that day touched down in Ogle County, Illinois (two different tornadoes) and Macomb & Tuscola Counties in Michigan.

At the time, this was the costliest tornado ever recorded in the United States. It was one of at least 18 tornadoes to occur that day[19] At least 137 people died as the tornado traversed the core of the downtown area, leaving a continuous, one-mile-wide (1.6\u00a0km) swath of destroyed homes, schools, saloons, factories, mills, churches, parks, and railroad yards in its wake. A few of the destroyed homes were all but completely swept away. Numerous trees were downed at the 36-acre (0.15\u00a0km2) Lafayette Park, and a barometer recorded a drop to 26.74 inHg (906 hPa) at this location.[20] After devastating the city of St. Louis, the tornado crossed the Mississippi River and struck the Eads Bridge, where a 2\u00a0in \u00d7\u00a010\u00a0in (51\u00a0mm \u00d7\u00a0254\u00a0mm) wooden plank was found driven through a 5\u204416\u00a0in (7.9\u00a0mm) wrought iron plate. Uncounted others may have died on boats on the river, which could have swept their bodies downriver where they could not be recorded in the official death toll. The tornado continued into East St. Louis, Illinois, where its path was narrower, but its strength became even more intense. Homes and buildings along the river were completely swept away and a quarter of the buildings there were damaged or destroyed. An additional 118 people were killed, 35 of whom were at the Vandalia railroad freight yards."

It was created in 1944. In mid-September 1967, during a prolonged drought, a fire of unknown causes was started in the park that lasted over a month and consumed 9,000 hectares of the reserve, managed by the State Forestry Institute (Instituto Estadual de Florestas - IEF).[4] Twelve people died in fighting the flames, after fighters led by Sergeant Agenor Almeida Costa were surrounded by a line of fire on October 18, near the Dom Helv\u00e9cio Lagoon. It is therefore the second largest forest fire in Brazil in number of fatalities, second only to the fire in Paran\u00e1 in 1963, which left 110 dead.[5][6] The fire was brought under control on October 24 after about 30 kilometers (km) of firebreaks were opened, but fires remained active for at least another week. Plantations in the vicinity and some homes were also affected. Despite the size of the native forest destroyed, the reserve's forests have not suffered another major fire and this has allowed the vegetation and soil to regenerate naturally."

Occasional fires occurred until then, but surveillance began to be intensified and deforested areas were reforested. On the other hand, there was no precedent for fire on the scale reached in 1967.[10][11]"

        "content": "Information from the time shows that the exact cause of the origin of the fire is unknown, but the first suspicions referred to the release of a cigarette tip, burned in some pasture that reached the conservation unit; purposeful motivation; or even spontaneous combustion because of the heat, in mid-September 1967.[4] Major Vicente Rodrigues, commander of the Rural Vigilance, believed that the front fire that started in Dion\u00edsio was caused by cigarette butts left on the side of the road, while the front fire in the region of Maring\u00e1 Farm, near the Doce River, on the border between Tim\u00f3teo and Ipatinga, may have been \"sabotage\" by timber smugglers, hunters and fishermen angry with the police inspections. Less than a year ago hunting and logging had been prohibited, and fishing was restricted to the Dom Helv\u00e9cio Lagoon and on weekends. During the fire one person was arrested setting fire to the forest near Maring\u00e1 Farm, but no further details were released.[12] Later the hypothesis of a cigarette was dismissed as the fire in Dionisio started in the middle of the forest. Suspicion returned to the charcoal ovens near the park, which possibly let off sparks.[10] According to information from the Ministry of the Environment, the fire would have started with a bonfire left by a tourist.[13] It is known for sure that the region faced a prolonged drought and a period of high temperatures, which contributed to the spread of the flames with the help of the wind.[10][14] At a rainfall station operated by the National Water Agency (Ag\u00eancia Nacional de \u00c1guas - ANA) in Coronel Fabriciano the only daily precipitation accumulations above 3 millimeters (mm) in the period from April 21 to November 17 were 21\u00a0mm on May 18 and 11\u00a0mm on September 14, but precipitation had been below average since January (the wet season runs from October to April).[15][16] Furthermore, the Rio Doce State Park surveillance team, consisting of ten soldiers, one corporal, and Sergeant Agenor Almeida Costa, was small compared to the size of the park.[4][12] If a spark started a fire in the middle of the forest it would hardly be noticed immediately, with enough time for fire proliferation.[10] Most of the fire started from the two fronts mentioned above. The first, which originated near Dionisio, came under control around October 9, but when it was almost extinct the second front started near Maring\u00e1 Farm on October 12. Shortly afterwards, a new front gained intensity again near where the first appeared.[12] At this point the situation became much worse,[4] with the appearance of other fire lines, the increase in heat and the intensification of winds, providing flames that reached 40 meters in height.[12] Another large front came to appear in the region of the Limoeiro Stream, in Tim\u00f3teo.[10] At times the flames advanced to 20 kilometers per hour.[4]"

        "content": "The lack of trained personnel and the absence of equipment contributed to the increase of the fire. Most of the firebreaks were being opened with hand axes and tree branches.[4] About 300 people were engaged in fighting the flames, the vast majority workers from the companies in the region (Usiminas, Acesita and Belgo-Mineira).[14] The companies also feared that the flames would reach eucalyptus plantations and charcoal installations that supply the furnaces of their industrial complexes.[12] However, there were still military personnel from the Fire Department, Military Police and Rural Vigilance.[14] On October 18, Sergeant Agenor, who had spent three days in the forest making firebreaks in the Dionisio region, was trying to return home after a brief reduction in fire activity. After traveling 2\u00a0km in his jeep, accompanied by soldier Cirilo, he spotted an intensification of flames and decided to return to fight them. Agenor formed a team of 12 combatants, who started to produce a firebreak around 1:30 pm; meanwhile, Cirilo left the area to summon other men. According to reports from Jos\u00e9 Lino, a worker for the Forestry and Agricultural Company (Companha Agr\u00edcola e Florestal - CAF) and the only survivor of the group, the fire began to advance at a rapid rate shortly afterwards, without enough time for everyone to evacuate the site properly. The smoke also made the men disoriented as they fled. As a result, 11 men burned to death on the spot (including Sergeant Agenor), one died from his wounds in the early morning of the 20th, and Jos\u00e9 Lino, although wounded, survived because he was able to reach a boat in the Dom Helv\u00e9cio Lagoon. Among the fatal victims, besides the sergeant, were employees of CAF, a subsidiary of Belgo-Mineira, and a forest ranger.[4][12] Over the course of October 19, the fire grew steadily, and by the morning of October 20, the two fronts were 30\u00a0km long;[14] the lines reached 40\u00a0km, 20\u00a0km each.[12] Also on October 20, a team of 87 firefighters from Belo Horizonte arrived in the region to help fight the blaze.[14] However, due to the lack of equipment, the soldiers were unable to work in the area and returned to the capital of Minas Gerais shortly afterwards.[4] For the firefighters involved, the only hope at this point was that it would rain heavily and there was a fear that the entire reserve would be consumed. Lieutenants Campos and Jos\u00e9 Luis suggested to Major Vicente that tractors be used, since entering the forest was becoming impossible.[12] On October 21 the governor of Minas Gerais Israel Pinheiro flew over the region, but could not see anything because of the smoke.[4] Take a good look. Now that we need rain, we don't know if it will come. And the lack of rain is caused precisely by the lack of forests; and a forest is being burned down without anyone being able to do anything about it."

This process also protected much of the eucalyptus plantations, about 20,000 hectares, but there was a risk of the fire reaching populated areas in Dion\u00edsio and Tim\u00f3teo if the wind blew strong and constant for 48 hours straight.[10] Despite the mitigation of the fire, flames were still active in the last days of the month,[17] but reports in November were that the fire had already ceased.[18]"

About 30 hectares of CAF's eucalyptus plantations were also burned.[4] Material damage was 1,500,000,000 Brazilian cruzeiros, which includes lost timber, neighboring plantations and houses in rural villages.[10] In 1969 a process of renovation and restructuring of the park was initiated by the state government to be opened to tourism,[20] which had been planned since before the fire. The park's forests did not suffer another major fire and this allowed natural regeneration of the vegetation and soil. Thus, the PERD has continued to be the largest Atlantic Forest reserve in the state and has significant relevance regarding conservation of regional natural resources.[21] Some trails open to tourists pass through areas affected by the 1967 event, such as \"Angico Vermelho\"[22] and \"Vinh\u00e1tico\",[23] and traces of the disaster are only noticed when shown by the guides.[24] Although fire monitoring has been intensified over the years,[9] the reserve is still not fully safeguarded from new occurrences.[11] In September 1993, a fire occurred that affected about 100 ha of native forest in Tim\u00f3teo.[25] Between September 20 and 24, 2019, a fire consumed 484.2 ha of the Rio Doce State Park between Marli\u00e9ria and Tim\u00f3teo.[26] During the 1967 fire three inquiries were opened: a military police to investigate the death of Sergeant Agenor, a military one to investigate the deaths of the other combatants, and another to investigate the causes of the fire.[4] Commander Agenor Almeida Costa, who died while fighting the flames, was honored with the name given to the 3rd Environmental Platoon of the Rio Doce State Park in Marli\u00e9ria, which was renamed the Sergeant Agenor de Almeida Costa Barracks on September 21, 2011. On the occasion his wife Romilda Andrade Costa and family members of other combatants were also honored under the presence of the Music Band of the 14th Military Police Battalion.[27]"

        "content": "According to The Economist, Lebanon's dysfunction and mismanagement which followed the protests, has originated in the country's sectarian political system codified by the Taif agreement, which took place in 1989. The Taif agreement enshrines a sect-based political system, where political authority is allocated based on the religious affiliation of the public servant. This system is perceived as exploited by the current Lebanese politicians, many of whom are Lebanese Civil War-era sectarian warlords who still occupy positions of power and enjoy amnesty against accountability.[25] Lebanon is a mosaic of various religious factions. It is composed of 18 different sects. The 18 officially recognized religious groups include four Muslim sects, 12 Christian sects, the Druze sect, and Judaism.[26] The outbreak of the protests was attributed to the accumulated crises within the preceding weeks in Lebanon. First, in Chouf and Saadiyat, among other places, fires propagated, scorching nearby homes, and placing many people in danger. A large portion of greenery, an aspect that makes Lebanon special, was burnt down as a result. The Lebanese government failed to employ its planes to extinguish the fires and had to rely on Cypriot aid.[27][28][29][30][31] Moreover, the prices of both oil and bread had been increasing as well as the rates of unemployment and poverty nationwide- in fact, the youth unemployment has reached 37% and the general unemployment  25% as of August 2019.[32] Since all of these issues are due to a lack of proper governance, the Lebanese people voiced out their opinions over the negative situation. Furthermore, Lebanese citizens were facing many problems in the preceding years, electricity cuts since 1975, and so obtaining 24-hour electricity in Lebanon has since been dependent on obtaining a deal with the country's \"generator mafia\", which operates a ring of contraband gasoline power generators that contribute to the high level of air pollution in Lebanese cities.[33] Lebanon has also not had access to drinking water except through purchased bottled water from private companies since the 1975\u20131990 Lebanese Civil War. Finally, the country suffers from deficient sanitation and sewage infrastructure, which led to the 2015 \"garbage crisis\" that sparked the 2015\u20132016 Lebanese protests.[34] Days before the protests began, a series of about 100 major wildfires in Chouf, Khroub and other Lebanese areas displaced hundreds of people and caused enormous damage to Lebanese wildlife. The Lebanese government failed to deploy its firefighting equipment due to lack of maintenance and had to rely on aid from neighboring Cyprus, Jordan, Turkey and Greece.[35][36] Protests started taking place in small numbers around Beirut towards the end of September.[37][38] Impetus for the revolutionary movement was apparent years before the protests began and was visible in Lebanon's arts and culture scene, as evidenced by pop artist Ragheb Alama's song \"Tar Al Balad\"[39] in December 2018 and rock singer-songwriter IJK's song \"Chedd Halak\"[40] in June 2019."

This was considered a short-term solution by economic analysts.[52] In a cabinet session held on 17 October, the government proposed strategies to increase state revenue for 2020. There were 36 items to be discussed, including the increase of Value Added Tax (VAT) by 2pp by 2021 and an additional 2pp by 2022, making it reach a total of 15%. Additionally, the media reported there were plans of a US$0.20 charge on Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) calls, such as ones made on FaceTime, Facebook and WhatsApp.[53] The final session of the budget draft was to be held on 19 October, but was canceled upon the agreement of Prime Minister Saad Hariri and President Michel Aoun.[54][55]"

One of his bodyguards shot stray bullets into the air, which further enraged the protesters, but no injuries were reported.[57] Walid Joumblatt, the leader of the Progressive Socialist Party, stated that he had spoken to minister Chehayeb- in fact, this minister represents the party in the Lebanese government- and so requested the bodyguards be handed over to the police, as all people are \"under the law\".[58][59] A large number of protesters began appearing in Martyrs Square, Nejmeh Square, and Hamra Street, as well as many other regions around Lebanon. As the protests grew bigger, Prime Minister Saad Hariri called a snap cabinet meeting at the request of President Michel Aoun for midday on 18 October.[60] An announcement was also made by Minister of Higher Education Akram Chehayeb that all schools and universities, public or private, would remain closed the next day.[61] The Minister of Telecommunications Mohamad Choucair announced that the \"WhatsApp tax\" idea had been scrapped at around 11:00PM.[62] Protesters saw the \"WhatsApp tax\" as the last straw, socially, politically and economically, against the entire political class, which was deemed corrupt and in need of immediate ousting. Protesters in Nabatiyeh and Tripoli, on 18 October, vandalized the offices of the Hezbollah, Amal Movement, and Free Patriotic Movement political parties in an expression of disillusionment and in protest against perceived government corruption.[63][64][65] Other protesters aimed to enter the Serail, which includes the Lebanese Parliament building, but were stopped by the use of tear gas from the Internal Security Forces.[66] protesters created roadblocks on the major roads of the country, using burning tires and trash cans to stop access.[67][68] Civil servants announced a strike with immediate effect through League of Public Sector Employees, arguing that the proposed reforms would \"undermine the rights of employees and pensioners in particular\".[69] A cabinet meeting was due to be held in the afternoon, but ministers of the Lebanese Forces announced that they would not attend.[70] The leader of the Forces, Samir Geagea, called for the resignation of the Prime Minister, due to the \"resounding failure to halt the deterioration of the [country's] economic situation\".[71] After this announcement, the cabinet meeting was canceled by the Prime Minister.[72] Leader of the Progressive Socialist Party, Walid Jumblatt, called for a \"calm and peaceful\" move against President Michel Aoun's mandate, and organized rallies in Aley, Bhamdoun, and Baakline to voice their opinions.[73] Pierre Issa of the National Bloc voiced a similar opinion, calling for a \"government of specialists, a government reduced from public safety\". However, he criticized the involvement of political parties within the protests and argued it should remain something for the citizens to do.[74] In the evening, Prime Minister Saad Hariri addressed the nation, giving his \"partners in government\" 72 hours to support the reforms. If they did not come to an agreement, he suggested he would take a \"different approach\".[75][76] He tweeted \"72 hours...\" right after the delivered speech.[77]"

However, he indicated that Hezbollah was against the government resigning and instead asked citizens to divert blame from Hariri's cabinet to the previous government, which was also to blame for the state of the economy.[80] As the protests carried on throughout the day, there were reports of Amal Movement militants harassing and opening fire on protesters in Tyre.[81] Protests were held around major European cities, as well as in North America and Australia, showing solidarity with the protesters in Lebanon.[82] Due to the mounting pressure from protesters, the Lebanese Forces announced their resignation from the cabinet. Samir Geagea, their leader, had previously blamed his opponents for \"obstructing the necessary reforms,\" but since declared his \"lack of confidence in the current cabinet.\" His party held four seats within the government: Minister of Labor Camille Abou Sleiman, Minister of Administrative Development May Chidiac, Deputy Prime Minister Ghassan Hasbani, and Minister of Social Affairs Richard Kouyumjian.[83] On 20 October, hundreds of thousands of protesters gathered in locations throughout the country, making it the largest demonstrations since 2005.[84] Gunfire was heard outside the Tripoli office of Firas Al-Ali, an associate of Hariri. None were injured with the clash, and security forces were quick to act.[85] At 6:00\u00a0pm, protesters across the country united to sing the national anthem together.[86] On 21 October, a general strike was called across the country demanding an end to the country's economic problems. Some protesters began clearing away demonstration debris in Beirut after a social media call to keep the streets tidy and clear.[87] In the afternoon, an emergency cabinet meeting was held. After the meeting, Prime Minister Hariri held a press conference in which he announced various economic reforms including halving the salaries of legislators and members of parliament, reducing the deficit by about US$3.4 billion in 2020 with the help of the Lebanese central bank and the banking sector, distributing financial aid to families living in poverty and giving US$160 million in housing loans.[84] These proposals were unsuccessful at quelling protests. At night, several motorcyclists hoisting Hezbollah and Amal Movement were recorded heading towards the protests in central Beirut but were intercepted by the Lebanese Army. Soon thereafter, Hezbollah and the Amal Movement denied any involvement with the motorcyclists.[88] Hariri met on 22 October with ambassadors from the United States, Russia, France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, and the European Union, along with representatives from China, the United Nations, and the Arab League. Hariri discussed planned reforms and stressed the importance of peaceful expression from the protesters. The representatives, who form the International Support Group for Lebanon, expressed support for economic reforms and protection of protesters, but urged the leaders of Lebanon to engage in open dialogue with the country's citizens.[89] On 23 October, Hariri held a meeting with the ministerial committee in charge of financial and economic reforms, discussing a draft law on the recovery of public money and requesting suggestions on it from the Supreme Judicial Council within ten days.[90] In the evening, Hariri also held a meeting with members of the Progressive Socialist Party to discuss the latest developments in the country.[91] Sheikh Akl of the Lebanese Druze community called for government dialogue to safeguard the rights of liberty, security and stability.[92] President Michel Aoun addressed the population on 24 October, stating his willingness to hold a dialogue with the protesters and find the best solution forward. He supported Hariri's reforms but did confirm a need to \"review the current government\" within the \"state institutions\", and not through protesting.[93] Hariri supported this review through Lebanon's \"constitutional mechanisms\", but the protesters rejected any calls for dialogue until the government has resigned.[94]"

Small scuffles broke out in central Beirut between protesters and Hezbollah supporters. One protester was injured.[95] A report by Standard & Poor's downgraded its credit assessment of Lebanon to \"CreditWatch negative\" due to the government's low creditworthiness and economic pressures relating to the reforms. The country's banks remained closed.[96][97] Hezbollah supporters again clashed with protesters in downtown Beirut, chanting in support of Hezbollah's General Secretary, Hassan Nasrallah.[98] Nasrallah held a speech in the evening, calling his supporters to leave the streets.[99][100] Within this speech, he praised the protesters for achieving economic reforms, but suggested that they were being exploited by local and foreign agents to start a civil war within the country.[101] Nasrallah also strongly suggested that the protests are part of an Israeli and American plot.[102] A security meeting was held on 26 October in Yarzeh to discuss how the safety and free movement of protesters could be ensured.[103] Lebanese Forces leader Samir Geagea once more criticized the lack of response from the government towards the protesters' concerns.[104] Meanwhile, thousands of Lebanese gathered in over thirty cities around the world on 26 and 27 October including Sydney, Paris, Houston and London in a show of support[citation needed]. Tens of thousands of individuals took part in a \"human chain\" which was held on 27 October at the coastlines from the Northern city of Tripoli to the southern city of Tyre \u2013 encompassing 171\u00a0km (106\u00a0mi) \u2013 organized with the intention to show the unity of the Lebanese people.[105][106][107] The Maronite Patriarch Bechara Boutros al-Rahi during a Sunday sermon in Bkerk\u00e9 considered that the people are living their positive and reformist revolution.[108] Pope Francis addressed the Lebanese people expressing their struggle in the face of challenges and social, moral and economic problems of the country, expressing he's praying that Lebanon can continue to be a place of peaceful coexistence, and urging the Lebanese government to listen to the concerns of the people.[109] Black-clad[102] Hezbollah and Amal Movement supporters attacked protesters in Beirut on 29 October, tearing down and setting fire to the tents set up by the protesters, throwing plastic chairs, and beating anti-government protesters.[110] Many among the angry mob chanted: \"God, Nasrallah, and the whole Dahyeh,\" in reference to the southern suburb that is a stronghold of the Iranian-backed militant group. They also chanted, \"Shia, Shia\", as a reverential reference to the country's Shiite Muslim sect.[102] The Hezbollah and Amal Movement supporters also attacked TV crew members and destroyed live broadcasting equipment for the MTV (Lebanon) and Al Jadeed television channels, claiming that they were upset at the roadblocks and insults to their leader.[111] Public squares across Beirut filled with protesters shortly after.[112] Prime Minister Saad Hariri announced his resignation in a televised address on the afternoon of 29 October. Several hours after the resignation of the Prime Minister, celebrations swept the nation with demonstrators cautiously welcoming the resignation celebrated through fireworks, songs, and releasing flagged colored balloons.[113] On 30 October, tear gas was fired at protesters in the northern district of Akkar by the Lebanese Army trying to reopen the roads. Protesters also blocked roads in the southern city of Sidon and Bekaa Valley. In Central Beirut, dozens of protesters blocked the \"Ring Bridge\" while a big crowd returned to Tripoli's al-Nour Square to protest. The Lebanese Army intervened in many regions to prevent escalation.[114][115] Later that evening a statement released from the Presidential Office said that Lebanese President Michel Aoun will address the nation the next day.[116] President Aoun delivered a speech on 31 October[117] in which he spoke about Lebanon's economic and financial crisis. He also spoke about his commitment to fighting corruption, ensuring political stability, eliminating terrorists, and the return of Syrian refugees within the country. He also promised the new government will be made up of specialists instead of political loyalists.[118] Protesters took to the streets and blocked roads across the country almost immediately after President Aoun's address to the nation, demanding early parliamentary elections and the formation of a technocratic government. Demonstrators shut off roads in cities nationwide \u2013 including Sidon, Bekaa, and Khaldeh \u2013 with burning tires or by the sheer volume of protesters. In Tripoli, thousands of protesters started to gather at Al-Nour Square while in Beirut, protesters blocked the George Haddad highway which connects the waterfront road to the \"Ring Bridge\". The Lebanese Army and riot police were deployed across the country in an effort to reopen the roads.[119][120]"

Corporate banking activity was similarly heavily restricted, and international bank transfers from Lebanon were halted almost completely, subject to manual per-transfer approval.[citation needed] Hezbollah's Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah offered a public speech in which he stated that Hezbollah feared a government overthrow, due to the consequent \"vacuum\" Lebanon would experience.[122] Nasrallah's then-latest speech was perceived to be unclear on whether Hezbollah supported or opposed the nationwide revolutionary movement. Nasrallah again shed doubt on the motivations of the protesters during his speech, implying that they were being manipulated by foreign influences.[123] As Lebanese schools universities remained closed during the protests, public teach-ins and debates, organized by secular political groups and advocacy organizations (Beirut Madinati, Libaladi, Lihaqqi and others) were offered in Beirut.[124] On 3 November, thousands of Lebanese Free Patriotic Movement supporters attended a protest in support of President Michel Aoun, the founder of the party. During the protest, FPM leader Gebran Bassil made a personal statement for the first time in over 13 days.[126] Bassil claimed \"We should block roads for MPs who refuse corruption-combating laws, politicians who escape accountability and judges who do not implement the law.\" He also demanded lifting banking secrecy on political officials' accounts and insisting accountability, as well as a return of misused or stolen public funds.[127] In the afternoon, tens of thousands of anti-government protesters flooded the streets across Lebanon in a \"Sunday of unity\".[128] Protesters gathered for the third consecutive Sunday since mass anti-government demonstrations began on 17 October, filling the streets and central squares of major cities including Beirut, Tripoli and Tyre. Dozens of main roads were closed by burning tires, mounts of sand, and by the sheer amount of protesters, despite an ongoing threat of violence from political-party opposition. Acts of violence from party rivals consisted around Lebanon, such as the attacks on protesters in Beirut blocking public roads.[129][130] These attacks were presumed to be affiliated with Hezbollah.[131] A candlelight vigil was held on 4 November in Baalbek in memorial of those who have perished in the Lebanese protest,[132] while physical tensions from road blocking persisted in Beirut.[133] On 5 November, some students of American University of Science and Technology in Beirut showed attendance in protest and were met with harsh engagement from soldiers of the Lebanese Armed Forces. General Directorate of General Security officers were recorded verbally threatening students that were recording the protests.[134] Protesters in Nabatieh, shut down companies such as OGERO, Liban Post, Banque du Liban and several banks[citation needed] despite state-exerted political pressure towards the protesters in this region.[135] Protesters were present outside electrical company buildings, frustrated with decades of inconsistent power and common outages.[136] Thousands of students across Lebanon protested on 6 November in front of universities and schools refusing to attend classes until their demands are met.[137] Several student-led movements have been organized since the start of the protests, in demand of a financial student contract, the reversal of the decision to charge tuition fees to the dollar currency in some universities, independent student councils in each university, and a well-funded Lebanese University. On the national scale, they have been asking for social, political, and economic reform, in hopes of finding respectable job prospects after graduation without nepotism or sect bias. Pension and retirement plans are also being demanded, as well as proper health care coverage.[138] In the afternoon, protesters began to gradually grow across Lebanon and started protesting by the thousands in front of key governmental and private institutions and forced some of them to close their doors.[139]"

Suleiman Haroun, the head of the Lebanese Syndicate of Hospitals, said that medical stocks in the country \"will not last more than a month\" unless a solution is found.[140] During the weekend, news spread of a planned parliamentary legislative session on 12 November that would include a proposed general amnesty law, which could grant current and past members protection against prosecution for crimes such as corruption and misuse of public funds. In response, protesters called for a general strike to be held on the same day, and published a list of demands which included bolstering guarantees for a speedy trial, working towards a solution for the economic crisis, guaranteeing the independence of the judiciary, and investigating the misuse of public funds.[141][142] On 11 November, the Lebanese Federation of Syndicates of Bank Employees called for a general strike for its 11,000 members over \"concerns for safety\". This strike is unprecedented in the country's history and its impact is unclear. No end date was specified for the strike, and a general closure of all Lebanese banks may very well be the result.[143] Riad Salameh, the governor of Lebanon's central bank (Banque du Liban) gave a press conference in which he denied the possibility of capital control on the Lebanese economy, assured that a \"haircut\" on large accounts is not a possibility, and repeated that the central bank's priority remains on economic stability and confidence in the Lebanese pound. When asked about the strike by the bank staff union announced earlier in the day, Salameh claimed to have not yet heard of it.[144] A few minutes after Salameh's press conference, Speaker of Parliament Nabih Berri appeared on live television to announce that the following day's parliamentary session had been delayed until 19 November 2019, possibly as a response to protests called for during the weekend against the proposed general amnesty bill that was due to be discussed. Berri claimed the postponement was for \"security reasons\".[145] In the afternoon, Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah gave a speech in which he made strong overtures towards a corruption investigation to be led by Lebanon's judiciary, offering for Hezbollah to collaborate fully with any such investigation and calling for a \"strong, independent judiciary\" to equally investigate all Lebanese parties without reservation.[146] Nasrallah also called for banking secrecy and any prior amnesty for public representatives to be lifted, \"dating back to 1992\". On 12 November, speaker of Parliament Nabih Berri was reported to have sent resigned Prime Minister Saad Hariri a pot of Leben, a traditional Lebanese dairy product, along with a note that promised \"eternal enmity\" if Hariri refused to form a new government. Hariri thanked Berri for the Leben but excused himself as having ceased eating all kinds of milks and cheeses due to lactose intolerance, concluding that \"indeed, the state of the country itself requires a new political diet or \"regime\", so to speak\". The unusual exchange was covered in Lebanese media.[147] President Michel Aoun gave a live interview at 8:30\u00a0pm, during which he rejected calls for a fully technocratic government, warned against a run on the bank further damaging the economic sector, and called for an immediate end to the protests to prevent a \"catastrophe\". Aoun accused protesters of \"stabbing the nation with a dagger\" and accused protesters that blocked roads of \"violating international law\". Aoun also stated that \"anyone who cannot find faith in the current Lebanese government can leave Lebanon and live somewhere else\".[148] Aoun's interview proved exceedingly unpopular with the protest movement, which began blocking an unprecedented number of arterial roads in Beirut and across Lebanon before the interview was even concluded including Qob Elias,[149] \"Ring Bridge\",[150] Dahr el Baidar,[151] Jiyyeh,[152] Nahr el Kalb,[153] Neemeh,[154] Beddawi,[155] Abdeh, Mahmara, Braqil,[156] Madina Riyadiyya,[157] Verdun,[158] Jal el Dib,[159] Hasbaya,[160] the Palma highway,[161] Aley,[162] Cola,[163] Dawra,[164] Sayyfi,[165] Corniche al Mazraa,[166] and Sassine.[167] Alaa Abou Fakhr,[5] a Lebanese national, was shot and killed in Khalde at the ensuing protests. Protesters began appearing in the early morning of 13 November near the heavily fortified Baabda Presidential Palace to express dissatisfaction with President Aoun's speech a few hours earlier and picked up in pace as the day progressed.[168] Activist and protester Khaldoun Jaber was released on 14 November after being detained by the Lebanese army in Baabda the previous day in mysterious circumstances. Jaber was shown to have marks of physical abuse upon his release, which he claimed were due to torture by the army during his detention. Jaber also claimed to have been exposed to psychological abuse.[169] During his detention, Jaber was not given access to a lawyer with even the location of his detention being kept secret. The reason for his arrest was unclear, with some sources claiming it was due to attempting to cross a security perimeter during the previous day's protest near Baabda Palace.[170]"

Hospitals are running out of medical supplies and equipment because they are 100% reliant on imported supplies and equipment.[171] Due to the shortage of US currency in Lebanon, banks have not been able to transfer funds in US dollars to the companies who import these supplies.[171] Suppliers now have to turn to exchange houses in order to get their US dollars, which end up charging significantly higher rates than the official rate of $1 to \u00a3L1,507.5, only if they had any dollars to sell.[174] Suppliers have also not been paid by the hospitals as a result of the situation. If this continues, hospitals will only have one month before they run out of their current shelf stock.[171] Hospitals have received no payment since the beginning of 2019 and salary reductions are being considered in many hospitals if the situation does not improve.[174] Beirut Bar Association elections were held on 17 November. The independent candidate, Melhem Khalaf, won the majority vote (2,341 votes) to become the BBA's Council president and the first independent candidate to win against politically affiliated candidates in decades. Khalaf's contenders were Nader Gaspard, Saadeddine Al Khatib, and Ibrahim Moussallem. Pierre Hanna, who was backed by the Lebanese Forces, Progressive Socialist Party and the Future Movement, as well as twelve other candidates who either dropped out or were not voted in, competed for council positions.[175] Parliament was set to hold two sessions in the morning of 19 November, including a legislative session that was opposed by protesters, due to it timetabling a controversial amnesty law that was perceived as potentially granting amnesty to crimes committed by the political class, such as misappropriation of public funds or corruption. The sessions were originally planned for 12 November but were already once postponed due to protests. 58 out of 128 Members of Parliament were boycotting the session, but that number was not sufficient to prevent a quorum. A human chain was planned around the Lebanese Parliament to prevent Members of Parliament from entering the premises and to thereby force the session to be postponed.[176] Protesters began gathering early in the morning. Convoys for some Members of Parliament were recorded shooting live bullets or speeding into crowds in an attempt to disperse protesters.[177] Many protesters were gravely injured. At around 11:20am, the Secretary-General of the Lebanese Parliament Adnane Daher confirmed to local media that both parliament sessions were postponed indefinitely. This was perceived as a victory by protesters.[178] Lebanese banks reopened for the first time since 11 November after the Lebanese Federation of Syndicates of Bank Employees ended its strike.[179] President Michel Aoun gave a speech on 21 November, on the eve of Lebanese Independence Day, in which he called for an end to protests and \"hateful language on the streets\" and promised an \"anti-corruption cabinet\". Protesters expressed dissatisfaction with the speech by resuming the closing of roads.[180]"

        "content": "Lebanon's 76th Independence Day was celebrated on 22 November 2019 with the nation's first-ever civil parade, which was organized by civil society groups in Beirut's Martyr's Square. An invite-only private military parade had been held in the early morning by the Lebanese government, and the civil parade was intended as a rebuke against the government organized by the \"true Lebanese\": the parade had \"battalions\" representing different groups from Lebanese society, including cooks, schoolteachers, retired military personnel, pharmacists, engineers, women's rights activists, bankers, athletes, performance artists and more. The civil parade coincided with a program of festival activities organized by independent groups, which included dancing and heat lantern lighting. Marches were held across the Beirut region in the morning, all arriving to the civil parade in central Beirut.[181][182][183] On 23 November, five youths, including children aged 12 and 15, were detained by Lebanese military intelligence after taking down a banner that supported the Free Patriotic Movement, which is the party of President Aoun. Their detention was reported to the media by their families, and the children were released past midnight after the intervention of volunteer lawyers.[184] A protest was held on 24 November outside the United States embassy in Lebanon to express opposition to U.S. interference in Lebanon. The protest came after Hezbollah accused the United States in meddling with and delaying the formation of a new cabinet, and after comments made by U.S. ambassador Jeffrey Feltman in which he said that \"reactions to [Hezbollah] by Lebanese leaders and institutions fortunately coincide with U.S. interests\".[185][186] Around noon, another protest was held across the Lebanese coastline to draw attention to the high level of environmental pollution in Lebanon.[187] Right before midnight, pro-government Hezbollah and Amal Movement supporters violently clashed with protesters in the \"Ring\" bridge and Jal el Dib areas, demanding an end to road blocks imposed by protesters. This came after protesters apparently physically assaulted two people after suspecting them of being Hezbollah supporters.[188] The Hezbollah/Amal supporters burned civil society tents, trashed cars, and caused damage to public and private property. The Lebanese army intervened with tear gas and flash grenades hours later, dispersing one of the most violent evenings since the beginning of the protests.[189][190] At around noon on 25 November, Hussein Chalhoub and his sister-in-law Sanaa al-Jundi died after their car hit a makeshift roadblock used by protesters to cut off access to the Jiyyeh highway. This inflamed tensions between protesters and pro-government Hezbollah/Amal Movement supporters.[6] J\u00e1n Kubi\u0161, the United Nations Special Coordinator for Lebanon, issued multiple statements on Twitter warning against escalating confrontation between protesters and Hezbollah/Amal Movement supporters.[191][192][193][194] Later in the afternoon, pro-government Hezbollah and Amal Movement supporters began roving around Beirut, Tyre and other cities on mopeds and motorbikes, shouting taunts and provocations at protesters. Some physical clashes ensued, and the confrontations continued to occur sporadically until later in the evening.[195][196] Resigned Prime Minister Saad Hariri formally announced on 26 November that he would not run again for the position.[197] Meanwhile, businessman Samir Khatib announced that he was \"ready to form a new government\", and seemed to accrue some level of endorsement from political parties.[198] President Michel Aoun announced that binding consultations to designate a new Prime Minister would be held on 28 November.[199] Overnight, clashes occurred all around Lebanon. In Baalbek, Hezbollah/Amal Movement supporters destroyed protester's tents and also their sound system.[200][201] In Bikfaya, Free Patriotic Movement (the party of sitting President Michel Aoun) supporters organized a protest in front of the home of former president Amin Gemayel. They clashed with Kataeb Party (Gemayel's party) supporters, which led to injuries and the destruction of private property until the Lebanese army intervened.[202][203] Clashes also occurred in Chyah and Ein Rummaneh. The Lebanese Red Cross claimed that dozens of people were injured including one female FPM activist injured to the head,[204] while the Lebanese army said that at least 16 people were detained for their involvement in the clashes.[205] On 27 November, Lebanon's Syndicate of Gas Station Owners announced that an open-ended strike would begin the next day to highlight the \"size of the losses sustained by the sector due to the presence of two-dollar [rates] in the Lebanese market.\"[206] Hundreds of Lebanese mothers led a \"mother's march\" in Chyah to protest against sectarian violence on 26 November between youths.[207] Sources at the Lebanese Ministry of Finance claimed to local media that the Lebanese Central Bank was scheduled to repay US$1.5 billion in Eurobond debt which matures on 28 November, putting to rest speculation that Lebanon could default on its debt. However, Lebanon still has outstanding Eurobond debt due in 2020, and media sources noted that the path towards refinancing necessary to handle that debt is unclear without a cabinet.[208][209][210] A protest occurred in front of the Lebanese Central Bank and other government administrative and judiciary institutions.[211] Arab League ambassador Hossam Zaki formally expressed \"readiness\" to help solve the political and economic crisis in Lebanon for the first time since the beginning of the protests.[212]"

According to local media, Fleity committed suicide because he was unable to provide for his family after losing his job. His suicide sparked a large outcry of anger online.[217] Protesters resumed blocking roads on 4 December following politicians' apparent consensus on designating Samir Khatib as the next prime minister.[218]"

The Coalition For Women In Journalism, which has a special focus on women journalists, documented several attacks. \"Covering large protests in many parts of the Middle East has always been so hard for women journalists \u2014 we remember the many terrible incidents that happened during the Arab Spring. Following which over the years we have seen many journalism support organizations and others in the industry to train and equip women reporters to be able to take precautions on the ground. But the scope of these attacks are now changing and diversifying.\" the organization's founding director Kiran Nazish said. \"Unfortunately this is an ever more precarious situation and it is important to point out to Lebanese authorities that they have a responsibility to protect the press. Not doing so or doing the opposite is rather reckless,\" Kiran added.[223] On 8 December, Samir Khatib withdrew as candidate for prime minister after failing to get enough backing from the Sunni Muslim parties in parliament.[224] With Khatib's withdrawal, Saad Hariri became the only candidate for prime minister once again. Protesters then gathered outside parliament to condemn Hariri's candidacy and demand an independent candidate.[225] Following days of heavy rainfall, a house collapsed on 10 December in Tripoli, killing two adult siblings.[226] Protesters, claiming that the house collapsed due to consistent municipal negligence, stormed the Tripoli municipal police office and demonstrated outside the house of the mayor. They smashed windows, set a room on fire, and damaged a car. The army intervened to stop the violence.[227] In Jounieh, four protesters were detained after attempting to block roads. They were released the same evening after another protest blocked the Jounieh highway.[228] In Beirut, protesters organized demonstrations outside the houses of current and former public works ministers. While attempting to reach the home of former public works and transportation minister Ghazi Zaiter, they were blocked at Rue Verdun by men dressed in uniforms of the Internal Security Forces. Cars were vandalized as the men dragged protesters out to beat them; a dozen people including reporter Paula Naufal were hospitalized for their injuries.[229] Protesters in Tripoli resumed blocking roads on 11 December.[230]"

According to the Lebanese Civil Defense, 46 people were treated for injuries and another 14 were hospitalized.[236] A group of counter-protesters, themselves supporters of Amal and Hezbollah, also briefly clashed with protesters until the army intervened.[237] Roads were blocked in northern Lebanon on 16 December. At noon, President Aoun delayed scheduled parliamentary consultations, where Saad Hariri was widely expected to be renamed prime minister. This was because Hariri was now no longer being supported by the main Christian parties in parliament.[238][239] At night, protesters gathered close to Saad Hariri's Beirut residence to reject his reappointment.[240] A separate group of protesters descended upon Beirut as well, expressing outrage at a month-old video of an ex-pat insulting several Shi'a religious leaders. Amal and Hezbollah released statements asking the men to fall back, but these calls were not immediately heeded.[241] Protest encampments in several places, including Beirut, Saida and Nabatieh, were ransacked and destroyed during the night. At least two cars in Beirut were set on fire.[242][243] On 18 December, Hariri announced that he did not want to be reappointed prime minister, calling on the president to designate a new Prime Minister immediately.[244] Later that day, Al Jadeed claimed that the remaining candidates for Prime Minister were now Tammam Salam (the 34th Prime Minister, 2014\u20132016), jurist Nawaf Salam (former representative of Lebanon to the United Nations), Khaled Mohieddin Qabbani (former Minister of Justice, 2005\u20132008) and academic Hassan Diab (former Minister of Education, 2011\u20132014).[245] Diab was the apparent favorite, because he had the support of Hezbollah and Amal.[246][247] Protests continued in Nabatieh and Kfar Remen despite threats of retaliation by Hezbollah and Amal supporters. Cement walls and blocs were erected around Beirut's central district, blocking off streets leading to and from Riad Al Solh Square as well a parliament.[248] Parliamentary consultations took place on 19 December and Hassan Diab was designated as the next prime minister to succeed Hariri.[249] The announcement of Diab becoming prime minister was immediately followed by street protests and road blocks in Tripoli and Beirut.

Abou Fakhr's death appeared to have been unprovoked, as he was unarmed and attending the protest with his wife and child. The Lebanese Army released a statement saying that his death occurred as an accident after a soldier fired shots purely with the intent to clear a path for an army convoy and that the soldier had been referred to military court for a trial.[259][260] However, during Abou Fakhr's funeral ceremony the next day, his wife, who was present with Abou Fakhr during his shooting, claimed that he was killed by Lebanese military intelligence.[261] Abou Fakhr's death was the first to be caused by the Lebanese army.[262] A video circulating on social media appeared to show a plainclothes man who drove a civilian automobile shooting Abou Fakhr at close range.[263] Abou Fakhr was a member of the Municipal Committee of Choueifat as a representative of the Lebanese Progressive Socialist Party. Walid Jumblatt, the party's leader, appeared among protesters to call for calm after mounting animosity towards the Lebanese army, urging that \"the state is our only refuge or else we will descend into chaos\".[264] Abou Fakhr's death triggered a substantial increase in protest activity, with reported clashes with army forces and additional roads being barricaded in protest. Tributes and candlelight vigils were held for Abou Fakhr across Lebanon and were attended by thousands of protesters, who came to perceive him as symbolizing a martyr for the revolutionary movement. Abou Fakhr's family received condolences from virtually every Lebanese political faction.[265] On 13 November 2019, the Lebanese Army announced that the suspected killer, First Adjutant Charbel Hjeil, had been referred to the military judiciary to await trial after the conclusion of the army's interrogation process.[266] A massive funeral procession was held in the evening with tens of thousands of attendees, with Abou Fakhr's coffin carried throughout Beirut.[267] On 21 November 2019, the Lebanese Army announced that First Adjutant Charbel Hjeil was charged with the murder of Alaa Abou Fakhr. The Colonel on the scene, Nidal Daou, also received unspecified charges. Sources claimed that Daou and Abou Fakhr were acquainted prior to the murder, implying a personal motive.

Lebanon's minister of information also added that the law is expected to be applicable to members of parliament, ministers, as well as public officials.[338][339] As the exchange rate of US dollar-Lebanese pound reached \u00a3L2,600 on Thursday, hundreds of demonstrators took to the streets in Antelias and Beirut, demanding for the government to find a solution, as well as to hold early elections.[340] Considering the current economic situation in Lebanon, a judge has reportedly halted an order of assets freezing of 20 banks, including their directors. The judge explained the reason for suspending the order, stating that he wants to first learn how the order could affect Lebanon's current economic position.[341][342] On 7 March, Prime Minister Hassan Diab said that Lebanon would default on a Eurobond repayment and pursue restructuring its debt. The country has never before defaulted. Lebanon's government debt is about 170% of its yearly gross domestic product. Several Analysts have added that only the IMF's support could be the solution to Lebanon's financial crisis after the default.[343][344] However, hundreds of protesters have reportedly continued their rally which commenced earlier on Thursday, in several cities across the country including Sidon, as they criticise against the financial policies and poor standard of living in the country.[345] On 9 March, Prime Minister Hassan Diab announced that Lebanon had defaulted on a $1.2 billion Eurobond, for the very first time in the history of the country.[346] On 10 March, the restriction on deposits due to shortage of foreign currency was reduced by a public prosecutor, as he consented to rules for commercial banks, targeted at defending depositor's rights. The decision was verified by an official at the office of the public prosecutor, even though no additional comment was given.[347][348] Amid fears of the further spread of coronavirus in Lebanon, on 15 March, the government decided to put in place a state of emergency, leaving its crippling economy in a stalemate.[349] The decision was reached after several hours of an emergency cabinet meeting which resulted to the closure of its land borders, seaports and Rafic Hariri International Airport in Beirut.[350] According to Reuters, the closure which commenced on Wednesday, is expected to be in place until 29 March, so as to enable the state of health emergency that has been set up, to tackle the virus effectively.[351] On 23 March, the Lebanese government decided to stop paying back all debts in foreign currencies, in light of the fall in foreign currency reserves and worsening financial and economic crisis. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused many businesses to be closed down, including a severe impact on the foreign sector, which influenced the government's new decision.[352][353] The Lebanese finance ministry added that the country is planning on reaching reasonable understanding with its creditors immediately.[354] On 27 March, camps in Martyrs Square in central Beirut, which has been mostly occupied by protesters since October 2019, were reportedly cleared by Lebanon's security forces, according to the National Post. The security forces engaged the Martyrs Square in the evening after the Lebanese cabinet had imposed a curfew.[355][356] The decision to remove the camps was made amid growing concerns over the further spread of coronavirus, according to the Lebanese government.[357] However, protesters claimed that the police neither informed or gave them a notice, instead, they instructed them to quickly vacate the protest site. A protester added that there were only about 50 to 60 of them remaining when the security forces invaded the camps, as most of the protesters had evacuated the camps following the closure of seaports and airport of Beirut by the Lebanese government on 18 March, according to the Al-Monitor.[358][359] Activists and journalists in Lebanon have expressed their concerns on the suspicion that the Lebanese government might be using the COVID-19 pandemic as an excuse to make its powers even stronger.[360]"

The president made the call during a meeting of the International support group for Lebanon, in which he particularly asked the governments of the International community to make available $11 billion which they had pledged for during a conference in Paris, April 2018.[362][363] Aoun also maintained that the country is solely relying on the financial aid which is to be dedicated in executing infrastructure projects, as they have gone into an unforeseen economic recession.[364] On 7 April, just a day after security forces stopped an escape attempt in Tripoli's prison in northern Lebanon, heavy protests erupted amid fears of the spread of coronavirus.[365] At least four inmates were reportedly injured when security forces fired rubber bullets in an attempt to disperse the crowd.[366] According to CNN, American citizens living in Lebanon have rejected the offer made by the US government to return them back to the US, due to the drastic increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in America. The offer was given to both citizens and permanent residents on a chartered flight at the cost of $2,500 for each individual.[367][368] On 21 April, several protesters in Lebanon returned to the streets again in large car convoys, gathering around the complex where MPs convened in order to pass several laws on Tuesday. Many protesters were sighted waving Lebanon's flag while putting on protective gear like medical masks and hand gloves as a preventive measure against the Coronavirus.[369][370] Due to the worsening economic condition, COVID-19 lock-down and the Lebanese government's inability to enact policies that would curb the situation, protesters were threatening to resume protests nationwide, Xinhuanet reported.[371] Prime minister Hassan Diab disclosed after the session that the reforms plan by the government is scheduled to be discussed next week.[372] On 27 April, large clashes in Tripoli between the army and protesters resulted in one protester being killed.[8] 40 troops were injured, and many banks in Tripoli were set on fire or had their windows smashed due to the currency's rapid devaluation. Molotov cocktails had been thrown at an army vehicle and at least 5 banks in the city in the previous days, and heavy gunfire was heard.[373] The next day, all banks in Tripoli announced their temporary closure until security has been restored, as they have been the targets attacks and rioting.[374] Protests also took place in Sidon on 27 April.[373] On 28 April, large protests erupted in Tripoli for a 2nd consecutive night, along with other demonstrations in Beirut, Sidon, Nabatieh, Bekaa Valley, and Akkar, in defiance of the lockdown to contain COVID-19 in Lebanon. Over a dozen banks and cash machines across the country were either torched with Molotov cocktails or vandalized. The military expressed regret over the killing of a protester the night before and opened an investigation into the death. A funeral procession for the deceased protester in Tripoli took place.[375][376] On 29 April, small protests continued for the third night. In the northern city of Tripoli, protesters lobbed fireworks and stones at soldiers who pushed them back with rubber bullets. In the southern city of Sidon, demonstrators set a central bank building ablaze with petrol bombs for a second night.[377] After a series of protests that turned into violence, the government of Lebanon on 30 April, approved the long-awaited plan to save the country's economy from the brink of collapse. Prime Minister Hassan Diab maintained that the Lebanese government intends to use the plan in applying for an IMF programme that would facilitate the revival of the economy which is projected to be in crisis for the next five years.[378][379] Following minor amendments, the approval of the plan was unanimously agreed by the government during the cabinet meeting at the presidential palace in Baabda, according to SBS.[380] However, Diab assured that the plan is subject to the option of having minor changes to it.[381]"

The protesters condemned the government's approach towards tackling the economic crisis which plummeted their local currency, leading to inflation and increased prices of goods.[382][383] Outside a private bank, struggles reportedly erupted between security forces and protesters, as at least one protester was sighted being stroked and taken away by security forces, according to Daily Sabah.[384] Lebanese banks have also shown their lack of support for the government to seek help from the IMF, claiming their counsel wasn't asked for. The banking association of Lebanon urged for the rejection of the plan by members of parliament, maintaining that it does not need to be passed, as it infringes on private property rights.[385][386] They added that the plan has no specific time for implementation, also lacking the ability to proffer solutions to the high rate of inflation, possibly leading to hyperinflation.[387] However, it is believed that the IMF may possibly confer with the Lebanese banks on the rescue plan before proceeding further, according to Arab News.[388] The United Nations on 8 May 2020, reported that the journalists covering popular demonstrations in Lebanon are at the highest risk of contracting COVID-19, as many of those protesting do not abide by the safety measures advised for preventing the spread of the novel virus. The issue was first addressed by Joyce Akiki, a prominent Lebanon-based reporter for MTV channel in her velfie (or a video selfie).[389] On 14 May, the director of cash operations for the Lebanese central bank, Mazen Hamdan was arrested based on the suspicion of being involved in currency manipulation. The order for the director's arrest was issued by A Lebanese financial prosecutor, Ali Ibrahim.[390][391] Although the prosecutor's office is yet to release a statement, security sources have confirmed that Hamdan is being held in detention while awaiting an investigation, according to Reuters.[392] Following the arrest of Mazen Hamdan, Lebanon's Prime Minister Hassan Diab demanded for the allegations regarding the Lebanese pound to be looked into further, maintaining that the people of Lebanon are entitled to an explanation as to why the exchange rate has plummeted, Daily Sabah added.[393]"

The hashtag #Americarevolts in Arabic language which trended on Twitter was used by several protesters in Lebanon as a sign of solidarity.[395][396] On 4 June, In anticipation of the intended protest scheduled for Saturday by the civil movement, the period of general mobilization in Lebanon was extended to 5 July by the Lebanese Council of Ministers.[397] The Lebanese aren't denied their right to protest, so far as they wear protective gear, avoid shutting down roads, starting violence with security forces, or destroying properties, the minister of Information Abdel-Samad stated. He added that the decision regarding the extension was reached in line with the recommendation of the Higher Defense Council.[398][399] Prime minister Hassan Diab, despite his support for peaceful protests, expressed his fears and cautioned the people of Lebanon against taking advantage of the situation by turning it into violence.[400] On 6 June, several protesters returned to the streets for the first time since the COVID-19 lockdown was put in place. The protests reportedly turned violent when some anti-government protesters and supporters of the Iran-backed Shiite Hezbollah movement began to throw stones at each other, according to DW.[401][402] As the thousands of protesters gathered in Beirut's Martyrs' Square clashed, the army was forced to intervene and stand in between the two groups.[403] According to a statement by the Lebanese Red Cross on Twitter, 37 people were injured during the violence that erupted, with the majority of the victims treated at the scene.[404] On 11 June, fresh violence erupted in Lebanon's capital Beirut, after the Lebanese pound significantly depreciated against the US dollars as angry protesters took to the streets.[405] Several roads were shut down across Lebanon by anti-government protesters, consequently clashing with security forces who used tear gas to disperse the crowd.[406] According to CNN, protests also reportedly broke out in southern cities of Saida and Nabatieh, as well as the northern city of Tripoli, where demonstrators threw Molotov cocktails and stones at the city's central bank building.[407] Following the series of heavy clashes that rocked Lebanon on Thursday, Prime Minister Hassan Diab called for an emergency cabinet meeting on Friday, in an attempt to discuss solutions to the country's financial crisis.[408] BBC reported that President Michel Aoun disclosed that the central bank is expected to start injecting US dollars into the market, so as to stabilize the plummeted exchange rate.[409] On 12 June, the demonstration which started late Thursday evening, entered its second night, with security forces firing rubber bullets and tear gas after clashing with protesters in Beirut and northern Lebanon's Tripoli. Many public properties, shops, were destroyed by the protesters.[410][411] On 13 June, some Lebanese protesters in Beirut's Martyrs' Square were sighted wearing black with their faces colored in white, while moving around with a coffin covered with the Lebanese.[409] As the protests in the capital and other cities across Lebanon reached its third consecutive day, hundreds of demonstrators rallied through the streets of Lebanon demanding for the Diab's government to quit.[412] After 100 days in power, the government led by prime minister Hassan Diab was considered inadequate to alleviate the economic crisis.[407] On 18 June, Henri Chaoul, a top advisor for Lebanon's Minister of Finance in the International Monetary Fund negotiations resigned. Chaoul's publicly posted resignation directly placed blame on the government and ruling elite stating \"Whilst the IMF has confirmed the quantum of these losses, the establishment (the political class, the monetary authorities, and the financial sector as a whole) has opted to dismiss the magnitude of these losses that impose themselves as an incontestable reality and has embarked on a populist agenda\".[413] During the day, protesters blocked the main highway in Jounieh connecting the city to Beirut. Clashes and violence between protesters and security forces occurred over the arrest of activist Michel Chamoun after he had criticized president Michel Aoun on social media. This comes a few days after a new order allowed the right to sue people who insulted the presidency on social media. Violence erupted as Chamoun was being transported from the serail in Jounieh to another detention center. One Internal Security Forces officer was injured in the clashes.[414][415] On 22 June, a female activist, Kinda El-Khatib, was charged with the crime of \"dealing with the enemy [Israel]\" and visiting occupied Palestinian territories, after she was taken from her home in Akkar on 18 June.[416] On 25 June, protests erupted across Lebanon amidst deteriorating economic conditions in the country, with several protesters shutting down various roads in Lebanon.[417] Several demonstrators reportedly gathered at the Palace of Justice in Beirut, calling for the immediate release of protesters who were detained earlier this week on the allegations of destruction of properties.[418] According to Al Jazeera, the Lebanese pound on Thursday plummeted to a new rate of more than \u00a3L7,000 to the dollar on the black market. Following the protests that erupted, President Michel Aoun on Thursday held a national meeting with Lebanon's top politicians, in fear of further escalation of the protests into a civil war.[419][420] During a television interview with Al Manar on 28 June, Lebanon's Interior Minister, Mohamed Fahmi, acknowledged killing two people during the 15-year civil war in Lebanon.[421] Fahmi claimed that he was protected by the current President Michel Aoun who was then a senior officer in the army. He also revealed that an incident occurred with the two people he killed, who were part of a very powerful group.[422][423] The interview with the minister has raised doubts regarding the relationship between Prime Minister Hassan Diab's assumed technocratic government and the current political elite comprising the likes of President Aoun.[424] On 29 June, two weeks after Henri Chaoul's resignation, the Finance Ministry Director-General and negotiator with the IMF, Alain Bifani, submitted his resignation. At a press conference, Bifani cited the reasons for resigning were that negotiations were at a \"dead end\" and that the risk level has reached a point where he could no longer stay silent. Bifani continued, \"We waited a long time for a chance to achieve serious change and we tried to anticipate what we have reached today. We struggled to avoid the worst, but the forces of darkness and tyranny came together to impede what we did\".[425] In a phone call interview with France 24, Bifani blamed the elite interest groups for allowing negotiations to reach a dead-end stating \"This is one of the very few cases when the IMF is seen on the side of social justice against political elites in cahoots with private interests, banks, and big depositors \u2013 the few who have over $10 million each [in bank deposits] and don't want to contribute to a fair solution.\"[426] An investigation was launched by Lebanon's security forces into a claimed missile attack that was supposedly fired close to former Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri's convoy on 17 June. A missile reportedly went off 500 metres away from the ex-prime minister's convoy while he was visiting the eastern Bekaa Valley.[427] To note, the report was first published by a foreign news station, the Saudi-owned TV station Al-Hadath, and there is no other reference of the attack.[428]"

The protesters gathered near the parliament building calling for the resignation of Lebanese government officials. The health ministry disclosed that despite search and rescue experts taking over the search for remaining survivors, at least 21 people were still missing.[448][449] The protests turned violent, with officers using tear gas, and several people were wounded. 17 ambulances were dispatched by the Lebanese Red Cross to the protest site in order to assist those who were wounded.[450] That same day, Emmanuel Macron arrived in Beirut. He was the first foreign head of state to do so since the blast. He promised France would donate to relief efforts and urged Lebanon's leaders to implement reforms.[451] More than 60,000 signed a petition to reintegrate Lebanon as a French colony for 10 years, but Macron rejected the idea and told the Lebanese people that it was up to them to fix their country.[452] On 8 August 2020, thousands of protesters stormed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Bustros Palace) during demonstrations. Security forces opened fire and clashed with the protesters, wounding more than 238 people, sixty-three of whom were taken to hospital;[453] Saudi news channel Al-Hadath confirmed that a policeman was killed in an accident.[9] Protesters also broke into the Ministry of Economy, Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Energy, and Association of Banks. They also broke into the offices of the ministries of housing and transport, the US News added.[454] A Human Rights Watch investigation documented security forces employing metal pellets in multiple instances against protesters in the August 8 demonstration. All security forces have rejected the claims.[455] In response to the protests and calls for the termination of his government, Prime Minister Diab promised to hold early elections, maintaining that his government would stay for two months until major parties can make a decision.[456] On 9 August, as the protests entered their second day, the fire reportedly broke out at the entrance of the parliament square, when angry protesters attempted breaking into the building. The broadcast was shown live on Lebanese TV, with security forces using tear gas to disperse hundreds of anti-government protesters gathered outside the building.[457][458] By Sunday, three ministers stepped down following the explosion. The Lebanese Information Minister Manal Abdel Samad described Diab's government as a failure in terms of meeting the demands of the people of Lebanon.[459][460] Also, Environment Minister Damianos Kattar lamented that the regime is incompetent and has missed chances for ensuring reforms.[461] On 11 August, findings by Amnesty International suggested that Lebanese security forces had applied unlawful use of force against protesters, during protests after the explosion in Beirut.[462] Medical documents also showed evidence that protesters were targeted with live rounds and rubber bullets. Medics were also reportedly attacked on the scene, as they were attending to the wounded during the clash.[463][464] On 26 August, Human Rights Watch revealed that excessive use of force and live ammunition was applied against anti-government protesters by Lebanese security forces during demonstrations that took place after the Beirut explosion. They also added that some protesters were aimed at directly with tear gas, hitting some in the neck and head.[465][466] Following these findings, HRW called for an independent investigation into the misconduct carried out by the Lebanese security forces.[467] Lebanese security forces fired metal pellets at least two Lebanese protesters in early September, adding to a growing suspicion that police are employing previously unused tactics that impose serious and possibly deadly injuries.[468] As Lebanon turned 100 years old on September 1, 2020, riled protesters gathered to demand justice for those impacted by the port blast. They flung rocks and attempted to mount over the walls around Lebanon's heavily guarded Parliament in Beirut as law enforcement agents successfully shot tear gas and rubber bullets in order to scatter the crowd. The protest was the first significant rally since August 8, which left thousands of anti-government protesters injured as they were met with tear gas, rubber bullets, and live ammunition from security forces.[469] During the protests, at least two protesters were said to have been injured as a result of metal pellets used by the Lebanese security forces, according to Al Jazeera.[470] On 3 September, 30 days after the devastating Beirut explosion, a rescue dog reportedly smelled something that the Chilean rescue thought might possibly be a heartbeat. A piece of equipment was deployed which was said to have picked up a pulse of 18 to 19 beats per minute, though rescuers say that despite the possibility of the pulse meaning someone is alive or in a coma, it could also be just an object producing a signal. Rescue teams dug through the rubble for hours, but unfortunately, they had to temporarily suspend the operation due to the fear that the building could collapse.[471][472][473] Separately, the army revealed that four containers with 4.3 tonnes of ammonium nitrate were discovered outside Beirut's seaport, according to the BBC.[474] The military disclosed that army experts had been invited in order to carry out an inspection of the containers with the dangerous chemical. However, the details of the owners or source of the chemicals was not disclosed, the Times of Israel added.[475][476] On 10 September, a huge fire reportedly broke out at Beirut's port which was believed to have originated from a warehouse where oil and tires were kept, the Lebanese army disclosed. The cause of the fire was not yet confirmed, CNN added.[477][478] Although the fire was not yet extinguished, it was brought under control by the Lebanese civil defense fighters, with no casualties reported.[478] However, the head of Lebanon's Red Cross George Kettaneh, stated that some people were experiencing shortness of breath.[479] On 12 September, the Lebanese Army reportedly clashed with anti-government protesters near the presidential palace in the suburb of Baabda. In an attempt to break up the gathering of protesters, the Lebanese soldiers were said to have fired rubber bullets and live rounds in the air, in order to prevent the protesters from reaching the presidential palace.[480][481] The protesters criticized the lack of accountability by the authorities to look into the August 4 explosion that devastated the capital, as some of them held up black versions of the Lebanese flag as a sign of mourning those killed in the blast.[482] Anti-government protesters were also reported to have clashed with rival protesters backing President Michel Aoun, Arab News added.[483] Several Lebanese soldiers were said to have been wounded as a result of stones and tree branches thrown at them by some protesters.[484] On 15 September, following Beirut's August 4 explosion, a third fire erupted again in a Zaha Hadid-designed shopping centre in Beirut.[485] Firefighters were able to bring the situation under control, as they managed to extinguish the flames, according to the Lebanese Civil Defense. The cause of the fire is yet to be determined, Al Jazeera added.[486][487] So far, no casualties have been reported during the incident.[488] On 27 September 2020, Gebran Bassil's party said he was infected with a \"mild\" case of COVID-19 as cases continued to surge throughout Lebanon.[489] On 9 October 2020, a fuel tanker exploded, leaving at least four people dead and twenty injured.

His nomination came just the same day as the French President Emmanuel Macron's second planned visit to Lebanon within a month, to discuss various needs for reform.[495][496] According to Lebanon's sectarian-based power-sharing system, Adib being a Sunni Muslim, makes him qualified to become Lebanon's PM. Adib's name was said to have emerged following a meeting between an influential group of previous PMs of Lebanon on Sunday, according to Al Jazeera.[497][498] After Mustapha Adib's nomination as new Prime Minister-designate, he urged for the formation of a new government and the implementation of immediate reforms, in order to reach an understanding with the IMF.[499] The 48-year-old little-known diplomat was able to acquire 90 votes out of the 128-member parliament of legislators. 17 MPs were said to have voted for other candidates, with about a dozen other MPs either failing to be present or voting for no one, Al Jazeera added.[500][501] On Monday also, French President Emmanuel Macron visited Lebanon for the second time since the August 4 explosion which destroyed almost half of Beirut.

His decision to step aside came after conducting a meeting with President Michel Aoun.[505][506] Despite Adib's resignation, President Aoun has maintained that he remains obligated to ensure that Macron's initiative is still on course.[507] According to DW, Adib particularly encountered a deadlock while nominating who would occupy the position of Finance Minister, as Lebanon's main Shiite groups, Hezbollah and Amal, both want to keep the position.[508] Following Mustapha Adib's resignation, French President Emmanuel Macron on 27 September, blamed Lebanon's leaders for being unable to establish a new government and described their failure as a betrayal. He added that he was embarrassed with the Lebanese political leaders during his news conference in Paris, stating that they had no regard for the commitments dedicated to France and the entire international community. He has also issued a warning to the Shiite group Hezbollah, which was held responsible for delaying the process of forming a new government, saying that the Iran-backed movement should not overestimate its powers.[509][510][511] While ruling out the establishment of sanctions, the French President said he would allocate another four to six more weeks for Lebanon's political class to implement France's plans for economic and political reform.[512]"

Northern Tripoli's Abdul Hamid Karami Square was also closed by protesters, including Zahle Square in central Lebanon.[536][537] On 4 March, protesters returned to the streets, criticizing their leaders for being unable to create a new government.[538] Protesters in Furn al-Shebak and Jal el Dib blocked main roads connecting Beirut to other cities by burning tires.[539] On 6 March, caretaker Prime Minister Hassan Diab threatened to stop performing his duties in an attempt to mount pressure on the Lebanese politicians to establish a new government. He also called on them to set aside their differences and create a new government, in order to prevent the country from rapidly escalating into more violence.[540][541] On the same day, a small gathering of protesters were reported to have gathered outside the central bank in Beirut, requesting for their deposits to be made accessible.

Aoun also maintained that inaction was no longer a choice for the PM-designate Hariri, as he must choose between stepping down or forming a government.[555][556] On March 20, on the eve of Mother's Day, a group of women protested and went from Bechara Al Khoury towards Beirut and the port shouting and crying due to the crisis in the country.[557] On March 22, and after several meetings between Prime Minister-designate Saad Hariri and President Aoun, Hariri said that the demands of the President were \"unacceptable\", therefore Lebanon witnessed a failure to form a new government which will worsen the crisis.[558] According to Hariri, President Aoun presented him with a line-up granting his team a third of all cabinet seats, which would enable them to have veto power over decision making in the Lebanese government.[559] Harir was said to have been criticized by Aoun for disclosing his proposed government with the media, because the distribution of the ministries was unjust which was his reason for not agreeing to the line-up, according to Al Jazeera.[560] After the meeting which only lasted for just 35 minutes, another date for a new meeting between Hariri and Aoun could not be confirmed.[561] On 23 March, central streets in Beirut were closed by protesters, following the outcome of the political meeting between the Lebanese prime minister-designate Saad Hariri and President Michel Aoun.[562] On March 28, the Lebanese Communist Party arranged a protest in the capital Beirut amid a worsening economic and living situation in Lebanon.[563] Despite tight security, the protesters gathered in front of the Central Bank, then moved to the Government Palace while holding banners demanding various basic social amenities.[564] On March 29, the parliament approved $200 million in emergency funding to avoid the national power cut that might hit the country by the end of March.[565] Former energy minister and member of parliament, Cesar Abi Khalil maintained that it is expected to make electricity sufficient for about two months.[566] On March 30, families of students studying abroad protested against Lebanese banks and tried to raid a closed bank while staff worked inside. Their protest was because their children were expelled from their universities because the parents couldn't send them money due to the rise of the exchange rate of the dollar.[567] Separately, a report by Human Rights Watch (HRW) suggested that during the lockdown and worsening economy protests in Lebanon's Tripoli, demonstrators were allegedly tortured by the Lebanese military intelligence.[568] Apart from the torture of detainees, the HRW also added that others were forcefully abducted by the military.[569]"

Driven by grievances related to governance, corruption, and economic challenges, women from diverse backgrounds emerged as key figures in shaping and sustaining the movement. In the years preceding the October uprising, Lebanon witnessed the emergence of a feminist public sphere, where women's organizations and groups played a cruicial role in highlighting issues of gender inequality.[639][640][641] Through lobbying efforts and activism, feminists pushed for legal reforms to address institutional inequalities and provide platforms to foster solidarity. In drawing upon past movements such as the 2011 protests against sectarianism and the 2015 garbage crisis protests, women entered the October Revolution with a wealth of experience in grassroots activism.[633] What distinguished the October uprising was its wide-ranging audience, offering feminist activists unprecedented opportunities to address national issues in highly networked and media-savvy environments.[633] Campaigns aiming to criminalize domestic violence and sexual harassment gained traction, shedding light on systemic challenges faced by women.[642][643] These efforts succeeded in raising awareness about women's experiences in intimate relationships and within families, amplifying their voices nationally."

The symbolic act of Malak Alaywe Herz kicking an armed bodyguard on the revolution's first night emerged as a powerful metaphor against the corrupt and patriarchal political system.[649] It resonated with those involved in the uprising and became an iconic image of resistance. These findings challenge previous research that assigned specific tactics and roles to women and men, as corroborated by feminist activists on the ground. Despite employing diverse tactics, women predominantly engaged in peaceful conflict resolution.[650] This was evidenced by their participation in organized marches in Tripoli and Baalbek, which aimed to address politico-sectarian tensions. They also led rallies, blocked roads, and de-escalated violence.[651] Additionally, they played a pivotal role in providing a physical buffer between protesters and security forces during moments of heightened tension.[638] By utilising platforms such as WhatsApp to swiftly coordinate and assemble at protest sites and form a human barrier to prevent the escalation of violence, they also played with gendered norms to mitigate violence. For instance, older women strategically invoked the concept of motherhood when engaging with soldiers, using phrases like \"Don\u2019t harm us, I could be your mom,\" to appeal to their sense of compassion and discourage violence.[638] Additionally, women act as informal mediators, negotiating access at roadblocks and diffusing conflicts between armed forces and protesters. Women-led unity marches in Beirut, Jal Al-Deeb, and Tripoli followed nights of violence, leading to a significant decrease in politicized violence for nearly two weeks. These efforts align with global trends suggesting that women's active involvement reduces the likelihood of armed conflict in protests.[652]"

The economic crisis has led to a projected surge in female unemployment rates, with women's unemployment expected to increase by 63%.[657] The August 4 Beirut Port blast further compounded these challenges, threatening employment opportunities and exacerbating the risk of gender-based violence and harassment, particularly among displaced women.[658] Consequently, Lebanon experienced a 13-place decline in the World Economic Forum's 2023 gender equality ranking, with the country now ranking 132nd out of 146 countries.[659] The cessation of recognition of foreign civil marriages by the General Directorate of Personal Status in September 2022, for instance, represents a regression in women's rights, as documented by Human Rights Watch in 2024.[660] Despite a notable increase in female candidates in the 2022 parliamentary elections, women continue to be underrepresented in political leadership.

The 2 secretaries of parliament were elected immediately after the Deputy Speaker. Although not constitutionally required, it was decided that the secretaries would be attributed to one Maronite Christian and one Druze. The election process of the 2 deputies had large debate particularly by opposition MPs. It was suggested that each MP votes for both preferences in the same ballot and that the positions should not be based on religion. However, it was decided that voting would take place on the basis of one name per ballot.[682] As a result of this Firas Hamdan, an opposition MP, who was one of few candidates for the Druze secretary, withdrew his candidacy in protest of the sectarian electoral procedure.[682]"

At 18:00, the fire had worsened due to strong prevailing winds and the fire had started to disrupt electricity supplies in the area.[2] It now covered approximately 100 hectares of heath and woodland, and 150 firefighters were involved, including most of the fire engines in Dorset and several from Dorset & Somerset and Hampshire.[4] Specifically, there were 28 in total: The fire was declared a \"major incident\" shortly after it was discovered, and by the end of the first day, the fire had spread to 183 hectares, and the smoke plume was affecting people as far away as Bournemouth, Ferndown and Wimborne.[4] The main trunk road through Dorset, the A35, was closed by police.[5] The fire needed special precautions to fight, as a major National Grid power line ran through the middle of the fire.[5]"

The fifteenth named storm and sixth typhoon in the western Pacific that year, Krovanh originated from a tropical disturbance within the monsoon trough on August\u00a013. Despite rather favorable conditions, the initial tropical depression did not intensify significantly and degenerated into a remnant low on August\u00a018. However, these remnants were able to reorganize and the system was reclassified as a tropical cyclone a day later. Intensification was rather rapid upon the storm's reformation\u00a0\u2013 the depression reached tropical storm status on August\u00a020 and then typhoon intensity two days later. Shortly after, Krovanh made landfall on Luzon at peak intensity with winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph).[nb 2] The typhoon emerged into the South China Sea as a much weaker tropical storm, though it was able to restrengthen over warm waters. Once again at typhoon intensity, Krovanh clipped Haiyan before moving over the Leizhou Peninsula on its way to a final landfall near C\u1ea9m Ph\u1ea3, Vietnam on August\u00a025. Quick weakening due to land interaction occurred as Krovanh moved across northern Vietnam, where the storm met its demise the following day. Krovanh first struck the Philippines, resulting in heavy rainfall and displacing approximately 1,000\u00a0families. The flooding caused severe damage and killed one person. In Hong Kong, eleven people were injured and isolated flooding occurred as a result of the typhoon's outer rainbands. However, Krovanh's effects were much more severe in China. Guangdong, Hainan, and Guangxi were the Chinese regions most extensively impacted. The typhoon brought record wind gusts into Guangxi. In those three regions combined, 13,000\u00a0homes were estimated to have collapsed and a large swath of farmland was damaged. Two people were killed in China and economic losses approximated at RMB\u00a52.1 billion (US$253 million).[nb 3] Due to its positioning and track, of all areas in Vietnam only the country's more northern regions were impacted by Krovanh. Flash flooding occurred in those regions, and 1,000\u00a0homes were flattened. One person was killed and five others were injured in Vietnam. Overall, the typhoon was responsible for the deaths of four persons."

        "header": "Meteorological history",
        "content": "The origin of Typhoon Krovanh can be traced back to an area of persistent convection well east of Chuuk State on August\u00a013. Over the course of the day the disturbance gradually consolidated within favorable atmospheric conditions,[1] and at 1800\u00a0UTC that day the Japan Meteorological Agency\u00a0(JMA) assessed the system to have organized sufficiently to be classified as a tropical depression.[2] Shower activity was suppressed by a nearby upper-level low for much of the storm's early existence;[1] however, at 0600\u00a0UTC on August\u00a015, the system was classified by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center\u00a0(JTWC) as a tropical depression. The depression tracked northwestward under the influence of a nearby ridge.[3] Strengthening and development of the tropical cyclone was very minimal over the next few days, and on August\u00a018, both tracking agencies discontinued monitoring the system due to the lack of an identifiable low-level circulation center.[1] Redevelopment of the disturbance was a possibility following its degeneration, and on August\u00a019, convection once again increased, prompting the JTWC to resume monitoring the system as a tropical depression at 0900\u00a0UTC, with the JMA following suit nine hours later. Due to slight wind shear, the depression's circulation center remained slightly displaced from the stronger convection.[1] At 0600\u00a0UTC on August\u00a020, the JTWC determined that the disturbance had intensified to reach tropical storm status.[3] Upon the 1200\u00a0UTC upgrade to such an intensity by the JMA,[2] the tropical cyclone was assigned the name Krovanh.[1] Subsequently, following reclassification, Krovanh began to quickly intensify as it tracked in a somewhat southwest bearing.[3] By August\u00a021, the tropical storm had begun to develop a banding eye feature.[1] At 0600\u00a0UTC that day, the JMA upgraded Krovanh to severe tropical storm intensity,[2] whilst the JTWC indicated that the storm intensified into a typhoon.[3] On August\u00a022, the JMA reassessed Krovanh as a typhoon and determined that the storm had reached its peak intensity with winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph).[2] Meanwhile, the JTWC analyzed the storm to have peaked with one-minute sustained winds of 165\u00a0km/h (103\u00a0mph);[3] this was followed by the storm making landfall on Luzon, just north of Palanan, Isabela, at 1115\u00a0UTC later that day.[1] Land interaction during Krovanh's passage of Luzon significantly weakened the cyclone, and upon the system's reemergence into the South China Sea by 2000\u00a0UTC on August\u00a022,[3] Krovanh was classified as only a tropical storm by the JMA. Redevelopment was rather rapid following emergence, and just four hours later the storm was redesignated as a severe tropical storm.[2] On August\u00a024, the storm began to develop tight banding and reformed its prior banding eye feature, which later organized into a well defined eye. Later that day Krovanh clipped the northeastern coast of Hainan before crossing the Leizhou Peninsula on August\u00a025.[1] During this time, the JMA upgraded Krovanh back to typhoon intensity and indicated that the storm was reaching a secondary peak in strength.[2] The JTWC indicated a similar development as the typhoon traversed the Gulf of Tonkin.[3] However, according to the JMA, Krovanh waned into a severe tropical storm shortly before the storm made its final landfall on C\u1ea9m Ph\u1ea3, Vietnam at approximately 1500\u00a0UTC on August\u00a025. Over land, Krovanh deteriorated rapidly, and both agencies ceased monitoring the system on August\u00a026 while it was well northwest of Hanoi.[1]"

Morning temperatures across most of the state were in the lower 60's with a dewpoint of approximately 60\u00a0\u00b0F (15-16\u00a0\u00b0C).[6] Meanwhile, a warm front was moving from Louisiana and into central and southwest Alabama. By noon, the skies had begun to darken as a cold front trailed over areas of northeast Texas. These conditions prompted the Storm Prediction Center to issue a moderate risk outlook across portions of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama with a slight risk outlook covering a region from Louisiana to Tennessee, North Carolina, and Florida.[3] The threat of severe weather across middle Tennessee was first identified by the early afternoon of January 23. A special weather statement was issued to highlight the severe weather threat for middle Tennessee for the afternoon of January 24. Another special weather statement was issued early on January 24 to continue to alert the public of the possibility of severe weather.[7] The tornado outbreak unfolded quickly across middle Tennessee during the early afternoon of January 24. Shortly after 330 PM, Doppler weather radar indicated a tornado as severe weather spotters reported a funnel cloud just east of Centerville, Tennessee. A tornado warning was issued at 333 PM for northern Maury and Williamson Counties as the tornado moved toward the more heavily populated area of Franklin. By 344 PM, another tornado warning was issued for Maury County as another tornado was indicated by Doppler weather radar in western Maury County, about 15 miles west of Columbia. By 422 PM, a tornado warning was issued for Rutherford and extended for Williamson County until 515 PM. Three tornadoes were indicated by Doppler weather radar from about 10 miles northeast and 5 miles west of Franklin, Tennessee and also along the Maury-Williamson County line. Several weather spotters, amateur radio operators, and sheriffs' deputies were maintaining contact with NWSO Nashville and provided excellent updates of the tornadoes, which coincided with Doppler weather radar indications. A very important severe weather statement was issued shortly after 430 PM highlighting the multiple tornadoes in Williamson County. This statement provided crucial information regarding areas within the Nashville metropolitan area which were in the paths of the tornadoes (including heavily populated areas such as Murfreesboro in Rutherford County). At 440 PM, the northernmost tornado about 5 miles northeast of Franklin continued to maintain itself, prompting a tornado warning for Wilson county valid until 545 PM. Another crucial severe weather statement was issued at 454 PM to indicate tornado locations and to pinpoint towns along the tornado paths. This particular statement mentioned that tornadoes would move to near Murfreesboro between 500 and 515 and to just southeast of Lebanon by 515 PM. At around 500 PM, an F2 tornado touched down near Smyrna in Rutherford County causing damage to Smyrna Middle as it moved southeast of Lebanon in Wilson County to near Watertown in southeast Wilson County at the predicted 515 PM time. Rutherford County residents had a 48-minute tornado warning lead time and Wilson county a 20-minute lead time."

Initial damage included snapped tree branches and shingles torn off of the roof of an apartment complex. As it crossed U.S. Route 82 and Interstate 59, the tornado quickly became stronger, with two businesses, Books-a-Million and Gayfers suffering roof damage. Moving in a northeast direction, the tornado then entered the Woodland Hills area, destroying outbuildings and damaging several homes. A 71-year old retired physician was killed when a tree fell onto the windshield of his pickup truck. It was the first tornado-related fatality in the United States in 1997.[28] The tornado ultimately reached F2 intensity as it entered Five Points East. The manager of the Food World grocery store at that location saw the approaching tornado and ushered customers into the store. Many cars in the Food World parking lot were destroyed, including one that was tossed into the backyard of a neighboring house while another was tossed through the roof of the store. At least one other business, a Big-B location, also suffered damage.[6] After impacting the Food World and Big B stores, the tornado continued into the Lynn Haven residential area damaging ten to twelve homes. Damage to these homes ranged from partial to complete roof loss. The tornado then crossed the Tuscaloosa Memorial Gardens Cemetery and State Road 216, entering the Summerfield subdivision. Six to eight houses in the subdivision received minor damage while other structures including a few mobile homes and a small grocery store were destroyed. The tornado dissipated shortly afterwards in a wooded area just north of State Road 216. A tornado warning was issued for Tuscaloosa County at 5:11 PM, shortly before the tornado dissipated. The warning would remain in effect for another 49 minutes.[28] The tornado was on the ground for approximately 15 minutes, with a path length of 10 miles long by 200 yards wide. The EMA of Tuscaloosa County concluded that up to 100 structures sustained some degree of damage, ranging from roof damage to complete destruction. The sole fatality that occurred during the tornado was the first tornado-related fatality to occur in 1997, and the first in Tuscaloosa since the 1932 Deep South tornado outbreak killed 37 people in the area. The December 2000 Tuscaloosa tornado, which occurred almost three years later, would follow a similar path to the 1997 twister.[29] The 2000 tornado was rated at F4 intensity and killed 11 people."

Forming out of an area of disturbed weather on June\u00a030, Kirogi initially tracked slowly towards the north. On July\u00a03, the storm underwent rapid intensification and attained Category 4 status on the Saffir\u2013Simpson Hurricane Scale the next day, according to the JTWC. On July\u00a05, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) assessed the storm to have reached its peak intensity with 10-minute sustained winds of 155\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph) and a barometric pressure of 940\u00a0hPa (27.76\u00a0inHg). Over the following several days, the storm tracked towards the northeast and accelerated towards Japan. Early on July\u00a08, Kirogi brushed eastern Japan before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone. Initial news reports stated that Kirogi produced deadly flooding in the Philippines; however, the storm was too far from the country to have any impacts. In Japan, Kirogi produced torrential rainfall and high winds, killing three people and leaving \u00a515\u00a0billion (2000 JPY, $140\u00a0million USD) in damages. Flooding inundated nearly 1,300 homes around Tokyo and high winds cut power to roughly 20,000 residences. Three homes were destroyed in a landslide on Kozushima."

        "content": "Typhoon Kirogi originated out of a disorganized area of showers and thunderstorms on June\u00a030, 2000, associated with a weak area of low pressure, situated roughly 650\u00a0km (400\u00a0mi) east of the Philippine island of Mindanao. The system remained nearly stationary for two days as it became increasingly organized. On July\u00a01, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert as they anticipated the low to develop into a significant tropical cyclone within 24\u00a0hours.[1] Around 0600\u00a0UTC the following day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began monitoring the system as a tropical depression.[2] At the same time, the JTWC also classified the system as Tropical Depression 05W and six hours later,[3] the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) began issuing advisories on the same system, classifying it as Tropical Depression Ditang.[1] Throughout the day on July\u00a02, the depression began to take a slow northward track in response to a mid-level subtropical ridge to the east[1] and later that day, the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical storm.[3] Early the next day, the JMA also upgraded the system to a tropical storm, at which time it received the name Kirogi.[2] Although a broad cyclone, convection was gradually wrapping around the southern periphery of the circulation.[1] Several hours after being named, the JMA upgraded Kirogi to a severe tropical storm and later a typhoon.[2] At the same time, the JTWC classified the storm as a typhoon.[3] Upon being upgraded the typhoon featured a well-developed outflow and prominent banding features consolidating around the system.[1] Not long after attaining typhoon intensity, Kirogi began to undergo rapid intensification.[1] Roughly 18\u00a0hours later, the JTWC reported that the storm had attained its peak intensity with 1-minute sustained winds of 215\u00a0km/h (130\u00a0mph), equivalent to a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson Hurricane Scale.[3] By this time, the typhoon was situated roughly 870\u00a0km (540\u00a0mi) southeast of Okinawa. The storm featured a 59\u00a0km (37\u00a0mi) wide symmetrical eye.[1] Early on July\u00a05, the JMA reported that Kirogi attained its peak intensity with 10-minute sustained winds of 155\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph) and a barometric pressure of 940\u00a0hPa (27.76\u00a0inHg).[2] The storm was a relatively large typhoon, with a gale diameter of 520\u00a0km (320\u00a0mi).[1] Several hours after attaining peak intensity on July\u00a05, a mid-level trough caused convection around the center of Kirogi to weaken and the eye became cloud-filled. Later in the day, most of the convective bands were confined to the eastern periphery of the system.[1] Around this time, the storm took a northeasterly track, which it maintained for several days.[2] Increasing in forward motion, the storm began to weaken; however, it also grew in size. By July\u00a06, the storm had a gale-diameter of 925\u00a0km (575\u00a0mi).[1] Gradual weakening took place as Kirogi tracked towards Japan, with both the JTWC and JMA reporting sustained winds at 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph) by July\u00a07.[2][3] Early on July\u00a08, the storm brushed the eastern coast of Japan near Ch\u014dshi, Chiba with 10-minute sustained winds of 150\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph).[1][2] Several hours later, the typhoon weakened to a severe tropical storm before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone near the southeast coast of Hokkaido. By this time, the storm took a sharp eastward turn and briefly slowed before re-accelerating. The remnants of the storm persisted until July\u00a010, at which time it dissipated to the southwest of the Aleutian Islands.[2]"

Typhoon Kirogi was never closer than 835\u00a0km (519\u00a0mi) from the Philippines.[1] However, large swells produced by the storm caused moderate damage along coastal areas of the Philippines, forcing workers in Manila to clear debris left by the damaging waves.[6]"

In all, damages from the storm amounted to \u00a515\u00a0billion (2000 JPY, $140\u00a0million USD).[8] Three people were killed by the storm, all of whom were found in irrigation ditches. The first fatality was an 81-year-old man, the second was a 30-year-old man who lost control of his car and crashed into a ditch, and the last fatality was a 3-year-old boy who fell in a ditch near his home.[10] Two 11-year-old boys, initially reported as missing, were later found in a ditch after being swept away by flood waters.[13] About 1,300 homes were inundated by flood waters around Tokyo[9] and three were destroyed on K\u014dzushima by a landslide.[10] Widespread power outages took place, leaving an estimated 20,000 people without power in Kanagawa and Shizuoka prefectures as winds up to 177\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph) knocked down trees and power lines.[10] Rainfall from the storm fell at rates of 55\u00a0mm/h (2.2\u00a0in/h). Total amounts reached 416\u00a0mm (16.4\u00a0in) in Tokyo,[14]  400\u00a0mm (16\u00a0in) on Izu \u014cshima and 357\u00a0mm (14.1\u00a0in) in Ogatsu, Miyagi Prefecture.[9] These rains were more than double the monthly average for July in eastern Japan.[3] Rainfall up to 182\u00a0mm (7.2\u00a0in) caused flooding throughout eastern Hokkaid\u014d, resulting in widespread agricultural losses. Throughout Aomori Prefecture, large stretches of roads were washed out by flood waters and several thousand homes were inundated. Damage from the storm in Aomori was estimated at \u00a5777\u00a0million (2000 JPY, $7.21\u00a0million USD).[15] In Obihiro, Hokkaid\u014d, a total of 2,957\u00a0ha (7,310 acres) of agricultural land was inundated by flood waters.[16] The fishing industry in Urakawa District, Hokkaid\u014d sustained severe losses, amounting to \u00a5899\u00a0million (2000 JPY, $8.34\u00a0million USD). High winds in the district resulted in moderate roof damage to several homes, some of which lost their roofs.[17]"

Approximately 600 firefighters and soldiers, twelve fire-fighting aircraft and nine helicopters were deployed to extinguish the fire.[3] These fires are the worst since 2007, though no casualties have been reported.[4]"

        "content": "The fires of 2009 began on the night of August 21, 2009 and burned over the next four days, covering approximately 21,000 hectares of pine forest, olive groves, shrub land and farmland. The fires affected 15 municipalities and communities and destroyed 60 homes, damaging another 150. The fires began in Grammatiko village, about 40\u00a0km north-east of Athens, and spread to the mountains of eastern Attica.  Around 72 houses were damaged in Grammatiko and other badly hit communities were Stamata and Rodopoli. More than 1,000 fire-fighters and soldiers were placed on duty over the weekend, and a total of 19 planes and helicopters worked to fight the fires, dropping around 14,000 tonnes of water on one day alone (24 August 2009). Aircraft were drafted-in from Italy, France and Cyprus. The cost of hiring the fire services 14 helicopters for about 120 flying hours is estimated at 30 million euros. According to World Wildlife Fund (WWF), Greece, The destruction from three days of intense forest fires \u201cconfirms the inability of the state to effectively manage the country\u2019s forests\u201d.[5]  Unlike the 2007 Greek forest fires, the 2009 fires took place in eastern Attica, which is a forested-suburban region known for its illegal ribbon development, where thousands of illegal homes have been legalised ahead of successive elections by incumbent governments. This area is also expected to undergo further development and population increase as a result of new urban plans for the area.[5] Gavril Xanthopoulos, a scientist at the Greek Forest Research Institute in Athens, and one of the country\u2019s leading forest fire experts is quoted as saying: \u201cThese areas are what we call a wildland\u2013urban interface, which are not just peculiar to Greece, but exist in all European Mediterranean countries\u201d. The mix of homes and forest can drain fire resources, because the fight is targeted at burning homes and property, allowing forest fires to spread faster.  Xanthopoulos claims to have alerted civil protection authorities a fortnight before the fires warning that the drought in vegetation had reached the levels of 2007, that there was an extreme likelihood of fires occurring and that this was reflected in the area\u2019s fire danger map.  The meltemi winds, typical of this time of year made the fires head south, which was a predictable trajectory for the fire.[5] WWF has called for radical reform of the fire service, which has been weakened, since 1981, by political interference in recruitment and promotion, bureaucratisation, the removal of fire-fighting responsibilities from the forestry service and abolition of the dasokommando, which is a Greek   specialised fire-fighting unit. According to Konstantinos Liarikos, environmental programme director of WWF, part of the existing fire service needs to be especially dedicated to forest fire-fighting, and emphasis should be on suppression rather than prevention:  the cost of hiring an Erickson Air-Crane Helitanker fire-fighting helicopter is 800,000 euros a season, and is equivalent to the cost of hiring 800 seasonal fire-fighters, which WWF claims would be more effective.  In addition, citizen awareness programmes are needed to educated suburban residents about fire prevention and fire-fighting. For example, the connection of electric pumps to swimming pools to help residents to use water for dousing fires. Planting fire-resistant tree species in gardens, such as bay laurel, poplar, acacia and oak, can also help save homes. In 2007, fires spread more slowly in rural areas of the Peloponnese where a farming population kept areas well-managed and clear of grass.[5]"

        "content": "Since the fires some areas, for example, around Lake Marathon, have been reported as being subject to grazing by flocks of goats. The goats are wandering freely over the burnt-out forest areas. Grazing goats is forbidden in Attica under a law of 1993. After the fires of August 2009, the grazing of other types of animals in forest areas, such as sheep and cattle, was also forbidden.[8] The burnt areas of forest appear to be unmonitored by forest patrols. There are only 49 forest guards in Attica, which means that each guard must patrol an area of 83,000 stremmata. A modern stremma is approximately 1,000 square metres and thus .1 hectares or .247 acres. The total forested extent of Attica is 3,500,000 stremmata. In some areas, olive trees have been planted within the burnt forest areas.  This is one of the first illegal steps in transforming unmonitored forested areas into cultivated land.[8] Mr Nikos Chlikas, a forester and environmentalist, has emphasised that about 90,000 to 100,000 stremmata in north-east Attica have been burnt for a second or third time, out of the total of 210,000 stremmata, which was burnt in August 2009. In these areas, it is essential that there is intervention by the authorities to help forest regeneration because the pine trees are very young and do not have the capacity to create cones. This forest cannot regenerate by itself. In addition, the number of small trees which are, at the moment, in the nursery at Amigdales will have difficulty covering 3,000-4,000 stremmata, for this reason money needs to be allocated for new trees, so that planting can take place over the next few years. According to Nikos Chlikas, the cost of reforestation is around 500 euro for each stremma, including the cost of caring for the trees for at least two years. However, in 2008 less than 10,000 stremmata were reforested in the whole of Greece.[8] As part of the post-fire protection work, the Geotechnical Chamber of Greece (\u03a4\u03bf \u0393\u03b5\u03c9\u03c4\u03b5\u03c7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u0395\u03c0\u03b9\u03bc\u03b5\u03bb\u03b7\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1\u03c2 (\u0393\u0395\u03a9\u03a4.\u0395.\u0395.)) with the aim of taking measures to protect the area have placed logs and matted branches along the ground in burnt forest areas, in order to slow down runoff and so reduce erosion. In some areas, cement dams have been constructed at some points, although experts question the logic of this, and claim that it is an excessive intervention into the environment. In the secondary and tertiary burnt areas there are, however, insufficient logs of the right size for creating barriers to run-off erosion. Mr Antonis Angelopoulos, a geologist and vice-president of the Geotechnical Chamber of Greece, Eastern Mainland Greece section, agrees that some of the interventions into the environment have been excessive. For example, in Agia Varvara, the permanent cement structures that have been made were probably unnecessary, because the area has already got at least two old, stone dams, which could have been recycled. However, on the gulley of Agiou Stefanou, the anti-runoff work has been positive, because dams have been constructed from boxes made out of wire. This is friendlier to the environment, because these dams hold back rain-washed matter, but allow water to pass through.[8]"

On January\u00a02, the typhoon moved through the southern Philippines, crossing Leyte, the Camotes Islands, northern Cebu, northern Negros Island, and central Panay. While the storm was nearby, Dumalag, Capiz recorded a minimum pressure of 983\u00a0mbar (29.02\u00a0inHg). Winds in Cebu reached 118.7\u00a0km/h (73.8\u00a0mph). The typhoon weakened in the South China Sea on January\u00a05\u20136. Across the archipelago, the typhoon sank two ships, left thousands homeless, and killed at least 31\u00a0people. Damage in the Philippines totaled about 6\u00a0million pesos, spurring the Governor-general to ask residents for money for a special typhoon fund. The American Red Cross donated about 20,000\u00a0pesos to assist in recovery.[1][2][3][4] A depression formed northwest of Guam on May\u00a06. It moved generally northward, passing west of the Bonin Islands before curving to the northeast. It was last observed on May\u00a08.[4] A typhoon formed in the South China Sea on June\u00a04. It moved to the north-northeast and passed near the east coast of Taiwan. The storm crossed the northern Ryukyu Islands and was last observed on June\u00a09.[4] Another typhoon formed in the East China Sea on June\u00a011. The storm moved in a general northeast direction, passing over the northern Ryukyu Islands. It was last observed on June\u00a014.[4] A tropical cyclone originated in the South China Sea on July\u00a010. A day later, the storm moved over southeastern China.[4] Another tropical cyclone was first observed over the open Pacific on July\u00a016. It moved to the northwest and struck eastern China near Shanghai; it was last noted on July\u00a018.[4] A depression existed east of the Philippines on July\u00a029. Steered by a ridge to the north over Japan, the system moved northwestward, brushing the northern tip of Luzon before entering the South China Sea. Early on August\u00a01, a station on Pratas Island recorded a minimum pressure of 988\u00a0mbar (29.2\u00a0inHg) while the typhoon passed nearby. As the storm approached southeastern China, the Hong Kong Observatory issued a Number 10 warning signal, which is the highest level of warning; this marked the first occasion that the agency issued a Number 10 warning since adopting a new system in the previous year. Late on August\u00a01, the typhoon made landfall between Hong Kong and Macau, and weakened over land by the next day. High waves damaged the end of the first Queen's Pier, and sank four ships. Wind gusts in the colony reached 218\u00a0km/h (135\u00a0mph). The high winds destroyed the roofs of several buildings, completely wrecking four homes. There were six deaths in Hong Kong, as well as four injuries.[5][6][7]"

The storm moved to the west and later northwest, recurved to the northeast, and then turned back to the northwest, steered by a ridge to its north. The track brought the typhoon over the southern Ryukyu Islands, where the typhoon wrecked about 10,000\u00a0houses, decimated crops, and killed 15\u00a0people. Ishigaki Island recorded a minimum pressure of 986\u00a0mbar (29.1\u00a0inHg). The typhoon then passed north of Taiwan, producing estimated winds of 160\u00a0km/h (99\u00a0mph). The storm struck mainland China between Fuzhou and Wenzhou on August\u00a011, eventually weakening over Guizhou province in central China. The schooner 'Kwongsang, bound from Shanghai to Shantou, foundered in the typhoon with 57\u00a0people on board, and only four survivors. Several other ships were damaged.[4][5][9][10][11][12] From August\u00a07\u201312, a low pressure area persisted in the South China Sea, bringing heavy rainfall to the Philippines. Over a nine-day period, the system dropped 1,036.5\u00a0mm (40.81\u00a0in) of rainfall in Manila, which caused the worst flooding in the city in 26\u00a0years, in conjunction with above normal tides. This left around 4,000\u00a0people homeless. The system moved northward through the South China Sea and began intensifying on August\u00a012. Three days later, the system strengthened into a typhoon and passed near Pratas, which recorded a minimum pressure of 986\u00a0mbar (29.1\u00a0inHg). On August\u00a017, the typhoon moved ashore southern China between Hong Kong and Shantou, and gradually weakened over land, dissipating by August\u00a020.[5][13] On August\u00a09, a tropical cyclone began developing between the Caroline Islands and the Marianas Islands. For several days, the track was uncertain, until a more steady northwest trajectory began on August\u00a015. The storm crossed the Ryukyu Islands on August\u00a017, and later turned to the northeast in the Yellow Sea. The storm moved across the Korean Peninsula, and dissipated on August\u00a019.[5]"

After crossing the East China Sea, the typhoon curved to the north and struck China's east coast near Ningbo on August\u00a025. The storm passed east of Shanghai, bringing estimated winds of 160\u00a0km/h (99\u00a0mph) to the city. The SS President Cleveland rode out the typhoon along the Huangpu River, and recorded a pressure of 966\u00a0mbar (28.5\u00a0inHg). After affecting China, the typhoon recurved to the northeast, moving across the Yellow Sea, the northern Korean peninsula, the Sea of Japan, and eventually the La P\u00e9rouse Strait. The typhoon was last observed on August\u00a028.[5] In Shanghai, high winds knocked down hundreds of trees.[5] Ahead of the typhoon, heavy rainfall across China led to the deadliest floods worldwide in the 20th century, with large areas flooded along the country's major rivers. On August\u00a026, wind-generated waves from the typhoon broke the walls of the levees along Lake Gaoyou. There were 15\u00a0breaks in levees along the Grand Canal, inundating a 25,900\u00a0km2 (10,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) portion of northern Jiangsu, including 80\u00a0towns, killing 300,000\u00a0people, according to contemporaneous news reports. In the city of Gaoyou, the levee break killed 2,000\u00a0people in the middle of the night. In 2005, the 1931 Gaoyou Flood museum opened, featuring aerial photographs of the floods, taken by Charles Lindbergh.[14][15] In Korea, the typhoon killed 40\u00a0people, with 770\u00a0fishermen reported missing after the storm's passage.[16]"

It was the fifth typhoon to impact Hong Kong during the active 1964 Pacific typhoon season, and prompted the issuance of the No. 10 typhoon signal from the Royal Observatory in Hong Kong\u2014the highest warning possible. The storm's precursor disturbance formed west of Pohnpei on October\u00a03 and tracked towards the west, becoming a tropical storm by October\u00a06. Gradually strengthening, Dot moved towards the west-northwest, northwest, and then curved west, leading to a landfall at typhoon intensity on Luzon on October\u00a09. A freighter with 32\u00a0crewmembers went missing west of the island after passing through the typhoon and was never recovered. Dot tracked slowly and strengthened further across the South China Sea between October\u00a09\u201313. The Royal Observatory began issuing tropical cyclone signals on October\u00a010. A day later, Dot reached its peak intensity with one-minute sustained winds of around 165\u00a0km/h (103\u00a0mph) and ten-minute sustained winds of about 150\u00a0km/h (93\u00a0mph). Dot curved northward and maintained this intensity as its final landfall near Hong Kong on October\u00a013, during which the Royal Observatory hoisted the No. 10 typhoon signal. Dot's slow movement near landfall prolonged its impacts, with the Royal Observatory recording eight hours of gale-force winds and over 330\u00a0mm (13\u00a0in) of rain. A peak gust of 220\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph) was clocked at Tate's Cairn, and the strong winds damaged most buildings around Hong Kong and shattered windows. Rain-triggered landslides destroyed homes and blocked roads. In total, Dot killed at least 26\u00a0people and injured 85\u00a0others according to the Royal Observatory, in addition to causing millions of U.S. dollars in property damage."

        "content": "Dot was the strongest tropical cyclone within the western Pacific basin in October\u00a01964.[2] According to data from the China Meteorological Administration (CMA), the precursor to Dot developed west of Pohnpei on October\u00a03.[3] The interaction of a trough of low-pressure and a tropical wave spurred tropical cyclogenesis.[4] This initial disturbance tracked westward for several days; aircraft reconnaissance first intercepted the nascent system 160\u00a0km (99\u00a0mi) southwest of Yap, finding it to have organized into a tropical storm. Early airborne observations suggested the system was dissipating, but additional intercepts a more organized center of circulation on October\u00a07 around which Dot was developing. Moving west-northwest, Dot passed offshore Catanduanes on October\u00a08.[2] That day, aircraft reconnaissance made their first detection of an eye within the tropical cyclone.[4] Dot curved northwest and then west on October\u00a09, concurrently reaching typhoon intensity and making landfall on northern Luzon at around 06:00\u00a0UTC the same day.[3][2] Upon landfall, Dot's one-minute maximum sustained winds were estimated at 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph) according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC).[3] Dot crossed northern Luzon and emerged into the South China Sea on a westerly heading at Laoag as it maintained typhoon intensity.[3][2] Between October\u00a010\u201311, the typhoon curved towards the northwest and strengthened further.[2] Dot nearly became stationary during the course of this turn approximately 430\u00a0km (270\u00a0mi) southwest of Hong Kong, but resumed a north-northwestward heading with a forward speed of about 11\u00a0km/h (6.8\u00a0mph) the next day.[5] The JTWC estimated that Dot's one-minute sustained winds crested at 165\u00a0km/h (103\u00a0mph) on October\u00a011, while the Royal Observatory estimated that Dot's ten-minute sustained winds peaked at 150\u00a0km/h (93\u00a0mph). The typhoon's central barometric pressure was estimated at 980\u00a0hPa (mbar; 28.94\u00a0inHg) by the Japan Meteorological Agency and 975\u00a0hPa (mbar; 28.79\u00a0inHg) by the HKO. Dot made landfall on China near Hong Kong holding roughly the same intensity at around 00:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a013.[3] The HKO registered a minimum air pressure of 977\u00a0hPa (mbar; 28.85\u00a0inHg) as the center of Dot passed 30\u00a0km (19\u00a0mi) to the east; the typhoon's eye measured 80\u00a0km (50\u00a0mi) across.[5] Once over land, the storm's winds diminished quickly, and by October\u00a014, the JTWC considered Dot to have dissipated. However, data from the JMA indicates that Dot continued as a tropical storm northwards over China until October\u00a015, after which the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone; this phase of Dot's existence continued east-northeast over the East China Sea and to the open Pacific east of Japan until they were last noted on October\u00a019.[3]"

Pat is also one of three storms in the Western Pacific which interacted with each other. Originating from a monsoon trough towards the end of August, Pat first formed on August\u00a024 several hundred miles east of the Philippines. It gradually intensified, and two days later, Pat was upgraded into a tropical storm. The cyclone initially moved east-northeast while continuing to deepen. However, Pat leveled off in intensity on August\u00a027. After turning northwest, Pat attained typhoon intensity on August\u00a028. Pat accelerated towards the north, and reached its peak intensity of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) on August\u00a030. The next day, the storm crossed the southern Japanese islands and entered the Sea of Japan. Gradually weakening, Pat transitioned into an extratropical cyclone later on August 31. Early the next day, the storm moved ashore along northeastern Japan. The system dissipated on September 2 after reentering the Pacific Ocean. A total of 23 perished due to Typhoon Pat and 12 others were rendered as missing. Additionally, 79\u00a0people were injured. Furthermore, 38\u00a0houses in Japan were demolished, 110\u00a0were damaged, and over 2,000\u00a0were flooded. More than 160,000\u00a0homes lost power. A total of 165 flights were cancelled."

        "content": "Typhoon Pat originated from an active monsoon trough located east of the Philippines in the last two weeks of August. Forming around the time as Typhoon Odessa and Tropical Storm Ruby, an area of enhanced convection was first noted towards the end of August. At 0600 UTC on August\u00a024, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started watching the system. Fifteen hours later, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) followed suit. At this time, the system was located within a favorable environment. The JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on the afternoon of August\u00a025.[1] Early the next day, the JMA upgraded the disturbance into Tropical Storm Pat.[2][nb 1] Later on August\u00a026, a Hurricane Hunter aircraft reported winds of 70\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph) and a pressure of 999\u00a0mbar (29.5\u00a0inHg), but did not locate a surface circulation. That afternoon, the TCFA was re-issued. Following additional Hurricane Hunter reports, which noted evidence of a surface circulation, the JTWC declared the system Tropical Storm Pat.[1] Initially poorly organized, Pat headed east-northeast, south of a subtropical ridge.[1] At 0600\u00a0UTC on August\u00a027, the JMA increased the intensity of the storm to 95\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph).[2] Meanwhile, the JTWC anticipated the storm to move east-northeast and separate from the monsoon trough before turning west-northwest under a weakening ridge. Instead, Pat drifted northeast, but remained situated within the monsoon trough. As such, the JTWC revised their forecast, and now expected the storm to move northwest due to the presence of an eastward moving trough situated over Mongolia.[1] Meanwhile, the JMA increased the intensity of Pat to 105\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph) early on August\u00a028.[2] Several hours later, both the JTWC and the JMA upgraded Pat to a typhoon.[4][nb 2] According to the JMA, the storm leveled off intensity for about a day.[2] By midday on August\u00a029, some tropical cyclone forecast models began to show Pat emerging into the Sea of Japan west of the ridge. However, this theory was not supported by the JTWC as they believed that the ridge was too narrow to be picked up a trough.[1] That same day, the JTWC increased the intensity to 160\u00a0km/h (99\u00a0mph), equivalent to a Category\u00a02 cyclone on the United States-based Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.[4] The next day, the agency finally revised its forecast and predicted the storm to enter the sea.[1] Around this time, the JTWC estimated that Pat attained peak intensity, with winds of 170\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph). During the evening of August\u00a030, the JMA reported that Pat reached its peak intensity of 135\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph) and a pressure of 955\u00a0mbar (28.2\u00a0inHg).[4] By this time, the ridge was gone, though a trough was now located near South Korea.[1] Shortly after its peak, Pat moved ashore along the southern tip Kyushu on August\u00a031.[6] Overland, Pat began to weaken, and early the next day, the JMA downgraded Pat to a severe tropical storm.[4] Meanwhile, Pat began to interact with Odessa, as the systems were approximately 500\u00a0km (310\u00a0mi) apart. As Odessa moved east-northeast, Pat accelerated towards the north, and then emerged into the Sea of Japan later on August\u00a031.[1] That evening, the JTWC downgraded Pat into a tropical storm.[4] At 2100\u00a0UTC that day, the JTWC noted that Pat had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. By this time, all the convection activity was restricted to the northeast quadrant of the system. Early on September\u00a01, Pat made landfall in Hokkaido along northeastern Japan.[1] At that time, the JMA estimated winds of 110\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph).[2] At midday, the JTWC stopped watching the system,[1] although the JMA continued to do so until 1800\u00a0UTC on September\u00a02.[2]"

A peak hourly storm total of 107\u00a0mm (4.2\u00a0in) was measured at Gokaharadake on Nagasaki.

Based on this, the JTWC upgraded the system into Tropical Storm Hal.[2][nb 2] Early the next day, the JMA classified Hal as a severe tropical storm.[3] Around this time, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Kuring.[1] Convection soon developed along the northern semicircle of the system, and thus Hal began to quickly intensify.[2] At 1200\u00a0UTC on June\u00a020, both the JTWC and the JMA estimated that Hal attained typhoon strength.[6] Meanwhile, Hal tracked west-northwestward, while situated south of a ridge that extended west over China. However, both the JTWC and its primary tropical cyclone forecast model predicted Hal to move northward, and re-curve northeast. Around this time, the storm passed about 60\u00a0km (35\u00a0mi) north of Luzon.[2] Late on June\u00a021, the JMA estimated that Hal attained its peak intensity, with winds of 145\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 960\u00a0mbar (28\u00a0inHg).[3] Passing near Taiwan, the storm gradually weakened.[6] At 1800\u00a0UTC on June\u00a022, the JMA lowered the intensity of Hal to 135\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph). According to the JMA, the typhoon leveled off in intensity for roughly 30\u00a0hours, before weakening resumed.[3] On the morning of June\u00a024, the JMA downgraded Hal to a severe tropical storm.[3] Five hours later, Hal moved ashore about 150\u00a0km (95\u00a0mi) northeast of Hong Kong at the same intensity.[2][6] By June\u00a026, the JTWC considered Hal dissipated.[2] The next day, the JMA followed suit and ceased watching the system.[6]"

        "content": "When it became apparent that the storm posed a threat to the Philippines, typhoon alerts were issued for much of Luzon, including the nation's capital city of Manila.[7] Although Hal ultimately passed north of the Philippines, Luzon bore the brunt of the typhoon, enduring widespread flooding and significant crop damage.[2] Forty-six people were killed in the Philippines:[8] fatalities included two individuals who drowned when a river overflowed its banks in the Zambales province;[9] a 24-year-old man electrocuted in Manila;[10] a man who became entrapped in a vehicle;[11] three people caught in a landslide; three civilians and a soldier swept down a torrential river;[12] and ten fisherman aboard a stricken ship.[8] A total of 5,242\u00a0families were evacuated,[11] including 50\u00a0in Baguio and 89\u00a0in Olongapo City.[9] In Laoag, 225\u00a0houses were destroyed.[11] Approximately 100\u00a0people moved to higher ground in the Pangasinan province. Roughly 80% of the nearby Santa Barbara municipality was flooded. According to press reports, 200 homes were either damaged or destroyed in the province of Ilocos Norte.[13] Elsewhere, in the province of Cagayan, the typhoon damaged 7,500 acres (3,000\u00a0ha) of rice and 175,000 acres (71,000\u00a0ha) of corn.[12] Widespread power outages were reported, and roads leading to Bagio were closed. Two radio towers were brought down.[9] A total of 127,440\u00a0people were directly affected due to the system.[8] In all, 13,518\u00a0families or 77,542\u00a0persons were left homeless[1] and damage totaled $10.5\u00a0million.[14] Offshore, eight people were injured on the U.S. Naval ship Kirk when a large wave crashed over the bow. Another boat, USB Oldendorf, sustained significant damage due to the heavy seas,[2] and 22\u00a0of its occupants required rescue. Many of the rescued received minor injuries.[9] A total of 13\u00a0people were rescued from the imperiled ship Offshore Patrick.[11] Following the passage of Typhoon Hal in the Philippines, 4,000\u00a0bags of food, 200\u00a0bags of clothes, and 400\u00a0bags of medicine were provided via airlift.[13] A few days after Hal, the nation was later affected by Typhoon Irma.[2] Hal brought heavy rains to much of Taiwan especially along the eastern portion of the island nation, where 9\u00a0in (230\u00a0mm) of precipitation was measured. These rains resulted in flooding, which led to most of the damage.[2] Seven fatalities occurred due to the storm,[12] including five others were initially reported as missing. A 41\u2011year\u2011old woman died due to the collapse of a wooden house. Six people were swept away, including an 11-year-old boy that died and two others were initially rendered as missing.[15] A total of 15 were hurt across the nation,[2] including one child and two farmers.[15] After passing near the Philippines and Taiwan, Hal threatened southern China,[2] becoming the first significant tropical cyclone to do so since Typhoon Ellen in 1983.[12] A total of 200 shelters were opened in Hong Kong, but only 19 people used the shelters. Many schools and business were closed,[13] including all stock markets within Hong Kong.[16] Typhoon Hal brought strong winds to much of southern China. At the Royal Observatory, Hong Kong, winds of 41\u00a0km/h (25\u00a0mph) and wind gusts of 91\u00a0km/h (57\u00a0mph) were recorded.[2] A peak wind gust of 93\u00a0km/h (58\u00a0mph) was observed in the Hong Kong International Airport.[17] Heavy rains were also reported, which led to mudslides.[2] The southern Fujian province was hardest hit, where over 100,000\u00a0people were stranded.[18] Ferry service to Macao was cancelled. A total of 14\u00a0incoming and 12\u00a0out coming flights from Hong Kong were cancelled.[19] Throughout the area, three farmers were reported missing and eight minor injuries were reported. Overall, damage in China was minimal.[19]"

Forming on September 11, 2009, about 1,100\u00a0km (700\u00a0mi) to the east of Guam, the initial disturbance rapidly organized into a tropical depression. By September\u00a012, the depression intensified into a tropical storm, at which time it was given the name Choi-wan. The following day, rapid intensification took place through September\u00a014. Choi-wan attained its peak intensity on September\u00a015, as it moved through the Northern Mariana Islands with the Japan Meteorological Agency reporting peak 10-minute sustained winds of 195\u00a0km/h (121\u00a0mph). Additionally, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center reported the storm to have attained 1-minute sustained winds of 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph). The typhoon remained very powerful until September\u00a017 when the storm's outflow weakened. The typhoon underwent an eyewall replacement cycle, leading to intensity fluctuations. By September 19, Choi-wan rapidly weakened as strong wind shear caused convection to diminish. The following day, the system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and dissipated several hours later over open waters. Despite the intensity of Choi-wan when it passed through the Northern Mariana Islands, no casualties were reported. However, following the storm, the United States Navy deemed that the island of Alamagan was uninhabitable, with all but one of the structures completely destroyed and most of the islands' trees downed. In response to this, all residents on the island were evacuated to nearby Saipan."

        "content": "Early on September 11, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began monitoring an area of convection roughly 1,100\u00a0km (680\u00a0mi) east of Guam.[1] A broad, low-level circulation center had formed within the system and became increasingly organized, showing signs of developing convective banding.[1] A Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert was released later that day as convection was rapidly consolidating around the low, which was embedded within the eastern end of the monsoonal trough.[2] It was then declared as a tropical depression by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and the JTWC with the latter designating it as Tropical Depression 15W[3][4] The tropical depression was tracking westward along the southern edge of the subtropical ridge situated east of the International Date Line.[4] During September 12, the depression continued to develop quickly with both the JMA and the JTWC reporting that the depression had intensified into a Tropical Storm later that day, with the JMA assigning the international name of Choi-wan and the international designation of 0915.[5][6] During September 13, Choi-wan gradually developed whilst moving west with the JMA reporting that Choi-wan had become a severe tropical storm late that day, before reporting along with the JTWC early the next day that Choi-wan had intensified further and had become a weak Typhoon with multiple spiral bands that had wrapped into the fully consolidated center to form a banding eye.[7][8][9] During September 14, Choi-wan intensified further whilst moving along the southwestern edge of a deep level subtropical ridge of the northeast, intensifying into a Category 4-equivalent typhoon on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale with 1-minute winds of 220\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph).[9][10] Early on September 15, the JTWC reported that Typhoon Choi-wan had intensified further and had become a Category 4-equivalent Super Typhoon whilst passing over the island of Alamagan.[11][12] Later that day the JMA reported that Typhoon Choi-wan had reached its 10-minute peak wind speeds of 195\u00a0km/h (121\u00a0mph) and a pressure of 915\u00a0hPa (mbar).[13][14] Typhoon Choi-wan then intensified further and reached its peak 1-minute wind speeds of 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph) which made it the first Category 5-equivalent tropical cyclone on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale anywhere in the world in 2009.[14][15] With the help of excellent poleward outflow and high ocean heat content, Typhoon Choi-wan remained at its peak intensity until early on September 17 when deep convection started to erode in the northwestern quadrant as the tropical upper tropospheric trough (TUTT) cell to the northwest was no longer providing good outflow.[16] Choi-wan was then downgraded to a typhoon by the JTWC as it started to undergo an eyewall replacement cycle, with the JTWC reporting a secondary peak intensity of 150\u00a0km/h (93\u00a0mph), during the next day.[10][17] During September 19, Choi-wan rapidly weakened, as it moved into an unfavorable environment with higher amounts of vertical wind shear, causing the storm's deep convection to erode. As a result of this and dry latitude air wrapping into the low level circulation center, the JTWC decided to downgrade Choi-wan to an extratropical system and released their final advisory, early the next day before the JMA followed suit later that day.[18][19] The JMA then reported that the extratropical low had dissipated completely, early on September 21.[13]"

Additionally, the watches in place for Guam and Rota were discontinued.[21][22] These warnings were kept in force until late on September 14, when the warnings for Tinian were canceled and the typhoon watch for Saipan was canceled, while the typhoon watch was upgraded to a Typhoon Warning as Choi-wan rapidly intensified.[23][24] The Tropical Storm Warning in place for Saipan was canceled during September 15 as Choi-wan intensified into a high-end Category 4 equivalent super typhoon.[25] All watches and warnings were discontinued during the afternoon of September\u00a016 once Choi-wan was no longer a threat to the Mariana Islands.[26] By September\u00a015, shelters were opened throughout Tinian and Saipan at local schools, most schools and all governmental buildings were closed and residents rushed to board up their homes.[27] The American Red Cross had also mobilized on the islands by this time.[28] Some private schools were open during the morning but let out early to allow students to return to their families before the typhoon's arrival. On Saipan, 179 residents sought refuge in shelters by the afternoon of September\u00a015, by which time heavy rain had begun falling.[27] Only one flight was delayed by the typhoon across all the islands.[29] The youth basketball league in the Northern Mariana Islands canceled their games for the time Choi-wan passed through the islands.[30] At the height of the storm, a total of 270 residents sought refuge in shelters on Saipan.[31]"

The most recent storm of Choi-wan's intensity to strike the islands was Chaba in 2004. That storm caused severe damage and widespread flooding. Unlike Chaba, relatively little rainfall fell due to Choi-wan, and no flooding was reported. The main effects from the typhoon in Saipan were downed trees which littered streets across the islands. Power lines were downed and sewer pipes were broken; however, crews began repairing damage once Choi-wan passed.[31] In Garapan, the major shelter on the island sustained minor damage and repair work on it would take roughly a week.[39] On Alamagan, residents attempted to contact officials on other islands on September\u00a017. Despite the extreme intensity of the storm, all sixteen residents on the island, including the 4-day old infant were safe. During their attempted contact, the connection was poor and hard to understand.[40] The following day, the United States Navy sent a ship and helicopter to the island to assess the situation.[41] The Navy stated that the entire island of Alamagan was a total loss, with all but one of the structures, a facility for laboratory and research, completely destroyed and most of the islands' trees downed.[42] Once on the island, they determined that all residents needed to be evacuated \"...whether they like or not\".[42] The first to be evacuated from the island were the infant and six people in the family; the infant was taken to a hospital on Saipan as a precaution. On nearby Agrihan, it was determined that the residents on the island also needed to be evacuated. Prior to their evacuations, they were given relief supplies, mainly food and water, to survive for five days. Roughly 260 gallons of fresh water, 50\u00a0lbs of rice and other health or comfort supplies were delivered by Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron 25 to both islands.[42] On September\u00a021, the Salvation Army announced that residents displaced by the storm would be received donated items, such as clothing, toys, pillows and baby formula.[43]"

The storm tracked northwestward toward Taiwan, and on July\u00a02 it attained its peak intensity with winds of 155\u00a0km/h (96\u00a0mph). Rammasun turned northward, passing east of Taiwan and China. In Taiwan, the outer rainbands dropped rainfall that alleviated drought conditions. In China, the rainfall occurred after previously wet conditions, resulting in additional flooding, although damage was less than expected; there was about $85\u00a0million[nb 1] in crop and fishery damage in one province. After affecting Taiwan and China, Rammasun began weakening due to an approaching trough, which turned the typhoon northeastward. It passed over the Japanese island of Miyako-jima and also produced strong winds in Okinawa. About 10,000\u00a0houses lost power on the island, and high surf killed two sailors. On the Japanese mainland, there was light crop damage and one serious injury. After weakening to a tropical storm, Rammasun passed just west of the South Korean island of Jeju-do, killing one person from high waves. The storm crossed the country, killing three others and leaving $9.5\u00a0million in damage. High rains also affected North Korea and Primorsky Krai in the Russian Far East."

        "content": "Toward the end of June, the monsoon trough extended across the western North Pacific Ocean just north of the equator, spawning two tropical disturbances. The easternmost one eventually developed into Typhoon Chataan, and the western disturbance persisted to the east of Palau with an associated area of convection. The system gradually organized, developing a weak circulation after wind shear steadily decreased.[1] Early on June\u00a028, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) [nb 2] classified the system as a tropical depression near Yap in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM).[2] At the same time, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) declared the system as Tropical Depression Florita,[1] and a few hours later the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)[nb 3] initiated advisories on Tropical Depression 09W.[4] After forming, the depression tracked northwestward, influenced by a ridge to the northeast, although it briefly turned to the northeast due to an increase in westerly winds; however, its northwest motion quickly resumed.[4] A trough over the Philippine Sea increased outflow over the depression, and the convection became better organized.[1] Early on June\u00a029, the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Rammasun.[2] While moving northwestward, the circulation initially remained broad and disorganized, located east of the cycling convection. However, Rammasun steadily intensified, and an eye developed on July\u00a01.[1] That day, the JMA and the JTWC upgraded the storm to a typhoon about 930\u00a0km (580\u00a0mi) east of Luzon in the Philippines.[2][4] The typhoon continued strengthening, developing concentric eyewalls with well-defined rainbands.[1] At 1500\u00a0UTC on July\u00a02, the JMA estimated peak 10 minute sustained winds of 155\u00a0km/h (96\u00a0mph).[2] Early on July\u00a03, the JTWC estimated 1\u00a0minute sustained winds of 205\u00a0km/h (127\u00a0mph) about 350\u00a0km (220\u00a0mi) south-southeast of Okinawa, or 510\u00a0km (320\u00a0mi) southeast of Taiwan.[1] While at peak intensity, Rammasun turned northward, steered around the subtropical ridge to its east,[1] and early on July\u00a03 it struck the Japanese island of Miyako-jima.[2] A stationary trough over China weakened the convection on the western periphery of the typhoon, and the eye gradually became less organized.[1] On July\u00a04, Rammasun began weakening,[2] and by 0000\u00a0UTC on July\u00a05 it was located about 280\u00a0km (170\u00a0mi) east-northeast of Shanghai as a minimal typhoon.[1] Shortly thereafter, Rammasun weakened to tropical storm status.[2] An approaching trough caused the storm to accelerate to the northeast, which weakened the convection and left the circulation exposed.[1] Around 2200\u00a0UTC on July\u00a05, Rammasun made landfall in South Korea,[2] just south of Seosan or about 70\u00a0km (43\u00a0mi) southwest of the country's capital of Seoul.[4] The JTWC estimated that the landfall intensity was around 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph). The storm quickly crossed the country,[1] and although the JTWC considered Rammasun dissipated early on July\u00a06 over the country,[4] the JMA continued tracking the storm toward the northeast, declaring the storm extratropical at 1200\u00a0UTC that day. Early on July\u00a08, the JMA reported that the remnants of Rammasun dissipated to the south of Vladivostok.[2]"

The combined damage in the country totaled $10.3\u00a0million (\u20b1522\u00a0million 2002\u00a0PHP).[nb 4][7] Before the typhoon affected Taiwan, residents in Taipei prepared sand bags,[8] and President Chen Shui-bian ordered the military to be on standby to assist in the storm's aftermath.[9] Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau issued an offshore typhoon warning on July\u00a02, prompting officials to cancel ferry service and restrict water activities in Kenting National Park.[10] After an extended drought that resulted in water restrictions for two months, the typhoon dropped rainfall across the country.[11] In Miaoli County, Rammasun dropped 681\u00a0mm (26.8\u00a0in) of rainfall, the highest total on the island.[1] The rains caused landslides in two villages, although damage was minor.[12] On July\u00a04, the water restrictions were removed island-wide, with the exception of Taipei;[13] the city's restriction was removed a day later after determining that the Feitsui Dam and the Shihmen Dam reached levels approaching their full capacity.[14] In contrast to the previously dry conditions on Taiwan, eastern China was experiencing above-normal rainfall, and many reservoirs were near capacity when Rammasun was approaching the region.[15] While paralleling the eastern coast of China, Rammasun dropped heavy rainfall that reached 225\u00a0mm (8.9\u00a0in) in Ningbo, and wind gusts peaked at 165\u00a0km/h (103\u00a0mph) in eastern Zhejiang.[1] Officials canceled 200\u00a0flights either departing or arriving from Shanghai Pudong International Airport.[16] High winds destroyed a migrant worker village in Shanghai, killing five people. The winds damaged a building that was under construction, injuring 44\u00a0people.[17] A woman was killed in Chongming when winds knocked a wall onto her.[18] Rammasun downed trees and caused power outages in the region, and storm flooding forced over 2,700\u00a0people to evacuate.[17] High winds left about $85\u00a0million in agriculture and aquaculture damage in Zhejiang; however, damage was less than expected due to the storm remaining offshore.[19] Striking the Japanese island of Miyako-jima, the typhoon produced peak wind gusts of 169\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph) while in the eyewall, with sustained winds of 93\u00a0km/h (58\u00a0mph).[1] Similarly strong winds were reported near Okinawa,[1] reaching 90\u00a0km/h (56\u00a0mph).[20] High seas from the typhoon killed two United States Navy sailors.[4] In Okinawa, Rammasun left about 10,000\u00a0houses without power.[21] Two people were injured in the country, one of them severely. A station in Miyazaki Prefecture on the Japanese island of Kyushu reported the highest rainfall associated with Rammasun, with a total of 290\u00a0mm (11\u00a0in). One house in the country was damaged due to the typhoon,[20] and there was at least one report of a landslide. Crop damage in the country totaled $4.4\u00a0million (\u00a5896\u00a0million 2002\u00a0JPY).[nb 5][22][23] The threat of the storm prompted officials to cancel 61\u00a0airplane flights.[24] Typhoon Rammasun passed a short distance west of Jeju-do, an island offshore South Korea,[4] dropping more than 300\u00a0mm (12\u00a0in) of rainfall.[25] High surf killed one person on the island,[17] and officials restricted access to Hallasan mountain and all parks.[26] Seven boats were damaged, and many roads on the island were flooded.[27] Before Rammasun struck the South Korean mainland, airline officials canceled 167\u00a0flights.[16] There were three deaths on the mainland,[4] including one boy who drowned in floodwaters.[28] Damage in the country totaled $9.5\u00a0million,[4] much of it property damage; there was also damage to the rice crop.[5] Rainfall extended into neighboring North Korea, damaging rice and maize.[29] Later, Rammasun brought the average monthly rainfall in only two days in portions of Primorsky Krai, causing flooding along roads and riverways.[30]"

By October 29, 2006, it had burned over 41,173 acres (166.62\u00a0km2) (or 61 square miles (160\u00a0km2)) and was 85% contained. On October 30, 2006, the fire was fully contained. Five firefighters died defending a vacant house locally known as the \"Octagon\" that was ultimately destroyed by the fire: Jason McKay, Jess McLean, Daniel Kurtis Najera, Mark Loutzenhiser and Pablo Cerda.

The fire caused the deaths of five firefighters, destroyed 34 houses and 20 outbuildings, and damaged the pavement of State Route 243.[1] The damage the fire caused is estimated at more than $9 million and was the worst wildfire caused by arson since 1994.[citation needed] The fire spread rapidly in moderate Santa Ana winds, and flammable brush due to the fire's proximity to the Chaparral biome, charring 24,000 acres (97\u00a0km2) in 18 hours. In comparison, the Ventura County Day Fire burned 24,000 acres (97\u00a0km2) in two weeks. There were reports that smoke from the fire could be smelled as far away as San Diego. [citation needed] The firefighters who died were overwhelmed by the fire when the winds shifted and blew the fire towards them. They were trying to defend a house above Cabazon, ultimately lost. Captain Mark Loutzenhiser, 43, from Idyllwild, California; Fire Engine Operator Jess \"Gus\" McLean, 27, from Beaumont, California; Assistant Fire Engine Operator Jason McKay, 27, from Apple Valley, California; Firefighter Pablo Cerda, 23, from Fountain Valley, California; and Firefighter Daniel Hoover-Najera, 20,[2] from San Jacinto, California, were killed defending the \"Octagon House\".[3] McLean and McKay died next to their fire engine without having time to enter it. Hoover-Najera's body was found to the west of the structures they were trying to protect. The surviving two firefighters were transferred to Arrowhead Regional Medical Center, where Loutzenhiser succumbed to his injuries shortly after arriving. Cerda died at 5:08\u00a0p.m. PST on October 31, 2006, in Arrowhead Regional Medical Center from his injuries. On October 26, 2006, FEMA announced it would pay 75% of the costs associated with fighting the fire.[1] The following day, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger declared a state of emergency in Riverside County and ordered flags at the California Capitol building and all California Department of Forestry stations to be flown at half-staff. Firefighters from as far away as Alameda County worked to control the blaze."

Several governments, as well as private agencies, donated to this reward. The State of California, Riverside County, San Bernardino County, the Morongo Band of Mission Indians, the Soboba Band of Luise\u00f1o Indians, and Tim Blixseth, a Coachella Valley logging industry magnate, each donated $100,000. The Riverside County Sheriff Department's Central Homicide Unit arrested Raymond Lee Oyler, a mechanic from Beaumont, on October 31, 2006, for setting two wildfires in the summer of 2006. Inside his car, authorities found a wig, latex gloves, cigarettes, black spray paint, and a partially burned slingshot that was used to launch incendiary devices into the brush. His DNA was found on two cigarette butts used in other nearby wildfires. \"Oyler's girlfriend told police that he had bragged about setting fires and had complained that they weren't big enough. She threatened to leave him if he didn't stop, so he quit for six months, Hestrin said.\"[4] The Riverside County Sheriff's Department announced on November 2, 2006, that Oyler also was charged for his involvement with the Esperanza Fire.[5] Overall, he was charged with almost two dozen counts of arson and 17 counts of setting fires with an incendiary device. Prosecutors alleged that Oyler had set as many as 25 fires throughout the San Gorgonio Pass during the summer of 2006. The fires combined and became more difficult to extinguish. He used a combination of matches and cigarettes to start a fire in Cabazon at the base of the San Jacinto Mountains.[6] \"The defense conceded that Oyler set 11 fires, just not the 2006 Esperanza fire that killed five firefighters.\"[4] On November 11, 2006, it was announced that Oyler was also a suspect in the 2003 Old Fire.[7] However, another person was later convicted of setting that fire. After a week of deliberation, a Riverside jury on March 6, 2009, found Oyler guilty of first-degree murder in the deaths of the five firefighters in the Esperanza fire. On May 9, 2007, Riverside County District Attorney Rod Pacheco said that he planned to seek the death penalty against Oyler.[8]  On June 5, 2009, Oyler was sentenced to death for starting the 2006 Esperanza fire.[9]"

We have six forest fires which have a height of 50 m and are growing, and as a country we do not have the capacity to put them out\".[2]"

It burned primarily in the San Jacinto Mountains in the San Bernardino National Forest. It started on July 15, 2013 at 1:43 PM near the junction of Highway 243 and Highway 74. It burned for 16 days on steep slopes of timber and chaparral above Palm Springs. Heavy rainfall, up to 1.5 inches (3.8\u00a0cm), on July 21 helped bring the blaze under control.[2] It was fully contained on July 30, 2013.[3] Cal Fire investigators said the fire was caused by a failure of \"some type of electrical equipment\" on private property and was not related to utility company equipment.[4] At the fire's peak there were 3,500 firefighters on the lines as well as 20 helicopters, 12 airplanes and 260 engines.[5] The cost of fighting the fire was estimated at $25.8 million.[3]"

The Palm Springs Aerial Tramway and Mount San Jacinto State Park were closed due to unhealthful air quality,[7] and many neighboring areas were warned of possible unhealthful air conditions.

Rich Minnich, a fire scientist from the University of California, Riverside, said this was a poster child for how Southern California wildfires should burn. \"We got an old-growth forest that burned slowly in good weather,\" he said. \"We got a fantastic house cleaning. Someone finally vacuumed the rugs.\"[8] Ken Kietzer, a scientist with the California state parks, echoed the assessment, saying the fire appears to have worked out well for Mount San Jacinto State Park. \"When the fire got into the park, it was for the most part not a crown fire. It was a creeping ground fire. That is going to be very favorable to reducing the buildup of ground fuels and thinning out some of the smaller, shade tolerant understory, which will probably in the long run be a benefit for the park.\"[8] A team of researchers from the San Diego Natural History Museum had been in the area studying the flora and fauna of Mount San Jacinto for comparison with a similar study done 100 years earlier by zoologist Joseph Grinnell; they were forced by the fire to evacuate their research camp. They are finding that the forest is much more dense than it was 100 years ago, partly due to decades of fire suppression. The increased density has altered the animal population as well as making the area more susceptible to large, damaging fires.[8]"

The storm originated as a tropical depression near Guam on August\u00a025, 1981. Moving along a west-northwest to northwest track, the system gradually strengthened as deep convection organized around it. The depression was assigned the name Agnes on August\u00a027 following the development of gale-force winds. Further intensification to typhoon-status occurred by August\u00a029. Agnes attained its peak intensity on August\u00a031 over the East China Sea as a Category\u00a02-equivalent on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale with winds of 175\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph).[nb 1] Subsequent interaction with a mid-latitude trough induced an extratropical transition as the cyclone slowed and turned north. The system had lost most of its tropical characteristics by September\u00a01, with the majority of convection sheared northeast over South Korea and Japan. Agnes later accelerated northeast and completed its transition on September\u00a03. The remnants continued along this course, impacting northern Japan and the Kamchatka Peninsula before last being noted on September\u00a06 near the International Date Line. Throughout the course of Agnes' existence, several countries were affected by torrential rains and typhoon-force winds. Hardest hit was South Korea where record-breaking rains triggered widespread flooding. More than 12,000\u00a0structures were damaged or destroyed by the storm and 191,000 acres (77,000 hectares) of farmland was inundated. A total of 113\u00a0people died in the country while damage reached $134\u00a0million. Taiwan saw similarly destructive rains which left 32\u00a0people dead or missing. A further 14\u00a0people died in mainland China where coastal flooding from the typhoon's slow movement coincided with the spring tide, resulting in the greatest storm surge since 1949 along the Yangtze estuary and Hangzhou Bay. Much of Japan saw rains from the storm, though no significant damage or loss of life took place in the country."

        "content": "On August\u00a023, 1981, following several days of tranquil weather, a tropical upper tropospheric trough (TUTT) began building westward from the International Date Line, near Wake Island. Over the following 36\u00a0hours, an expansive area of convection developed southwest of the organizing TUTT. On August\u00a025, surface observations on Guam in the Mariana Islands indicated the presence of a low-pressure system.[1] Coinciding with this, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) declared the formation of a tropical depression at 06:00\u00a0UTC.[2] Weather reconnaissance missions throughout the day indicated a 1006 mbar (hPa; 29.71\u00a0inHg) center west of Guam, prompting the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. Following improvement in the convective structure, the JTWC began warning on the cyclone as Tropical Depression 18W at 18:00\u00a0UTC, at which time the depression was situated roughly 665\u00a0km (413\u00a0mi) west-northwest of Guam.[1] Tracking west-northwest and later northwest around the southwestern edge of a subtropical ridge, steady intensification of the cyclone ensued. Early on August\u00a027, a reconnaissance plane measured a central pressure of 994\u00a0mbar (994\u00a0hPa; 29.4\u00a0inHg) and flight-level winds of 85\u00a0km/h (53\u00a0mph), indicating the system had become a tropical storm.[nb 2] In light of this, the JTWC assigned the name Agnes to the storm.[1][nb 3] Additionally due to its proximity to the Philippines, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration dubbed the system with the local name Pining.[3] Strengthening occurred at a climatological rate, with Agnes attaining typhoon-status on August\u00a029. A large, banding eye-feature developed within the core of Agnes as it approached the Ryukyu Islands of southwestern Japan. The storm passed 170\u00a0km (110\u00a0mi) south of Okinawa around 06:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a030 and emerged over the East China Sea. Early on August\u00a031, Agnes achieved its peak strength with winds of 175\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph) and an estimated central pressure of 947 mbar (hPa; 27.96\u00a0inHg). This ranked it as a Category\u00a02-equivalent on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale.[1] The JMA estimated the system to have been slightly weaker, with ten-minute sustained winds of 150\u00a0km/h (93\u00a0mph) and a pressure of 950 mbar (hPa; 28.05\u00a0inHg).[2] As the storm moved over the East China Sea on September\u00a01, Agnes began to interact with a mid-latitude trough situated south of South Korea and began a prolonged extratropical transition. Increasing wind shear exposed the center of the typhoon and displaced convection to the north and east. Subsequent slowing of the cyclone's forward speed as it turned northward resulted in an extended period of heavy rain for much of South Korea. The JTWC estimated Agnes to have become predominantly extratropical by the end of September\u00a01, coinciding with the system weakening below typhoon intensity.[1] The JMA, however, maintained the storm as a tropical system as it began moving northwest. The diminishing cyclone moved over the Korea Strait on September\u00a03 and completed its extratropical transition that afternoon. Accelerating over the Sea of Japan, the remnant storm deepened slightly before striking the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido on September\u00a04 with an estimated pressure of 976 mbar (hPa; 28.82\u00a0inHg). After moving over the Sea of Okhotsk, Agnes impacted the Kamchatka Peninsula of Russia on September\u00a05. The system then moved over the open waters of the North Pacific and was last noted near the International Date Line on September\u00a06.[2]"

A few other islands reported winds greater than 90\u00a0km/h (56\u00a0mph).[5] After moving over the Sea of Japan, the storm's remnants brought heavy rains to much of Japan the day after a 6.6\u00a0Mw earthquake rocked eastern parts of the country. Air and sea transportation across the Korean Strait was cancelled for September\u00a03. Landslides were reported across Kyushu, though no casualties occurred.[6] On Shin-Kamigot\u014d, Nagasaki, rain fell at rates of 69\u00a0mm (2.7\u00a0in) per hour on September\u00a03 as Agnes passed to the north.[7] Rainfall in the mainland peaked at 208\u00a0mm (8.2\u00a0in) on Chausuyama in Aichi Prefecture.[4]"

Flood waters, reaching depths of 2.0\u00a0m (6.6\u00a0ft), inundated 238,256 acres (96,419 hectares) of farmland and destroyed 140\u00a0homes. An estimated 3,000\u00a0people were left homeless.[10] Significant water rise occurred along Yangtze estuary and Hangzhou Bay in mainland China as Agnes remained just east of the area for 36\u00a0hours and the coincidence of the spring tide. A peak storm surge of 1.6\u00a0m (5.2\u00a0ft) was measured in the region with continuous onshore flow,[11] the highest since 1949;[9] conversely, in areas with continuous offshore flow, water levels fell by 20\u00a0cm (7.9\u00a0in). Model simulations of the event estimated that a 1.5\u00a0m (4.9\u00a0ft) surge affected the Waigaoqiao Free Trade Zone in Shanghai.[11] Offshore, 300\u00a0vessels sank while the resulting inland floods killed 14\u00a0people.[9] Authorities in Shanghai mobilized 100,000\u00a0personnel to limit the extent of the floods as 200\u00a0sections of seawall collapsed. According to local newspapers, 59,700 acres (24,200 hectares) of farmland flooded and 4,280\u00a0homes were damaged. Losses were estimated in the millions of dollars.[12] High winds downed many trees across the region and debris littered the streets of Shanghai. United States President Jimmy Carter, wrapping up an inspection of the Chinese Navy, was scheduled to take a cruise out of the Huangpu River; however, the typhoon forced the vessel to remain at port.[13]"

This low-pressure area moved over Biscay, Spain on the morning of 10 July and it moved quickly towards the north-east. While it moved towards the east, on the eastern part of the low-pressure area, warm and moist subtropical air arrived from the Mediterranean Sea. This air spread to the south and middle of Germany. This caused high temperatures in the south of Germany (e.g. Karlsruhe 30.6\u00a0\u00b0C on 10 July), but low temperatures in the north of Germany (North Sea area 15\u00a0\u00b0C on 10 July). Meanwhile, on the north-western side of the low-pressure area cold and dry air from the northern polar region moved to the south. During the day the cold dry air moved westwards over France and Germany and moved into the warm and moist air, which had accumulated south-east of the low-pressure area. This caused strong thunderstorms, associated with hail, strong rain and wind gusts. One of this thunderstorm produced two tornadoes, while the storm front crossed from France into Germany on the evening of 10 July. The low-pressure area arrived over northern Germany on 11 July.[3][4] Similar weather situations commonly cause heavy thunderstorms over Pforzheim, with one producing another tornado: On 13 August 1953, another tornado caused significant damage in a part of Pforzheim.[4] The website tornadoliste shows 2 confirmed (1953 and 1968), 1 plausible (5 June 2022, 2 min tornado) and 3 possible (1903, 2003, 2016) tornadoes for Pforzheim.[6]"

Radar operator Black used a phone \"which somehow remained operational for a short time\" and called the office in Birmingham, where he said, \"We\u2019ve been hit\".[7] The radar at the office was completely destroyed by the tornado, with the NWS noting the radar dome \"vanished\".[7] John Brasher, a reporter for the Centreville Press, called the two meteorologists at the Centreville office \"heroes\", as they stayed on the job, knowing they were in the path of the tornado.[6] Along the tornado's entire track, 216 buildings were destroyed, 570 others were damaged, 45 businesses were damaged or destroyed, and 97 trailer homes were destroyed.[2] Grazulis documented that \"more than 12,000 acres of timber were heavily damaged\" by the tornado.[2] In total, the 800-yard (730\u00a0m) wide tornado killed seven people and injured at least 199 people along the 139.1-mile (223.9\u00a0km) track.[1][2] While the NWS officially recorded 199 injuries, Grazulis recorded 208.[1][2] Grazulis also documented this tornado as being most likely a family of tornadoes, with only the first 65 miles (105\u00a0km) being a single tornado.[2] John Brasher and Jim Oakley, another reporter with the Centreville Press, followed the tornado's track and said that \u201cthe tornado never lifted from the ground as it followed Highway 25 the entire way.\u201d[8][9]"

        "content": "Onslow was gazetted on 26 October 1885 as a town to serve the port at Ashburton Roads, at the mouth of the Ashburton River, exporting wool from sheep stations of the Pilbara hinterland. It was named after the then Chief Justice of Western Australia, Sir Alexander Onslow (1842\u20131908).[4][5][6] Wool continued to be the major industry for the next eighty years, despite the extremes of drought and flood that characterize the region and are related to the passage or absence of cyclones. Although a large jetty was built at the original site of Onslow (Old Onslow), repeated cyclone damage and the silting up of the river caused increasing problems with the loading and unloading of visiting ships. The cargo was transferred by lighter from the ship in Ashburton Roads to the jetty, then by horse-tram from the jetty across 6 kilometres (3.7\u00a0mi) of marshland inland to the town. This led the state government in 1923 to develop a new town and jetty 18 kilometres (11\u00a0mi) north-east at Beadon Point.[7][8] The new townsite was gazetted on 10 January 1924, and the residents of Old Onslow moved across in 1925.[7][9] The new location for Onslow's jetty was better protected from storm damage with the townsite more conveniently located on the coast.[10] On 15 May 1943, Onslow became the most southerly town in Australia to be bombed by Imperial Japan in World War II, when a single plane bombed the airfield.[5] However, there was no damage or casualties.[5] Since the war, the declining purchasing power of wool has, despite consistently good rainfall on the inland sheep stations since the late 1960s, led to a change in focus of Onslow's economy from wool to tourism. It is an access point for Coral Coast activities, such as scuba diving on the coral reefs offshore from the town."

Only a few months have average highs below 27 \u00b0C (80.6 \u00b0F). Onslow registered the highest temperature ever recorded in Australia (along with Oodnadatta in January 1960)[11][12] at 50.7\u00a0\u00b0C (123.26\u00a0\u00b0F) on 13 January 2022.[13][14][15] During Onslow's long history, the town has gone through the extremes of heatwaves, heavy rains and cyclones. For example, in 1912, Onslow received only 14.5 millimetres (0.57\u00a0in) of rainfall and during 1935-36 combined only 126 millimetres (4.96\u00a0in) fell.[17][18][19]  \nWhile in 1961 a record 997.9 millimetres (39.29\u00a0in) was recorded, most of which fell between late January and early March, a result of three cyclone impacts within five weeks.[16][20][21] These cyclones brought heavy rain and destructive winds to Onslow, resulting in flooding and damage to buildings.[20]\nA major long-term drought between 1935 and 1941, during which time only one cyclone hit (in April 1937) and did not produce rain on the inland sheep stations, led to a decline in Onslow's fortunes."

Destructive wind gusts of 231 kilometres per hour (144\u00a0mph; 64\u00a0m/s) were recorded during the cyclone, which bent telephone poles, leaving them parallel with the ground.[20] On 19 February 1975, Severe Tropical Cyclone Trixie crossed the coast near Onslow, with the cyclone's centre passing directly over nearby Mardie.[20] A wind gust of 246 kilometres per hour (153\u00a0mph; 68\u00a0m/s) were recorded at Onslow, whilst wind gusts of 259 kilometres per hour (161\u00a0mph; 72\u00a0m/s) at Mardie (This was the limit of the recorder, so the gusts at Mardie may have been higher).[20][22] At the time, the wind gust recorded at Onslow was the highest recorded in Australia.[20][23]"

Fire trucks had been sent to fight the fire in the morning but were trapped following a sudden and dramatic change in wind direction.[3] Two of the trucks became bogged leaving their crews unable to escape.

        "content": "In early 1961, a series of bushfires burned in the south-west region of Western Australia.[1] The devastating fires burned large areas of forest in and around Dwellingup from 20 to 24 January, at Pemberton and in the Shannon River region between 11 and 15 February,[1] and in the Augusta-Margaret River area in early March.  There were also major fires which burned in the Darling Scarp around Kalamunda.  The towns of Dwellingup and Karridale were largely destroyed by the fires, as were a number of smaller railway and mill settlements. There was no loss of human life. Whilst the 1960 rainy season over the affected region had not been excessively dry, rainfall had been below average over the region affected by the fires ever since August of that year - thus the forests were perhaps even drier than they would normally be by January. However, the underlying cause of the Dwellingup fires lay far to the north in the Pilbara, where a tropical cyclone had formed on 15 January northeast of Darwin had followed a trajectory along the north west Western Australian coast and intensified north east of Onslow and then moved steadily southwards, hitting that town on 24\u201325 January while having a central pressure of 920 hPa. Hurricane-force winds demolished several buildings and storm surge inundated the town with 1.8 metres water. With a strong high pressure system to the east of the cyclone remaining almost stationary for some days, hot north-easterly winds developed and became so intense that by the 20th maximum temperatures throughout the south west were uniformly above 40\u00a0\u00b0C (104\u00a0\u00b0F) and remained at that level for the following five days. During this period,  as the cyclone moved slowly along the coast it drenched Onslow and the neighbouring district, but only dry thunderstorms occurred in the south-west, which started fires that spread extremely rapidly in the hot, windy conditions. The first fires were reported from Dwellingup, 110 kilometres (68\u00a0mi) south of Perth,  on 19 January and the following day fires erupted in the timbered country of the Darling Scarp around Mundaring and Mount Helena. Although as the cyclone tracked down the west coast some rain came around 25 January to ease the fires,[2][3] not all were fully extinguished. Moreover, as the normal dry summer weather evaporated further moisture from the forests, when another severe cyclone hit Onslow on 12 February it caused even stronger winds (sustained at up to 60 kilometres per hour (37\u00a0mph) with much stronger gusts) and as this cyclone moved inland, lost intensity and produced no rain in fire-affected areas, decaying bushfires were re-ignited. The fire from Dwellingup consequently moved downslope toward the major town of Pinjarra where it burned a significant portion of the town's buildings\u2014500 people were left homeless.  As the forests surrounding began re-igniting, the entire population of a number of other mill towns was relocated to Dwellingup in the following days. The fires continued to burn owing to the strong winds, and many tiny timber towns were completely burnt out - Holyoake, Nanga Brook, Marrinup and Banksiadale; and were never re-built. The 2 March saw Onslow\u2019s third cyclone in five weeks, which like the second did not produce any rain in the affected areas and led to temperatures reaching in Perth 37.8\u00a0\u00b0C (100.0\u00a0\u00b0F) on the first two days of March for the first time. Fires spread southward to Augusta-Margaret River Shire, though some in that area were thought to have been deliberately lit, and continued to rage within 25 kilometres of Perth city.[4] Although rain was predicted,[4] it did not eventuate. Despite the dryness of the cool change, an easing of the winds allowed fire fighters to finally bring the flames under control. However, in all it is estimated that the fires burned a total of 4,400 square kilometres (1,700\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of bushland, and property damage far exceeded this. Following the fires, a Royal Commission was conducted to investigate causes and in following years many recommendations were made to improve controlled burning in the tall eucalypt forests of the south-west."

A few false typhoon alerts had been announced earlier in the year. The next morning, the Praya scene from west to east was heart-rending: one could easily find boats capsized and corpses floating and drifting on the water with some bodies washed ashore by the high tides. The sizeable Stonecutters' Island Gaol was left in ruins and both the Police Courts and Victoria Gaol were unroofed.  The damage overall was considered \"incalculable\".[3] Ernst Eitel recounted how many of the European and Chinese houses were ruined and became roofless; big trees were unrooted and corpses were found in the ruins and started surfacing at the waterfront from the wrecked ships.[8] A visitor arriving on a steamer from Peking during the typhoon reported that the waterfront was nearly swept away, hardly a tree was left standing in the Botanical Gardens and many buildings were found roofless and in ruins. People were hastily burying the dead for the heat was intense and there was great concern over the outbreak of contagious diseases.[9] Following the incident, Brazilian astronomer Francisco Ant\u00f4nio de Almeida, in his 1879 account describes an episode of arson and looting at two warehouses in which foreigners were murdered, for which the two Chinese perpetrators were sentenced to death. Almeida also cites English newspapers of the time who estimated up to eight thousand people killed in the typhoon, many of them being Spanish families fleeing the Carlist Wars, and originally bound for the Philippines.[10]"

Gracie was a storm that was very difficult to forecast, with its movement unpredictable.[2] After five days of erratic motion, Gracie became a major hurricane which struck South Carolina, and weakened as it moved up the Appalachians, bringing much needed rain to a drought-plagued region.

It turned to the east on September 25, and turned back west to west-northwest on September 27 as a stable anticyclone built in to its north.[2][5] Gracie quickly strengthened and reached its peak of 140\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h) winds on September 29, but cooler air and land interaction weakened it slightly to a 130\u00a0mph (215\u00a0km/h) Category 4 major hurricane at the time of its landfall at 1625 UTC over St. Helena Sound near the south end of Edisto Island in South Carolina.[6][7] After landfall, Gracie moved inland and north and became extratropical on September 30. Gracie's remnants persisted for several days as they slowly turned northeastward and then eastward. Gracie's remnants emerged into the Atlantic on October 2, before dissipating later that day.[8]"

The Garden Club of South Carolina replaced numerous trees after the storm.[18] Wind damage was quite significant across South Carolina, particularly the city of Beaufort, South Carolina, with many downed trees, telephone poles, and streetlights. Also, numerous windows were shattered and shingles were torn off of roofs. A number of creeks overflowed causing floodwaters that, in areas, were several feet deep. The opening of the Beaufort Center of the University of South Carolina was delayed due to Gracie.[19] It would be 30\u00a0years before another major hurricane struck South Carolina: Hurricane Hugo in September 1989.[8]"

The tornado began moving east, first reaching EF2 intensity near a golf clubhouse, where a flag pole and light were pushed over.[7] The tornado briefly weakened to EF1 before reaching EF3 intensity in a subdivision in the northern part of Maryland Heights, where most walls of a house were collapsed. EF2 damage was also found in areas around the house, with EF1 damage in the northern part of the neighborhood along the edge of the track.[8] Low-end EF2 damage continued further east. After crossing Highway 270, the tornado weakened to EF1 intensity as it impacted more homes on the other side of the highway. As the tornado moved into Bridgeton, it reached EF4 intensity along the northern side of Old St. Charles Road, with several adjacent homes in this area being flattened.[9] A condo in the area was also heavily damaged by the winds, with a large portion of the roof and decking being torn off.[10] High-end EF3 damage was also reported at several houses at the end of Beaverton Drive, with most being flattened.[11] A power station and a few retail locations were also nearly flattened at EF3 intensity.[12] The tornado weakened to a high-end EF1 as it crossed Highway 67 and Highway 70, damaging some houses in neighborhoods to the east. [13] The tornado turned slightly north as it hit the eastern section of St. Louis Lambert International Airport at around 8:10 PM.[5] Concourse C had a large section of its roof torn off when the tornado struck. Many windows at the airport were blown out, and signs were damaged as well. Vehicles outside were tossed by the tornado, including a van that was partially pushed over the edge of a parking garage. Lambert Airport released a surveillance video showing debris swirling inside the airport as people ran for cover.[14] It was reported that an aircraft was moved away from its jetway by the storm, with passengers still on board.[15] One plane from Southwest Airlines was damaged when the wind pushed a conveyor belt used for loading baggage into it. American Airlines said that four of its planes were damaged, two of them significantly. One was buffeted by 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) crosswinds while taxiing in from a landing when the tornado hit and the other had possible damage to its landing gear.[16] The tornado was at EF2 intensity when it hit the airport.[2][14] The tornado continued at low-end EF2 intensity as it moved into the suburbs of Berkeley, Kinloch and Ferguson, where many homes suffered roof loss, along with Berkeley High School, which did not suffer much damage, however, tree and outbuilding damage was reported around the edges of the property.[17] Homes on the western edge of Kinloch saw EF2 damage, while the Kinloch City Hall was narrowly missed. EF1 tree damage with occasional EF2 damage to structures continued through Kinloch and the eastern part of Berkeley. The tornado would move just to the north of the downtown area of Ferguson. A restaurant and church on Blackburn Avenue lost the majority of their roofing, with several windows being broken at the church.[18] More low-end EF2 damage was reported to houses northeast of downtown Ferguson. The tornado weakened back to EF1 intensity further east, where light damage was reported at the Griffith Elementary School. The tornado passed north of the main areas of Dellwood, where houses and trees would be damaged at EF1 intensity, however, some areas of EF2 damage were reported at several locations east of Dellwood, which included several large power poles that were snapped.[19] The tornado continued into the community of Bellefontaine Neighbors, where light to moderate roof damage was reported at several homes. Isolated low-end EF2 damage was found, but most damage was EF1-level in this area. Further east, trees and some homes suffered low-end EF1 damage. Light tree damaged occurred at North Riverfront Park before the tornado crossed the Mississippi River into Illinois.[20] Low-end EF1 damage would occur in areas west of Nameoki Township, with the tornado narrowly missing an industrial park along Highway 3. The tornado reached EF2 intensity for the last time in areas north of Maryland Place and Pontoon Beach, before dissipating just to the north of Pontoon Road at 8:31 PM."

At least two dozen tornadoes were reported that day, with more than three times that many reports of large hail and strong winds, causing widespread swaths of damage to crops, buildings, and other personal property across much of eastern South Dakota and southwest Minnesota. The first tornado, spawned by a supercell thunderstorm, touched down in Charles Mix County, South Dakota about 1:00 pm. The last tornado was reported shortly before midnight that evening, ending an 11-hour period of intense severe weather across eastern South Dakota and southwest Minnesota. Until the record was broken in 2010, the 27 tornadoes that touched down in Minnesota on June 16 mark the largest single day tornado outbreak in Minnesota since accurate records started being kept in 1950.[1][2] Remarkably there was only one fatality from this outbreak, that coming from an F5 tornado in Chandler, Minnesota. In addition to the F5, three F4 tornadoes were reported in Murray County, Minnesota, and Mitchell and McPherson counties in Kansas. Damage estimates for the two days were in excess of $160 million.[3][4][5][6] This outbreak played a large part in a record setting month in June, 1992. The 399 tornadoes that touched down in that month was a United States record at the time, breaking the old record of 335 tornadoes set in May, 1991. This record was eventually broken, when 543 tornadoes touched down during May, 2003.[7] This record, though, would broken in turn when over 750 tornadoes touched down in April 2011.[8][9]"

        "content": " Mount Bold Reservoir is the largest reservoir in South Australia with a maximum capacity of over forty-six thousand megalitres. Costing A$1.1 million, the reservoir took six years to construct on the Onkaparinga River system between 1932 and 1938. The reservoir does not connect directly to the main reticulation system; rather, to maintain levels at Clarendon Weir, water is released only as required. Much of the water from Mount Bold will eventually end up at Happy Valley Reservoir and used to supply parts of the Mount Lofty Ranges and also Adelaide. A major renovation was completed in 1964 when the level of the dam was raised 6.4 metres to increase the reservoir's capacity by approximately 17,000 megalitres. Although originally supplying its own electricity through a small hydro-electricity plant, this was discontinued in 1961. However, Mount Bold is now considered a possible site for a future commercial mini-hydro generator. In early June 2007, the South Australian Government began a scoping study into expanding the reservoir's capacity fivefold to 240 gigalitres at an estimated cost of A$850 million.[1] The plan was criticised by the Opposition as not providing any new water, and by ecologist David Paton as threatening surrounding wildlife.[2] On 26 September 2010, Mount Bold Reservoir was opened for the first time since 2005 after receiving large amounts of rainfall in the week leading up to the date. The resulting water flushed out the Onkaparinga Catchment, causing several flooded roads but removing debris which had been building up for many years.[3]"

Nelson originated from a tropical disturbance southeast of Guam towards the middle of March. Although the system was initially poorly organized, it developed rather quickly, and was upgraded into Tropical Storm Nelson on March\u00a019. It tracked westward, and fluctuated in intensity for several days. On March\u00a024, Typhoon Nelson intensified into a typhoon, and entered an episode of rapid intensification. On March\u00a025, Nelson reached its peak intensity of 115\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph), but thereafter moved ashore on the Philippines, where the storm weakened significantly. On March\u00a027, the typhoon entered the South China Sea, and the next day, briefly re-intensified before resuming a weakening trend. Nelson dissipated on March\u00a031. Affecting the nation less than a week after Tropical Storm Mamie did, Nelson was responsible for additional flooding across much of the Philippines. Fifty-six people were killed due to the typhoon, eight of whom perished due to drownings. Over 1,200\u00a0homes were destroyed. More than 165,000\u00a0people fled to shelters, including 83,000\u00a0that were displaced from their home. Thirty fishing boats and 23\u00a0ferries were destroyed due to the system.

        "content": "The second of three early season tropical cyclones to form in the West Pacific basin, Typhoon Nelson can be traced back to a low latitude area of disturbed in mid-March.[1][nb 2] The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started watching the system at 0000\u00a0UTC on March\u00a018[3][nb 3] while a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) was issued. Initially, the system was disorganized, but the disturbance was located in a favorable environment aloft and began to develop rapidly. Ten hours after the TCFA, the JTWC upgraded the system into a tropical depression.[1] Early on March\u00a019, the JMA classified the system as a tropical storm.[3] Later that morning, Hurricane Hunters reported winds of 95\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph) and a barometric pressure of 993\u00a0mbar (29.3\u00a0inHg).[1] Based on this, the JTWC designated the system as Tropical Storm Nelson.[5] Nelson tracked westward, staying south of a large subtropical ridge. Despite the aforementioned favorable environment,[1] Nelson briefly weakened late on March\u00a019, but re-intensified slightly the following morning.[5] Shortly thereafter, the JTWC upgraded the system into a typhoon. Further intensification was halted due to increased easterly wind shear,[1] and the storm began to level off in intensity[5] as it accelerated on a westward course.[1] On March\u00a021, the JMA declared Nelson a severe tropical storm.[3] According to the JTWC, the storm fluctuated between tropical storm and typhoon status for about 60\u00a0hours,[1] even though the JMA suggest that Nelson did not become a typhoon until March\u00a024.[3] Around this time, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also started monitoring the storm, assigning it with the local name Bising.[6] After becoming a typhoon, Nelson forward's speed began to slow down as the storm began to move away from the ridge and encounter more conducive conditions. Consequently, Typhoon Nelson began to deepen more rapidly,[1] and by the afternoon of March 25, both the JTWC and JMA increased the intensity to 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph).[5] Although the JMA suggests the system reached its peak intensity at that time,[3] the JTWC indicated that Nelson strengthen slightly on March 25, and attained winds of 195\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph), equivalent to a major hurricane or a Category 3 system on the United States-based Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.[1] Shortly thereafter, the storm moved ashore in the Philippine at peak intensity.[5] After making landfall, Nelson weakened over the south-central portion of the nation. By March 26, the JMA had lowered the winds to 160\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph).[3] By March\u00a027, Nelson re-emerged into the South China Sea, having weakened considerably,[1] and data from both the JMA and JTWC indicated that Nelson was no longer a typhoon.[5] The next day, Nelson briefly re-intensified slightly, and at 1800\u00a0UTC on March\u00a028, the JMA estimated a secondary peak intensity of 105\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph).[3] On the following day, Nelson resumed weakening due to increased wind shear. Despite the presence of a trough, Nelson did not recurve northeast, and instead meandered westward.[1] On the afternoon of March\u00a031, the JMA ceased watching Nelson.[3] On the next day, the JTWC followed suit while located about 450\u00a0km (280\u00a0mi) east of Nha Trang, Vietnam.[1]"

The house and shed on the property did not burn when the fire started.[33] Western Power restored power to more homes leaving 480 properties without power.[34] Repairs and restoration of the network were to take weeks to complete.[34] Power poles and other materials were accumulated close to the bushfire site.[34] Construction teams were to begin on Saturday 6 and Sunday 7 February, with the work expected to take weeks.[34]"

Visiting other people was not allowed, and masks had to be worn in public.[40][41] During the evacuation of residences near the fire, there was confusion about whether people could go to family and friend's houses or not due to the lockdown restrictions. The police commissioner, Chris Dawson, stated \"If you are under threat, leave your property. Do not stay in the property if you think you have to obey the COVID-19 rules.\" Premier Mark McGowan stated \"Right now, WA is battling two different kinds of emergencies \u2013 a dangerous fire emergency and a COVID-19 lockdown emergency.\"[42][43] Firefighters followed COVID-19 Safe Operations Guidelines, prepared by DFES to manage the risk of responding to an emergency during an outbreak. The Guidelines recommend crews limit sharing of personnel across vehicles or teams but there was no limit to the number of firefighters in each vehicle (as initially stated).

Almost 70% of the Australian Capital Territory's (ACT) pastures, pine plantations, and nature parks were severely damaged,[1] and most of the Mount Stromlo Observatory was destroyed. After burning for a week around the edges of the ACT, the fires entered the suburbs of Canberra on 18 January 2003. Over the next ten hours, four people died, over 490 were injured, and 470 homes were destroyed or severely damaged, requiring a significant relief and reconstruction effort."

        "content": "On 8 January 2003, lightning strikes started four fires in New South Wales, over the border but in close proximity to Canberra. Despite their proximity and very small initial sizes, low intensity, and low rate of spread, these fires were not extinguished or contained by New South Wales emergency services personnel. Subsequent inquiries into the bushfires, including the Roche report, the McLeod inquiry, and the Coroners Report, identified poor management of the initial response as a key contributor to the disaster that unfolded on 18 January 2003. On 13 January, a Bell Jet Ranger helicopter that had been waterbombing the fires in the forests west of Canberra crashed into Bendora Dam with one person, pilot Duncan Patrick, injured. The pilot was reloading water buckets from the dam at the time of the crash. ACT Chief Minister Jon Stanhope and ACT Chief Fire Control Officer Peter Lucas-Smith were reviewing the fires nearby during a routine bushfire surveillance flight in the Snowy Hydro SouthCare helicopter. The unconscious pilot had been pulled from the sinking wreckage by a SouthCare rescue helicopter medical crewman Euan McKenzie, but due to the weight of his clothes and lack of life vest, was unable to be dragged from the water.[2][3] The pilot of the Southcare chopper cautiously positioned his aircraft to allow Stanhope, Lucas-Smith and a paramedic on board to dive into the dam and bring the injured pilot about 60 metres to shore for resuscitation by Lucas-Smith and McKenzie.[4][5][6][7] The pilot had head injuries and underwent emergency surgery at Canberra Hospital.[8] Both Stanhope and Lucas-Smith received the Royal Life Saving Society's rescue medal to commemorate their bravery in the rescue. McKenzie received the society's highest award, the Bravery Cross,[9] which recognises undertaking a rescue in an aquatic environment under circumstances that endanger the rescuer's life.[10] On 17 January, the Emergency Services Bureau (ESB) released its final media release prior to 18 January, at 8:50\u00a0pm.[11] This media release differed to any previous one in format and content. It also provided several clues that were overlooked in the assessment of the risk Canberra faced. For example, one point of the release stated that bushfire logistical support staging areas were being relocated from Bulls Head and Orroral Valley (far outside urban Canberra) to the North Curtin District Playing Fields (far inside urban Canberra),[12] signalling both a major retreat by fire fighters and pointing to imminent danger to the city itself."

        "content": "The morning of Saturday 18 January 2003 was hot, windy and dry. Temperatures as high as 40\u00a0\u00b0C (104\u00a0\u00b0F) and winds exceeding 80 kilometres per hour (50 miles per hour), plus a very low relative humidity, were the main weather features of the day. Two fires continued to burn out of control in the Namadgi National Park, with the entire park, along with the Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve, being closed due to the threat. A second fire, in the Brindabella Ranges, was threatening to break containment lines. By 9\u00a0am on the morning of Saturday 18 January, burned leaves appeared on lawns in houses in the Weston Creek, Kambah, and Tuggeranong suburbs bordering the western extremity of Canberra. By 10\u00a0am, news helicopters were overflying Duffy and reporting news of the fires interstate and internationally. Throughout the day, the fires burned closer to the fringes of Canberra's suburbs, and there was no sign of authorities gaining control of the situation. At around 2\u00a0pm, police evacuated the township of Tharwa to the south of Canberra. By mid-afternoon, it had become apparent that the fires posed an immediate threat to the settlements near Canberra, such as Uriarra and Stromlo, as well as to the houses on the city's urban-bushland interface. A state of emergency was declared at 2.45\u00a0pm by the ACT's Chief Minister, Jon Stanhope. The fires reached the urban area at 3\u00a0pm. The first emergency warning advisories were broadcast shortly after, on radio and television, with the advisories updated throughout the day. These advisories, accompanied by the Emergency Warning Signal stated that a significant \"deterioration\" of the fire situation in the ACT had occurred and placed several suburbs on alert to evacuate. As the day continued, these advisories advised the evacuation of several suburbs (also enforced by Police on the ground) and placed most suburbs of Canberra on some level of alert. By now, the fire had reached the fringes of many suburbs, was surrounding Tharwa, and threatened the historic Lanyon Homestead, which was hosting a wedding and protected by only a single fire truck. By 3.50\u00a0pm, some houses were alight in the suburbs of Duffy and Chapman, with the loss of a home in Holder soon after. An ACT Fire Brigade unit, perceiving the fire from a vantage point in Fyshwick, overrode instructions by the radio controller to ignore the signs and remain where they were. The unit headed to Duffy, attempting to alert both controllers and residents to the imminent danger. That unit was caught in a fire front on Warragamba Avenue Duffy at around 4.10\u00a0pm, after having rescued at least two residents. Both the crew and residents were forced to flee the appliance when the fire struck. Due to fire damage to infrastructure and extreme winds bringing down powerlines across the area, large parts of the city lost power. Fires also started in Giralang because of powerline problems. Evacuation centres were set up at four schools \u2013 Canberra College, UC Senior Secondary  College Lake Ginninderra (then Lake Ginninderra College), Erindale College, and Narrabundah College. A dark cloud hung over the city, and, although it was not in danger, Parliament House was closed. By 5\u00a0pm, houses were reported destroyed in Duffy, Chapman, Kambah, Holder, and Rivett, as well as in the small forestry settlement of Uriarra. It was later found that the first casualty of the fires, an elderly woman named Dorothy McGrath, had died at the nearby Stromlo Forestry Settlement.[13] Escape for residents was hampered by poor warning and by the settlement's location, surrounded by the pine forest. Fires in the Michelago area forced the closure of the Monaro Highway into Canberra. Fires spread through the Kambah Pool area and into the suburb of Kambah, causing damage to many homes and one of the ACT's primary Urban and Rural fire stations. Fire spread through parkland, crossing the Tuggeranong Parkway and Sulwood Drive finally engulfing Mount Taylor. Within an hour, houses were also burning in Torrens, on the slopes of Mount Taylor, and in Weston. The fires by now had inflicted severe damage to the city's infrastructure. Power supplies were cut to several suburbs. These outages affected both the Emergency Services Bureau's own headquarters in Curtin and the Canberra Hospital (running on back-up generators), which was under intense pressure from people suffering burns and smoke inhalation. In Curtin, the ESA headquarters was in danger from the fires. With back-up power available only to the Communications Centre, many personnel were forced to work on tables outside as Army Reserve personnel hosed down the building.[14] It was later noted that the ESB could have moved its operations away from danger to other emergency service locations such as the AFP Winchester Centre or Tuggeranong Police Station.[14] Water, gas, sewerage, and communications were heavily affected. Water, gas, and landline communications was unavailable to several suburbs due to damage to supply lines and city reservoirs. Mobile telecommunications were severely affected due to increased traffic, causing serious disruption to mobile phone networks and the ESA's own radio and dispatch networks. A local generator services business later reported on their website that the ash and smoke were so intense, that some back-up power diesel generators at communication and data centres failed to produce enough power due to air intake filters clogging up. At least one generator air intake filter burned as it sucked in burning leaves blowing in the strong winds. The fires impacted part of the Lower Molonglo Water Quality Control Centre (LMWQCC), responsible for treating the city's sewage and waste water before its release into the Molonglo River. The plant's operations were disrupted due to fire damage, causing concern about the possible release of sewage into the Molonglo River, as the plant's reserve storage could only hold one day of surplus. However, the lack of resources and equipment failures for crews protecting the plant could have led to a catastrophe, as detailed in Danny Camilleri's testimony in Coroner Maria Doogan's subsequent inquest into the fires.  Camilleri testified that his crews arrived to find much of the area around the plant on fire, with a significant risk of the fire endangering dangerous substances stored at the plant to treat waste, including chlorine.[15] He stated that if the fire had caused a breach in the chlorine tanks, it would have created \"a poisonous cloud that would blow toward Canberra necessitating mass evacuations\".[15] By 10\u00a0pm, one of the four evacuation centres in Canberra was completely full, and the others were filling up quickly. Reports of looting also began to arrive from the damaged areas. Both Prime Minister John Howard and Governor General Peter Hollingworth changed their plans to return to Canberra as soon as was possible.[clarification needed] While the very worst of the fires had passed, the situation was still far from stable, and going into Sunday, 19 January, houses were still ablaze across numerous suburbs."

        "content": "By the evening of 19 January, it was clear that the worst-hit suburb was Duffy, where 200+ residences were destroyed,[16] and that four people had died: Alison Tener, 38, Peter Brooke, 74, and Douglas Fraser, 60, and Dorothy McGrath, 76, of the Mount Stromlo Forestry Settlement.[17][18] The loss of life, damage to property, and destruction of forests to the west of the city caused not just economic loss but significant social impacts. Bushfires severely harmed the vegetation of the Cotter River Catchment and caused water quality problems in the three dams in the catchment: Corin, Bendora and Cotter Dams. For quite some time after the fires, turbidity in the water due to silt and ash from surrounding burnt-out forests meant Canberra had to rely on Googong Dam on the Queanbeyan River, which was not affected by the fires. Given the drought and existing water shortages, this effectively reduced Canberra's water reserves to around 15% for some time. An upgrade to the Stromlo Water Treatment Plant was subsequently required to allow extra filtration of water to cope with the diminished quality in the future. As with any bushfire, the environment will take significant time to regenerate. Regeneration of vegetation was delayed by an ongoing drought in the region."

Instrumentation and engineering workshops, the observatory's library, and the main administration buildings were consumed. The visitors' centre or \"Exploratory\" housing public exhibits and cafe escaped the fires unscathed, despite being on the edge of a steep gradient, which fires had roared up, and being only metres from the 74-inch (1.88\u00a0m) telescope, which was completely destroyed. The insurance payment sought by the Australian National University (ANU), amounting to 75 million Australian dollars, could have become the largest insurance claim in Australian history. However, in August 2009, during trial in the ACT Supreme Court, the three insurance companies settled out of court, paying the ANU an undisclosed sum.[20] A related claim against ANU's insurance broker, Aon Risk Services Australia Ltd, for failing to renew insurance coverage on some structures, was also settled for an unstated amount in June 2011.[21] Canberra artist Tim Wetherell was commissioned by ANU[22] to produce a sculpture from the ruins of the Mount Stromlo telescopes.  The finished sculpture was named \"The Astronomer\" and installed in the Parliamentary Triangle, outside Questacon."

The memorial was designed by Canberra artists Tess Horwitz, Tony Steel and Martyn Jolly and incorporates elements requested by the ACT community. It is a journey from the day of the fire, through the process of recovery, to the honouring of memory. The entrance memorial walls are made from the community's salvaged bricks, which are inscribed with messages of grief and gratitude. Beyond the walls, a site framed by a grove of casuarinas contains red glass and metal forms, referring to the force of the firestorm and to the lightning strikes that sparked the main fires. An avenue leads to an amphitheatre enclosing a pond and bubbling spring. Glass columns bordering the pond contain details from photos provided by the community which speak of memory and human resilience. On 18 February 2006, an independent group of fire victims installed a plaque to honour the four people who died in the fires and the volunteer firefighters who fought so hard. The plaque is located at the end of the walkway to the memorial, immediately before the memorial walls. Fire victims and residents held a simple ceremony to mark the occasion."

Areas just outside Pilot Knob, a small town in Missouri, were affected by two separate F2 tornadoes that caused considerable damage. The northern fringe of Metropolis in Illinois was also hit by a damaging F3 tornado in which homes were completely destroyed. In eastern and central Missouri alone, over 400 homes or other structures were badly damaged or destroyed. 10 people were injured.[1] Several tornadoes also occurred north of Birmingham, Alabama \u2013 three of which were rated as F2's. In addition to the tornadoes, there were numerous reports of straight-line wind damage and hail larger than baseballs, as well as countless reports of damage from flash flooding due to the heavy rains as a result of the thunderstorms. This was one of the most widespread non-tropical September outbreaks in United States history, yet no tornado-related deaths occurred (although 12 people were killed by other thunderstorm impacts).[1]"

The fire burned out around 180\u00a0ha (440 acres) of grass and swampland. It threatened the small community of Duranbah near the Queensland and New South Wales border.[9] On 10 October 2020, a bushfire began in the Royal National Park near Waterfall on Kangaroo Ridge, south of Sydney. The New South Wales Rural Fire Service (NSWRFS) believes this started due to a spot fire from a hazard reduction burn on the other side of the Princes Highway. The fire severely disrupted highway and railway traffic as both were halted that afternoon. As of 11 October, it was burning out of control in a north-easterly direction and was 286\u00a0ha (710 acres) in size. The railway was open and the highway operated at reduced speeds.[10][11] The 'Marie Bashir', the NSWRFS's Boeing 737 Large Air Tanker water bombing aircraft was used to fight it on 10 and 11 October, the first time the aircraft was used this fire season.[10][12] On 23 November 2020, a bushfire flared to Watch and Act Level at Glenugie south of Grafton due to a short-lived heatwave which soared temperatures on the North and Far North Coastlines. It crossed the Pacific Highway and caused numerous spot fires adjacent to the Highway.[13] On 28 November 2020, severe fire danger warnings were in place for the Far North Coast, North Coast, Greater Hunter, Greater Sydney Region and North Western region. There was a very high fire danger for Illawarra, Shoalhaven, Central Ranges, New England and Northern Slopes. Total fire bans were in place in all those localities.[14] On 29 November 2020, three fires flared to Watch and Act level as a result of a heatwave of up to 40\u00a0\u00b0C (104\u00a0\u00b0F), and 90\u00a0km/h (56\u00a0mph) winds that had been wreaking havoc since 28 November. The first fire began in the suburb of Northmead, threatening homes there. Multiple RFS crews went to the area, and helicopters scooped water from the Parramatta River to douse flames.  One home was fire damaged. By 3pm the fire was under control.[15] The second fire broke out in Faulconbridge, a suburb of the Blue Mountains,[14] and quickly spread by 3\u00a0ha (7.4 acres). The third fire broke out near Kenthurst in Sydney's Northwest.[14]"

Early in the morning (3:35am) the Queensland Fire and Emergency Services (QFES) issued an emergency warning in which residents were advised to \"leave immediately\".[19] High temperatures of 32\u00a0\u00b0C (90\u00a0\u00b0F), and strong winds hindered fire fighting and QFES Director Brian Cox said \"A lot of this fire is burning in inaccessible country \u2026\".[19] Heavy rainfall in mid-December helped contain the fire and the QFES was able to hand control back to the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service (QPWS).[20] This was the longest burning fire this fire season up to 14 December 2020 as it had been burning since October, over two months, and as of  that date, more than half the island had been \"blackened\" by fire. The fire was still burning, but the island was safe for visitors though some walking trails and areas were still restricted for safety.  The island reopened on 15\u00a0December.[21] The area burnt by the fire was estimated at 87,000 hectares (210,000 acres).[17] It is expected that the burned areas will successfully regenerate.[22] Four men, aged 21 to 24, were charged over the bushfire and on 21 January 2021 at Hervey Bay Magistrates Court two of the four pled guilty to one count each of \"unlawfully lighting a fire and leaving a fire unattended\", were fined A$667 on each offence, and did not have a conviction recorded. The other two were charged with \"unlawfully lighting a fire\" but had their cases adjourned to 11 February. A 17-year-old minor was allegedly involved, but not charged and is instead being dealt with through the Youth Justice Act due to his age.[17]"

This comes after the first Total Fire Bans were issued for South Australia for the first time in the 2020\u201321 Australian bushfire season.[23] At 12:48 pm ACDT on 27 November, the South Australian Country Fire Service responded to a grass fire at Templers in the State's Mid North. Shortly after arriving the CFS declared an Emergency Warning and ordered people around Templers, Freeling, Lyndoch and Roseworthy to evacuate. Just after 3pm the fire was declared contained.[24] At 12:37 pm ACDT on 11 January, an out-of-control bushfire raged in the Lower South East of South Australia near the township of Lucindale. As of 2:36 pm 12 January over 14,000 ha of grass and scrub was burnt. After having over 200 firefighters working around the clock, the fire threat has reduced and contained with help from the Victorian Country Fire Authority.[25] At 4:15 pm ACDT on 24 January, a bushfire took hold at Cherry Gardens under Extreme weather conditions, located in the Adelaide Hills. At 4:36pm the first Emergency Warning was issued for people living on Hicks Hill Road, Orchard Road, Lewis Street and Prith Road, soon towns were being notified to evacuate as the fire raged out-of-control towards homes that would pose a threat to lives in its path. As of 7:15pm on 25 January the fire was declared Contained after heavy rain improved the firefighting conditions. Four months later a 61-year-old man was charged with starting the fires.[26]"

Strong winds made the fire hard to control, but it was downgraded to a watch and act on 4 January.[30] A bushfire in High Wycombe, a suburb in the east of Perth, on 15 January and burned through about 4\u00a0ha (9.9 acres) of bushland requiring some 75 firefighters to contain it.[31] Another fire was also burning in York on 15 January resulting in the loss of one home and shed on a hobby farm near the Great Southern Highway.[1] Another fire started burning on 16 January in a nature reserve[32] in the suburb of Oakford in Perth's southern suburbs resulting in the closure of Kwinana Freeway between Mortimer and Anketell Roads and the loss of one house. Approximately 150 fire fighters and 50 vehicles along with aerial bombers were required to combat the blaze.[2] Over 100\u00a0ha (250 acres) of bushland was burned out.[32] On 1 February 2021, the 2021 Wooroloo bushfire started at Werribee Road, Wooroloo.[33] Over 500 fire fighters and 90 fire trucks were required to battle the fire and spread to parts of Wundowie, Gidgegannup and Chidlow. More than three houses, outbuildings and two fire trucks were destroyed.[3] The fire remained uncontrollable overnight, and reached ground just east of The Vines by mid morning on the following day, by that stage it had a 60\u00a0km perimeter and was 7000 hectares in size.[34] At lunch time on 3 February it was confirmed that 71 houses had been lost, with areas of Bullsbrook and Shady hills in Perth's north advised to evacuate due to predicted wind changes combined with steep terrain that is inaccessible to vehicles.[35][36] By 6 February it had destroyed at least 86 houses and 2 fire trucks[5] and burned out an area of over 10,500\u00a0ha (26,000 acres).[37] On 5 February, two new bushfires in the South West were ignited, one near Injidup and the other near Yallingup, with one thought to have been deliberately lit. 100 firefighters were needed to control the fires which were 11\u00a0km (6.8\u00a0mi) apart, with the Yallingup fire coming close to Ngilgi Cave.[38]"

Yancy was the sixth typhoon of the annual typhoon season and sixth tropical cyclone overall to impact Japan that year. Developing out of an area of disturbed weather in the open northwest Pacific on August\u00a029, 1993, the precursor to Yancy tracked westward and quickly intensified to reach tropical storm strength on August\u00a030. Just two days later, the tropical storm reached typhoon intensity as it recurved towards the northeast. A period of rapid intensification followed, allowing Yancy to quickly reach super typhoon intensity. The strong tropical cyclone reached peak intensity on September\u00a02 with maximum sustained winds of 175\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph).[nb 1] The following day Yancy made its first landfall on I\u014djima at nearly the same strength; over the course of the day the typhoon would make three subsequent landfalls on Japanese islands. Land interaction forced the tropical cyclone to weaken, and after its final landfall on Hiroshima Prefecture, Yancy weakened below typhoon intensity. After emerging into the Sea of Japan, Yancy transitioned into an extratropical cyclone; these remnants persisted as they meandered in the sea before dissipating completely on September\u00a07.[nb 2]"

The Joint Typhoon Warning Center\u00a0(JTWC) started to monitor the disturbance at 1200\u00a0UTC on August\u00a027.[2] Aided by a southwesterly monsoonal wind flow and in an area of favorable conditions, the system organized, and at 0600\u00a0UTC on August\u00a028, the JTWC issued a Significant Tropical Weather Advisory on the disturbance.[3] Organization continued throughout the day's course, and the system was classified by the Japan Meteorological Agency\u00a0(JMA) as a tropical depression at 0000\u00a0UTC on August\u00a029.[4] Shower activity at that time began to coalesce more closely around the system's center of circulation, prompting the JTWC to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert an hour later. Based on satellite intensity estimates, the agency also reclassified the system as a tropical depression at 0600\u00a0UTC that day.[3] At the time, the depression was positioned roughly 1,000\u00a0km (620\u00a0mi) northwest of Guam.[5] Through tropical cyclogenesis, the primitive depression tracked westward, in the direction of Taiwan.[3] At 0000\u00a0UTC on August\u00a030, the JMA upgraded the system to tropical storm intensity,[4] followed by the JTWC six hours later based on a ship report in the vicinity of the cyclone.[3] Yancy continued to gradually intensify, and according to the JMA the storm reached severe tropical storm intensity at 1200\u00a0UTC on August\u00a031.[4] By this time, Yancy started to curve towards the northwest.[5] Later that day, the tropical storm began developing a banding eye feature. This was reflected in satellite intensity estimates, prompting the JTWC to upgrade Yancy to typhoon status.[3] The JMA maintained the storm's severe tropical storm status through this period, though on September\u00a01 the agency initiated 3-hour position fixes in contrast to their usual 6-hour fix procedure; at 0300\u00a0UTC that day the JMA upgraded Yancy to typhoon intensity. Upon upgrade, Yancy was estimated to have a minimum barometric pressure of 965\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.50\u00a0inHg).[4] At the time the typhoon was positioned approximately 500\u00a0km (310\u00a0mi) south-southwest of Okinawa.[5] Rapid intensification ensued,[3] and just nine hours later the JTWC estimated Yancy's winds to have equated to that of a Category\u00a03 on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale.[2] The JTWC upgraded the typhoon to super typhoon status at 0600\u00a0UTC on September\u00a03 as one-minute sustained winds were estimated to have reached the threshold of 130 knots (240\u00a0km/h; 150\u00a0mph).[3] Three hours later the JMA estimated Yancy to have peaked in strength with ten-minute sustained winds of 175\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 925\u00a0mbar (925\u00a0hPa; 27.3\u00a0inHg); this intensity would be held for the following 18\u00a0hours.[4] Only minimal weakening occurred in the immediate hours following peak intensity, and at around 0600\u00a0UTC on September\u00a03, Yancy passed directly over I\u014djima.[4] Tracking rapidly northeastward at around 40\u00a0km/h (25\u00a0mph),[5] Yancy made a second landfall on Kagoshima Prefecture within an hour later at the same intensity;[4] at the time this made Yancy the strongest tropical cyclone ever to make landfall on Japan since Typhoon Shirley in 1965, 28\u00a0years prior.[3][6] Land interaction with Kyushu further weakened Yancy,[5] but the system remained at typhoon intensity upon its landfall on western Ehime Prefecture at around 1400\u00a0UTC that day. The JTWC estimated that the typhoon was still maintaining Category\u00a03 intensity upon landfall on Ehime.[2] This particular landfall greatly weakened Yancy, and despite the storm briefly emerging over intra-insular waters, was only a minimal typhoon by the time of its final landfall on Hiroshima Prefecture at 1600\u00a0UTC that day. Shortly following the tropical cyclone's final landfall, Yancy weakened below typhoon intensity to severe tropical storm classification. Continuing to track northeast, the weakening cyclone underwent extratropical transition and was assessed to have fully transitioned into an extratropical storm by 1200\u00a0UTC on September\u00a04 while located in the northeastern Sea of Japan.[4][5] Yancy's extratropical remnants persisted for several days as they meandered within the Sea of Japan before dissipating by 1200\u00a0UTC on September\u00a07.[4]"

Total damage costs on Kume and Naha islands amounted to \u00a51.8\u00a0billion (US$17.3\u00a0million), and two people were killed.[17] Heavy agricultural damage also occurred on Ishigaki Island. Sugarcane crops were severely impacted, with losses reaching \u00a535\u00a0million (US$330,000) and accounting for approximately 80.5%\u00a0of all sugarcane crops on the island. Significant damage was also inflicted on other fruit and vegetable crops. Total agricultural losses on Ishigaki reached \u00a543.6\u00a0million (US$410,000). On nearby Taketomi Island, similar agricultural damage ensued.[19] To the east, the Miyako Islands also suffered extensive damage. Heavy rainfall triggered widespread flooding, which took a toll on infrastructure and agriculture. Ten buildings sustained at least partial damage, with one completely demolished. In addition, three dikes were breached by floodwater. Roughly 4,478\u00a0ha (11,065\u00a0ac) of farmland were damaged. Agricultural damage there amounted to \u00a5309\u00a0million (US$2.9\u00a0million).[20]"

However, higher hourly rainfall rates were reported at stations in Mizobe and Makurazaki. Off the coast, strong storm surge was reported, resulting in damage along the coast. In Sata, waves were estimated to be 11.5\u00a0m (38\u00a0ft) high. Widespread flash floods and landslides were commonplace across Kagoshima. Nine people were killed in a single landslide incident.[22] Another landslide in Kinpo, Kagoshima trapped 20\u00a0people.[23] In Kawanabe, a single mudslide killed nine persons and destroyed 20\u00a0homes.[24] A total of 31\u00a0landslides occurred throughout Kaghsima. Widespread power outages also took place, which affected 384,000\u00a0houses. Prefecture-wide, 209\u00a0homes were demolished and 626\u00a0sustained partial damage. Overall, damage costs in Kagoshima amounted to \u00a543.9\u00a0billion (US$420\u00a0million), and 33\u00a0lives were lost. An additional 163\u00a0persons were injured.[22] Despite not being a point of landfall, Miyazaki Prefecture was the most severely affected region of Japan.[25] Many of the highest rainfall totals recorded in Japan took place in Miyazaki Prefecture. A weather station in Mitate, located in the town of Hinokage, observed 577\u00a0mm (22.7\u00a0in) of rain, far more than any other station in the country. The same station reported 543\u00a0mm (21.4\u00a0in) of its rainfall total in a 24-hour period, which still exceeded the storm totals of any other Japanese weather station.[12] High storm surge generated by Yancy caused coastal inundation in Hy\u016bga, which flooded the first floors of many buildings. Several fishing boats in a harbor off of Nobeaka capsized due to wave action. River swelling caused by heavy precipitation and flooding washed away four bridges prefecture-wide. Further inland many homes were unroofed as a result of strong winds. A total of 347\u00a0homes were damaged, and of those 38\u00a0were destroyed. Overall damage totaled \u00a588.8\u00a0billion (US$840\u00a0million), primarily as a result of agricultural loss, and two people were killed.[25]"

Winds gusting as high as 94\u00a0km/h (58\u00a0mph) resulted in the destruction of several homes. The strong winds also toppled and uprooted numerous trees, including a patch of trees 1,670 hectares (4,100 acres) in area in the southern portion of the prefecture. Landslides were also commonplace, blocking homes and destroying additional buildings. Damage in the prefecture reached \u00a530.5\u00a0billion (US$290\u00a0million), primarily to forestry, where damage in that sector alone totaled \u00a521\u00a0billion ($200\u00a0million). One person in Kumamoto Prefecture was killed after a falling incident while five others were injured.[26] \u014cita Prefecture was primarily impacted by heavy rainfall from Yancy, resulting in widespread flooding.[27] Precipitation peaked at 422\u00a0mm (16.6\u00a0in) in \u014cita, the second highest rainfall amount in Japan.[12] Four people were killed after two buildings collapsed as a result of an overflowing river. Another person was killed due to a flood-triggered landslide. The floods destroyed 28\u00a0homes and inundated another 302\u00a0across \u014cita. In addition to residential damage, the floods inundated large swaths of agricultural land, leading to soil erosion. Crops, in particularly pears, were greatly affected. Approximately 1,074 hectares (2,650 acres) of arable land was eroded. Across the prefecture, agricultural damage amounted to \u00a526.8\u00a0billion (US$250\u00a0million). The floods also caused widespread clean water shortages, particularly in Kusu District. Overall, damage caused by Yancy in \u014cita Prefecture was estimated at \u00a542.4\u00a0billion (US$402\u00a0million), and seven people were killed.[27] Nagasaki, Saga, and Fukuoka prefectures were less affected by Yancy relative to other regions in Kyushu.[12] Nagasaki Prefecture was primarily impacted by the typhoon's storm surge. Wave heights peaked at 8\u00a0m (26\u00a0ft) off of Miiraki. The wave action caused some coastal damage. Further inland, damage lessened, and limited to a single landslide. Damage in Nagasaki totaled \u00a51.7\u00a0billion (US$16\u00a0million).[28] In Saga, excessive rainfall caused widespread crop damage and suspended various transportation services. Damage estimates in Saga were slightly less than in Nagasaki, totaling \u00a51.6\u00a0billion (US$15\u00a0million).[29] Flooding in Fukuoka Prefecture resulted in two landslides and destroyed four buildings. Eighty-nine other buildings were inundated by floodwater. Damage there totaled \u00a52.4\u00a0billion (US$23\u00a0million), and one person was killed.[30]"

An area of disturbed weather formed near the Caroline Islands in early October. A mid-latitude cyclone weakened a subtropical ridge to its north, allowing the disturbance to slowly gain latitude, and on October\u00a03, the system organized into a tropical depression. On the next day, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Orchid. Continuing to intensify, the cyclone strengthened into a typhoon on the morning of October\u00a06. Typhoon Orchid tracked due westward south of subtropical ridge while rapidly intensifying, and on October\u00a07, Orchid reached its peak intensity. Shortly after its peak, the typhoon began to recurve north as the ridge receded. After interacting with Typhoon Pat, Orchid weakened below typhoon intensity on October\u00a012. After accelerating to the northwest while gradually weakening, Orchid transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on October\u00a014. In conjunction with Pat, high waves claimed two lives on Guam. Because of the storm's slow movement as it tracked south of Japan, Typhoon Orchid dropped heavy precipitation across most of Japan. One person was killed and twenty people were injured across Japan. A total of 17\u00a0flights were cancelled while 1,072\u00a0trains were halted, stranding 342,000\u00a0passengers. In addition, 18\u00a0ferries were cancelled. The storm inflicted 249\u00a0landslides, flooded over 675\u00a0homes, and was accountable for extensive road damage in Japan.

        "content": "The first tropical cyclone to develop during October\u00a01991, Typhoon Orchid formed a broad monsoon trough that extended from the South China Sea eastward through the Caroline Islands. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started monitoring the system at 06:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a01 while it was located northwest of Guam. A mid-latitude trough weakened a subtropical ridge to its north, allowing the tropical disturbance to slowly gain latitude. Following a surge in the monsoon trough, a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert was issued at 08:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a03.[1] At the same time, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a tropical depression,[2][nb 3] with the JTWC doing the same at 00:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a04.[nb 4] Post-storm analysis from the JTWC indicated, however, that the depression had attained tropical storm midday on October\u00a03.[1] The JMA upgraded Orchid into a tropical storm early on October\u00a04, and twenty-four hours later, the JMA upgraded Orchid into a severe tropical storm.[5] At around this time, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Sendang.[6] On the evening of October\u00a05, Orchid was upgraded into a typhoon by the JTWC, and on the following morning, the JMA followed suit.[5] Continuing to intensify, Typhoon Orchid tracked due westward south of subtropical ridge.[1] Late on October\u00a06, the JTWC raised the intensity of the storm to 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph), equal to a Category\u00a03 hurricane on the United States-based Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (SSHWS).[7] Increased convergence in the southern quadrant enhanced convection, and dual outflow channels aloft were present.[1] The next day, the JTWC and JMA estimated that Orchid attained its peak intensity of 210\u00a0km/h (130\u00a0mph)[1] and 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph).[2] Shortly after its peak, Orchid began to recurve near 130\u00b0E as the ridge receded eastward, allowing Orchid to move north. Typhoon Orchid slowly accelerated after recurvature, only to slow down south of Japan on October\u00a010 as a binary interaction started with Typhoon Pat. Over a 42-hour period from October 10\u201312, Orchid took a \"stair-stepped\" track - moving to the north then back to the northeast due to interaction with Typhoon Pat.[1] At 00:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a012, both the JTWC and JMA agreed that Pat lost typhoon intensity.[5] Orchid subsequently started speeding up, following Pat to the northwest while slowly weakening. At 00:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a013, the final warning was issued by the JTWC since Orchid had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone,[1] though according to the JMA, this process did not occur until 24 hours later.[2] The JMA stopped keeping an eye on the system late on October\u00a015.[5]"

Officials estimated it would take several months to repair the damage. Nearby, tracks were lifted 1\u00a0m (3.28\u00a0ft) due to pressure from underground water.[19] Six people were injured throughout Tokyo, where the storm resulted in \u00a5240\u00a0million in damage.[18] In both Owase and Ayama, one landslide occurred. Meanwhile, two landslides were reported in Nabari.[20] Roads were damaged in 295 places and embankments were damaged in 98\u00a0spots in Chiba Prefecture.

Roads there were damaged in forty-one places, forcing five roads to close.[24] Moisture from the storm, aided by a cold front, damaged 275\u00a0homes and destroyed 8\u00a0other houses in Saitama Prefecture, which resulted in 35\u00a0losing their homes. Over 300\u00a0ha (740 acres) of farmland was damaged, totaling \u00a5645\u00a0million.[25] Eighty-six homes were damaged in Gunma prefecture, including forty-four in \u014cta, while four others were destroyed.[26] A landslide blocked a road near Katsuyama.[27] A 43-year-old woman was killed because of a landslide in Fukushima Prefecture, where six people were hurt.[28] Seventeen dwellings were damaged and destroyed in Yamagata Prefecture.[29] Heavy rains deluged Iwate Prefecture, damaging seventy-nine houses and destroying seven others.

The worst impacts were felt in the Iowa City area, where significant damage and numerous injuries were reported, in addition to at least one death across the region. Another supercell developed on April 14 across western Indiana, producing a few tornadoes; although, nothing very serious was actually reported. That system moved eastward over the Mid-Atlantic States on April 15, but no tornadoes were reported there. While the first system moved eastward, a second system developed over the Upper Midwest and tracked across the Midwest between April 15 and 16. This new system produced 40 reported tornadoes, several of which have been damaging; however, no fatalities were reported from the second system. That system then tracked into the Mid-Atlantic on April 17 and was mostly a straight-line wind event, even though there were a handful of new tornadoes reported across the region. A third system developed on April 18 and brought even more severe weather, this time farther south in the lower Midwest, primarily in Missouri. There were several more tornadoes reported from this one. The severe weather activity finally ended on April 19 across the South.

The tornado touched down at the southwest edge of town and moved northeast, downing power lines and striking the Sheriff's Office. The tornado then struck the University of Iowa campus, heavily damaging multiple buildings and temporarily trapping several students. The motor pool headquarters was a total loss. Just off campus, the Alpha Chi Omega sorority house was also severely damaged, and had to be evacuated following the event.[54] As the tornado struck the downtown area, multiple historic brick buildings sustained collapse of walls or had their roofs torn off. Saint Patrick's Church was heavily damaged by the tornado. Just before the tornado hit, Reverend Rudolph Juarez ushered 50 to 75 parishioners (many elderly) to the safety of the rectory basement next door. This likely saved many lives, as the tornado tore off the roof of the church and collapsed the top portion of the brick facade and the steeple into the main congregation area. Residential sections of the city also sustained major damage, as many trees and power lines were downed, and 1,016 homes and apartment buildings were damaged. Upper portions of exterior walls failed at some of these residences. Elsewhere, a 53-year-old Dairy Queen was destroyed, multiple vehicles were flipped, a Wal-Mart sustained roof damage, and a gas station awning was blown over. Three automobile dealerships were also damaged; one dealership had 200 vehicles damaged, a second had 60-70 vehicles damaged, and a third had nearly every vehicle sustaining some type of damage. A total of 35 businesses were damaged or destroyed. The tornado dissipated as it exited at the northeast side of town.[55][56] The tornado struck on a Thursday night, which is normally a busy time for the bars of downtown Iowa City. Fortunately, the tornado struck relatively early in the evening, and downtown was not as packed as it might have been had the tornado struck a few hours later. There were a few reports of looting, mainly at establishments where liquor was sold/stored. The Iowa National Guard was called in to restore order and assist with debris cleanup. Electricity was cut to about 7,000 customers in the area, but most power was quickly restored after the tornado.[57] This was the only known tornado to have struck downtown Iowa City. Overall, 30 people were injured in the event.[58]"

        "content": " The Eyre Peninsula bushfire of 2005, an event also known locally as Black Tuesday[2] and by South Australian Government agencies as the Wangary bushfire,[3] was a bushfire that occurred during January 2005 on the lower part of the Eyre Peninsula, a significant part of South Australia's wheat belt, where most of the land is either cropped or grazed.[4] The fire resulted in 780 square kilometres (301\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of land being burnt, the loss of nine lives, injury to another 115 people, and huge property damage.  It was South Australia's worst bushfire since the Ash Wednesday fires of 1983. Heat from the fire reached 1,000\u00a0\u00b0C (1,830\u00a0\u00b0F), with speeds up to 100 kilometres per hour (62\u00a0mph).[5]"

        "content": "Maximum temperatures were recorded on 10 January 2005 as 31.9\u00a0\u00b0C (89.4\u00a0\u00b0F) at Coles Point and 38.6\u00a0\u00b0C (101.5\u00a0\u00b0F) at Port Lincoln; winds gusted to 63 kilometres per hour (39\u00a0mph).[6] The bushfire began not long after 3\u00a0pm in roadside vegetation on Lady Franklyn Road north of the town of Wangary, approximately 45 kilometres (28\u00a0mi) north-west of Port Lincoln. The source of ignition was subsequently found to have been a vehicle parked in grass on the roadside. The inquest conducted by the Deputy State Coroner concluded that \"a carbonaceous particle or particles landed in dry vegetation at the side of Lady Franklyn Road and immediately, or virtually immediately, ignited that vegetation\" from an exhaust system that \"had a number of irregularities and defects that consisted of holes and imperfect joins in the system. [The] muffler was not a standard part for that vehicle. Compared to the standard muffler that would normally be fitted to a vehicle of that type, the non-standard after-market muffler had a lesser capacity to inhibit the passage of hot carbonaceous particles through it.\"[7] After the fire was detected, people went to the scene, including farmers in their farm firefighting appliances who had seen the smoke from a distance. Country Fire Service (CFS) appliances and their volunteer crews were also dispatched to the location. It quickly became obvious that sourcing water in this area was a problem; the fire proved difficult to quell under the influence of a strong breeze. Valiant efforts were made to contain the fire during the course of the afternoon, and more CFS appliances arrived.[citation needed] By the evening, the fireground covered 1,800 hectares (4,400 acres) with a south-eastern flank of several kilometres.[citation needed] Measures to counter the fire included fire suppression, blacking out, burning out, backburning, and earthmoving. At 8:54 pm, when the unfavourable weather conditions for firefighting had abated, the fire was judged to be contained. (This carried no implication that the fire was extinguished; the fire was still active in an area of sugar gums and in a swamp.)[citation needed]"

        "content": "Overnight, the fire edge extended approximately 7 kilometres (4.3\u00a0mi).[8] The weather forecast for the morning of Tuesday 11 January was very unfavourable for firefighting, suggesting that extreme conditions would exist at 10 am.[9] In the event, just before 10 am the first of several breakouts occurred from the fireground, spreading extremely quickly under strong north-westerly winds.[10][3][11] Maximum temperatures on Tuesday 11 January were recorded as 36.7\u00a0\u00b0C (98.1\u00a0\u00b0F) at Coles Point and 38.2\u00a0\u00b0C (100.8\u00a0\u00b0F) at Port Lincoln; winds gusted to 83 kilometres per hour (52\u00a0mph).[12] During the course of the morning and early afternoon, fire proceeded across the landscape of the Lower Eyre Peninsula in an easterly direction, carried in the main by wheat-stubble fuels. Ultimately it reached North Shields and its beachside caravan park on the east coast 8 kilometres (5\u00a0mi) north of Port Lincoln's suburbs, and the Port Lincoln Airport and adjacent settlement of Poonindie a further 5 kilometres (3\u00a0mi) northwards.[13] The worst affected areas were Wangary, North Shields, Wanilla, Poonindie, Louth Bay, Whites Flat, Koppio, Greenpatch and Warunda. Essential services such as electricity, telecommunications and water infrastructure were destroyed.[5] The flames \"chose their victims at random\", according to an Australian Broadcasting Corporation reporter who interviewed victims on Wednesday 12 January. \"Half the Port Lincoln Caravan Park at North Shields was spared; the other half, destroyed. As the flames bore down on the caravan park, panicked residents escaped to the ocean.\" One man, who had escaped to the beach, said \"It's the worst place for it to come, actually, because there's nowhere to run. That's why a lot of the people here ended up in the water. I rescued a man out of a boat that got washed out to sea with the wind yesterday. They jumped off the cliffs when the fire came. [A neighbour and his daughter] couldn't see the land because of the smoke, and the wind was that strong, it actually pushed them out to sea and they nearly drowned, and some people came along in boats and picked them up, and they ended up on the shore just up the road here, and he was collapsed on the bottom of the boat. He spent the night in hospital.\"[14] During the Tuesday, the fire claimed the lives of nine people and injured 115, three of whom required urgent hospital treatment in Adelaide. The coronial inquest recorded that the fire caused approximately $100 million in total property damage, including:[note 2] It was not until 20 January before firefighters finished attending to continuing hazards such as smouldering logs and fenceposts and the fire was finally declared extinguished.[16]"

        "content": "The human impact of loss, injury and dislocation, and the loss of treasured possessions and clothing, was immense. As the fire continued its spread across the peninsula, residents provided emergency accommodation and assistance for fire victims at several assembly points. A bushfire recovery centre was set up at Port Lincoln High School and Cummins Bowling Club. The State Recovery Committee, comprising representatives of government agencies and relief organisations, met urgently on 12 January to coordinate prompt agency responses. Personal hardship and distress grants were provided as a priority, including a State Government grant of $10,000 to all farmers affected by the fire to assist with immediate needs; Centrelink payments were prioritised; a hotline service was set up on 12 January, receiving more than 2900 calls in 15 weeks; and extensive measures such as providing shipping containers for storage of salvaged possession were speedily put in place.[17][5] Donations of goods flooded in, and an Army detachment and people from across Australia joined local people to help with the clean-up \u2013 discovering among the devastation such objects as melted headlight glass and aluminium \u2013 and undertaking recovery tasks such as re-fencing.[18] Ten years later, on Sunday 11 January 2015, about 200 people packed into the Marble Range Football Club, Wangary, for a 10th anniversary memorial service. State member of parliament for the region, Peter Treloar, who in 2005 was a farmer, said \"Many people's lives changed for ever that day\"; but he said he understood that not all wanted to be involved in the commemoration. \"It's not going to be a day for everyone. I've spoken to some people who did not want to attend.\" Memorial organiser Benji Callen said people were still healing from the bushfire and attended the memorial with mixed feelings. Among people who had been in the fire who spoke with reporters from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation was Lorna Harding, aged 91, who was among those who took refuge in the sea off North Shields. She had watched as the house she was born in and had lived in all her life was destroyed. \"It just came so fast. Before we knew where we were, we were covered in smoke. But we had the sea to go into so we were right.\"[2]"

        "header": "Coronial inquest",
        "content": "Between 5 October 2005 and 8 May 2007, South Australia's Deputy State Coroner conducted a coronial inquest that examined a large range of factors connected with the bushfire, taking evidence from 140 witnesses. In his 703-page report released on 18 December 2007, the coroner made 34 wide-ranging recommendations for minimising future bushfire risks,[19] to which the South Australian Government subsequently responded.[20] The report also listed other investigations into the bushfire.[21] An Australian Broadcasting Corporation television program broadcast on the day on which the coronial findings were released stated that \"The report details a series of miscalculations and miscommunications among firefighters on the ground and their CFS senior officers in Adelaide that resulted in resources being denied until the fire was out of control. According to the Deputy Coroner, miscommunications between senior CFS officers left them unaware how seriously the fire was growing. As a result, critical decisions were delayed.[4] ... There are those critical of the coronial process, arguing it does little to prevent a future bushfire ... civil action is likely to be launched immediately against the CFS and the owner of the vehicle which started the fire by 70 litigants, mostly farmers.\"[4] A great deal of evidence was given to the inquest about the crucial question of the firefighting and fire suppression strategies that could and/or should have been adopted on the Monday night and the Tuesday morning, but were not. The main focus of activity overnight, attracting much of the available resources, had been on an area of sugar gum trees. The coroner considered it was an unwanted distraction to CFS appliances that might otherwise have been available to work elsewhere. Only a very limited amount of suppression work was undertaken on the eastern or western sides of a paperbark swamp, or in the swamp, where there was significant fire activity. As a result, fire was able to escape from that part of the swamp with no resources there to prevent it or reduce its impact. The coroner queried whether the fatal outcome would have occurred if the fire\u2019s impact had even been reduced slightly.[citation needed] The Deputy State Coroner had referred in the coronial report to the \"very strident\" public criticism of volunteer Incident Management Teams that had occurred. However, his concluding remarks were: \"The CFS have effected much change since this incident. Recommendations made in two separate inquiries \u2013 namely Project Phoenix and the inquiry conducted by Dr Bob Smith \u2013 have been, or are being, implemented. In addition, a number of initiatives have been implemented that have resulted in more effective and timely communication in incident settings. The implementation of change is to be applauded. The response of the Country Fire Service to this incident and that of its Chief Officer, Mr Euan Ferguson, has, in my view, been exemplary.\"[22]"

        "content": " Typhoon Ruby, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Yoning,[1] was a strong tropical cyclone that struck Hong Kong, Macau, and southern China in early September\u00a01964. The precursor disturbance to Ruby was first identified on August\u00a029 over the Philippine Sea, and this system organised into a tropical cyclone by September\u00a01. Ruby intensified as it moved west, becoming a typhoon the next day and subsequently passing over the Babuyan Islands of the Philippines. After reaching the South China Sea, Ruby turned northwest and intensified further, attaining peak ten-minute sustained winds of 195\u00a0km/h (121\u00a0mph) before making landfall at the peak intensity near Hong Kong on September\u00a05. The typhoon weakened after moving inland and dissipated on September\u00a06 over southeastern China. Despite brushing Philippines as a typhoon, no impacts were recorded. Ruby was one of the strongest typhoons to hit Hong Kong in the city's history. The storm produced a peak wind gust of 268\u00a0km/h (167\u00a0mph) at Tate's Cairn and a gust of 230\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph) on Waglan Island; the latter was the strongest gust observed for that site. The storm sank 314\u00a0fishing vessels and destroyed or damaged thousands of homes. Rain-triggered landslides and wind-blown debris caused 300\u00a0injuries. Among locales in Hong Kong, Tai Po was most seriously affected. A total of 38\u00a0fatalities were attributed to Ruby in Hong Kong, though another 14\u00a0people remained unaccounted for. A wind gust of 211\u00a0km/h (131\u00a0mph) generated by Ruby in Macau was the strongest gust measured there on record; at least 20\u00a0fatalities were reported in Macau. The typhoon caused serious flooding along the mouth of the Pearl River in Guangdong Province in South China, where at least 700\u00a0people were killed."

        "content": "The genesis of Typhoon Ruby stemmed from the interaction of a trough of low pressure and a westward-propagating tropical wave. This interaction led to the formation of a wind circulation west of Saipan on August\u00a029, 1964. It initially moved west-northwest before curving west.[2] Nimbus 1, a weather satellite, was used to detect and locate this precursor disturbance 21\u00a0hours prior to investigation from aircraft reconnaissance.[3][4] For the first twelve hours on September\u00a01, the disturbance became a tropical depression,[5][nb 1] and by around 12:00\u00a0UTC, the tropical depression had strengthened into a tropical storm while over the central Philippine Sea, 965\u00a0km (600\u00a0mi) east of Basco, Batanes, in the Philippines.[6][7] Ruby initially moved slightly south of west with a forward speed of 28\u00a0km/h (17\u00a0mph).[7] It became a severe tropical storm within 18\u00a0hours of tropical cyclogenesis according to data from the Hong Kong Observatory (known as the Royal Observatory in 1964).[5] Aircraft reconnaissance estimated one-minute maximum sustained winds of 100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph) on their first intercept of the system on September\u00a01.[2] Data from the JTWC and HKO indicate Ruby became a typhoon by 12:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a02.[5][7] Ruby passed north of Luzon and across the Babuyan Islands as a typhoon on September\u00a03 with one-minute sustained winds estimated by the JTWC at 140\u00a0km/h (87\u00a0mph) and ten-minute sustained winds estimated by the HKO at 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph).[5] According to the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), Ruby's barometric pressure reached a minimum of 972\u00a0hPa (mbar; 28.70\u00a0inHg) during this time; this is disputed by the HKO and the China Meteorological Administration (CMA), which both analysed Ruby's pressure to have continued falling for at least two more days.[5] On September\u00a04, Ruby turned towards the northwest while 200\u00a0km (120\u00a0mi) northwest of Luzon.[6] While ship observations were scant in the northern South China Sea following the issuance of typhoon warnings,[7] aircraft reconnaissance and satellite imagery provided data on Ruby's position and intensity as it approached Hong Kong, Macau, and the southeastern coast of China.[2] On September\u00a05, Ruby's one-minute sustained winds topped out at 220\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph) according to the JTWC, with the HKO reporting ten-minute sustained winds peaking at 195\u00a0km/h (121\u00a0mph); in the HKO classification system, this made Ruby a super typhoon.[5][8] The CMA and HKO both estimated Ruby's central atmospheric pressure bottomed out at 960\u00a0hPa (mbar; 28.35\u00a0inHg).[5] Ruby made landfall near Hong Kong at peak intensity at around 09:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a05.[5] Its eye spanned approximately 30\u00a0km (19\u00a0mi) across.[7] Ruby weakened after moving inland, degenerating into a tropical storm by September\u00a06 and dissipating inland over southeastern China later that day.[7][6][2]"

The Royal Observatory headquarters measured a minimum air pressure of 968.2\u00a0hPa (mbar; 28.59\u00a0inHg) when the centre of the typhoon was roughly 30\u00a0km (19\u00a0mi) to the southwest.[7] At Tate's Cairn, a wind gust of 268\u00a0km/h (167\u00a0mph) was registered; other measured peak gusts included 227\u00a0km/h (141\u00a0mph) at the Royal Observatory and 203\u00a0km/h (126\u00a0mph) at Kai Tak Airport.[8] A 230\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph) gust on Waglan Island was the fastest observed in the island's history.[11] Rainfall accumulations in Hong Kong reached at least 175\u00a0mm (6.9\u00a0in) in 24\u00a0hours.[12]:\u200a1\u200a The Royal Observatory recorded at least (165\u00a0mm) 6.50\u00a0in of rain from the storm.[13] Ruby produced a maximum storm surge height of 1.49\u00a0m (4\u00a0ft 11\u00a0in) at Quarry Bay.[14] There were 38\u00a0fatalities in Hong Kong associated with Ruby, though 14\u00a0others were never accounted for. Another 300\u00a0people were injured by the storm, and a total of 8,500\u00a0people were classified by the Royal Observatory as \"disaster victims\".[10] Numerous injuries were caused by sheet metal torn from buildings under construction in downtown Hong Kong. Fifty thousand refugees from the People's Republic of China were rendered homeless.[15]:\u200a1\u200a The typhoon destroyed or damaged 314\u00a0fishing vessels and 20\u00a0ships throughout the Hong Kong area.[10] At least ten ships ran aground.[15]:\u200a2\u200a Nine people were lost after a Panamanian freighter, the Dorar, sank in Victoria Harbour; 14\u00a0others were rescued.[6] Kai Tak International Airport, ferry service, and other transportation systems were brought to a standstill throughout Hong Kong, in addition to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.[16][12]:\u200a2\u200a Roads were blocked by toppled trees and overturned cars.[17][16] One road was obstructed by cranes that fell from a 20-storey building.[16] Heavy rainfall caused by Ruby led to floods, landslides, and razed homes.[6][18] High voltage electrical wires torn by the winds caused hundreds of fires before the power service was terminated.[15]:\u200a1\u200a Tai Po was the hardest-hit area in Hong Kong; there, the storm destroyed thousands of village houses and temporary shelters. In Kowloon and Tsuen Wan, 1,368\u00a0houses were affected.[10] A loosened boulder in Kowloon trapped ten people.[16] At Mui Wo, 30\u00a0homes were destroyed and 180\u00a0others were unroofed.[10] High waves pushed water into the Hong Kong City Hall, causing a delay in the 1964 Summer Olympics torch relay.[15]:\u200a2\u200a Following the passage of Ruby, hundreds of workers cleared and repaired streets most seriously impacted in Hong Kong.[19] The colonial government appealed for public donations for victims of Ruby on September\u00a06. Hot meals and cash assistance were prepared for the displaced Chinese refugees in Hong Kong by government welfare groups.[20] A 211\u00a0km/h (131\u00a0mph) wind gust in Taipa, Macau, set a new record for the fastest gust measured there; this record was later superseded by Typhoon Hato in 2017.[21] The typhoon triggered a fire that destroyed a building there.[19] Over 20\u00a0people were killed and 100\u00a0others were injured in Macau. \"Severe flooding\" occurred in Guangdong Province throughout the province and along the Pearl River delta.[22] Many homes collapsed, and the damage there was the most severe since 1949.[23] Xiangshan County was the hardest-hit region.[24] More than 700\u00a0people were reportedly killed in Guangdong Province, including the unconfirmed deaths of 300\u00a0people following the collapse of a school dormitory.[25] The devastation in Guangdong led to an increased influx of refugees fleeing the People's Republic of China for Hong Kong.[26]"

        "content": " Typhoon Nepartak, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Weng,[1] was a modest tropical cyclone that struck the central Philippines and the southern China island of Hainan in November 2003. Forming as a tropical depression on November 11 between Yap and Guam, the system moved westward and slowly intensified. It received the name Nepartak midday on November 12 from the Japan Meteorological Agency, becoming the 20th named storm of the 2003 Pacific typhoon season. On November 13, Napartak struck Samar in the Philippines and bisected the island chain. Up to four million people lost power, and transportation ground to a halt; over 5,000 individuals became stranded on ships forced to stay in port during the tropical storm. It was reported that 13 individuals died in the storm in the Philippines. After entering the open waters of the South China Sea, Nepartak continued to intensify and turned more toward the northwest. It attained its peak intensity on November 16, with maximum 10-minute sustained winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph) and 1-minute winds of 140\u00a0km/h (87\u00a0mph).[nb 1] After weakening slightly, the storm found a weakness in the easterly steering currents and bore north, reintensifying slightly and directly striking southwestern Hainan. There, heavy rainfall and strong winds destroyed crops, livestock, and hundreds of homes, leaving $197 million (2003 USD) in damage. The storm rapidly deteriorated in the Gulf of Tonkin and dissipated as it neared mainland China."

        "header": "Meteorological history",
        "content": "Nepartak originated in a region of strong thunderstorm activity, associated with a broad trough of low surface pressure, which was situated around 640\u00a0km (400\u00a0mi) southeast of Guam by 0000 UTC on November 11.[1][3] With weak wind shear and modest divergence of air over the system, it began to mature, although initially the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)[nb 2] downplayed the potential for tropical cyclogenesis. Over the next several hours, a low-level circulation center became evident and convection organized around it, prompting the JTWC to issue an updated outlook.[1] At 1800 UTC, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA)[nb 3] classified the storm as a tropical depression while it was located northeast of Yap in the Caroline Islands.[5] The JTWC issued a tropical cyclone formation alert for the system at 2030 UTC, and designated it Tropical Depression 25W at 1200 UTC on November 12.[3] The system intensified gradually as it began to track quickly westward toward the Philippines.[1] The depression had found its way to the southwestern quadrant of a large anticyclone aloft, allowing for continued strengthening. Both the JMA and the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical storm midday on November 12,[1][3] when it gained the name Nepartak from the JMA. Simultaneously, the cyclone entered the area of responsibility of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration, which named it Tropical Storm Weng.[6] Meteorologically, the storm began to exhibit improved outflow and deepening convection as it neared the central Philippines.[1] At around 1600 UTC on November 13, Nepartak made landfall on northern Samar Island in the Philippines before traversing the remainder of the archipelago from east to west.[5] The cyclone emerged into the South China Sea briefly weakened and with reduced forward motion, but quickly resumed its intensification trend as it turned more toward the northwest.[1] Shortly thereafter\u2014at 0000 UTC on November 15\u2014the JTWC further upgraded 25W to a typhoon.[3] Continuing generally toward the west-northwest under steering currents from a mid-level ridge to its north, Nepartak maintained its windspeeds throughout the day. With an improving appearance on satellite imagery, however, the storm gained some additional strength, and the JTWC estimated 25W to have attained its first peak intensity with maximum 1\u2011minute sustained winds of 140\u00a0km/h (87\u00a0mph) at 0000 UTC on November 16.[3] Later that day, the JMA determined Nepartak to have reached maximum 10-minute winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph), placing it at typhoon status. The cyclonic envelope began to ingest dry air from its surroundings, and convection began to wane, leading to slight weakening as the storm approached the island of Hainan. A shortwave trough soon cut a weakness in the mid-level ridge which had previously suppressed Nepartak to the south, allowing the cyclone to curve north and enhancing outflow over the storm. By late on November 17, a small eye feature about 19\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi) in diameter had formed, and at 0000 UTC the next day it was situated just offshore southwestern Hainan.[1] The cyclone's 1-minute winds increased once again to 140\u00a0km/h, marking its second and final peak at 0000 UTC on November 18.[1] The JMA, however, maintained Nepartak as a severe tropical storm.[3] The JTWC indicated that 25W made a second landfall on the coast of Hainan,[3] although the JMA did not make such mention, implying Nepartak's center remained over the Gulf of Tonkin.[5] Regardless, the cyclone's circulation had obscured most of Hainan and the Gulf of Tonkin and reached into adjacent Vietnam, and its forward speed slowed to a crawl. Extended interaction with land proved detrimental to the storm, and it began to rapidly disintegrate. Just 18 hours after its final bout of strengthening, Nepartak had been reduced to an exposed circulation center with no associated thunderstorms.[1] Turning toward the northeast, the system had been concurrently downgraded to a tropical depression by the JTWC and JMA early on November 19.[3][5] The weak remnant low of Nepartak limped ashore over Beihai, China at 1900 UTC and dissipated shortly thereafter.[1]"

        "content": "On its first landfall, the tropical storm buffeted the eastern-central Philippines with damaging winds gusting up to 160\u00a0km/h (99\u00a0mph), heavy rainfall, and rough seas. At least 20 provinces experienced adverse or dangerous weather, with the worst conditions concentrated over the islands of Samar and Masbate.[7] While structural and crop damages were limited, local infrastructure and transportation suffered the greatest.[8] Nepartak's winds caused complete power outages on Samar, Masbate, and nearby Marinduque, affecting their entire collective population of nearly four million individuals.[9] Many schools were closed. The storm forced the cancellation of nearly two dozen domestic flights to and from the region,[8] and at least 120 ferries and other vessels sought shelter in ports around the Manila, Bicol, and Visayas regions. On those ships were more than 5,000 people who became stranded until safe passage could be made.[10] By November 15, five deaths had been confirmed in the Philippines, four the result of electrocutions from downed powerlines.[10][11] Immediately following the disaster, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo made assisting the stranded passengers in coastal ports a priority.[11] According to the PAGASA in its post-storm report, a total of 13 people died, 5 others remained unaccounted for, and 11 sustained injuries.[6] One newspaper reported that a motorized craft in the Ta\u00f1on Strait capsized at the height of the storm, forcing the rescue of 11 people.[10] Another source also describes the sinking of a boat with at least 13 survivors and one fatality.[12] It is not clear whether these accounts cover the same incident. Nepartak inflicted widespread destruction on Hainan, including damage to farms and buildings. Most of the island was subject to strong winds and torrential rains, but the storm helped to relieve one of the worst summer droughts in almost 65 years.[3] Due to the danger, shipping was halted in the Qiongzhou Strait between November 16 and 19.[13] Nepartak impacted at least 1.72 million people on Hainan, compromised infrastructure, and impeded industry. The storm halted the operation of mines and rendered 72 highways temporarily unusable. Crops suffered extensively; 64,000\u00a0ha (160,000 acres) of fields were damaged, reducing grain production by as much as 3,200 tons. In addition, 400 head of livestock were lost to the typhoon.[14] With about 800 homes destroyed, damage on Hainan amounted to $197 million (2003 USD), and no fatalities were reported.[1][3] Following the storm, a young male sperm whale weighing over 500\u00a0kg (1,100\u00a0lb) washed ashore near Dongfang City on the island's southern shore, and died shortly after. Biologists speculated that the whale's demise may have been related to typhoon, although this was not confirmed.[15] By the time the storm had begun to abate over Hainan, it was already nearly dissipated, and as a result produced few, if any, noticeable effects in mainland China. Across the Gulf of Tonkin, Vietnam had experienced deadly flooding in the week before Nepartak's approach, and the typhoon initially raised concerns about worsening the situation. Officials made preparations to minimize potentially exacerbating factors,[16] and the cyclone remained far enough east to avoid seriously impacting the country.[1]"

Increased attention has been given to this season as authorities and government attempt to preempt any future loss of life after the Black Saturday bushfires during the previous season, 2008\u201309. Long range weather observations predict very hot, dry and windy weather conditions during the summer months, leading to a high risk of bushfire occurrence. In late September, several bushfires affected southeastern and northern Queensland. In October, bushfires affected much of the central latitudes of Australia, across Western Australia, Queensland and New South Wales. In early November, a heat wave across southeastern Australia and high bushfire risk weather, precipitated a series of bushfires in those states, particularly South Australia, where 6 people were injured in separate incidents. In December, a further 5 people were injured and a helicopter pilot killed, whilst fighting bushfires in NSW. Later that month, a 60-year-old man and three other men suffered burns whilst fighting fires in Southern NSW, while major fires burnt in the Riverina, far east Gippsland and Port Lincoln. Between Christmas and New Years 2009, bushfires affected the northern and central Wheatbelt of Western Australia, destroying 37 homes and about 3,000 hectares (7,410 acres) of bushland. In early January 2010, Victoria and South Australia experienced \"Catastrophic\" category fire conditions, and on 10 January, a CFA volunteer was killed and 2 others injured after a fire truck rolled en route to a fire near Mansfield, in Victoria's north east."

This has increased the fuel load potential by drying out vegetation, and increases the potential occurrence of hot temperature and high wind combinations that precipitate extreme bushfire conditions. The drought has increased potential for extreme conditions throughout the last decade. Major fires in the Victorian Alps during the 2003 and 2006/07 seasons and areas north-east of Melbourne in 2009, burnt large areas of vegetation in these areas resulting in reduced fuel loads in large areas of Victoria. However, other regions have not experienced major bushfires for a decade or longer, notably in the Otways, Mount Macedon, Southwest coast and much of the Dandenongs, requiring increased awareness and preparedness preceding the 2009\u201310 season, including controlled burns, general community preparations and overall education and awareness of the general population."

A list of 52 towns in Victoria that are deemed to be most at risk was released by the Victorian State Government in August 2009. This list is separate from the Royal Commission's interim report released around the same time. The nominated centers will take priority for developing \"township protection plans\".[1] The Royal Commission into the Black Saturday bushfires of the preceding season released its interim report on 17 August 2009, including recommendations for the 2009\u201310 season and other future seasons. The recommendations included, better warning systems, increased public awareness and education preceding the season, and better chain of command within and between all relevant authorities, amongst much else."

Most major fires are burning in the North Kimberley region, east of the Mitchell Plateau. One fire, burning near Broome, on 14 October, threatened property and homes in the outer suburb of Coconut Wells.[18] Other major bushfires burning in the Kimberly include fires at Fitzroy Crossing on Leopold Downs and Mount Elizabeth Station. In 2008, late-season wildfires burnt more than 7 million hectares in the Kimberley.[18] On 14 October, bushfires burnt on the Gold Coast in southeast Queensland affecting the areas around Nerang and Pacific Pines. On 14 October, the Nerang Shopping Centre was evacuated when flames reached within metres of the surrounding carpark.[19] A large bushfire burnt during mid-October in the Mount Archer National Park area on the eastern outskirts of Rockhampton for several days, threatening the suburbs of Lakes Creek, Koongal and Frenchville.  A house in Koongal was destroyed in the bushfire. On 15 October, a large grassfire burnt near the Gateway Motorway at Deagon in Brisbane's north and a fire at Toorbul (east of Caboolture) jumped containment lines and began burning in a pine plantation. In mid-October, bushfires burnt in the Clarence Valley. On 14 October 2009, one fire threatened the town of Brooms Head. The fire penetrated the settlement and threatened its only shop.

This was the second major heatwave in the region within 10 months. On 19 November, strong winds and storms abated the heat wave and increased risk of bushfires. On 10 November, three controlled burns in Victoria breached containment lines following wind gusts and high 30-degree temperatures, one 15 hectare fire in Point Nepean and two in Gippsland, one of which burnt over 1,000 hectares. On 20 November, a cool change brought strong winds and storms to much of the state causing damage to buildings and other structures. The high winds fanned several small bushfires including a 40-hectare fire at Dorodong, north-west of Casterton and a 180-hectare fire in the Cobboboonee National Park near Heywood in the state's south west. On 19 November, Around 20,000 lightning strikes occurred in South Australia as storms and cold fronts abated the November heat wave, Adelaide recording a temperature of 43. The strikes ignited over 100 fires across the state. Over 1,000 hectares have thus far been burnt on the Yorke Peninsula, where five people were injured when two CFS trucks collided in heavy smoke near Curramulka. Another firefighter near Kingston was injured in a separate incident. Over 2,000 personnel aided firefighting efforts across the state during these fires. Dozens of fires ignited between 19 and 20 November were burning in north, central and western New South Wales, and on Sydney's northern outskirts. 1000 personnel were deployed on the fire front, 2 homes were damaged and approximately 3,000 hectares burnt in NSW in total.

A father and son suffered serious burns whilst defending property after a bushfire flared up in the central-west New South Wales town of Vittoria, near Bathurst. Both were taken to Orange Base Hospital for treatment before being transferred to Concord Hospital in Sydney. The same fire forced the closure of the Mitchell Highway, between Bathurst and Orange. Every region of NSW was under a high to catastrophic fire danger for 9 December and total fire bans remained in effect for the central ranges, northern slopes, northwestern and upper central west plains regions. Between 9 and 10 December, 3 helicopters were involved in separate incidents fighting the fires. A helicopter mapping the fires crashed in dense fog into rainforest in the Donigo National Park at around noon, the pilot was taken to hospital in a critical but stable condition, whilst the passenger, a park ranger, died. Less than 24 hours later, two water-bombing helicopters collided tail rotors, forcing both to land, no one was injured. Areas affected by the early December fires included; Vittoria, near Bathurst, Wallendbeen, near Cootamundra, Cudgen, near far north NSW coast and areas west of Tamworth. The Vittoria fire burnt around 2,000 hectares (4,940 acres), while the Diamond Swamp fire burnt around 7,000+. On 17 December, bushfires affected Southern NSW including a major fire which has burnt 5,500 hectares (13,590 acres) in the Gerogery area, which is believed to had started at the Walla Walla tip.[21] A 60-year-old man suffered burns to 36 per-cent of his body whilst fighting fire near Walla Walla, with a number of vehicles, home, sheds, crops and livestock also destroyed by the fire.[22] The fire also forced the closure of the Main Southern railway line between Melbourne and Sydney and the Olympic Highway.[23] In Tooma near Tumbarumba, a bushfire had burnt 11,500 hectares (28,420 acres) destroying six homes and threatening the Tooma Hotel and also the Kosciuszko National Park.[21] Three men suffered burns and smoke inhalation while trying to fight the fire just outside the village of Tooma.[22][24] In Michelago, 54 kilometres (34\u00a0mi) south of Canberra, a bushfire burnt 9,000 hectares (22,240 acres) and three houses were also destroyed.[25] A powerline is believed to have caused a bushfire in Gregadoo, near Wagga Wagga, which burnt approximately 10 hectares (20 acres) of pasture, destroying a new shed and farm machinery.[26] Wagga Wagga recorded a catastrophic fire danger index of 170, the highest recording in seven years, due to the low humidity, high temperatures and strong winds.[27] On 17 December, a bushfire burnt over 6,700 hectares in far east Gippsland, near Cann River. Victoria's first Emergency Warning message for the summer was issued to the towns of Cann River, Noorinbee and Tonghi Creek as these towns were under imminent threat of being directly impacted. However, later that evening, rain began to fall and put a dampener on the fire, thus reducing fire activity and ending the threat to the towns. On 31 December, a small grassfire started at approximately 4:45pm (AEDT) at Mount Clear near Ballarat.[28] On 23 December, a bushfire burnt land around Port Lincoln, destroying several structures including the State Emergency Service Headquarters and six houses. The fire also cut power to approximately 6,000 properties after burning through the main power lines.[29] An unauthorised campfire in state forest was thought to start a bushfire that began 13 December 2009 about 17\u00a0km East of Harvey[30] The smoke from the fire later smothered Perth and other places along the Swan Coastal Plain in haze on 14 December until cleared by the sea breeze.[31] Over 100 personnel were involved in combating the blaze including dozens of firefighters. FESA issued warnings to residents of Harvey and Dwellingup and many roads were closed. A total area of 9700ha was burnt but no private property was destroyed.[32] On 29 December, following the state's first use of the \"catastrophic\" fire risk alert,[33] temperatures in areas to the north and east of Perth passed 45\u00a0\u00b0C (113\u00a0\u00b0F)[34] and a large bushfire started at 1pm AWST near the town of Toodyay, 85 kilometres (53\u00a0mi) north-east of Perth. The fire destroyed 37 homes and about 3,000 hectares (7,410 acres) of bushland. The fire continued into 30 December and was declared a natural disaster by the Premier, Colin Barnett.[35] Two firefighters were treated for smoke inhalation and dehydration, with the Fire and Emergency Services Authority of Western Australia (FESA) also reported that it had believed that a resident was being treated for burns at the Royal Perth Hospital.[36][37][38] A large bushfire was also reported at Badgingarra, about 200 kilometres (124\u00a0mi) north of Perth."

On 3 January, a bushfire threatened homes in the Swan Valley suburb of Brigadoon, 36 kilometres (22\u00a0mi) north-east of Perth.[39][40] On 8 January, a 26-year-old St Kilda man was seen trying to set fire to a park bench in the Sherbrooke State Forest in the Dandenong Ranges, 35\u00a0km east of Melbourne, just before 9.00am. He was later arrested on suspicion of attempted arson.[41] Another man was accused of arson after it was alleged he started two fires in Templestowe, an eastern suburb of Melbourne, less than 500m from houses. On 10 January, a CFA volunteer firefighter was killed and 2 other CFA personnel seriously injured when a CFA fire truck carrying 5 personnel rolled on Spring Creek Road at Tatong, whilst en route to a controlled burn near Mansfield, in Victoria's north-east, shortly before 6:30 am. The cause of the crash is yet to be determined.[42] On 11 January, the 'Catastrophic (Code Red)' fire danger rating was used for the first time in the state for 2010, in the Wimmera Region, prompting many residents to evacuate the town of Halls Gap whilst most other regions were classified as at 'Extreme' risk. Temperatures across much of the state exceeded 40 degrees, surpassing 43 in Melbourne, combined with strong northerly winds. On 12 January, a fire near Cann River in East Gippsland, broke containment lines.

It burnt an area of about 15 miles in length and up to 4 miles wide. Three hundred and fifty people fought the fire over two days before putting it out. A later flare up caused further damage to 600 acres of land, 500 of which was on the property of Timothy Quinlan.[36][37] In 1906, when he was Speaker of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly, Quinlan had been an advocate for the building of the line.[38] A major bushfire, blamed on collapsed power lines, broke out at about noon on 29 December 2009 after outdoor temperature had reached 45.4\u00a0\u00b0C (113.7\u00a0\u00b0F)[39] and the \"catastrophic\" fire risk rating had been used for the first time in the state.[40] Areas to the south, south-west and east of Toodyay were affected, with more than 3,000 hectares (7,410 acres) of forest burnt and 38 homes lost.[41]"

It caused moderate damage in the Philippines when it paralleled the country to the east as a Category\u00a05\u2013equivalent super typhoon; it later affected Taiwan and Japan as a weakening system. The fourth tropical depression, second named storm and the first super typhoon of the 2011 Pacific typhoon season, Songda formed from a non-tropical low that was embedded from the Intertropical Convergence Zone on May 17. An area of low-pressure subsequently formed and became organized for the JTWC to issue a TCFA on the system and the JMA to issue advisories, before both agencies declared it a tropical storm, earning the name Songda. Under favorable conditions, Songda slowly intensified as it entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility, with the PAGASA naming it Chedeng on May 23. On the next day, the three agencies declared the system a typhoon before rapidly intensifying to a super typhoon over the Philippine Sea. As it entered an unfavorable environment for further strengthening, Songda slowly weakened as it passed near Taiwan, before becoming extratropical near Japan. The remnants of the system slowly moved to the northeast, before absorbing to another extratropical cyclone to the south of Alaska. As Songda skirted the eastern Philippines, the typhoon caused four deaths and caused flash floods and significant landslides across the affected part of the country; however, the total damages in the country are unknown. Despite the storm becoming extratropical as it passed Japan, it caused heavy rains which led to flash floods and there were also reports of landslides. Thirteen individuals were killed due to unknown reasons. In total, Songda was blamed for 17 deaths and caused over \u00a57.06\u00a0billion ($65.156\u00a0million) worth of damages across its path."

It was in its time the costliest tornado in U.S. history, damaging nearly 9,000\u00a0homes and inflicting widespread damage to businesses, high-rise buildings, and public infrastructure. The tornado's damage was surveyed by meteorologist Ted Fujita in what researcher Thomas P. Grazulis described as \"the most detailed mapping ever done, up to that time, of the path of a single tornado.\" Originally, the most severe damage was assigned a preliminary F6 rating on the Fujita scale, making it one of only two tornadoes to receive the rating, alongside the 1974 Xenia tornado.[2] Later, it was downgraded to an F5 rating.[a] The extremity of the damage and the force required to displace heavy objects as much as was observed indicated that winds produced by vortices within the tornado may have  exceeded 290\u00a0mph (470\u00a0km/h). Although skies were clear, dry, and sunny in Lubbock during the afternoon of May\u00a011, the westward push of a dry line brought moist air into West Texas, providing suitable conditions for thunderstorm development. After 6:30\u00a0p.m., thunderstorms were in progress over the Lubbock area. At least two tornadoes developed prior to the main F5\u00a0tornado, including one that tracked across parts of eastern Lubbock near U.S. 87. The primary F5 tornado touched down in southwestern Lubbock at 9:35\u00a0p.m. and over the next half-hour carved a 8.5-mile (13.7\u00a0km) path of devastation encompassing roughly a quarter of the city, with the twister lifting near the Lubbock Municipal Airport shortly after 10\u00a0p.m. The tornado varied in size, spanning 1.5\u00a0mi (2.4\u00a0km) across when it first touched down before narrowing to around 0.25\u00a0mi (0.40\u00a0km) by the time it lifted. Severe damage was wrought to high-rises and other buildings in downtown Lubbock, including the 20-story Great Plains Life Building. The tornado briefly moved west and weakened, causing light damage to the campus of Texas Tech University before reintensifying and resuming a northward path. The tornado's most destructive impacts were observed in the Guadalupe barrio, north of 4th Street, along Texas State Highway Loop 289, and near the Lubbock County Club. In those locales, some homes were completely leveled and many others were irreparably damaged. Around 119\u00a0aircraft were damaged at the Lubbock airport where the Lubbock office of the United States Weather Bureau was located. As of 2024, this remains the westernmost F5/EF5 tornado recorded in the United States.[4][5]"

Cumulus clouds began to proliferate over the region by around 4\u00a0p.m. and towering cumulus clouds began to develop over West Texas, darkening the skies over Lubbock.[10][8] The WSR-57 weather radar site in Amarillo, Texas, began detecting radar echoes south of Lubbock at 6:30\u00a0p.m.[6] Lubbock radar later picked up on a thunderstorm with a diameter of approximately 10\u00a0mi (16\u00a0km) forming near Woodrow, Texas, 15\u00a0mi (24\u00a0km) south of the Lubbock Municipal Airport.[8] Satellite imagery from the ATS-3 satellite showed that the storm emerged about 15\u201320\u00a0mi (24\u201332\u00a0km) behind the leading edge of the advancing mass of moist air originating from the Gulf.[11] Although the westward retreat of this boundary\u00a0\u2013 known as a dry line\u00a0\u2013 would typically coincide with nightfall and a stabilizing of the atmosphere, it did not move far from Lubbock during the evening, maintaining a local area of converging winds and moist rising air supportive of thunderstorm growth. These conducive conditions were also bolstered by the approach of a shortwave trough in the mid-levels of the troposphere, serving as another contributor to rising air.[6] By 7\u00a0p.m. the northern fringes of the storm were near the Lubbock city limits.[11] A radiosonde launched from Amarillo concurrently showed that the tropopause had risen by 7,000\u00a0ft (2,100\u00a0m) to 48,000\u00a0ft (15,000\u00a0m) over the preceding 12\u00a0hours. The Amarillo weather radar also suggested that the thunderstorm's cloud tops were rising to at least 46,000\u00a0ft (14,000\u00a0m).[12] Ironically, at the time the storm was developing, the Lubbock Civil Defense was holding a meeting to discuss disaster preparation plans, highlighted by showing the documentary film Tornado! (1966). The Lubbock Tornado itself became the subject of another documentary, Twister, with a subtle emphasis on a bumper sticker: \"Lucky Me!  I Live in Lubbock!\" With the storm approaching and threatening to become severe, Alan Johnson of the Weather Bureau called Bill Payne, the director of Lubbock Civil Defense, to provide notice of the inclement weather. The emergency operations center (EOC) at the basement of the Lubbock city hall was activated at 7:45\u00a0p.m.[8] Following discussion between forecasters at the local Weather Bureau office in Lubbock (Lubbock WBO, located at the Lubbock airport) and the radar operator in Amarillo, a severe thunderstorm warning was issued by the Lubbock WBO for Crosby, Floyd, Lubbock, and Hale counties at 7:50\u00a0p.m. with an expiration time set to 9:00\u00a0p.m.[6][12] This warning was disseminated via the Emergency Action Notification Signal and through local radio and television stations such as KFYO.[12] KFYO continuously ran without commercials after this time until 7:30\u00a0a.m. on May\u00a014.[6] Despite the increasingly conducive atmospheric conditions for the formation of severe thunderstorms, the NSSFC did not issue a severe thunderstorm watch or tornado watch for the region before storms developed. The Environmental Science Services Administration (ESSA) wrote in a service assessment of the weather event that the lack of such of a watch from the NSSFC demanded \"some explanation,\" but also noted that their absence did not affect the operations of the Lubbock WBO.[7]"

        "content": "Large hail the size of grapefruits were reported in the thunderstorm 5\u00a0mi (8.0\u00a0km) south of Lubbock at around 8\u00a0p.m., with baseball-sized hail reaching southeastern Lubbock by 8:13\u00a0p.m. Severe Weather Statements were transmitted by the Lubbock WBO over the Weather Wire Service to relay the hail reports as the storm neared Lubbock. Radar data indicated that the thunderstorm's cloud tops had increased to 55,000\u00a0ft (17,000\u00a0m) by 8:10\u00a0p.m. At around the same time, an off-duty policeman reported a funnel cloud 7\u00a0mi (11\u00a0km) southeast of the Lubbock airport and 3\u00a0mi (4.8\u00a0km) east of the city limits.[12][13] This, along with the detection of a hook echo on radar, prompted the Lubbock Weather Bureau office to issue a tornado warning for Crosby, eastern Floyd, western Hale, and Lubbock counties at 8:15\u00a0p.m. with an expiration time of 9:00\u00a0p.m.[12] At 8:30\u00a0p.m., a tornado\u00a0\u2013 the first of two to strike the Lubbock area\u00a0\u2013 touched down near the intersection of Broadway and Quint Avenue in eastern Lubbock.[6] Described by tornado researcher Ted Fujita as a \"small forerunner\" to the main Lubbock tornado, this first twister produced a damage path roughly 2\u00a0mi (3.2\u00a0km) across and caused structural damage indicative of wind gusts reaching around 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h). The most severe damage occurred near the interchange between U.S. 82 and Parkway Drive, which was under construction at the time. There, 13\u00a0concrete beams weighing 109,000\u00a0lb (49,000\u00a0kg) each and doubly weighted with chains were blown down from a partially-built overpass by the tornado.[13] At 8:40\u00a0p.m., the NSSFC issued a severe thunderstorm watch for the entirety of the Southern Plains.[6] Concurrently, two thunderstorms quickly developed 8\u00a0mi (13\u00a0km) southwest of the Lubbock airport and moved northeast at 25\u00a0mph (40\u00a0km/h); their formation was noted on a Severe Weather Statement issued by the Lubbock WBO at 8:42\u00a0p.m. At 8:59\u00a0p.m., the office issued a bulletin that extended the preexisting tornado warning to 10\u00a0p.m. The bulletin also advised people to prepare to seek shelter with radar imagery and reports continuing to indicate that a tornado was in progress roughly 7\u00a0mi (11\u00a0km) south-southeast of the Lubbock airport.[12] At around 9:00\u00a0p.m., a separate tornado\u00a0\u2013 listed as an F1 tornado in the National Centers for Environmental Information's Storm Events database\u00a0\u2013 unroofed a barn approximately 8\u00a0mi (13\u00a0km) north of Crosbyton, shearing the sheet metal roof over a nearby pasture.[14] TORNADO WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FOR LUBBOCK...WESTERN CROSBY...FLOYD...AND SOUTHERN HALE COUNTIES UNTIL 10 PM TONIGHT...SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS WITH LARGE HAIL...DAMAGING WINDS AND POSSIBLY A TORNADO IN THESE AREAS UNTIL 10 PM...RADAR STILL INDICATES GOOD HOOK FORMATION ABOUT 6 MILES SOUTH SOUTHEAST OF THE LUBBOCK AIRPORT...AND THIS LOCATION WOULD BE ON THE BUFFALO SPRINGS LAKE ROAD ABOUT 3 MILES EAST OF THE CITY OF LUBBOCK...IDALOU SHOULD BE ON THE ALERT IN PARTICULAR FOR THIS SEVERE STORM AND POSSIBLE TORNADO..."

        "content": "Large hail continued to fall throughout Lubbock, with reports indicating hail the size of golf balls and baseballs.[6] After around 9\u00a0p.m., the radar echoes associated with the storms in the Lubbock area began to congeal, resulting in a singular, larger echo. This coalescence had been previously observed in connection with tornadogenesis.[11] By 9:14\u00a0p.m., the severe thunderstorm was 10\u201315\u00a0mi (16\u201324\u00a0km) in diameter based on radar data.[14] At 9:35\u00a0p.m., the main Lubbock tornado, much larger and more destructive than the previous tornadoes, touched down near the intersection of 19th Street and University Avenue and began to track towards the north-northeast.[6][8] The WSR-1 radar site in Lubbock simultaneously observed a hook echo in the thunderstorm coincident with the newly formed tornado. This prompted the Lubbock WBO to alert the Lubbock Civil Defense EOC, which, in combination with a spotter report of a funnel cloud in the area, resulted in the activation of tornado warning sirens. However, the tornado's winds had already severed the power lines that serviced many of the sirens, rendering them inoperable and causing their failure to activate. Although police cruisers also sounded their sirens to alert those nearby of the imminent tornado, many ultimately did not hear either signal and thus likely received no warning.[16] Communications were brought down as the tornado tore through Lubbock and triggered widespread power outages. At 9:43\u00a0p.m., Bud Andrews, the radio announcer on KFYO, directed listeners to take shelter shortly before the AM station stopped transmitting. The Lubbock Civil Defense headquarters lost commercial power and communications at 9:46\u00a0p.m. with the exception of a single telephone line. The Lubbock WBO was able to reach the EOC at 9:47\u00a0p.m. to relay that the hook echo observed on radar was in the vicinity of 4th Street and Avenue U.[8] This was the last communication transmitted by the Lubbock WBO as all communications went offline at 9:49\u00a0p.m. The WSR-1 radar also went offline around the same time following the downing of its emergency generator. The personnel at the office abandoned their post and took shelter at 9:55\u00a0p.m. shortly before the tornado passed over the Lubbock WBO. With the Lubbock WBO no longer fully operational, dissemination of subsequent tornado warnings were carried out by the agency using the VHF-FM radio of the Lubbock Fire Department; this was ultimately the only line of communication between the Lubbock WBO and the surrounding area and allowed tornado warnings to be communicated to the Abernathy, New Deal, and Petersburg areas at 10:10\u00a0p.m.[6] Wind gusts at the nearby airport reached 77\u00a0kn (89\u00a0mph; 143\u00a0km/h) at 10:03\u00a0p.m., likely coinciding with the tornado's passage over the airport and the Weather Bureau office.[17] The tornado lifted near the airport shortly thereafter. All weather warnings were called off by the Lubbock WBO at 11:30\u00a0p.m. once thunderstorms had lessened to a more moderate intensity around Lorenzo, Texas.[6]"

        "content": "The primary Lubbock tornado\u00a0\u2013 the second of two tornadoes that struck the city on May\u00a011\u00a0\u2013 produced a damage path 8.5\u00a0mi (13.7\u00a0km) long and extending across 15\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (39\u00a0km2) of ground, beginning at 9:35\u00a0p.m. in southwestern Lubbock, tracking through downtown Lubbock, and lifting shortly after 10\u00a0p.m. near the Lubbock Municipal Airport[6] This damage path covered nearly a quarter of the city. The tornado was 1.5\u00a0mi (2.4\u00a0km) wide when it formed and when it tracked through downtown, tying it with the 1947 Glazier\u2013Higgins tornados as the widest tornado recorded in Texas history. The tornado narrowed as it tracked northeast, reaching a width of 0.25\u00a0mi (0.40\u00a0km) when it impacted the Lubbock airport. It was the second tornado in Texas history to strike the downtown area of a city of comparable size, with the first being the 1953 Waco tornado,[14][c] and one of the most destructive to hit any U.S. city.[19] As the tornado struck after nightfall, no photographs were taken of the twister.[6] There were 26\u00a0fatalities and numerous injuries, with estimates of the lower-bound on the number of casualties ranging from 500 to as high as 2,000.[6][20] Approximately 1,500\u00a0people were treated for injuries and 96\u00a0people were hospitalized, with many of the injuries caused by broken glass in the downtown area.[21] Estimates of the tornado's damage toll vary: the National Weather Service (NWS) forecast office in Lubbock and the National Centers for Environmental Information Storm Events Database lists the tornado as having caused $250\u00a0million (equivalent to $1.96\u00a0billion in 2023) in damage.[22][1] The May 1970 edition of Storm Data initially estimated a $135\u00a0million (equivalent to $1.06\u00a0billion in 2023) property damage toll. Nonetheless, the lower estimate made the Lubbock tornado the costliest tornado in Texas history.[6][14] It also became the costliest tornado in U.S. history, incurring more damage than the tornado that struck Topeka, Kansas, on June 8, 1966; the Lubbock tornado's toll was later surpassed by a tornado that struck Omaha, Nebraska, in 1975.[23] According to the National Weather Service, 8,800\u00a0homes were damaged, of which 430 were destroyed.[6] The American Red Cross enumerated damage to 1,713\u00a0single family homes, of which 460 were destroyed.[21] Additionally, 600\u00a0apartment units were destroyed and 250\u00a0businesses were damaged or destroyed. Ten thousand vehicles were also damaged or destroyed;[6] some cars were compacted to a height of 2\u20133\u00a0ft (0.61\u20130.91\u00a0m) above the ground. Damage to private vehicles reached approximately $3\u00a0million (equivalent to $23.5\u00a0million in 2023). Estacado High School, Thompson Junior High School, and eight elementary schools (Arnett, Jackson, Hunt, K. Carter, McWhorter, North Avenue U, and Sanders) were damaged.[14] The tornado also caused extensive power outages and disruptions to communications, knocking out service to 25,000\u00a0telephones.[20][8] Large trees were also uprooted throughout the damage swath.[14] The severity of damage along the tornado's path varied considerably, a phenomenon the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) ascribed to both the varied structural integrity of the buildings impacted and the varied wind patterns generated by the tornado.[21] In some areas, homes with minor shingle damage remained standing next to homes with total loss of their roofs.[24] While an NBS investigation concluded that two tornadoes touched down east of Texas Tech University before merging into a single tornado north of downtown,[25] analysis of the tornado damage conducted by Ted Fujita deduced there was a singular multiple-vortex tornado composed of smaller vortices that produced smaller areas of serious damage; 25 of the 26 fatalities occurred in the paths of these smaller vortices.[6] Fujita's analysis of these vortices, which he termed \"section spots\", suggested that rotational winds of 145\u2013290\u00a0mph (233\u2013467\u00a0km/h) were produced by the tornado. Two homes in the path of one of these small vortices were pulverized, with the remaining debris carried 200\u00a0ft (61\u00a0m) away onto a field. One empty fertilizer tank weighing 16 short tons (15\u00a0t) was displaced 890\u00a0m (2,920\u00a0ft), with the tank likely remaining airbone for 700\u00a0m (2,300\u00a0ft), being lofted by a tornadic vortex above US-87 before rolling to its final position.[26] When Fujita proposed his eponymous scale for rating tornado damage in 1971, he rated the most severe damage from Lubbock as F5, the highest practical rating on the scale.[27] John A. Shanahan of Stone & Webster analyzed several instances of severe damage produced by the tornado, finding that horizontal winds may have ranged between 150\u2013250\u00a0mph (240\u2013400\u00a0km/h). Supporting evidence for winds of such strength included a steel tank weighing 37,570\u00a0lb (17,040\u00a0kg) being displaced 2,700\u00a0ft (820\u00a0m) from its initial supporting structure.[28] Downtown Lubbock was heavily impacted by the tornado, with skyscrapers and buildings subjected to the tornado's violent winds.[14] The tornado also narrowed during its traversal of downtown to a diameter of roughly 0.4\u00a0mi (0.64\u00a0km), producing in a corresponding increase of winds around the tornado.[29] Eighty percent of the plate glass windows in the downtown district were shattered.[14] The tornado's periphery struck the 20-story Great Plains Life Building (now known as the NTS Building), distorting the building's frame counter-clockwise and disabling three of the building's four elevators.[8][30] The torsion of the entire building resulted in severe cracks in the building's stairwells and on the fire protection surrounding steel columns within the tower.[30] Brick was also stripped from the building and windows were blown out by the atmospheric pressure differences induced by the tornado.[14][30] Interior pressure buildup fractured loadbearing columns and lofted ceilings. As the center of the tornado remained 0.5\u00a0mi (0.80\u00a0km) northwest of the skyscraper, the building likely avoided more extreme damage; the damage toll nonetheless reached around $2\u00a0million (equivalent to $15.7\u00a0million in 2023).[30][20] There were around 30\u00a0people in the building when the tornado hit; they took shelter in the lobby as the tornado passed nearby.[30] The predominantly glass north and southern fa\u00e7ades of the 15-story First National Bank\u2013Pioneer Natural Gas Building (now the Wells Fargo Building) were largely destroyed. The marble veneer of the building's eastern and western ends were ripped from their copper wire anchor. Strong winds penetrated the buildings interior, damaging suspended ceilings. Total damage to the building amounted to around $1\u00a0million (equivalent to $7.8\u00a0million in 2023).[14][8][31] Signs were ripped from the roof of the Lubbock National Bank Building while the Citizens National Bank Building and Lubbock County Courthouse sustained primarily minor window damage.[14] The two-story plate glass windows on the eastern side of the Lubbock City Hall were shattered, leading to the collapse of some interior walls;[14] overall the city hall sustained moderate damage.[8] Federal government buildings in downtown Lubbock avoided significant damage, with occupied and operational buildings collectively sustaining only around $2,000 in damage. However, $150,000-worth of construction materials were damaged at the site of the eight-story Federal Office Building, which was under construction at the time.[32] Several churches were damaged: the Broadway Church of Christ lost roof tiles and window panes and the roof of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church collapsed.[8] The publishing facilities of the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal were crippled by the tornado.[14] The roof of the Central Fire Station collapsed, smashing the fire trucks below. One dispatcher on duty was struck by shards of flying glass and lost an eye.[8] One Greyhound bus was hurled onto a downtown building by the tornado.[14] The steel frames of the two buildings at Newson's Living Center were contorted by the tornado; one of the buildings was destroyed while the other sustained heavy damage on its topmost, second story.[24] The tornado curved west its initial traversal of downtown Lubbock and weakened markedly, with the swaths of intense damage caused by the tornado's smaller vortices becoming less apparent.[33] One of the light towers at the Jones Stadium on the campus of Texas Tech was destroyed while three others on the stadium's eastern side were bent by the tornado's winds. The stadium itself sustained light damage; this was the extent of the tornadic damage on the university's campus.[8][14] After the tornado reached the intersection of University Avenue and 4th Street, it looped eastward and intensified, becoming increasingly destructive.[33] Student housing in the Overton area of Lubbock was particularly hard-hit, with the severity of damage requiring demolition of the remaining structures. The University Arms apartments on 5th Street and University Avenue sustained moderately damage.[8]  The Arnett Benson subdivision sustained significant damage and roofs were damaged and tree limbs were torn near the Clovis Highway.[14] The Brookshire Inn was seriously damaged.[8] Industrial buildings were hard-hit by the tornado, including several warehouses.[34] Buildings with large segments of exposed and unsupported roofs suffered greatly, experiencing heavy damage or total destruction.[14] Five of the cylindrical grain bins at the Goodpasture Inc. grain elevator, each covered by 10-inch (25\u00a0cm) thick and steel-reinforced concrete, were blown open by the tornado.[26][35] Damage to public facilities amounted to roughly $10\u00a0million (equivalent to $78.5\u00a0million in 2023).[14] Both the Lubbock Power and Light (LP&L) No. 1 power plant near downtown and the LP&L No. 2 power plant on Municipal Hill were knocked out by the tornado.[14][8] After clearing the downtown area, the tornado tracked northeast along U.S. Highway 87. Significant residential damage was concentrated north of 4th Street. Apartment complexes along the northern side of 4th Street near Indiana Avenue were unroofed. The motels on Avenue Q North Drive (the Amarillo Highway) were destroyed, while all motels lining 4th Street and Avenue Q north of 10th street were seriously damaged.[14] The Lubbock City-County Health Department headquarters on Avenue Q were destroyed.[14] A Ramada Inn adjacent to US-87 was directly in the path of the center of the tornado and was bombarded by quickly-moving debris, resulting in loss of the motel's brick veneer; the motel's carport was lofted 40\u00a0ft (12\u00a0m) northward. At two mobile home parks north of downtown, some homes were blown off of their chassis, overturned, and crushed by the tornado; 80 mobile homes in total were destroyed, with another 30 taking severe damage. It was the second tornado strike in two years for one of the mobile home parks; many of the complex's residents took shelter in the basement of a nearby house.[36] The most severe residential damage was wrought in the Guadalupe neighborhood, between Avenues A and Q north of 4th Street, along the northern part of Loop 289, and in the Lubbock Country Club west of the Amarillo Highway.[14][8] The tornado inflicted considerable damage to homes near the Lubbock Country Club. Some homes disintegrated and others were fully unroofed. Without basements or storm shelters, many residents sought shelter beneath mattresses in their homes. Nearby trees were denuded of their leaves and debris in the area was numerous.[36] The tornado then tracked across the Lubbock Municipal Airport, damaging hangars and buildings.[14] Aircraft were strewn by the powerful winds across the airport tarmac.[8] Roughly 100\u00a0private airplanes were destroyed by the tornado both within and outside the hangars, with another 19 small military aircraft irreparably damaged. The rim of the funnel cloud, at the time measuring between 0.3\u20130.4\u00a0mi (0.48\u20130.64\u00a0km) in diameter, came as close as 0.75\u00a0mi (1.21\u00a0km) to the Lubbock WBO, with the office's anomemometer registering a peak gust of 77\u00a0kn (89\u00a0mph; 143\u00a0km/h).[14][33]"

        "content": "Twenty-six people were killed in the tornado or died due to injuries received during the storm.[37] Hospitals turned away people with minor injuries due to the sheer number of casualties inflicted by the tornado.[14] With its water pumps rendered inoperable, the city relied on external sources of water including the Pearl Brewing Company in San Antonio.[8] After the storm, Mayor Jim Granberry imposed a curfew, and Police Chief J.T. Alley issued orders that looters would be shot on sight. No looting was reported throughout the ordeal. The city council was directed to lead the rebuilding process, which continued under Granberry's successor, Morris W. Turner. The Lubbock Tornado also served as a model for the development of the Fujita scale, developed a year later. Bud Andrews and Ernesto Barton, Lubbock radio broadcasters, were given Presidential Citations from then U.S. President Richard M. Nixon for coverage of the disaster.[citation needed] Despite the destruction wrought by the tornado, the recovery effort revitalized the stagnating Lubbock economy and helped to bring about a period of sustained economic and physical growth.[38] Numerous buildings throughout Lubbock were damaged beyond repair and were demolished after the tornado. This included the northwestern section of downtown, whose demolition made way for the construction of the Lubbock Memorial Civic Center and the George and Helen Mahon Public Library;[8] civic leaders had lobbied for a civic center and other public development of downtown in years prior and used the redevelopment of downtown to make these visions a reality.[38] New hotels and restaurants were constructed along the largely devastated east side of Avenue Q. The residents of the predominantly Hispanic neighborhood of Guadalupe moved to primarily the southern and western portions of Lubbock. The Lubbock Urban Renewal Agency rebuilt the largely destroyed Guadalupe neighborhood, though progress was slow for many years before substantial reconstruction occurred.[38][8] The damage path of the Lubbock tornado was the subject of a detailed mapping carried out by Ted Fujita. Researcher Thomas P. Grazulis described this mapping as the \"most detailed mapping ever done, up to that time, of the path of a single tornado,\" becoming a seminal work in understanding the relationship between tornado subvortices and extreme damage. The degrees of damage wrought by the tornado also became the basis for the six tiers of the Fujita tornado scale, which served as the standard for classifying tornadoes until it was superseded by the Enhanced Fujita Scale in 2007.[39][22] Fifty years after the disaster, a The Lubbock Tornado Memorial Gateway Park was opened at Ave Q and Glenna Goodacre Blvd in downtown Lubbock: a spot along the destructive path of the larger tornado.The memorial includes two flowing black granite-clad walls representing the two paths of the tornadoes. There are also artistically bent street lights representing the power of the tornadoes, and one relic from the destruction: a snapped-off utility pole. The walls are engraved with timelines of the tornado events, a map of the destructive paths overlaid on a street map of the city at the time, and location references on the map indexed to the individual names and ages of the 26 victims who died as a result of the second tornado. There are also quotes from survivors and other details."

The tornado touched down as a 100-mph EF1 in southwest Guilford County, severely damaging a daycare center and flipping an unoccupied school bus. The tornado moved north across Highway 311 and gained intensity, becoming an EF2 that caused significant damage to structures in the area, including blowing a bedroom off of a single-story home. It briefly reached EF3 in intensity when it entered a residential area, removing the second story off of a 2-story home and damaging or destroying 50-60 homes in the neighborhood. The tornado weakened to an EF2 and moved into a highly urbanized area, causing minor to moderate damage, and again removing the 2nd story off of a 2-story home. The storm finally weakened to an EF1 and finally lifted just north of Oak Hollow Lake.[21][22] This was the first EF3 tornado to strike the Piedmont Triad region since May 8, 2008, when an EF3 tornado struck Clemmons, just outside Winston-Salem. The tornado caused $9.95\u00a0million in property damage, destroying 40\u00a0homes and businesses and damaging another 609\u00a0structures.[23] The mayor of High Point declared a state of emergency.[24]"

The tornado tracked quickly eastward into the city, hitting the town of Copper Cliff and the neighborhoods of Robinson and Lockerby over the next ten minutes. Another tornado associated with the same storm also hit the community of Field, approximately 70\u00a0kilometres east of Sudbury, less than an hour later. The storm continued through North Bay, uprooting some trees in the wilderness but avoiding any damage to the city.[3] It then tracked southeasterly toward Ottawa, leading the federal government to order a precautionary shutdown of its offices in the capital,[4] but the storm weakened around Chalk River and only a few millimetres of rain actually fell on Ottawa by the time it reached that city.[4] Residents of the region had little warning of the storm as the Sudbury Airport did not at the time have weather radar capable of detecting tornado activity,[5][permanent dead link] and the day's only weather forecast was for \"showers\".[6] The first public indication of the twister, instead, was a phone call to CKSO from a woman frantically reporting that her house was blowing away.[7] Six people died and 200 were injured in the tornado, which caused an estimated $17 million in 1970 (which is about $131.6 million in 2023) in damage,[7] including to Inco's copper smelter in Copper Cliff. A pipeline carrying iron-nickel concentrate to the plant collapsed onto a train track below, in turn causing a derailment when a train hit the collapsed pipe, but the incident resulted in only minor injuries.[8] The Inco Superstack, then under construction, swayed in the storm but was not heavily damaged.[3] Six workers were on the construction platform at the time, although all six survived.[9] Minor damage was also reported to the Big Nickel, with some pitting of the stainless steel panels as rocks and debris hit the monument, although that structure also survived.[10] Damage was also reported to Memorial Hospital, Glad Tidings Tabernacle, and over 300 homes in Lively, Sudbury and Field.[11] Some streets in the affected neighbourhoods were flooded by up to a foot of water, and electrical and communications infrastructure was heavily damaged. For several days after the storm, amateur radio remained the only reliable method of communication into and out of the city.[12] In Field, a lumber mill which was the town's primary employer was heavily damaged,[13] and a church roof was ripped off just minutes after parishioners had left the building after the end of the morning mass.[14]"

It was not until 1972 that the Canada Atmospheric Environment Service published a final report confirming that a tornado had indeed taken place.[19]"

        "content": "Nannup's name is of Noongar origin, meaning either  \"stopping place\" or \"place of parrots\", and was first recorded by surveyors in the 1860s. The area was at one point known as \"Lower Blackwood\", and the first European settler to explore it was Thomas Turner in 1834. In 1866, a bridge was built over the river and a police station was established. A townsite was set aside in 1885, surveyed in 1889 and gazetted on 9 January 1890.[3] In 1906, a primary school and shire office were built. In 1909, the Nannup Branch Railway (no longer in operation) was extended from Jarrahwood, linking to the Bunbury-Busselton railway. Menaced by bushfires in 1928, settlers had to battle hard against the flames to save their properties.[4] More bushfires, fanned by strong winds, swept across the region in 1935 burning out over 100 hectares (247 acres) and destroying one house and a barn.[5] More bushfires were burning in the district over the course of several days in 1937, resulting in the stables and the sheds at the local race course being burned down, the destruction of large amounts of feed for stock, and the loss of telephone lines.[6] The town was flooded in 1945 when the Blackwood River rose to its highest flood level recorded to that date. Three families were left homeless and others had to be evacuated from the floodwaters.[7] At its highest level the river was running 1.1 metres (3.5\u00a0ft) over the Russell Street bridge and the town's electricity supply failed from lines being damaged, leaving the town in darkness.[8]  The river flooded again in 1946 and 1947, closing roads but not causing any significant damage to the town.[9] In 1949 the town received 174 millimetres (6.86\u00a0in) of rain in a period of seven hours, causing flooding and one bridge connecting the town to Busselton to be swept away.[10] Bushfires once again struck in 1950 with several large fires burning only a few miles from town. The outbreak destroyed nearly 12,100 hectares (30,000 acres) of jarrah and karri forest. The fires were brought under control reasonably quickly; they were believed to have been deliberately lit.[11] The Dry Brook bridge just outside town on the Nannup-Balingup collapsed as a result of flood damage from the previous years. Although the bridge had been repaired after being damaged in smaller floods of 1950, it was undercut again and caved in without causing any injuries.[12] In 1982 after the remnants of a tropical cyclone passed through the south west, the town and surrounding areas were inundated by heavy rains. The Blackwood rose 11.6 metres (38\u00a0ft), submerging over 50 houses.[13] Many historical photographs are held by the Nannup Historical Society.[14] Parts of the movie Drift were filmed in Nannup in 2011.[15] One of the oldest buildings, a stone cottage built in 1862\u201363, is still standing on a farm on Gold Gully Rd. The building was in disrepair for a number of years but as of February 2020[update] is being restored by the current owner.[citation needed]"

It includes both non-volcanic mountains, such as many of those in the North Cascades, and the notable volcanoes known as the High Cascades. The small part of the range in British Columbia is referred to as the Canadian Cascades or, locally, as the Cascade Mountains. The highest peak in the range is Mount Rainier in Washington at 14,411 feet (4,392\u00a0m). The Cascades are part of the Pacific Ocean's Ring of Fire, the ring of volcanoes and associated mountains around the Pacific Ocean. All of the eruptions in the contiguous United States over the last 200 years have been from Cascade volcanoes. The two most recent were Lassen Peak from 1914 to 1921 and a major eruption of Mount St. Helens in 1980. Minor eruptions of Mount St. Helens have also occurred since, most recently from 2004 to 2008.[3] The Cascade Range is a part of the American Cordillera, a nearly continuous chain of mountain ranges (cordillera) that form the western \"backbone\" of North, Central, and South America. The Cascades are home to many national parks and protected areas, including North Cascades National Park, Mount Rainier National Park, Crater Lake National Park, and Lassen Volcanic National Park. The northern half of the Pacific Crest Trail follows the range."

        "content": "The Cascades extend northward from Lassen Peak (also known as Mount Lassen) in northern California to the confluence of the Nicola and Thompson rivers in British Columbia. The Fraser River separates the Cascades from the Coast Mountains in Canada,[4] as does the Willamette Valley from the upper portion of the Oregon Coast Range. The highest volcanoes of the Cascades, known as the High Cascades,[5] dominate their surroundings, often standing twice the height of the nearby mountains. They often have a visual height (height above nearby crestlines) of one mile or more. The highest peaks, such as the 14,411-foot (4,392\u00a0m) Mount Rainier, dominate their surroundings for 50 to 100 miles (80 to 161\u00a0km). The northern part of the range, north of Mount Rainier, is known as the North Cascades in the United States but is formally named the Cascade Mountains north of the Canada\u2013United States border, reaching to the northern extremity of the Cascades at Lytton Mountain.[6] Overall, the North Cascades and Canadian Cascades are extremely rugged; even the lesser peaks are steep and glaciated, and valleys are quite low relative to peaks and ridges, so there is great local relief.[7] The southern part of the Canadian Cascades, particularly the Skagit Range, is geologically and topographically similar to the North Cascades, while the northern and northeastern parts are less glaciated and more plateau-like, resembling nearby areas of the Thompson Plateau.[4] The range is near the Pacific Ocean and in the region's prevailing westerly winds, so it receives significant rain and snowfall, especially on the western slopes due to orographic lift, with annual snow accumulations of up to 1,000 inches (2,500\u00a0cm) (= 83 feet (25\u00a0m)) in some areas. Mount Baker in Washington recorded a national record single-season snowfall in the winter of 1998\u201399 with 1,140 inches (2,900\u00a0cm) (= 95 feet (29\u00a0m)).[8] Before that year, Mount Rainier held the American record for snow accumulation at Paradise in 1978. It is not uncommon for some places in the Cascades to have over 500 inches (1,300\u00a0cm) of annual snow accumulation, such as at Lake Helen, near Lassen Peak.[9] Most of the High Cascades are therefore white with snow and ice year-round. The western slopes are densely covered with Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) and red alder (Alnus rubra),[10] while the drier eastern slopes feature mostly ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), with some western larch (Larix occidentalis), mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) and subalpine larch (Larix lyallii) at higher elevations.[11] Annual rainfall is as low as 9 inches (230\u00a0mm) on the eastern foothills due to a rain shadow effect.[12] Beyond the eastern foothills is an arid plateau that was largely formed 17 to 14\u00a0million years ago by the many flows of the Columbia River Basalt Group. Together, these sequences of fluid volcanic rock form the 200,000-square-mile (520,000\u00a0km2) Columbia Plateau in eastern Washington, Oregon, and parts of western Idaho.[13] The Columbia River Gorge is the only major break of the range in the United States. When the Cascades began to rise 7\u00a0million years ago in the late Miocene, the Columbia River drained the relatively low Columbia Plateau. As the range grew, erosion from the Columbia River was able to keep pace, carving out the gorge and major pass seen today. The gorge also exposes uplifted and warped layers of basalt from the plateau.[14][15]"

        "content": "Before European exploration, First Nations tribes named many peaks, including \"Wy'east\" for Mount Hood,[16] \"Seekseekqua\" for Mount Jefferson (Oregon),[16] \"M'laiksini Yaina\" for Mount McLoughlin,[16]  \"Tahoma\", the Lushootseed name for Mount Rainier,[17] and \"Louwala-Clough\", meaning \"smoking mountain\" for Mount St. Helens.[18] In early 1792, British navigator George Vancouver explored Puget Sound and gave English names to the high mountains he saw. Mount Baker was named for Vancouver's third lieutenant, Joseph Baker, although the first European to see it was Manuel Quimper, who named it la gran monta\u00f1a del Carmelo (\"Great Mount Carmel\") in 1790.[19] Mount Rainier was named after Admiral Peter Rainier. Later in 1792, Vancouver had his lieutenant William Robert Broughton explore the lower Columbia River. He named Mount Hood after Lord Samuel Hood, an admiral of the Royal Navy. Mount St. Helens was sighted by Vancouver in May 1792, from near the mouth of the Columbia River. It was named for Alleyne FitzHerbert, 1st Baron St Helens, a British diplomat.[20] Vancouver's expedition did not, however, name the mountain range which contained these peaks. He referred to it simply as the \"eastern snowy range\". Earlier Spanish explorers called it Sierra Nevada, meaning \"snowy mountains\".[19] In 1805, the Lewis and Clark Expedition passed through the Cascades on the Columbia River, which for many years was the only practical way to pass that part of the range. They were the first non-indigenous people to see Mount Adams, but they thought it was Mount St. Helens. When they later saw Mount St. Helens they thought it was Mount Rainier.[21] On their return trip, Lewis and Clark spotted a high but distant snowy pinnacle that they named for the sponsor of the expedition, U.S. President Thomas Jefferson.[22] Lewis and Clark called the Cascade Range the \"Western Mountains\".[23] The Lewis and Clark expedition, and the many settlers and traders that followed, met their last obstacle to their journey at the Cascades Rapids in the Columbia River Gorge, a feature on the river now submerged beneath the Bonneville Reservoir. Before long, the great white-capped mountains that loomed above the rapids were called the \"mountains by the cascades\" and later simply as the \"Cascades\". The earliest attested use of the name \"Cascade Range\" is in the writings of botanist David Douglas in 1825.[24][25] In 1814, Alexander Ross, a fur trader with the North West Company, seeking a viable route across the mountains, explored and crossed the northern Cascades between Fort Okanogan and Puget Sound. His report of the journey is vague about the route taken. He followed the lower Methow River into the mountains. He might have used Cascade Pass to reach the Skagit River. Ross was the first European-American to explore the Methow River area and likely the first to explore the Stehekin River and Bridge Creek region. Due to the difficulty of crossing the northern Cascades and the paucity of beaver, fur-trading companies made only a few explorations into the mountains north of the Columbia River after Ross.[26] Exploration and settlement of the Cascades region by Europeans and Americans was accelerated by the establishment of a major trading post of the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) at Fort Vancouver near today's Portland, Oregon. From this base HBC trapping parties traveled throughout the Cascades in search of beaver and other fur-bearing animals. For example, using what became known as the Siskiyou Trail, Hudson's Bay Company trappers were the first non-natives to explore the southern Cascades in the 1820s and 1830s, establishing trails which passed near Crater Lake, Mount McLoughlin, Medicine Lake Volcano, Mount Shasta, and Lassen Peak.[27] The course of political history in the Pacific Northwest saw the spine of the Cascade Range being proposed as a boundary settlement during the Oregon Dispute of 1846. The United States rejected the proposal and insisted on the 49th parallel north, which cuts across the range just north of Mount Baker. Throughout the period of dispute and up to the creation of the Crown Colony of British Columbia in 1858, the Hudson's Bay Company's York Factory Express route, as well the route of fur brigades, followed the Okanogan River along the east edge of the Cascades and the Columbia River through the range. Passes across the range were not well known and little used. Naches Pass was used for driving cattle and horses to Fort Nisqually. Yakima Pass was also used by the Hudson's Bay Company.[28] American settlement of the flanks of the Coast Range did not occur until the early 1840s, at first only marginally. Following the Oregon Treaty the inward flux of migration from the Oregon Trail intensified and the passes and back-valleys of what is now the state of Washington were explored and populated, and it was not long after that railways followed. Despite its being traversed by several major freeways and rail lines, and its lower flanks subjected to major logging in recent decades, large parts of the range remain intense and forbidding alpine wilderness. Much of the northern half of the Cascades, from Rainier north, have been preserved by U.S. national or British Columbia provincial parks (such as E.C. Manning Provincial Park), or other forms of protected area.[29] The Canadian side of the range has a history that includes the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush of 1858\u201360 and its famous Cariboo Road, as well as the older Hudson's Bay Company Brigade Trail from the Canyon to the Interior, the Dewdney Trail, and older routes which connected east to the Similkameen and Okanagan valleys. The southern mainline of the Canadian Pacific Railway penetrated the range via the passes of the Coquihalla River, along one of the steepest and snowiest routes in the entire Pacific Cordillera. Near Hope, B.C., the railway roadbed and the Othello Tunnels, now decommissioned, are popular tourist recreation destinations for hiking and bicycling. The pass is used by the Coquihalla Highway, a government megaproject built as part of the Expo 86 spending boom of the 1980s, which is now the main route from the Coast to the British Columbia interior. Traffic formerly went via the Fraser Canyon, to the west, or via Allison Pass and Manning Park along Highway 3 to the south, near the border. The Barlow Road was the first established land path for U.S. settlers through the Cascade Range in 1845, and formed the final overland link for the Oregon Trail (previously, settlers had to raft down the treacherous rapids of the Columbia River). The Road left the Columbia at what is now Hood River and passed along the south side of Mount Hood at what is now Government Camp, terminating in Oregon City. There is an interpretive site there now at \"The End of The Oregon Trail\". The road was constructed as a toll road\u00a0\u2013 $5 per wagon\u00a0\u2013 and was very successful. In addition, the Applegate Trail was created to allow settlers to avoid rafting down the Columbia River.  The Trail used the path of the California Trail to north-central Nevada.  From there, the Trail headed northwest into northern California, and continued northwest towards today's Ashland, Oregon.  From there, settlers would head north along the established Siskiyou Trail into the Willamette Valley. With the exception of the 1915 eruption of remote Lassen Peak in Northern California, the range was quiet for more than a century. Then, on May\u00a018, 1980, the dramatic eruption of Mount St. Helens shattered the quiet and brought the world's attention to the range. Geologists were also concerned that the St. Helens eruption was a sign that long-dormant Cascade volcanoes might become active once more, as in the period from 1800 to 1857 when a total of eight erupted. None have erupted since St. Helens, but precautions are being taken nevertheless, such as the Cascades Volcano Observatory and Mount Rainier Volcano Lahar Warning System in Pierce County, Washington.[30]"

        "content": "The Cascade Range is made up of a band of thousands of very small, short-lived volcanoes that have built a platform of lava and volcanic debris. Rising above this volcanic platform are a few strikingly large volcanoes, like Mount Hood and Mount St. Helens, that dominate the landscape.[31] The Cascade volcanoes define the Pacific Northwest section of the Ring of Fire, an array of volcanoes that rim the Pacific Ocean. The Ring of Fire is also known for its frequent earthquakes. The volcanoes and earthquakes arise from a common source: subduction, where the dense Juan de Fuca Plate plunges beneath the North American Plate.[32] As the oceanic slab sinks deep into the Earth's interior beneath the continental plate, high temperatures and pressures allow water molecules locked in the minerals of solid rock to escape. The water vapor rises into the pliable mantle above the subducting plate, causing some of the mantle to melt. This newly formed magma rises toward the Earth's surface to erupt, forming a chain of volcanoes (the Cascade Volcanic Arc) above the subduction zone.[32]"

        "content": "Soil conditions for farming are generally good, especially downwind of volcanoes. This is largely because volcanic rocks are often rich in potassium-bearing minerals such as orthoclase, and erode relatively easily. Volcanic debris, especially lahars, also helps to spread mineral-rich volcanic material, and the storage of water in the form of snow and ice is also important for agriculture. The snow-capped mountains, such as Mt. Hood and Mt. Bachelor, are used as ski resorts in the late winter, while in the summer they become popular hiking and mountaineering locations. Much of their meltwater eventually flows into reservoirs, where it is used for recreation, while its potential energy is captured to generate hydroelectric power before the water is used to irrigate crops. Because of the abundance of powerful streams, many of the major westward-draining rivers of the Cascades have been dammed to provide hydroelectric power. One of these, Ross Dam on the Skagit River, retains a reservoir which spans the border southeast of Hope, British Columbia, extending 2 miles (3.2\u00a0km) into Canada.  At the foot of the southeast flank of Mount Baker, at Concrete, Washington, the Baker River is dammed to form Lake Shannon and Baker Lake. The Cascades harbor a largely-untapped potential for geothermal power. The U.S. Geological Survey Geothermal Research Program has been investigating this potential. Some of this energy is already being used in places like Klamath Falls, Oregon, where volcanic steam is used to heat public buildings.[33] The highest recorded underground temperature found in the range is 510\u00a0\u00b0F (266\u00a0\u00b0C) at 3,075 feet (937\u00a0m) below Newberry Volcano's caldera floor."

        "content": "Forests of large, coniferous trees (western red cedars, Douglas-firs, western hemlocks, firs, pines, spruces, and others) dominate most of the Cascade Range. Cool, wet winters and warm, dry summers (largely a  result of oceanic influence) favor evergreen species, whereas mild temperatures and rich soils promote fast and prolonged growth.[34][35] As a traveler passes through the Cascade Range, the climate first gets colder, then warmer and drier east of the crest.[36] Most of the Cascades' lower and middle elevations are covered in coniferous forest; the higher altitudes have extensive meadows as well as alpine tundra and glaciers. The southern part of the Cascades are within the California Floristic Province, an area of high biodiversity.[citation needed] Silver fir predominates above 2500\u00a0ft, while there are moors, meadows, and mountain hemlock/subalpine fir groves from 4500 to 6000\u00a0ft on the west side. The treeline is at ~6000 feet. On the east side, subalpine forests of larch trees grade to pine and interior fir forests below 4200\u00a0ft, which grade to ponderosa below 2500\u00a0ft, which in turn grades to semidesert scrub near sea level. Above 7500\u00a0ft, the landscape is barren with either no plants or only moss and lichen.[37] Black bears, coyotes, bobcats, cougars, beavers, deer, elk, moose, mountain goats and a few wolf packs returning from Canada live in the Cascades. Fewer than 50 grizzly bears reside in the Cascades of Canada and Washington.[38]"

However, continental Australia has experienced a decrease in this activity over recent decades, as high pressure systems have become more dominant.[8] These longer-term deficiencies has a great effect on the drying of woodland fuels, particularly in the Jarrah forest of Western Australia's South-West and the forests of Victoria's Otway Ranges, which witnessed significant fires during the 2015/16 season.[8]"

The fire was contained the same day by Country Fire Authority firefighters.[18][19][20] On 6 October and during the week following, 6 houses, 15 non-residential structures, 5 vehicles and 3,100 hectares (7,700 acres) of forest and paddock were destroyed by a significant bushfire in the Lancefield area of the Shire of Macedon Ranges, 70 kilometres (43\u00a0mi) north of Melbourne. Communities affected by the fire included Baynton, Benloch, Nulla Vale, Lancefield, Pastoria and Sidonia. At least 22 aircraft were utilized by the Country Fire Authority to fight the fire before it was contained on 12 October.[21][22][23][24][25] The fire had been lit a week earlier as part of a controlled burn in Cobaw State Forest overseen by the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning, however the authorities had lost control of the blaze in strong winds and hot conditions. An independent report into the blaze, released in November 2015, criticized the initial controlled burn as inadequately planned and inadequately staffed. The then Victorian Environment minister Lisa Neville admitted failures in the risk assessment taken prior to the approval of the controlled burn, and the following quote of hers was reported by The Age on 19 November 2015.[26][27] It [the control burn] probably should not have been lit, given the broader circumstances. On 17 November, one \"weekender\" holiday house and 50 hectares (120 acres) of forest were destroyed by a bushfire at Devon North in the Shire of Wellington, 6 kilometres (3.7\u00a0mi) north-west of Yarram. The blaze originated from a controlled burn to reduce the fuel load on private land.[28][29] Over 19\u201320 December, temperatures reached up to 45\u00a0\u00b0C (113\u00a0\u00b0F) across Victoria\u2014including 41\u00a0\u00b0C (106\u00a0\u00b0F) in Melbourne, Victoria\u2014and extreme fire conditions were felt across the entirety of the state. During the following week, Victoria suffered three significant fires; 4,600 hectares (11,000 acres) of forest and farm land were burnt by the Scotsburn fire, 7,000 hectares (17,000 acres) were burnt by the Barnawartha fire, and fire started by lightning in the Otway National Park near Lorne would continue to burn past Christmas and be dubbed the \"Lorne-Jamieson Track\" fire.[48] On 19 December, 14 houses and at least 30 non-residential structures were destroyed by the Scotsburn fire, which also ravaged significant areas of rural property in the City of Ballarat and Shire of Moorabool municipalities. Suburbs and towns affected included Clarendon, Durham Lead, Elaine, Garibaldi and Scotsburn. The fire had been ignited on the same day by a landowner using a slashing machine; 500 firefighting personnel and 8 aircraft attended the fire, and it was contained by 20 December.[48][49][50][51][52] On 20 December, the Barnawartha fire destroyed 4 houses and several non-residential structures in the Shire of Indigo, as well as causing the deaths of 1,200 head of livestock. Near Wodonga, several dozen families were evacuated when the uncontrolled grass fire advanced rapidly on the town, however damage to the town itself was minimal. There were also fears that the fire may advance on Yackandandah, however rainfall of up to 20 millimetres (0.79\u00a0in) on the night of 20 December slowed the spread of the fire and limited damage to Barnawartha and Indigo Valley.[48][62][63][64] On 25 December (Christmas Day) severe fire conditions, including a strong northerly wind, led to the Lorne-Jamieson Track fire in the Otway National Park jumping containment lines and impacting numerous communities situated along the Great Ocean Road in the Shire of Colac Otway. A total of 116 houses were destroyed\u201498 in Wye River and 18 in Separation Creek\u2014on 25 December, and over 2,500 hectares (6,200 acres) of dense forest were burnt by the time the fire was contained on 21 January 2016. Although structural damage was limited to the two communities of Wye River and Separation Creek, the township of Lorne was advised by the Country Fire Authority to evacuate from mid afternoon on 25 December, the communities of Kennett River, Grey River and Wongarra were evacuated several times, and the Great Ocean Road was closed for several days after the 25 December run damaged parts of the road infrastructure.[1][53][54][55][56][57][58][59][60] Lightning ignited the Lorne-Jamieson Track fire in inaccessible country on 19 December, and during the week prior to the 25 December run the fire had burned to a distance of approximately 4 kilometres (2.5\u00a0mi) north-west of Separation Creek. On the day of the run, a Keetch\u2013Byram Drought Index of 80 was recorded at Aireys Inlet and 83 at Cape Otway; these are considered \u2018serious\u2019 with respect to fuel ignition potential. In Wye River, a north/north-westerly wind with gusts of up to 33 kilometres per hour (21\u00a0mph) and humidity hit a low of 17% at 16:30 AEDT (UTC+11) were observed. At 11:30 AEDT (UTC+11) the emergency siren was sounded in Separation Creek and approximately three hours later the fire front impacted the communities.[61] On 18 January, one house, 6 non-residential buildings and 90 hectares (220 acres) of scrub and forest were destroyed, and another house damaged, by a bushfire that burned through the Crib Point and Stony Point communities in the Shire of Mornington Peninsula. The fire moved rapidly through the scrubland around the abandoned Westernport Refinery and was battled by 27 firefighting appliances and 3 aircraft. The cause of the fire is suspected to have been arson.[83][84][85][86][87][88] On 19 January, one house and 100 hectares (250 acres) of paddocks and grassland were destroyed by a bushfire that burned near Edgecombe and Kyneton in the Shire of Macedon Ranges. The fire is also suspected of having been deliberately-lit.[89][90] On 23 February, 2 houses, up to 6 non-residential buildings and 1,300 hectares (3,200 acres) of forest and paddocks were destroyed, and one house damaged, by a fire that burned through Addington and Mount Bolton in the City of Ballarat municipality.

The bushfire was first reported on 29 September.[105] During November, the Shire of Esperance suffered two significant fires and a fire complex; 128,000 hectares (320,000 acres) were burnt by the Cascades fire, 18,000 hectares (44,000 acres) were burnt by the Merivale fire, and 164,000 hectares (410,000 acres) were burnt by the Cape Arid complex of fires.[30] On 17 November, during the major run of the Cascades fire, four civilian fatalities occurred in vehicles traveling on Griggs Road in Scaddan. The Cascades fire destroyed one house, 16 non-residential structures and dozens of vehicles. There was also significant damage to rural produce; approximately 4,500 head of livestock perished and 30,000 hectares (74,000 acres) of crop\u2014constituting about 500,000 tonnes of grain\u2014were burnt. In addition, the Merivale fire destroyed two houses in the Stockyard Creek area, and the Cape Arid complex destroyed large areas of Western Ground Parrot habitat.[30][31][32][33][34][35][36] During January, the shires of Harvey & Waroona suffered a number of significant fires; 70,000 hectares (170,000 acres) of forest and farmland were burnt by the largest of these fires, which ignited on the night of the 6 January and was dubbed the \"Waroona\" fire. On 7 January, two civilians perished when the fire-front of the Waroona fire burned into the center of the Yarloop townsite; Malcolm Taylor, 73, and Les Taylor, 77, both died within their own houses. During the time that the fire-front passed through Yarloop, it destroyed 121 houses, 18 buildings of commercial or community significance\u2014including a fire station, a hospital, a hotel and a hall\u2014and the historic Yarloop Workshops. In the 17 days between ignition and being extinguished, the Waroona fire destroyed at least 162 houses and a significant amount of other property in the communities of Cookernup, Hamel, Harvey, Lake Clifton, Preston Beach, Waroona, Wagerup and Yarloop.[65][66][67][68][69][70][71][72][73][74][75][76] Public road access to Yarloop was not restored until seven months after the fire when roadblocks were finally removed 11 August 2016.[106] Effects of the Waroona fire were widespread in southern Western Australia; falling ash in the Eaton, Australind and outer Bunbury areas caused service stations to stop pumping fuel, and the closure of both the Forrest Highway and South West Highway prompted the cancellation of the 2016 Southbound music festival when it cut off access to Busselton. However, the event was partly revived as a benefit concert to raise funds for fire victims.[77][78][79][80] The size of the fire allowed the creation of its own weather pattern with rising heat and particulate matter facilitating the development of both pyrocumulus and pyrocumulonimbus clouds. The rare weather event created unpredictable winds with sudden gusts and changes in directions making it even more difficult for firefighters to control the blaze.[81][82] A 'Special Inquiry Into the January 2016 Waroona Fire' was held by the Western Australian Government, headed by Euan Ferguson. Its 264-page report was released on 29 April 2016.[107] On 14 March, one townhouse and 12 hectares (30 acres) of parkland were destroyed by a fire that prompted evacuations at Edith Cowan University and damaged facilities at university situated in the City of Joondalup. A camper who had been lodging near Grassbird Avenue in Lake Joondalup Nature Reserve was charged for lighting the fire, allegedly to clear scrub near his camp site.[94][95][96]"

Winding through varying terrain along the coast, and providing access to several prominent landmarks, including the Twelve Apostles limestone stack formations, the road is an important tourist attraction. The city of Geelong, close to Torquay, experiences great benefit from Australian and international visitors to the road, with Geelong Otway Tourism affirming it as an invaluable asset.[2][3] In 2008, the Royal Automobile Club of Victoria (RACV) listed the road as the state's top tourism experience in its Victoria 101 survey, based on places that members of the public would recommend to visitors.[4]"

It was suggested that it run from Barwon Heads in the east, follow the coast west around Cape Otway, and end near Warrnambool. In 1918, the Great Ocean Road Trust was formed as a private company, under the helm of president Howard Hitchcock. The company managed to secure \u00a381,000 in capital from private subscriptions and borrowing, with Hitchcock himself contributing \u00a33000. The money was to be repaid by charging drivers a toll until the debt was cleared, and the road would then be gifted to the state.[14][15]"

        "content": "Construction began on 19 September 1919. Approximately 3,000 returned servicemen worked on the project, which was a war memorial for servicemen killed in World War I. The advance survey team progressed through dense scrub at a rate of approximately three kilometres a month. Construction was mostly by hand, using explosives, pick and shovel, wheelbarrows, and some small machinery,[16][13] and was at times perilous, with several workers being killed. The final sections, along steep coastal cliffs, were the most difficult to work on. Anecdotal evidence from ABC archives in 1982 suggested workers would rest detonators on their knees during travel, because it gave the explosives the softest ride.[13] Workers were paid 10 shillings and sixpence for an eight-hour day, also working a half-day on Saturdays. They were accommodated in tents, and were provided with meals in a communal dining marquee. Food cost up to 10 shillings a week. Despite the isolation of the camps, the workers had access to a piano, gramophone, games, newspapers and magazines. In 1924, the coastal steamer Casino became stranded near Cape Patton, after having hit a reef at Point Hawdon, near the Grey River. Legend has it that 500 barrels of beer and 120 cases of spirits were jettisoned and that road workers salvaged them, resulting in an unscheduled two-week-long drinking break. However, Museums Victoria notes only that most of the cargo, largely composed of Christmas goods, was dumped into the sea.[17] The Age reported that, \"The Great Ocean-road [sic] proved a boon to the passengers, who were enabled without much inconvenience to reach Wood's farm house, Apollo Bay. However, if the road were finished, the vessel's cargo could be safely conveyed to either Apollo Bay, the Wye River, or Lorne.\"[18]"

However, it was then closed from 10 May 1922 for further work, opening again on 21 December, along with tolls to help recoup construction costs. The charge, payable at the Eastern View toll gate, was two shillings for motor cars, and 10 shillings for wagons with more than two horses.[19] In November 1932, the section from Lorne to Apollo Bay was finished, bringing the road to completion. It was officially opened by Victoria's Lieutenant-Governor Sir William Irvine, during a ceremony near the Grand Pacific Hotel at Lorne, and the road has subsequently been acknowledged as the world's largest war memorial.[3] At the time, The Age commented, \"In the face of almost insurmountable odds, the Great Ocean Road has materialised from a dream or 'wild-cat scheme', as many dubbed it, into concrete reality\".[19] Although Hitchcock had died of heart disease on 22 August 1932, before the road was completed, his car was driven behind the governor's in the procession along the road during the opening ceremony.[14] A memorial in his name was constructed on the road at Mount Defiance, near Lorne, and he is generally considered to be the Father of the Road.[20] In the face of almost insurmountable odds, the Great Ocean Road has materialised from a dream or 'wild-cat scheme', as many dubbed it, into concrete reality Rood, David (10 April 2007). \"Road's still great, 75 years on\". The Age. Retrieved 26 June 2010. In its original state, the road was considered a formidable drive, comfortably accommodating only a single vehicle at a time. Areas with sheer cliffs were the most hazardous, with only few places where drivers could pull over to allow others to proceed in the opposite direction. For \u00a35, any \"public-spirited citizen\" could request that a crossover be cut into the road.[12][21] On 2 October 1936, the road was handed to the State Government, with the deed for the road being presented to the Victorian Premier at a ceremony at the Cathedral Rock toll gate. Tolls were removed at that time.[19] In 1939, following the death of the chairman of the Country Roads Board, W.T.B. McCormick, who was also honorary engineer for the Great Ocean Road Trust, it was decided to build a memorial arch in his honour, across the road at Eastern View.[22] The arch was opened 4 November 1939, and was built of timber logs on a stone base, with a tablet memorial to Mr McCormick on one side, and another to the returned servicemen on the other.[23] The arch was rebuilt in 1973, and again in 1983, after being destroyed in the Ash Wednesday bushfires.[24] In 1962, the Tourist Development Authority deemed the road to be \"one of the world's great scenic roads\".[25] Despite improvements, the road was still considered a challenging drive, and the Victorian Police motor school was using it for training around 1966.[26] Over its life, the Great Ocean Road has been susceptible to natural elements. In 1960, the section at Princetown was partially washed away by water during storms.[27] There were landslides on 11 August 1964,[28] and 1971, both closing sections of the road near Lorne.[29] Because of the terrain surrounding the road, it was also closed due to bushfires in 1962[30] and 1964, particularly in areas with nearby campsites.[31] In January 2011, a section of a cutting collapsed due to heavy rain. In 2011, the road was added to the Australian National Heritage List.[32]"

A cold front was approaching from the Midwestern Plains and was associated with a strong low further north. Strong temperature contrasts were observed on either side of the front. In addition, winds near the ground and aloft were very strong and significant shear was noted before given additional ingredients for extreme severe weather across the Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys on March 1, 1997. On February 28, 1997, the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) had issued a Day 2 moderate risk of severe weather for much of Arkansas and a tornado watch was issued for the western and central part of the state during the morning hours of March 1.[3] Early on March 1, the SPC issued a tornado watch for portions of the Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys.[4] Throughout the day, the National Weather Service office in Little Rock, Arkansas, issued 57 weather warnings, including 34 tornado warnings. Areas affected by the deadly tornadoes had tornado warnings with lead time estimated at between nine and 28 minutes.[3]"

The supercell alone killed 21 and injured several hundred others. Near the Tennessee border and across the Mississippi River, the same supercell produced three additional tornadoes, one of which killed a person near Dyersburg, Tennessee.

In Kentucky, then-governor Paul E. Patton had initially declared 120 counties a state of emergency and deployed about 1100 National Guard troops to the flood-stricken regions. In Indiana, the Ohio River overflow its banks due to record rains.[citation needed] All 13 counties along the river between Evansville and Cincinnati were also declared disaster areas. In West Virginia, then-Governor Cecil Underwood declared state of emergencies for 14 counties, and 16 were later declared disaster areas as over 4,000 homes and other structures were damaged by the flooding.[citation needed] Overall, across the state of Arkansas 1,200 homes were damaged or destroyed, including close to 400 in Arkadelphia alone.[3] Several areas that were hit by the tornadoes did not have any tornado sirens. After the outbreak several million dollars were invested to improve the siren system throughout the state for future tornado outbreaks, including the 2008 Super Tuesday tornado outbreak, a similar but much deadlier and more widespread outbreak.[citation needed] 14 people in Arkansas were killed by that outbreak on February 5, 2008, and nearly 60 in total were killed across the Mid-South regions of the US."

Riots took place here that resulted in many injuries, at least three black strikebreakers killed, and authorities bringing in state militia to suppress the emergency soon after the strike started on September 30.[3] During the 1960s, McComb and nearby areas were the sites of extreme violence by KKK and other white supremacist opponents to the Civil Rights Movement. In 1961, SNCC conducted its first voter registration project in Mississippi in this city. White officials and local KKK members countered it with violence and intimidation to suppress black voters. In 1961, Brenda Travis, Robert Talbert, and Ike Lewis were\u00a0arrested for staging a sit in at a Greyhound station. They were charged with trespassing and kept in jail for 28 days. Following their release, Travis was expelled from school. In response to the expulsion and the murder of Herbert Lee, 115 students staged a walk out on October 4, 1961, known as the Burglund High School Walk Out. At the walk out, many students were beaten by the police and arrested. Students continued protesting by refusing to return to school until Travis was allowed to reenroll. As a result, they too were expelled. The 16 seniors who participated were unable to graduate. Travis' fate for participating in the march was more serious. Travis was arrested, again, and sent to a state juvenile facility without a trial. After 6+1\u20442 months, Travis was released by the governor and exiled from Mississippi.[4][5][6] After whites severely beat several staff members, staff members being jailed for their involvement with the walkout, and receiving backlash from the community for putting students on the \"frontlines\", SNCC pulled out of the region in early 1962. They moved north in Mississippi to work in slightly less dangerous conditions.[7] In 1964, civil rights activists began the Mississippi Project and what would be called Freedom Summer, with teams returning to southwest Mississippi. They sang, \"We'll Never Turn Back.\" SNCC members of the Council of Federated Organizations (COFO) returned to McComb in mid-July 1964 to work on voter registration. From late August 1964 through September, after passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, McComb was the site of eleven bombings directed against African Americans.[8] Malcolm Boyd took part of COFO's Freedom House as a member of a clerical delegation to assist African-American voter registration. The following summer, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 authorizing federal oversight and enforcement to enable blacks to register and vote again in the South. In Mississippi, most blacks had been disenfranchised since 1890. Even with enforcement, it took time to overcome local white resistance to black voting. On January 10, 1975, during the Great Storm of 1975, an F4 tornado caused major damage to 38 blocks in the city, severely damaging or destroying many homes, businesses, vehicles, and trees within the town and surrounding areas along the tornado's track. The tornado killed 9 people and injured 210 others along its 56.5-mile (90.9\u00a0km) path.[9]:\u200a10 On October 20, 1977, a chartered plane carrying members and crew of rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd crashed in a swamp near McComb, killing lead singer Ronnie Van Zant, guitarist Steve Gaines, Steve's sister Cassie (a backup singer), road manager Dean Kilpatrick, as well as both  pilots."

        "content": " Neosho (/ni\u02d0\u02c8o\u028a\u0283o\u028a/; originally Siouan pronunciation: [ni\u02c8o\u0292o] or Siouan pronunciation: [ni\u02c8o\u0292u]) is the most populous city in Newton County, Missouri, United States, which it serves as the county seat. With a population of 12,590 as of the 2020 census,[5] the city is a part of the Joplin, Missouri Metropolitan Statistical Area, a region with an estimated 176,849 (2011) residents. Neosho lies on the western edge of the Ozarks, in the far southwest of the state. The name \"Neosho\" is of Osage derivation from \"Ne-u-zhu\", meaning \"clear, cold water\", \"many waters\", or \"the meeting of waters\", which refers to local freshwater springs.[6][7] The springs attracted varying cultures of Native American inhabitants for thousands of years. The Osage Nation had long occupied the territory at the time of European contact. Like the Osage, European-American settlers were also attracted to the springs, and founded the community of Neosho in 1833.[8] It was incorporated as a municipal government in 1878. Nicknamed \"City of Springs\", Neosho has long served as an agricultural center. Since 1888, it has been the site of the Neosho National Fish Hatchery, the oldest in the National Fish Hatchery System. It is known locally as the \"Gateway to the Ozarks\". Since 1957, it has also been identified as \"the Flower Box City\"."

        "content": "Starting in the late 1820s, European-American settlers of English, Scottish, German, Welsh, and Scots-Irish ancestry began moving into the area. The first of these settlers was Lunsford Oliver, who migrated from Tennessee in 1829 and located near Shoal Creek. He was the namesake for  Oliver's Prairie. His nearest neighbors were in Springfield, sixty miles to the east. In 1831 he was joined by Nathaniel Turner, John Smith, Joseph Ross, Campbell Pure, Blake Wilson, Levi Lee, Carmac Ratcliffe, and George McInturf. McInturf built a corn mill, the first mill of any kind in the region. Soon afterward came Mathew H. Ritchie, who founded the town of Newtonia near Oliver's Prairie, and John W. McCord, who settled near Walbridge Spring with Levie Lee and founded the town Neosho twelve miles (19\u00a0km) to the west. In these years, the region was called \"Six Bulls\", a colloquial reference to \"six boils\", referring to the large streams that flowed through the area \u2013 Shoal Creek, Center Creek, Indian Creek, Spring River, and North Fork. By 1835, at least three schools had been established along Shoal Creek, and a teacher named Billingsley taught near Neosho. The earliest known religious effort dates to 1836, when Methodist Circuit riders visited the area and held meetings in settlers' log cabins. In 1843, Rev. Anthony Bewley was appointed to the Neosho and Granby circuit, establishing the first permanent churches in Six Bulls. Rev. John W. McCord was involved in organizing Neosho Presbytery, a Cumberland Presbyterian congregation at New Salem Campground, on May 15, 1837.[9] These early settlers were sometimes visited by Native Americans from the Southeast United States, who had been relocated from Georgia to the Indian Territory a few miles west of later Kansas under the Indian Removal Act. They periodically came into the area on hunting expeditions. Newton County was originally contained in Crawford County and afterward in Barry County. As the population increased, it was separated from Barry County on December 31, 1838, and established as a county under its present name. It was named in honor of American Revolutionary War veteran Sergeant John Newton. He was a comrade of Sergeant William Jasper, who is memorialized at Fort Moultrie. Later the counties of Jasper, McDonald, and Barton, were successively created from some of Newton's territory. The first county court session was held at Reed's residence on April 13, 1839, Judge Foster P. Wright presiding. John Reed, Hugh Shannon, and Jacob Testerman sat as judges under appointment by Lilburn Boggs, Governor of Missouri. John Reed was made presiding judge, Thomas Mosely Jr., appointed as clerk; John Haskins, as assessor; and Isaac Gibson as sheriff. Townships were established and roads laid out by this body. On November 12, the commissioners reported Neosho as the permanent seat of justice, and James Wilson was appointed a special commissioner to lay out the town. The first elected county judges were Edward V. Warren, Larkin Newton, Samuel V. Warren, and Samuel M. Cooley, with Milton Sexton as clerk in 1840. That same year, Milton Sexton, as superintendent, built the first courthouse, a log structure that was occupied in March 1841. In 1841, Charles S. Yancey became circuit judge of the Thirteenth Judicial District, to which Newton County was attached. The first state representative was John Wilson. In 1840, Lemuel B. Hearrell conducted a school at Hickory Creek, which at times numbered forty pupils. In 1842, Wilson opened the first school in Neosho. He taught classical Latin and higher mathematics. The Methodist Church was active in the area from 1845. During the 1840s, lead was discovered and entrepreneurs developed mining here. Neosho's early commercial development was dominated by lead and zinc mining. Newton County established one of Missouri's earliest commercial operations. Lead was transported by wagon from Neosho to Indian Territory, then shipped down the Arkansas River and Mississippi River to New Orleans. French colonists had conducted lead mining further east in Missouri before the United States acquired the territory in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803."

        "content": "In 1846, a strip two miles (3.2\u00a0km) wide was detached from northern Newton and attached to southern Jasper County. A survey of the community was undertaken in 1846 by F. M. Duncan, who laid out the courthouse square and surrounding blocks. According to the survey, the town covered an area of about 40 acres (16\u00a0ha) and was laid off beginning at the \"west edge of the large spring and ... northeast of a large white oak\", which included land originally belonging to John McCord. Part of McCord's relinquished land was returned to him. He subdivided it to take advantage of development related to nearby Neosho. This subdivision, later incorporated into the city limits, is still called \"McCord's Addition to Neosho\". On August 20, 1847, Neosho was legally incorporated with William C. Jones, Jackson C. McKay, Samuel Rice, William B. Holmes, and William B. Mooney as trustees. The first Baptist congregation was organized at Neosho in 1847, with the Rev. W.H. Farmer as pastor. He served until 1859. In 1849, McDonald County was created by an act of the state legislature from the southern portion of Newton County, reducing it to its present dimensions. The same act named John Williams of Taney County, James Williams of Barry County, and Chesley Cannifex of Greene County as commissioners to locate the seat of justice within five miles (8.0\u00a0km) of the new geographical center of the county. They designated the temporary seat at the home of John Reed, one and one-half miles east of the present site of downtown Neosho. Later the same year, a log jail was built. The design of the courthouse square followed that of the Shelbyville Square Plan, which has lots arranged to face a central courthouse block. A brick courthouse built in 1850 at a cost of $3,000 replaced the earlier log structure. During the next decade, numerous residential and commercial buildings were constructed in and around the courthouse square. The first newspaper printed in the county was the Neosho Chief, founded in 1854 by J. Webb Graves. It was renamed as the Neosho Herald and was removed in 1861 to Arkansas after the outbreak of the American Civil War. Its records were captured by the Union Army. By special act passed on August 3, 1854, Congress laid out a monthly Pony Express mail route from Neosho to Albuquerque, New Mexico, authorizing an annual budget of $17,000. After the Mexican\u2013American War and the acquisition by the US of the southwest territory, this region became of great commercial and military importance. But the Pony Express route was not a commercial success. In March of the following year, the route was changed to run from Independence to Stockton, California, via Albuquerque."

        "content": "During the Civil War, the county was occupied alternately by the opposing forces. Several engagements were fought in and around Neosho, Newtonia, and Granby, at some places more than once. In addition, frequent skirmishes took place between small units and raids by area bandits. The schools were closed during the war, and most of the schoolhouses destroyed. The new courthouse was occupied by troops of both armies during the war and finally destroyed c.\u20091863. After the war, the county records were found intact in a cell in the jail. R.W. Ellis, the county clerk, had concealed them there  before he left to join the Confederate Army in 1861. On July 3, 1861 the Union force of Col. Franz Sigel moved from Neosho to find and trap Gov Jackson's Missouri State Guard force, reported to be somewhere near Lamar, Missouri. Sigel believed that another Union force should be chasing them from their Union victory at Boonville on June 17. Col. Sigel knew that Sterling Price and another Confederate Army were south of his position, so he garrisoned Neosho. Captain Conrad and his Rifle Company B of the 3rd Missouri Infantry, numbering about 80 men, were selected. When Brigadier General Benjamin McCulloch agreed to General Price's request for assistance with the Missouri State Guard, he moved north. Hearing of the Union force at Neosho, they sent four companies of the 1st Arkansas Mounted Rifles and Cpt. Carroll's Company of Arkansas State troops to capture them. On July 5, the garrison sent forces north to Carthage to ascertain the situation, as the Battle of Carthage was ongoing. Col. McIntosh ordered a two-pronged advance to Neosho, but the western force found its route longer than expected. McIntosh ordered the surrender of the company of Union troops as his Mounted Infantry companies came  within two hundred yards of the court house, where the Union force was stationed. With no pickets to the south and a force to the west of town, the Confederates accepted unconditional surrender just as the second force arrived on scene. Captain Conrad's men were paroled on July 8 and were escorted the first four miles to protect them from numerous threats against their lives made by Neosho locals. The Union troops marched unarmed to Springfield, making 85 miles in 50 hours. On October 21, Missouri Governor Claiborne Jackson and the pro-Southern members of the Missouri General Assembly, who had been forced to flee from Jefferson City when the Union Army approached, held their next to last legislative session at Neosho. On October 28, 1861, they established a provisional capital in Neosho. Governor Jackson and the Missouri General Assembly met in the Masonic Hall, numbering thirty-nine members of the House and ten of the Senate. They passed an ordinance of secession and the event was celebrated with cannon firing by General Sterling Price's State Guardsmen who were camped in the adjacent hills. The Confederate States government accepted the results of the vote, and Missouri was admitted as the 12th state of the Confederacy. However, the pro-Union members of the General Assembly had already convened, and supported by the occupying Union troops, had declared Jackson removed from office, as well as all who favored the South. The pro-Union members then set up a their own provisional government and appointed Hamilton R. Gamble to be governor. Missouri would have three governors during the course of the Civil War, one elected by the people (Jackson) and two appointed by the pro-Union government (Gamble and William Preble Hall). General Price made an effort to organize a Confederate defense of Missouri and initially succeeded, but any chance for concerted pro-Southern action ended when he was defeated in March 1862 at Pea Ridge. During 1862, various engagements between the hostile forces occurred in the vicinity of Neosho. In 1863, Neosho was garrisoned by Union troops, part of the time with American Indian soldiers occupying the courthouse. On October 4, 1863, a portion of the town was burned by Confederate General Joseph Shelby, who appeared with 1,100 men and, after shelling the courthouse, received the surrender of Union Captain McAfee and his 200 men. Confederate casualties in the fight were seven dead and 22 wounded.[10] No court was held from May 22, 1861 until after the war, when on June 19, 1865, when Tipton O. Wood, Frederick Gallimore, and James R. Pearson sat as a county court with W.I.I. Morrow as clerk and Harvey Conly as sheriff; all were temporarily commissioned by the Governor. In 1866, elections were finally held and order was established. In 1866 a board of education was organized, consisting of Lyman Beebe, J.H. Price Sr., R.V. Keller, E.H. Benham, Hubbard F. Jones and Edwin Ebert. A school site was purchased and the existing building repaired.[10] In 1867, a small two-story building was erected for courthouse purposes and the county officers were provided for there and in private buildings until 1878, when a substantial stone and brick building was completed at a cost of $16,250. In 1887, a jail was built. The first circuit court session was held at the house of Judge John Reed on July 22, 1839, Judge Foster P. Wright presiding. Debate flourishes to this day regarding the legitimacy of these actions, or for that matter those of the Union men who deposed him from office. Claiborne Jackson continued to serve as governor in the Confederate-held portions of the state. But by the end of 1861, Union forces would occupy almost all of Missouri. Jackson took refuge in Arkansas, dying in Little Rock the following year of cancer. A Union victory at the Battle of Pea Ridge in northwest Arkansas in early 1862 sealed Missouri's fate as a Union border state."

        "content": "Following the Civil War, Neosho became a prominent commercial center of southwest Missouri during the late 19th century. The population of the small community grew in size from approximately 500 to 2,725 between 1870 and 1900. During these decades dozens of brick commercial buildings were built around the central courthouse square containing a wide variety of private businesses including lumber yards, livery stables, general stores, and hotels. In addition to retail shops and stores the city also boasted numerous manufacturing companies such as wagon factories, mills, and even a cigar factory. A new brick courthouse was constructed in 1878 followed by a county jail in 1888. The Atlantic and Pacific Railroad reached Neosho in 1870. The A& P eventually became the San Francisco and St Louis railroad. In 1878, Neosho was incorporated and the first permanent courthouse was constructed in the center of the town square. In 1887 the Kansas City-Fort Smith and Southern Railroad entered Neosho. The KCFS& S served the Neosho National Fish Hatchery, the oldest Federal Fish Hatchery still operating today, which was built the following year. This railroad was eventually sold to the Kansas City Southern Railroad which still operates and runs through Neosho today. In the 1882, after the vineyards of France, Spain, and Portugal were struck by the deadly phylloxera louse, it was determined that grapes bred by Neosho winemaker Hermann Jaeger were resistant to the louse. His work proved to be a savior for the great vineyards of Europe. Working with other scholars and grape growers, Jaeger supplied cuttings from his Monark Springs vineyards to help replant those lost in Europe. For his contribution to the grape and wine industries of France, Jaeger was awarded the coveted French Legion of Honour, the highest award that that nation can bestow on a civilian. By 1898, there were 101 schools in Newton County with 139 teachers and 7,618 pupils. The permanent school fund was $23,260.28. The population of the county in 1900 was 28,001. By the start of the 20th century the city Neosho was a thriving community connected by three rail lines and exporting a variety of products and agricultural produce. The courthouse square continued as Neosho's commercial and governmental center well into the 20th century. Numerous commercial buildings were constructed from 1900 to 1930 including the four-story Haas Building on the north side of the square. The Missouri and North Arkansas Railroad ran from the Arkansas resort town of Eureka Springs to Neosho where it connected with the Frisco and Kansas City Southern tracks in 1908."

        "content": "On August 5, 1914 there was a head-on collision between motorcar No. 103 of passenger train of the Missouri & North Arkansas Railroad Company and locomotive No. 805, of a regular passenger train of the Kansas City Southern Railway Company, near Tipton Ford, a few miles north of Neosho. Because Motorcar No. 103 was carrying about 105 gallons of gasoline at the time, 43 passengers died, many burned beyond recognition, several others were injured, and the motorcar was entirely demolished.[11] Two days later the city held a funeral on the Newton County courthouse lawn for more than 30 unidentified individuals, who were buried in a mass grave in the Neosho I.O.O.F. cemetery. During the Great Depression, the federal government assisted financially in the construction of the Neosho City Hall and Municipal Auditorium, as well as the current Newton County Courthouse. Funded by the Works Progress Administration, the original courthouse was razed in December 1935 to make way for the current Carthage stone, Art Deco-style courthouse, which was designed by architect Neal C. Davis, a Newton County native. Construction of the new courthouse began in April 1936. In 1938, another Davis-designed, WPA-funded project, the Auditorium and City Hall, was completed. This building was extensively restored and modernized in a multi-million project completed in September 2008. Neosho is the home of Fort Crowder. Originally established as Camp Crowder south of town in 1941 at the height of World War II, the post was to serve as an armored training center. By 1943 the army had acquired 42,786.41 acres (173.1505\u00a0km2) in Newton and McDonald counties. As the facility was constructed, it was re-designated as a U.S. Army Signal Corps training center. It was named for Enoch Crowder, a Missouri general who was instrumental in developing the draft for World War I and the Selective Service. The post also served as an infantry replacement center; later in the war, it had a small German prisoner-of-war detention facility. Some of the soldiers stationed at Camp Crowder included Carl Reiner, Dick Van Dyke, Mort Walker, Tillman Franks, and Jean Shepherd. Writers for the 1960s-era The Dick Van Dyke Show, made the post the setting where Rob and Laura Petrie, portrayed by actors Dick Van Dyke and Mary Tyler Moore, met; Rob was a sergeant in Special Services and Laura was a USO dancer. The camp was well known to its residents for being muddy and swampy during the rainy season. The cartoonist Mort Walker, who was stationed there, later used it for his fictional \"Camp Swampy\" in his long-running newspaper comic strip, Beetle Bailey. Camp Crowder was deactivated in 1951. While the core of the post was retained, many of the temporary barracks were declared surplus and sold. The base's movie theatre was disassembled and reassembled on the campus of what is today the University of Missouri \u2013 Kansas City. It served as the Kansas City Playhouse until being torn down for a new theatre. A portion of its wall, which contains statues of Comedy and Tragedy, are landmarks on the university campus. Neosho obtained the permanent barracks as surplus and adapted them as the core of the community college campus for Crowder College."

In 1955 the town had received a $5,000 grant from the New York Community Trust for that purpose. Local companies provided lumber at cost, and the Jaycees formed an assembly line to build more than 200 wooden flower boxes. Pet Milk Company donated 400 used wooden barrels for container gardens, and town nurseries supplied plants at reduced rates. The city dressed up trash cans and parking meters around the courthouse square with flower baskets. In 1957 Neosho earned a coveted All-America City Award from Look magazine and the National Municipal League. (The Life magazine photojournalist Wallace Kirkland covered the 1957 city for the magazine. A life collection of his photographs from this assignment, many previously unpublished, can be found in the Life photo archive, hosted by Google). Since then, the Flower Box Promotion Committee has supported beautification and awarded 'Beauty Spot' prizes each spring and summer to homes and businesses with outstanding yards, flower gardens, and flower boxes."

Its mission was to be the Army's military police training school. After Short's defeat in the 1956 election, the fort was deactivated. About 2,000 acres (8.1\u00a0km2) of the post was turned over to the U. S. Air Force, which constructed Plant 65. The rocket engine manufacturing facility was operated by contract to North American Aviation, later known as Rocketdyne. This facility became Rocketdyne's primary manufacturing and testing complex for the H-1 rocket engine, used by the Saturn I and Saturn IB rockets. These rockets were used in NASA's Apollo, Skylab, and Apollo-Soyuz Test Project programs until its contract ended in 1968.[12] On April 24, 1975, a major tornado caused massive destruction and killed three persons. It destroyed a motel, apartment complex and mobile home park, along with dozens of homes and businesses."

Summers can be very humid, with moist air riding up from the Gulf of Mexico, and during July and August daytime highs can reach into the triple digits. Winters vary from mild days to bitterly cold, with lows reaching into the teens below zero a few times a year. Neosho is situated in \"Tornado Alley\", a broad region where cold air from the Rocky Mountains and Canada collides with warm air from the Gulf of Mexico, leading to the formation of powerful storms. Neosho has had many severe outbreaks of tornadoes, including an EF4 tornado hit the Neosho area on May 10, 2008, and traveled about 80 miles (130\u00a0km) in two states, as well as a major tornado that caused massive destruction on April 24, 1975, which resulted in three killed and many injured. The region is also prone to ice storms, such as the 2007 ice storm during which hundreds of thousands lost power for days and (in some cases) weeks.

At Gingin, north of Perth, a house and a shed were also damaged in a bushfire.[47] On 5 January, one house and one vehicle were destroyed at Yallingup by a small 5 hectares (12 acres) bushfire. 72 firefighters took 5 hours to bring the fire under control, and one firefighter was treated for heat exhaustion.[23] Between 8 and 11 January, one firefighter and one police officer were injured by a fire that burned 6,600 hectares (16,000 acres) around the north Perth suburbs of Bullsbrook, Chittering and Muchea.[48] On 31 January, one house, several vehicles and a number of sheds were destroyed by a 385 hectares (950 acres) bushfire that had ignited on 29 January and threatened the town of Waroona. A portion of the South Western Highway was closed and over 50 residents were evacuated. Approximately 200 firefighters were required to combat the blaze.[29][30] A fire that had been ignited by lightning near Northcliffe between 29 and 31 January almost doubled in size from 58,000 hectares (140,000 acres) to 80,000 hectares (200,000 acres) during hot, windy conditions on 4 February, and most residents of the town were evacuated to Pemberton.[24][25] During the 11-day duration of the fire, two homes and five non-residential structures were destroyed and a significant number of livestock perished as the blaze burned over 95,000 hectares (230,000 acres) of scrub, forest and pasture; a natural disaster zone was declared across the region.[26][49] Another fire that had been ignited by lightning between 29 and 31 January burned through 52,000 hectares (130,000 acres) of scrub, forest and pasture near Lower Hotham, in Boddington Shire; one house, two sheds, and the 66-year-old wooden Long Gully Bridge were destroyed in the blaze.[26][27]"

Becoming the eleventh named storm, the seventh severe tropical storm and the fourth typhoon of the 2011 Pacific typhoon season, Nanmadol made a total of three landfalls killing 26, and causing widespread damage worth US$26,464,591. The area of low pressure that was about to become Nanmadol formed on August 19. It drifted north and became a tropical depression on August 21, a tropical storm on August 23 and a typhoon on the same night. Nanmadol reached peak strength with winds of 100 knots (185\u00a0km/h; 115\u00a0mph) (10-minute sustained) and 140 knots (260\u00a0km/h; 160\u00a0mph) (1-minute sustained) threatening the Philippines with heavy rain and flash flooding. The Filipinos were warned about high waves, strong winds and very heavy rains over the weekend with storm signal 4 raised in parts of the Nation. There, strong winds toppled trees, power and communication lines triggering power outages in the provinces of Cagayan and Isabela. Rivers swelled up on receiving tons on rainwater, overflowing at least six bridges across the two provinces. The typhoon hardly moved in 24 hours bringing relentless rains to the archipelago causing the retaining wall of Baguio's dump facility to collapse. Also, major power lines in the nation were pulled down causing total power failures in Benguet, Cagayan, Apayao, Kalinga and mountain provinces."

        "content": "Late on August 19, an area of low pressure developed to the north of Palau.[1] Early on August 20, the system became more organized and developed a low-level circulation center.[2] The system then turned north and continued to drift north until on August 21, when the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the low-pressure area to a tropical depression east of Philippines.[3] The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on the system reporting that the system was becoming more well organized.[4] Later that day, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) started monitoring the system as a tropical depression and named it Mina.[5] Late on August 22, the system became more well organized prompting the JTWC to initiate advisories on the system, designating it 14W.[6] On August 23, the JMA upgraded 14W to a tropical storm, naming it Nanmadol.[7] Overnight, the system continued to intensify and early on August 24, the JMA upgraded Nanmadol to a severe tropical storm.[8] Later that day, convective banding improved and Nanmadol developed an eye-like feature.[9] As a result, Nanmadol continued to intensify rapidly and became a typhoon, by midnight, that day.[10] The JTWC originally anticipated a fujiwhara effect of Nanmadol on Talas, a weaker tropical cyclone to the east of Nanmadol.[11] However, the two cyclones moved far away from each other with at least a 1,000 nautical miles (1,900\u00a0km; 1,200\u00a0mi) of distance between them. This prompted the JTWC to change its forecast on the system, from turning east and interacting with Talas, to move west and hit the Philippines.[12] On August 26, Nanmadol reached peak strength with winds of 100 knots (190\u00a0km/h; 120\u00a0mph) (10-minute sustained) and 140 knots (260\u00a0km/h; 160\u00a0mph) (1-minute sustained) reaching category 5 status on the SSHS. The typhoon developed a large eye with a diameter of 18 nautical miles (33\u00a0km; 21\u00a0mi) with highly symmetric deep convective bands wrapped into it.[13] Nanmadol continued to drift north west and made landfall over Gonzaga, Cagayan, Philippines with strong winds of over 95 knots (176\u00a0km/h; 109\u00a0mph).[14] After interacting with land, the eye of Nanmadol became cloud filled and the eyewall in the northern semicircle became eroded causing the system to weaken.[15] However, the typhoon maintained tightly curved convective banding and central convection for long time after the landfall. The typhoon maintained a favorable upper level outflow, though located in a mid-level subtropical ridge.[16] As Nanmadol started moving away from Luzon, the eye became more evident and central convection became re-consolidated with curved banding.[17] However, the typhoon did not maintain this for long. Nanmadol could not recover very well from interacting with land and started weakening as the cloud tops were warming up and the eye was being filled with clouds again.[18] During the early hours of August 28, Nanmadol struggled to strengthen after passing over the Babuyan Islands. The eye became completely cloud-filled and the outermost rainbands crossed over Taiwan.[19] This prompted the JMA to downgrade Nanmadol to a severe tropical storm.[20] Later that day, the central convection started depleting as the system approached southern Taiwan. At that time, it was located approximately 245 nautical miles (454\u00a0km; 282\u00a0mi) south of Taipei in the periphery of a mid-level subtropical ridge.[21] Nanmadol continued to weaken as it approached Taiwan and the winds rapidly decreased to under 75 knots (139\u00a0km/h; 86\u00a0mph) (1-minute sustained), making Nanmadol a minimal typhoon on the SSHS. It maintained a poorly defined eyewall to its south with convective banding wrapped into the cloud filled center.[22] Late on August 28, Nanmadol made its second landfall over Dawu Township in Taitung County, Taiwan and started weakening.[23] After a tremendous burst of convection over southern Taiwan, land interaction severely weakened the system. A strong subtropical ridge towards the north-east of the storm started pushing Nanmadol towards the northwest at an increasingly fast pace.[24] Soon, Nanmadol accelerated towards the northwest and entered the Taiwan Strait, with fragmented convective bands wrapped into an adequately defined center. Landfall weakened the system rapidly prompting the JTWC to downgrade Nanmadol to a tropical storm with winds of under 50 knots (93\u00a0km/h; 58\u00a0mph).[25] Eventually, the JMA too downgraded Nanmadol to a tropical storm with winds of under 45 knots (83\u00a0km/h; 52\u00a0mph). At that time, it was located to the west of Tainan, Taiwan with 30 knots (56\u00a0km/h; 35\u00a0mph) winds spreading 220 nautical miles (410\u00a0km; 250\u00a0mi) towards the north-east and 140 nautical miles (260\u00a0km; 160\u00a0mi) towards the south-west.[26] On August 30, Nanmadol slowed moving and became almost stationary. The low level circulation center became exposed and the curved convective banding moved to the south of the system.[27] Soon it started experiencing strong wind shear and continued weakening. The shear pushed convection approximately 70 knots (130\u00a0km/h; 81\u00a0mph) south of the LLCC. The system also accelerated towards China at 08 knots (15\u00a0km/h; 9.2\u00a0mph) and weakened to a minimal tropical storm.[28] After its third landfall over Fujian, China, Nanmadol weakened rapidly prompting both the JTWC and the JMA to issue their final warnings on the system.[29][30]"

Also, people living in low-lying areas were instructed to prepare for flash flooding and landslides.[33] The Philippine Department of Health issued a white alert to its subordinates all along Nanmadol's path, ordering them to stock up on medicines and supplies so that the victims need not purchase them at the time of need.[34] As Nanmadol continued to intensify rapidly, storm signal was upgraded to 4 in some parts of Cagayan.[35] Quickly, the Philippine National Police were fully activated as Nanmadol intensified on nearing the north east Philippine coasts. The PNP were ordered to be in close coordination with the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Office of Civil Defense.[36] Also, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration reported that though Nanmadol was intensifying rapidly, heavy rains were no longer expected. The PAGASA said that unlike Ketsana in 2009, Nanmadol carried less rainwater and would dump less rain when compared to Ketsana.[37] On August 27, several flights were cancelled as the typhoon drifted closer to Philippines unexpectedly. Several sea vessels were also warned about very rough sea conditions over the weekend.[38]"

Also, Taiwanese residents were warned about possible heavy rains and strong winds from Monday, August 29.[40] On August 27, the Central Emergency Operation Center of Taiwan announced that they were completely prepared for any kind of contingencies triggered by the typhoon. Also, the police in Hualien set up a blockade to prevent people from approaching the seashore where high waves have been detected.[41] Also, the residents of the Pingtung and Taitung counties were asked to prepare for torrential downpour and strong winds.[42] The Opposition Democratic Progressive Party postponed their national congress meeting for the safety of party members and to allow its workers to focus on typhoon relief work.[43] On August 28, Ma Ying-jeou, the President of the Republic of China ordered evacuations of thousands of people from vulnerable areas, saying that a slow moving typhoon could result in more damages and casualties than normal.[44] The Defense Ministry of Taiwan mobilized some 35,000 soldiers to be ready to help out as many people as possible when the typhoon strikes. The soldiers were in possession of portable power generators, water pumps and amphibious assault vehicles.[45] On August 29, offices and schools were shut and a yellow alert, the second lowest in the nation's four-level rainstorm alert system was issued by the National Marine Environmental Forecasting Center.[46] Also, the Taiwan Railway Administration halted services on the South-Link Line in fear that heavy rain could trigger landslides and cause rail-accidents. The Directorate General of Highways closed the Suhua Highway saying that the area through which the highway was built is more prone to landslides during typhoons.[47]"

No one was reported to be dead or injured however.[53] On August 26, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) reported that one fisherman went missing after local residents reported that they found his banca empty.[54] On that day, the typhoon spawned a tornado in the Biliran Province blowing out three school buildings. No children were reported to be dead or injured although.[55] On August 27, Nanmadol lashed into the northern tip of the nation bringing heavy rains, causing landslides. Nanmadol, the strongest typhoon to affect the Philippines in 2011, killed two children in a landslide and left two fishermen missing.[56] Later, the NDRRMC started forced evacuations in some areas of the Cagayan province after storm warning signal 4 has been raised.[57] The typhoon's eye passed over the city of Santa Ana with the 24-hour rainfall accumulation over 400 millimetres (16\u00a0in). The typhoon also enhanced the Southwest Monsoonal Flow across the Philippines bringing heavy rains and squalls.[58] Another big issue was that the typhoon slowed down after landfall and did not move much in six hours, leaving the northern half of the nation in danger for a longer period of time.[59] Some thirteen families were evacuated from the Isabela province which was earlier hit by the typhoon as the governed ordered dam officials to release water if conditions worsen at the Magat Dam.[60] Nanmadol's strong winds toppled trees, power and communication lines triggering power outages in the provinces of Cagayan and Isabela. Also, the system spawned another tornado which blew out some 18 houses in the Ilocos Norte province.[61] Rivers swelled up on receiving tons on rainwater, overflowing at least six bridges across the two provinces. Another landslide in the Cordillera region blocked zig-zag shaped roads lying between mountains.[62] Late on the day, the NDRRMC reported that by then, Nanmadol killed 6, injured 7 and left 6 more missing. They also added that several towns in Ilocos Norte were completely submerged by floodwater. Several roads in the provinces of Ilocos Sur, La Union and Pangasinan.[63] The typhoon hardly moved in 24 hours bringing relentless rains to the archipelago causing the retaining wall of Baguio's dump facility to collapse. Also, major power lines in the nation were pulled down causing total power failures in Benguet, Cagayan, Apayao, Kalinga and Mountain Provinces.[64] On August 28, the NDRRMC reported that the typhoon displaced a total of 108,788 people, killing 7, injuring 10 and leaving 6 more missing. A Total of 93 houses were damaged including 16 totally destroyed. A total of 9 bridges and 28 roads remained impassable as floodwater rushed on top of them. Power was restored to many provinces including Isabela communication lines were functional. The only province left without power was Aurora.[65] On August 29, the NDRRMC further upgraded the death toll to 12, the number of injured to 21 and the number of missing to 9. They added that two people from Baguio and Benguet were killed in landslides attributed to Nanmadol. In their report, they also mentioned that the total damage to infrastructure and agriculture caused by Nanmadol was at US$22,475,672.[66] Later the same day, the NDRRMC reported that power was fine restored in Isabela province. Also, the continued to rise the death toll, putting it at 16, and the number of missing at 8. The total damage to agriculture and infrastructure was also upgraded to US$23,748,522.[67] On August 30, continuing the sequential reports after the typhoon, the NDRRMC pushed up the death toll to 22; the number of injured to 23 and the number of missing to 12. Also, they reported that the total number of houses damaged was 1,316 with 32 totally destroyed. The total damage to agriculture and infrastructure was also increased to US$26,119,801.[68] Later the same day, the NDRRMC further upgraded the death toll to 25; the number of injured to 32 and downgraded the number of missing to 7 reporting that 5 Pangasinan fishermen were rescued. Also, they included that in the wake of Nanmadol, a total of 47 incidents including 14 flashfloods, 12 landslides, 8 tornadoes, 6 sea mishaps, 1 vehicular accident, 4 collapsed structures, 1 lightning strike and 1 soil erosion were monitored.[69] Continuing the daily situational reports, the NDRRMC on September 1, upgraded the death toll to 29, the number of injured to\n37 and downgraded the number of missing to 5. They also increased the total damage from Nanmadol to agriculture and infrastructure to US$33,158,317.[70] On September 2, Benguet and Baguio were declared under State of Calamity by the NDRRMC. Also, the City Health Office Dagupan conducted a survey in their area of responsibility to check if there was any increase in flood-borne diseases. The NDRRMC confirmed more deaths, increasing the toll to 33, and the number of missing to 8 and the total cost of damage to agriculture and infrastructure to US$33,711,271.[71] After thorough reanalysis, the death toll was last raised to 35 and the damage was put at US$34,521,216.[72] Total economic losses in the Philippines were counted to be Php 40.9 billion (US$907.9 million).[73]"

Several thousands of people were evacuated as a precaution, when Nanmadol, the first typhoon to directly impact Taiwan since Typhoon Fanapi in 2010 made landfall.[75] The Council of Agriculture soon issued a red-alert for six riverside areas advising people that are at a high risk of mudslides after heavy torrential rains dumped by the typhoon.[76] The early damage estimates to agriculture was reported to be at US$344,790 with bananas hit the hardest sustaining losses of more than NT$3 million.[77] The storm started claiming lives later that day, when debris attributed to the storm hit a motorcyclist killing him almost instantly.[78] Some 30,000 households in southern and eastern Taiwan did not have electricity, 8,000 people were evacuated and several roads and bridges were closed due to the heavy rain.[79] Even long after Nanmadol left Taiwan, heavy rain continued to batter the nation. Several parts of the nation saw rains of more than \non meter and 1.5 meters with Pingtung County was the hardest hit of all. The total economic losses to the nation were put at NT$75.5 million (US$2.6 million).[80] The Hengchun Township was completely inundated by the floodwaters after heavy torrential rain from Nanmadol. The rain was so heavy that a local said, \"I never saw so much water in all my 60 years\".[81] On August 30, Eqecat reported that the total insured economic losses caused by Nanmadol in Taiwan could exceed US$500 million.[82]"

Evacuations were being carried out with local residents being taken to higher grounds.[85] On August 31, authorities in China reported that the total economic losses caused by Nanmadol in China were more than 44 million yuan (6.9 million U.S. dollars) as the storm destroyed 110 houses having more than 138,000 people evacuated.[86] In Putian City, Nanmadol claimed two lives, leaving four missing after very heavy torrential rains attributed to the storm. Bullet trains were slowed or stopped after the heavy damaged caused by Nanmadol's remnants to Fujian Province.[87] Also, the astronomical high tide coincided with Nanmadol's storm surge bringing unusually high tides which resulted in the increase of the likelihood of coastal flooding.[88] On September 1, Chinese state owned news agency Xinhua reported that The storm has caused direct economic loss of 130 million yuan or US$20,354,807 with two deaths, twenty injuries and six missing in the Fujian Province.

At 11:44\u00a0a.m. the commander on site ordered the evacuation of residents two miles (3.2\u00a0km) downwind of the fire. By noon the fire had reached the town of Superior, three miles (4.8\u00a0km) to the east, prompting the evacuation of stores there.[19] Within another hour evacuations had been ordered for tens of thousands of people starting with the town of Superior and later the cities of Louisville, portions of Broomfield, and unincorporated Boulder County.[1][20] Other portions of Broomfield, along with portions of Lafayette, Arvada, and Westminster were issued pre-evacuation orders.[21] Wind gusts of 115 miles per hour (185\u00a0km/h) were reported,[22] and the fire extent was an estimated 1,600 acres (650\u00a0ha) by 5:00\u00a0p.m. and had increased to 6,200 acres (2,500\u00a0ha) by 10:00\u00a0a.m. on December 31.[11] On the night of December 31\u2013January 1, heavy snowfall put an end to the fire.[23] "

At least three wildfires were reported near Flagstaff and caused hundreds of people to evacuate. However, two of the three reported fires, which are the Haywire and Double fires, combined on June 13. Before the merger of both of the fires, the Double Fire burned 500 acres (200\u00a0ha).[1] The first wildfire to be discovered was the Pipeline Fire on June 12 at around 10:15 AM (MST);[2] By Monday evening on June 13, the fire burned 5,000 acres (2,000\u00a0ha). As of June 13, 2022, no injuries or deaths have been reported, and one structure has been destroyed.[3] A total of 26 homes in Timberline were lost in the tunnel fire in April of 2022. The cause of that fire remains unknown although citizens blame the USFS for not thoroughly extinguishing a controlled burn. That was never proven. The pipeline fire was caused by a simpleton from Louisiana burning his used toilet paper in the middle of a blinding wind storm and up to 65\u00a0mph gusts, necessitating several days of \"red flag warnings\". The pipeline and haywire fires were deemed 100% contained two weeks later when monsoon storms put the fires out, but severe, persistent and life-threatening post fire/burn scar flash flooding began immediately in its stead."

        "content": "Between 1852 and 1857, Beechworth was a gold-producing region and centre of government; however, its power, wealth and influence were short-lived. According to Carole Woods, an early party of prospectors retrieved a pan of gold from the area weighing 14 pounds (6.4\u00a0kg).[5] Another lucky party cleared some 50 pounds (23\u00a0kg) of gold in a week.[6] And so began a rush into this remote region. During the first election campaign in 1855, one candidate, Daniel Cameron, rode a horse shod with solid gold horseshoes. The extravagance of this event is still commemorated as the logo for Beechworth is a golden horseshoe. At the time, Beechworth was far removed from the centre of colonial administration in Melbourne both in distance and time taken to travel. The local debates around the potential railway into Beechworth encompassed a broad gauge (5\u00a0ft\u00a03\u00a0in\u00a0/ 1,600\u00a0mm) option or a narrow gauge (2\u00a0ft\u00a06\u00a0in\u00a0/ 762\u00a0mm) system, between Wangaratta and Beechworth and these debates and options appeared in the Ovens and Murray Advertiser newspaper. Ironically, in the 1890s a narrow gauge system did eventuate nearby, running from Wangaratta to Whitfield. Finally a broad gauge railway arrived at Beechworth in September 1876,[7] but by that stage the town and its gold production was waning. The rail line was closed in 1977 and dismantled, after 101 years of service. During its boom times, Beechworth town boasted a range of industries including, a tannery, jewellers, boot makers, a brewery, blacksmiths, livestock sale yards. It had schools, a convent, hotels, a prison with imposing stone walls, a hospital, a mental hospital, court house, police barracks, stage coach companies and a powder magazine. In its golden days, men and women arrived from the United States, United Kingdom and China. At its peak, Beechworth town had over 3,100 residents.[8] Surrounding areas and mining camps sprang up as thousands of miners rushed into areas such as Spring Creek, Reedy Creek, Silver Creek, the Nine Mile Creek and the Woolshed increasing the population on the Ovens to around 22,000.[9] The Chinese were not allowed to live in Beechworth town and resided on the outskirts. Numerous controls, regulations and licence checks were enforced on the Chinese miners (see: Woods; also McWaters; also O'Brien; and Cronin). Beechworth Cemetery has a large preserved section of early Chinese miners/pioneers. The presence of the Chinese goldminers around Beechworth and throughout Victoria's north-eastern region created social unrest and these are recorded in O'Brien's; Woods'; and Cronin's works below."

He became dux in his first year. In his second year he was employed part-time as an assistant teacher at the school, and took up after school tutoring of fellow students. In September 1870, when Isaacs was just 15 years old, he passed his examination as a pupil teacher and taught at the school from then until 1873. Isaacs was next employed as an assistant teacher at the Beechworth State School, the successor to the Common school.[14] From 1875 Isaacs moved to Melbourne for work and to undertake law studies. His connection to Beechworth was re-established when he was elected as the member for Bogong in the Victorian Legislative Assembly from May 1892 until May 1893 and between June 1893 and May 1901. Isaacs further represented Beechworth and surrounding areas when he was elected to the first Federal Parliament in 1901 to the seat of Indi. He served until 1906 when he was appointed to the High Court. His little-known brother John Alfred Isaacs was also a lawyer and represented Ovens, the local electorate, from 1894 to 1902, but died insolvent and embroiled in matrimonial problems."

These two local papers provide rich primary sources for many historians of Beechworth and its surrounds, plus the Kelly Gang historians.(See: Woods (1985); McMahon (2000); Lane (1978); McQuilton (1979); Jones (1995); McWaters (2002); O'Brien (2005); and Wild & McMahon (2006)) The Ovens and Murray Advertiser still survives as a local paper."

The parish covered the town and surrounding rural areas including Broadbridge Heath, Roffey and Southwater.[3] The town was an ancient borough, being described as a borough from the thirteenth century and also electing members of parliament from 1295 onwards.[4] By the eighteenth century the borough corporation had ceased to have much role in administering the town, instead serving primarily as the means by which the main landowners, the Dukes of Norfolk, controlled the election of MPs. Dealing with such rotten boroughs was part of the motivation behind the Reform Act 1832, which reduced Horsham's representation from two to one MPs and made elections less open to abuse. Following those reforms Horsham's borough corporation stopped functioning.[5] Local government eventually returned to Horsham in 1875 when the central part of the parish, containing the town, was made a local government district, governed by a local board.[6] Such districts were reconstituted as urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894. The 1894 Act also said that parishes could no longer straddle district boundaries, and so the part of Horsham parish outside the urban district became a separate parish called Horsham Rural.[7][8] Horsham Urban District was abolished in 1974, merging with surrounding districts to become the modern Horsham District, which covers a large rural area as well as the town itself.[9] The Horsham Rural parish continued to exist until 1987 when it was divided into the parishes of Broadbridge Heath, North Horsham and Southwater, subject to some adjustments to the boundaries with neighbouring parishes at the same time.[10]"

At the south end of the Causeway is the Church of England parish church of St. Mary: Norman in origin, rebuilt in the 13th century and restored in 1864\u201365 by the Gothic revival architect S.S. Teulon.[14] The area immediately to the south east of the parish church is known as Normandy. It was formerly an area of artisans cottages and an ancient well. A short walk along the banks of the Arun in a south-easterly direction is Chesworth Farm, an area of open public access. Swan Walk, a shopping centre which opened in 1976 and was enclosed with a glass roof in 1989 with the addition of Springfield Court. Swan Walk takes its name from the Swan Inn that once stood where the pedestrian area now enters West Street, the old name being honoured by the bronze swan statues to the back of the centre and a mosaic in the middle. The shopping centre once enclosed the Capital Theatre which was built in the 1930s and was sandwiched between shops and a multi-storey car park from 1976 until its demolition in early 1983 when Marks & Spencer bought the site to build their store that opened in 1984.[15] A shopping area and public square, the Forum, opened in 2003[16] to the south of West Street. Fifty metres south is the River Arun. On the northern bank is Prewett's Mill, and on the south side is the town's cricket field. East Street joins the A281 and passes under a railway bridge (the line from London Victoria to Littlehampton). The road becomes Queen Street and the area becomes Iron Bridge (named after the railway bridge). The area consists of mainly Victorian and Edwardian houses to the north of Brighton Road, whilst to the south, there are areas of inter- and post-war housing. This area is known as the East Side. Horsham Park, a remnant of the former Hurst Park Estate, is in the northern end of the centre. The park has football pitches, a wildlife pond and tennis courts. Leisure facilities, including a swimming complex and a gymnastic centre, have been built on land around the park."

The area contains the Iron Bridge, a steel structure that carries the railway to the south of Horsham.[17] North Heath was originally used as a label to describe the northern part of the Horsham ancient parish (compared to Southwater to describe that part south of the River Arun), this area was developed as a district in the latter part of the 20th century.[17]"

In 2014 the important industries were financial services, pharmaceuticals, and technology. Horsham is a commuter town serving London, Gatwick Airport and the South East Coast.[24] The town still has Saturday and Thursday markets on Carfax. Horsham's town centre has a reputation for small business[25] and also provides multiple retail chain stores. Supermarkets serving the town include branches of Tesco, Sainsbury's, Marks & Spencer, Lidl and Waitrose. In 2015, a new \u00a38 million \"Waitrose\" and \"John Lewis at Home\" joint facility was opened after the closure of the smaller Waitrose that was formerly located in Piries Place.[26][27] RSA Insurance Group,[28] an insurance company, has its registered office in Horsham.

At its peak, the company occupied several smaller premises on the Carfax, Springfield House near St John the Evangelist Roman Catholic Church, the building that is now a study centre in Hurst Road, Parkside and the whole of the St Mark's complex, and print and security centres in industrial estates sprinkled around Horsham, plus Tricourt House closer to the Carfax and now occupied by a housing association. West Sussex County Council has partially occupied parkside after Royal Sun Alliance vacated the building.[29] Until 2015 the Swiss-based multinational pharmaceutical company Novartis, formerly Ciba-Geigy before a 1996 merger, was a major employer in the town, but the plant is now closed and the site scheduled for redevelopment.[30] The RSPCA,[28] an animal welfare charity, has a \u00a316 million headquarters at Southwater near Horsham, built to replace its former headquarters in the centre of the town.[31] Horsham is also the headquarters of video game studio Creative Assembly, as well as the location of its motion capture studio.[32]"

The building fell into disrepair and was substantially rebuilt around 1812. In 1888 it became the property of Horsham Urban District Council and was again largely rebuilt. The present building is essential of late-Victorian construction, though preserving some aspects of the earlier buildings. It has been used as council offices and as a magistrates court and more recently housed the Horsham Registry Office on the upper floor. The ground floor was still used as an occasional market place until the Town Hall was closed to be let as a restaurant.[34] Carfax contains the Town's Memorial to the dead of the two world wars as well as a substantial well-used bandstand. The Parish Church of St. Mary the Virgin is the oldest building in Horsham, having been in continuous use for nearly eight centuries. It is located at the end of the Causeway in Normandy, the oldest existing part of Horsham. It has a ring of ten bells.[35] The earthworks of the eleventh-century Horsham or Chennelsbrook Castle can be found near Chennells Brook.[36][37] At the west end of the town centre formerly stood a kinetic water sculpture called the 'Rising Universe', colloquially known as 'The Shelley Fountain'. It was designed by Angela Conner, and erected to commemorate the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley who was born at Field Place in Broadbridge Heath, near Warnham, two miles west from Horsham centre. The fountain was designed to release a torrent of six and a half tons of water periodically; it was 45\u00a0ft across at its base, standing 28\u00a0ft high.[38] It carried a plaque bearing one of his poems 'Mont Blanc'. The fountain was turned off in the spring of 2006 to save water. Despite recycling it used 180 gallons a day to cover evaporation and filtration losses. However, the council has made water saving efficiencies elsewhere and the fountain was turned on again on 13 November 2006, its tenth birthday but was turned off again after that Christmas. In May 2008 the fountain was turned off again due to the failure of its main hydraulic cylinder.[39] On 19 January 2009 the fountain was fenced off for repairs.[40] It was reopened without the fountain functioning. The fountain was again repaired at the start of March 2011 at a cost of more than \u00a330,000[41] and was removed altogether in June 2016[42] with cost of upkeep being cited as the main reason.[43]"

        "content": "The promontory was first occupied by indigenous Koori people at least 6,500 years prior to European arrival.[2] Middens along the western coast indicate that the inhabitants subsisted on a seafood diet.[3] The promontory is mentioned in dreamtime stories, including the Bollum-Baukan, Loo-errn and Tiddalik myths.[4][3] It is considered the home of the spirit ancestor of the Brataualung clan - Loo-errn.[5] The area remains highly significant to the Gunai/Kurnai and the Boon wurrung people, who consider the promontory to be their traditional country/land.[4] The land is now owned by the Boonwurung, Bunurong and Gunaikurnai people. The first European to see the promontory was George Bass in January 1798.[6]  He initially referred to it as \"Furneaux's Land\" in his diary, believing it to be what Captain Furneaux had previously seen. But on returning to Port Jackson and consulting Matthew Flinders he was convinced that the location was so different it could not be that land.[7] Seal hunting was conducted in the area in the 19th century.[8] Shore-based whaling was also carried out in a cove at Wilsons Promontory from at least 1837. It was still underway in 1843 at Lady's Bay (Refuge Cove).[9] Throughout the 1880s and '90s a public campaign to protect the area as a national park was waged, including by the Field Naturalists' Club of Victoria.[10] The promontory has been a national park, to one degree or another, since 1898. Wilsons Promontory National Park, also known locally as \"the Prom\", contains the largest coastal wilderness area in Victoria. Until the 1930s, when the road was completed, it was accessible only by boat.[10] The site was closed to the public during World War II, as it was used as a commando training ground. The only settlement within Wilsons Promontory is Tidal River which lies 30 kilometres (19\u00a0mi) south of the park boundary and is the focus for tourism and recreation. This park is managed by Parks Victoria.[11]\nIn 2005 a burn started by staff got out of control and burnt 13% of the park, causing the evacuation of campers.[12] In 2009, a lightning strike near Sealer's Cove started a fire that burned over 25,000 hectares (62,000 acres). Much of the area had not been burned since 1951.[13] The fire began on 8 February, the day after \"Black Saturday\", where an intense heat wave, combined with arson, faulty electrical infrastructure and natural causes, led to hundreds of bushfires burning throughout the state of Victoria. Although the fire burned to within 1 kilometre (0.62\u00a0mi), the Tidal River camping area and park headquarters were unaffected. The park reopened to the public one month after the incident and the burned areas quickly regrew.[14] Despite the damage, the natural beauty of the area remained largely intact.[15] In March 2011 a significant rainfall event led to major flooding of the Tidal River camping area.  The bridge over Darby River was cut, leaving no vehicle access to Tidal River, leading to the evacuation of all visitors by helicopter over the following days, and the closure of the southern section of the park.  In September 2011 public access to Tidal River was reopened following repair of the main access road, and the bridge at Darby River.  All sections of the park south of Tidal River were closed while further repairs of tracks and footpaths were undertaken. The park was fully re-opened by Easter of 2012. Tourists may choose basic or glam, cabins or camping (powered/unpowered) if they wish to stay inside Wilsons Promontory National Park. Many however choose to stay in accommodation just outside the Park in Yanakie, where they can still view the Wisons Promontory mountains and scenery and be only minutes from the Park's free entrance. There are overnight hiking tracks[16] with two key circuits, one in the north and one in the south. The southern circuit is more popular with overnight hikers with several camping areas suited to wild camping. Camping is only allowed in the designated areas to reduce damage to the bush."

It was given this name by Governor Hunter on the recommendation of Matthew Flinders and George Bass: \"At our recommendation governor Hunter called it WILSON'S PROMONTORY, in compliment to my friend Thomas Wilson, Esq. of London.\"[6] Despite Wilson being significant enough for such a large amount of land to be named in his honour, he had slipped into obscurity until 2023, when new research was published by the Royal Australian Historical Society. Wilson was in fact one of the most important promoters of the study of the natural history of New South Wales, as Eastern Australia was then known, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. He was a member of both the Society for Promoting Natural History and the Linnean Society, a wealthy apothecary, a patron of surgeon and botanical collector John White and supporter of Flinders. White dedicated his far-reaching and substantial account of the First Fleet to Wilson, entitled Journal of a Voyage to New South Wales[18]"

        "content": "Coastal features include expansive intertidal mudflats, sandy beaches and sheltered coves interrupted by prominent headlands and plunging granite cliffs in the south, backed by coastal dunes and swamps. The promontory is surrounded by a scatter of small granite islands which, collectively, form the Wilsons Promontory Islands Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of its importance for breeding seabirds.[19] Tidal River is the main river in Wilsons Promontory. The river runs into Norman Bay and swells with the tide. The river is a very fascinating colour, a purple-yellow. This is due to the large number of tea trees in the location, which stain the water with tannin, giving it a tea-like appearance. Darby River is the second major river, with extensive alluvial flats and meanders. It was the site of the original park entrance and accommodation area from 1909 to the Second World War.[20] Wilsons Promontory is home to many marsupials, native birds and other creatures. One of the most common marsupials found on the promontory is the common wombat, which can be found in much of the park (especially around campsites where it has been known to invade tents searching for food). The peninsula is also home to kangaroos, snakes, wallabies, koalas, long-nosed potoroos, white-footed dunnarts, broad-toothed rats, feather-tailed gliders and emus. Some of the most common birds found on the promontory include crimson rosellas, yellow-tailed black cockatoos and superb fairywrens. There are also many pests, including hog deer, foxes, feral cats, rabbits, common starlings, and common blackbirds. As the Wilsons Promontory Marine National Park and Corner Inlet Marine National Park have been established, the area holds a variety of marine life and coral reefs. In recent years, after a long disappearance, due to illegal hunting by the Soviet Union with help by Japan, Southern right whales started to return to the area to rest and calve in the sheltered bays along with Humpback whales. Killer whales are also known to pass the area, and dolphins, seals, sea lions, and penguins still occur today. The peninsula is also home to two large sets of dunes, the Big Drift and Little Drift. They are not very well-known but sometimes visited by hikers and suitable for sandboarding.[21]"

Nine houses were destroyed and a further two were significantly damaged by the fires, and hundreds of residents were evacuated.

The investigation to identify a possible perpetrator remains with Police.[3] It is possible the initial Early Valley fire started due to an electrical fault on a power pole.[7] The origin of the fire has been determined to be a 5\u00a0m2 (54\u00a0sq\u00a0ft) area directly behind a power pole.[7]:\u200a7\u200a Investigation showed that there were electrical faults recorded around the time, however these faults could have been a result of ionised air with a lower breakdown voltage due to the fire already burning below. Subsequent evidence uncovered in 2020 indicated evidence of electric arcing and melted aluminium on the pole in a way that is unlikely to be explained by fire damage.[7]:\u200a169\u200a However, due to a lack of evidence on the exact timing of these events, the cause is officially undetermined.[7]:\u200a2\u200a Evidence suggests that the second fire at Marleys Hill was arson, with no alternative source of ignition identified.[27]"

Firefighters fought the 5-acre (2.0\u00a0ha) fire on a steep hillside above 7151 Buckingham Boulevard, and by Saturday night believed it to be under control. The fire re-ignited as a brush fire shortly before 11:00\u00a0a.m. on Sunday, October\u00a020 and rapidly spread southwest, driven by wind gusts up to 65\u00a0mi (100\u00a0km) per hour.[4] It quickly overwhelmed local and regional firefighting resources. By 11:30\u00a0a.m., the fire had spread to the nearby Parkwoods Apartments located next to the Caldecott Tunnel. Shortly before noon, the fire had been blown up to the top of Hiller Highlands to the west, from where it began its sweep down into the Hiller Highlands development and the southern hills of Berkeley. Burning embers from houses and vegetation were carried ahead of the fire line by torrid winds and started new blazes ahead of the original burn. Within thirty minutes the fire had crossed both Highway\u00a024 (an eight-lane freeway) and Highway\u00a013 (a four-lane freeway), eventually igniting hundreds of houses in the Forest Park neighborhood on the northwest edge of the Montclair district and in the upper Rockridge neighborhood. The fire eventually touched the edge of Piedmont, burning some municipal property, but the buildings and houses were spared. The hot, dry northeasterly winds, dubbed as \"Diablo winds\" in reference to the Diablo mountain range, Diablo Valley, and surrounding geography of same name, periodically occur during the early fall season.  These are similar to the Santa Ana winds in Southern California, and have been the cause of numerous devastating fires. The fire began generating its own wind, the defining characteristic of a firestorm. The superheated fire-driven winds combined with warmer, drier air east of the Berkeley Hills, and interacted with the ambient cooler, more moist Bay/Coastal air to create erratic, dangerous gusts, which  helped produce numerous rotational vortices. All of these combined to help spread the fire, tossing embers in all directions. The wind was so strong that it also blew debris across the bay into San Francisco. Ash fell onto the field of Candlestick Park where the Detroit Lions and San Francisco 49ers were playing during that afternoon.[5] The CBS telecast of the game also showed live footage of the fire. As with the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake two years earlier, the blimp shots from the national sports media provided many people with first word of the disaster. By mid-afternoon, the wind had slowed and shifted to the west, driving the fire to the southeast. At about 9:00\u00a0p.m., the wind abruptly stopped, giving firefighters a chance to contain the fire.[6]"

        "content": "Assistance from firefighting agencies as far north as the Oregon state line, as far south as Bakersfield and as far east as the Nevada state line were delayed initially. Official reports differ between when the Oakland Fire Department made requests, and when the state Department of Forestry and Fire Protection was asked to mobilize air tanker support to the fire zone.[7] Eventually the California Department of Forestry (CDF) was asked to dispatch several air tankers, which doused the fire with tons of fire retardant all day long. The CDF established a base at the Naval Air Station in Alameda. Additionally, the Naval Air Station itself sent its own firefighting equipment and material to the scene of the fire. The next morning, before full control had been gained, satellite photographs, especially infrared (heat-sensing) photographs, were provided with the help of NASA Ames Research Center's Disaster Assistance and Rescue Team (DART) to aid firefighters in plotting the extent of the fire and spotting hidden hot spots. In terms of alarm assignments, it was the equivalent of a 107-alarm fire. For a variety of reasons, the firefighting teams were initially overwhelmed by the firestorm. The winds were gusting at times in excess of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h), creating erratic and extreme fire behavior. Flames took out power lines to seventeen pumping stations in the Oakland water system. Outside fire teams faced various equipment compatibility issues such as hydrants having the wrong size outlets for the hoses used by neighboring counties.  Oakland was also not able to communicate with many mutual aid resources due to antiquated equipment and lack of access to statewide radio frequencies brought on by the budget restrictions in the preceding years. In some areas, firefighters simply ran out of water, as there was no power to refill the emptied reservoirs.[8] Additionally, many narrow, winding roads in the area were crowded with parked cars, including many in front of fire hydrants; this prevented fire trucks and ambulances from getting to certain areas and connecting fire hoses. The general situation was one of chaos and panic among residents in the area. The most important factor was the rapid spread of the wind-driven fire. Before most of the firefighting resources could be brought to the scene, the fire had established a large perimeter. At the fire's peak, it destroyed one house every 11 seconds. By the first hour, the fire had destroyed nearly 790\u00a0structures. In addition to the winds and the heat, an important factor in the rapid spread of the fire was that it started in an area that was at an interface between developed and undeveloped land. Many of the first dwellings to burn were surrounded by thick, dry vegetation. In addition, the nearby undeveloped land had even more dry brush. Other factors included many wood shake/shingle roofs which were easily ignited by embers, and the use of wood chip mulch in landscaping around buildings, which was blown around spreading embers and igniting vegetation across streets.[9] The same conditions contributed to a major conflagration nearby in the 1923 Berkeley fire and a more limited conflagration in the same area on September\u00a022, 1970, again under similar conditions. A smaller fire also started in Wildcat Canyon on December\u00a014, 1980.[10] As night descended, the firestorm threatened to destroy the historic Claremont Resort hotel, where the media had gathered to report on the fire. Television crews trained their cameras on the dark hill immediately behind the hotel and millions watched as the fire slowly marched house by house toward the evacuated hotel. The fire was stopped shortly before it reached the hotel. By 5:00\u00a0p.m., the winds died down, giving firefighters a chance to control the blaze, though full containment would not be achieved until October\u00a022. As many as 400\u00a0engine companies, 1,500\u00a0personnel, and 250\u00a0agencies worked to put out the fire. By Wednesday, October\u00a023, at 8:00\u00a0a.m., the fire was declared under control, almost 72\u00a0hours after it started."

        "content": "The fire's rapid rate of spread and massively-destructive nature sparked renewed recognition of the dangers posed by wildland-urban interface fires in major cities, and spurred research and investigation into improved prevention and suppression of such fires.[11] Several nonprofit groups arose after the fire. One, the Hills Emergency Forum, was created by local fire agencies to build consensus on fire safety standards and codes, offer multi-jurisdictional training, and coordinate fuel reduction strategies, as well as other goals. At least two citizen groups also arose, the North Hills Phoenix Association and the Claremont Canyon Conservancy to participate in policy decisions and provide educational and stewardship services at the wildland\u2013urban interface. The fire validated that the efforts undertaken by CARD (Collaborating Agencies Responding to Disasters) after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, to build a nonprofit preparedness infrastructure, were key to addressing the needs of vulnerable communities. In response to issues about firefighting equipment during the disaster, Oakland city firefighters now carry more extensive wildland firefighting gear and fire shelters. Prior to and during this firestorm, when this was not standard equipment, firefighters were sometimes forced to don turn-outs which greatly hampered their ability to move quickly and stay cooler during a wildland fire. Fire hydrants now have the industry standard 4+1\u20442 and 2+1\u20442\u00a0inch outlets throughout the city. The lack of a standard in 1991 caused numerous difficulties for various agencies who attempted to connect to non-standard hydrants, even though the 3-inch (76\u00a0mm) outlets previously used by Oakland were considerably more efficient.[citation needed] Water cisterns and a new hills fire station were added, and radio communications were improved. On June 12, 2008, a brush fire ignited in almost the exact location of the starting point of the 1991 fire, but owing to a rapid response, the preventive measures implemented after the 1991 disaster, and the lack of significant winds, the fire was confined to 2 acres (0.81\u00a0ha), with no damage to any structures, and was extinguished within 90 minutes.[12] In 2015, a $4 million federal grant to prevent fires in the Oakland Hills ignited debate over whether to cut down trees in the region. The city and its fire department say clearing young eucalyptus trees and other non-native plants would deter another deadly firestorm like the one that whipped through the hills in 1991.[13][14] One of the most famous victims who lost his house in the disaster was game designer Will Wright, who lived a few blocks away from where the fire started. He used his experience of rebuilding his life as the basis for the concept of the Maxis computer game series The Sims, and added the city's recovery from the fire as a scenario in the game SimCity 2000.[15][16]"

        "content": "This is an accepted version of this page  The North Fire was a wildfire that occurred in the Mojave Desert near the towns of Victorville and Hesperia, north of San Bernardino and south of Bakersfield, California. The fire began on July 17, 2015. The areas most impacted were adjacent to Interstate 15, where the Cajon Pass passes through the San Bernardino National Forest. The fire spread to 4,250 acres, and burned homes and other buildings, as well as numerous vehicles stranded on the interstate. Seventy-four passenger vehicles and trucks were burned along the highway or in neighboring communities due to the fire.[3] The fire closed Interstate 15, the main highway connecting Southern California with Las Vegas, Nevada, during the first day of the blaze.[4] One-thousand fire fighters battled the blaze during the height of the fire, which as of the evening of July 17 was five percent contained.[5] Mandatory evacuations were ordered for the towns of Phelan and Baldy Mesa, which were threatened or impacted by the fire.[6] Two-hundred-four people utilized an emergency shelter set up at Serrano High School, in Phelan.[1] The evacuation orders were lifted as crews worked to contain the fire. On the evening of July 18, the fire was reported to be 45% contained, after a rain storm from the remnant moisture of Hurricane Dolores brought cooler temperatures to the chaparral fueled fire.[7] By the following morning, the fire was reported to be 60% contained.[8] On Monday, July 20, the fire was reported to be 75% contained, but had also grown from 3,500 to 4,250 acres.[9] The fire was fully contained on July 21, and fire fighters remained on scene to douse hot spots in the burn area.[3] The remnants of Hurricane Dolores assisted with putting the fire out by drenching the area the same weekend, while causing other damage in Southern California.[10] The presence of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs/drones) in the area that interfered with fire fighting efforts has renewed discussion of legislation to limit the operation of drones in the United States. In response to the drone activity over active wildfires, San Bernardino County, the California State Legislature and the Congress of the United States have all proposed restrictions on privately owned drones."

On Sunday, July 19, aerial suppression of the fire was temporarily halted by the presence of drones flying in the vicinity. Three of the five drones found in the area left the scene, but the presence of two others interfered with the fire fighting operation. After a delay, the fire fighting operation resumed.[11] On Monday, July 20, a US Forest Service officer fired his weapon outside the headquarters of the fire fighting effort, located at the fair grounds in Victorville. A man allegedly became \"uncooperative\" and tried to flee, dragging the officer with his car. The officer fired several rounds into the vehicle, but there were no injuries.[12]"

Prior to the meeting, Board Chairman James Ramos stated, regarding UAVs in the area of fire fighting operations, \"When you are inhibiting the response of the first responders, then you infringe on the safety of the residents of San Bernardino County.\"[14] At the meeting, the county approved monetary rewards of US$25,000 for each incident for information leading to the arrest of individuals who piloted UAVs over recent wildfires in the county.[15] Both houses of the California State Legislature have either introduced legislation or otherwise acted regarding UAVs operating over state wildfires. Senate Bill 168 would give immunity to first responders who damage or destroy privately owned UAVs operating over wildfires. And some members of the California House of Representatives are urging the Federal Aviation Administration to consider geo fencing of commercially available UAVs, which could be used by authorities to keep them out of restricted areas.[15] In October, 2015, the US Federal Aviation Administration announced that UAVs flying within the United States must register their aircraft with the federal government. This new policy will apply to both new vehicles, as well as UAVs already owned and operated. The new policy imposes penalties on UAV owners who do not comply.[16]"

An area of disturbed weather formed near Pohnpei in late-July\u00a01992, and after an increase in thunderstorm activity, a tropical depression developed on August\u00a03. After passing near Guam, Janis tracked generally westward, and on August\u00a05, the storm was believed to have attained typhoon intensity. After intensifying at a brisk pace, Janis attained peak intensity on August\u00a06 near Okinawa. Thereafter, the typhoon began to weaken and accelerate as it recurved towards Kyushu, where it made landfall on the next day. Land interaction took its toll on the typhoon as it tracked northeast, paralleling the western coast of Honshu. On August\u00a09, Janis transitioned into an extratropical low over Hokkaido. Five fishing boats sank offshore Taiwan, where one fisherman was killed, and six others were listed missing. Typhoon Janis was the second of two consecutive systems to move over the Japanese archipelago, with Tropical Storm Irving preceding it. Nationwide, twelve fatalities were reported and another was initially reported as missing. Sixty-seven others sustained injuries. A total 1,561\u00a0houses were destroyed while 1,508\u00a0others were flooded. In addition, 47\u00a0ships and 4,802\u00a0ha (11,870 acres) were damaged.

Passing near Guam and moving into the Philippine Sea, the depression organized further[1] and was upgraded to a tropical storm at 18:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a03 by both the JTWC and JMA.[6] At around this time, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Gloring.[7] Midday on August\u00a04, the JMA classified Janis as a severe tropical storm.[3] Six hours later, Janis was declared a typhoon by the JTWC,[1] with the JMA doing the same at 00:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a05.[3] According to the JTWC, Janis entered a period of rapid deepening, intensifying 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph) during the day of August\u00a05.[2] At 00:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a06, the JTWC increased the intensity of the storm to 215\u00a0km/h (130\u00a0mph), equivalent to a low-end Category\u00a04 hurricane on the United States-based Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Operationally, the storm was believed to have attained winds 230\u00a0km/h (145\u00a0mph), based on Dvorak estimates from polar orbiting satellite imagery. However, in post-storm analysis, the JTWC determined that due to the high resolution of the satellite, the eye temperature of the storm was overestimated, prompting the agency to revise its Dvorak methods to better match intensity estimates derived from geostationary satellites.[1] After tracking towards the west-northwest during its early stages, Typhoon Janis turned towards the north-northeast[8] and passed 165\u00a0km (105\u00a0mi) east of Okinawa.[1] The JTWC estimated that Janis leveled off in intensity. However, the JMA estimates that Janis was still strengthening, and did not attain its highest intensity until 18:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a06, when the agency reported winds of 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph) and a barometric pressure of 935\u00a0mbar (27.61\u00a0inHg).[6] After its peak intensity, the typhoon began to weaken and accelerate as it recurved towards Kyushu; this turn was correctly predicted by the JTWC.[1] At the time of landfall on Kyushu late on August 7, the JTWC and JMA estimated winds of 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph) and 135\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph) respectively.[6] Over Kyushu, land interaction took its toll on the typhoon,[1] and the JTWC and JMA downgraded Janis to tropical storm intensity on August 8.[6] The tropical storm moved to the northeast, paralleling the western coast of Honshu. At noon on August\u00a09, Janis transitioned into an extratropical low over Hokkaido.[1] It was lasted noted by the JMA around noon on August\u00a013 near the International Date Line.[3]"

According to CALFIRE, it is also the sixth-deadliest and fourth-most destructive wildfire in state history, causing just over $1.3 billion in damages.[5][6][1] In November 2018, the Camp Fire (2018) surpassed the Tubbs Fire (which had previously surpassed the 1991 Oakland Firestorm and the Cedar Fire) to become the single most destructive wildfire in California history, in terms of the number of buildings destroyed.[6] In December 2017, the Thomas Fire surpassed the Cedar Fire to become California's largest modern wildfire on record, before the Mendocino Complex Fire's Ranch Fire surpassed both fires to become the state's largest wildfire in August 2018.[7]"

It was first reported at 5:37\u00a0p.m. PDT on October 25, 2003, to the south of Ramona in central San Diego County. At the time it began, at least eleven other wildfires were actively burning in Southern California. Within ten minutes of the initial report, the U.S. Forest Service had deployed 10 fire engines, two water tenders, two hand crews and two chief officers. Within 30 minutes, 320 firefighters and six fire chiefs were en route.[8] A San Diego County Sheriff's Office ASTREA helicopter that was rescuing a hunter spotted the fire at about the same time as the first phone report was received and called for an air response. Another sheriff's helicopter equipped with a Bambi Bucket was dispatched to drop water on the fire. When the helicopter was only minutes away from the fire, a Forest Service fire chief cancelled the water drop because policy required the cutoff of aerial firefighting 30 minutes before sunset, a decision which was later severely criticized by the public, media, and other elected officials.[8] Between the time the fire started and midnight the predicted strong easterly Santa Ana winds surfaced and the fire burned approximately 5,319 acres.[9] By 3:00\u00a0a.m., 62,000 acres (250\u00a0km2) had burned.[10] Overnight, the fast-moving fire killed 12 people living in Wildcat Canyon and Muth Valley in the northern part of Lakeside, who had little or no warning that the fire was approaching. The fire destroyed 39 homes on the Barona Indian Reservation.[11] In only a few hours, the Cedar Fire pushed southwest over 30 miles (48.3\u00a0km) and burned over 100,000 acres (400\u00a0km2) at rates of up to 6,000 acres (24\u00a0km2) per hour.[12] The fire also crossed several large highways, including Interstate 15, and by noon on October 26, the fire was burning hundreds of homes in the Scripps Ranch community of San Diego, and was threatening many others.[13] On October 26, the fire forged into Alpine, Harbison Canyon, Lake Jennings and Crest, burning hundreds more homes in areas that had been devastated by the Laguna Fire 33 years earlier. By October 28, the strong easterly Santa Ana winds died down and the fire turned east, consuming another 114,000 acres (460\u00a0km2). The entire community of Cuyamaca, most of nearby Cuyamaca Rancho State Park, and more than 500 homes surrounding the town of Julian were destroyed.[14] On October 29, a group of firefighters attempting to defend a house in Riverwood Estates, near Santa Ysabel, became entrapped and overrun by the fire. One firefighter died. Another firefighter sustained severe injuries, and two others were hurt.[15] Firefighters finally achieved full containment of the Cedar Fire on November 3, and the Cedar Fire was completely brought under control on December 5.[2]"

After gathering branches and other flammable brush together, Martinez intentionally lit a large fire that he quickly lost control of, spreading to the surrounding \"tall and thick\" Chaparral brush.  The daily high temperature combined with low humidity & low moisture content of the highly flammable chaparral were ideal for a wildfire.   At 8PM local time the predicted evening Santa Ana winds blew hot and dry desert air from the east westward though the rugged terrain fanning the intense flames westward towards the residential areas of San Diego. Two Local Sheriff deputies were already searching for Mr. Martinez in a helicopter and quickly spotted the thick black smoke from the fire he had set.   They found Mr. Martinez on a pile of rocks near a \"parking lot sized\" scorched area and alerted local fire crews.   Martinez was rescued and when initially questioned refused to answer the sheriff deputies as to how the fire started. Due to the loss of daylight, the terrain and high winds fire crews were unable (as per policy) to attempt to fight the rapidly spreading and intensifying fire. Martinez was charged in federal court on October\u00a07, 2004 with setting the wildfire and lying about its cause to investigators.[22] In November 2005, as part of a plea deal a federal judge sentenced Martinez to six months in a work-furlough program and ordered him to complete 960 hours (40 days) of community service.[23] He also was sentenced to five years' probation and to pay $9,000 in restitution.[24] As part of the plea bargain, prosecutors dropped the charge of lying to investigators.[23]"

The report stated that though the fire conditions and severity should have been expected, the responsible agencies were not properly prepared when the fire broke out, and radio communications problems exacerbated the problem. The report stated that \"Disorganization, inconsistent or outdated policies among agencies that grounded aircraft or caused other problems, and planning or logistics in disarray also marked the preliminary stages of the difficult, dangerous firefighting.\"[26] With multiple fires already burning in the state, many local crews were already headed north to fight other fires and could not be recalled to assist with the Cedar Fire.[12]"

At the time that the Cedar Fire started, there were already 11 other fires burning in the region. Aviation resources in the area were currently being held on the ground under a \"no divert\" declaration, in order to be available for structures' protection on another fire. However, weather and visibility at the other fire was precluding their use, so the aircraft sat idle, despite the fact that conditions were acceptable for their use on the Cedar Fire.[25] Both the media and local elected officials were also critical of the lack of use of military aviation assets located nearby at Camp Pendleton and Miramar. The U.S. Marine Corps operates CH-46 Sea Knight and CH-53 Sea Stallion helicopters that can carry water-dropping buckets, but existing policies prohibited their use until all other civilian resources were used. Additionally, the military aircraft radios were not compatible with those used by most state and local fire agencies, and the military pilots had not received any training in fire-specific operations, making them a potential safety hazard both to firefighters on the ground and other aircraft over the fire.[25]"

The tornado also destroyed the Otter Tail County courthouse, the county jail, four churches and multiple other businesses. Small trees in town were debarked, and railroad tracks were reportedly pulled from the ground at one location, indicative of extreme intensity.[4] The Northern Pacific rail depot was completely destroyed, and reportedly swept away. At Lake Alice, several summer homes were swept into the water along with their occupants, resulting in several fatalities there.[5] The Great Northern Oriental Limited passenger train was thrown off the tracks by the tornado, but none of the 250 passengers on the train was seriously injured.  Checks that were sucked up by the tornado in Fergus Falls were found 60 miles to the east.[2][6]"

        "content": "The only fatal tornado of the outbreak touched down in Putnam County, Illinois, north of Florid before moving east and striking Granville. Witnesses reported a multiple-vortex tornado just prior to its arrival in Granville. The town was bisected by the half-mile-wide tornado with 12 buildings destroyed, 45 with major damage, and 26 with minor damage (mainly residential). The Granville State National Bank lost its roof, and Hopkins Elementary School lost the roof over the old gymnasium with damage in nearly all the classrooms. Significant damage also occurred to Granville Drugs, the only drug store in town. In Granville, 5 people were injured by the tornado, including an elderly woman who suffered a heart attack during the tornado and was eventually evacuated via Life Flight to a Peoria hospital. Injuries were low due to the 32 minutes of lead time before the tornado struck Granville. Damage in Granville was estimated to be at least $8\u00a0million, with the school suffering at least $3.5\u00a0million in damage. Damage in town was rated high-end F2.[2] The tornado entered LaSalle County, Illinois, from Putnam County, approximately 3 miles (5\u00a0km) northeast of the town of Standard, producing F0 intensity damage in a wooded area southwest of Peru. As the tornado continued northeast, F2 intensity damage was done to several homes in a subdivision near the intersection of East 250th and 2569th Roads. Several roofs were blown off homes, along with damage to external walls. Significant tree damage was done as well. Path width was estimated at 50 yards (45\u00a0m) at this location. The tornado then continued northeast, crossing the Illinois River twice as it moved toward the town of Utica, downing a steel high tension tower on the north bank of the river, immediately west of Illinois Route 251. The tornado moved into the southwest side of Utica where it was at F0 intensity. Homes along Washington Street only had tree and minor roof damage. A church steeple was damaged between Johnson and Washington streets. Roofs and trees were more severely damaged on the south side of Johnson Street. The tornado rapidly increased to F3 intensity on the north side of Johnson Street where one home had its roof taken off, and north walls were blown out. A machinery building was completely destroyed on the south side of the canal and a semi-tractor trailer was blown into the canal. A large grain bin was blown across the canal and flattened. The tornado then moved north of the canal into the heart of town where several homes were severely damaged, garages were destroyed, and brick buildings collapsed. Eight people died and seven were rescued from the basement of the turn of the century sandstone Milestone Tap tavern. The structure collapsed when a vehicle was thrown into it. The tornado was approximately 250 yards wide at this point. On the east edge of the vortex along Mill Street, in downtown, buildings suffered damage to facades, roofs and windows. East of Mill Street there was damage to trees and minor roof damage. In the northeast section of town a mobile home was overturned just east of Mill Street. The vortex crossed the railroad tracks and apparently dissipated on a steep bluff on the northeast side of town. At the top of the hill there were some trees and limbs downed, and some debris from town was deposited.[3] On June 2, 2004, the Village Clerk's son was stillborn. The clerk, Angela Brown, had worked 16-hour days following the tornado hit until his birth, and she stated her doctors attributed his death in part to stress as a result of this work. In a memorial service on April 19, 2005, the city of Utica recognized him as the ninth victim (though this death is not counted in the official NCDC total).[4]"

Two school buses, one for the east side and one for the west side, took the students to and from school. The east-side bus was a 1929 Chevrolet truck modified and driven by farmer and bus driver Carl Miller.[1][2] On the day of the tragedy, some of the back windows were broken and cardboard was used to block the wind.[1] March 23, 1931, started out warm, at 60\u00a0\u00b0F (16\u00a0\u00b0C), though dark clouds were forming. The east-side bus ran the route and picked up 20 students, ranging in age from 7 to 14 years old. Due to the warmth, some students, such as Mary Louise Stonebraker, did not bring winter clothes.[3] When the students got to school around 9 a.m., the weather had turned for the worse; temperatures dropped below freezing, and snow started to fall.[1] At the school, the two school teachers, Maude Mosier and Franz Freiday, came to the decision that the children should be taken home because the school had no water or food, and only a small stove for heat. Miller disagreed, but the teachers overruled him. All the students returned to the two school buses. The west bus made it to a local farmhouse.[4]"

Miller was trying to take a shortcut to get to the Untiedt farm, but he almost immediately got lost, unable to see past the radiator of the bus. Around 9:30\u00a0a.m., as they were driving around looking for a landmark, the school bus slid into a ditch on Holly\u2013Towner Road and the engine stalled out.[2] Miller tried to restart the engine, but packed snow and ice prevented it from starting up again. Stuck on a bus with no heater, and with high wind that blew out the cardboard covering the missing windows (which caused snow to start to pile up inside), the situation became dire. The occupants tried to get warm by making a fire with school books, but this mostly filled the bus with smoke. Plus, their lunches had become frozen, and so they were also hungry. To stay warm, the bus driver ordered the kids to jump around. In the afternoon, as the storm continued to rage, Miller asked two of the older students, Bryan Untiedt and Clara Smith, to go for help.[4] They walked some distance, but they were too cold and had to turn around.[3] The occupants continued to jump around and dance to stay warm, even through the night. The next morning, the blizzard continued. Miller made the decision then to go find help. He told the older kids to continue to exercise and then left. Soon after he left, 13-year-old Mary Louise Stonebraker was the first child to die.[3] Later that second day (March 27), some of the fathers, Bud Untiedt, Ernie Johnson, and Dave Stonebraker, left their homes to find the students. Finding the school empty, they then searched the nearby area. By the evening, the storm was breaking, and Untiedt and Stonebraker found the stranded school bus. Temperatures dropped as low as \u221220\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221229\u00a0\u00b0C), with 70 miles per hour (110\u00a0km/h) winds.[5] Upon entering the bus, they found the 17 living students; two more, 7-year-old Kenneth Johnson and 11-year-old Robert \"Bobbie\" Brown, had died on the bus. Loading the kids onto a wagon, they took them to Andy and Fern Reinert's farmhouse, reaching the house around 5 p.m.[3] That night, two more students died, Mary Louise Miller, the bus driver's daughter, and Arlo Untiedt, both 8 years old. The students had been on the bus over 30 hours. Miller's body was found on Saturday, March 28, 1931, frozen, 3.5 miles (5.6\u00a0km) away from the school bus.[1][3] His hands were bloody from using a barbed wire fence to find help."

The tragedy did cause reform in school buses and schools, such as adding two-way radios to all buses, and Colorado mandated all schools have a telephone.[4] A marker is located in the Holly Cemetery in Holly, Colorado. In addition, a memorial, called the Pleasant Hill Memorial, is located alongside Kiowa County Road 78.

In Taiwan 26 were killed and four were reported missing. Some 126 houses collapsed and 453 others were damaged. Electricity and water supplies to 100,000 people were cut off. Flood-related damages contributed to an estimate of more than 4 billion New Taiwan dollars (1994\u00a0NT$). Super Typhoon Doug then took on a north to northeast track over the East China Sea after sweeping across northern Taiwan and started to weaken. Doug weakened to a severe tropical storm on August 9 and was downgraded to a tropical storm further on August 10. Over the next couple of days, Doug made a clockwise loop over the Yellow Sea before making landfall over Shanghai on August 11. Doug became extratropical later that day.

An area of disturbed weather developed on November 5 near the International Date Line. For more than two weeks, the disturbance failed to develop appreciably while it tracked generally westward. The disturbance began to organize on November 17. Four days later, the disturbance was designated a tropical depression, and on November 22, the depression was classified as a tropical storm. After resuming a westward course, Page intensified into a typhoon on November 24. Page then entered a period of rapid deepening before plateauing in intensity early on November 26. Page turned northwest, north, and later northeast as it rounded a subtropical ridge. Because of the change in steering, Page began to encounter stronger wind shear, which resulted in a prolonged weakening trend. On November 30, Page, just offshore Honshu, weakened below typhoon intensity, and became an extratropical cyclone on the same day after making landfall in central Honshu. Typhoon Page was the record sixth tropical cyclone to directly affect Japan that year. It also was the latest typhoon to hit the country, with the previous mark set by Typhoon Agnes of the 1948 Pacific typhoon season. In Tokyo, 61 homes were damaged and 16 were destroyed. Elsewhere, in Mie Prefecture, 276 homes were damaged and 9 other homes were destroyed. Overall, four fatalities were reported and twelve others suffered injuries. A total of 162 homes were destroyed while 1,544 other houses were flooded. Nearly 35 hectares (86 acres) of farmland were damaged.

Poorly organized,[2] the disturbance then briefly turned west-northwest[3] under the influence of a subtropical ridge. Convection organization improved, and on November 17, Dvorak classifications reached T1.5/30\u00a0mph (50\u00a0km/h), which prompted the JTWC to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. The low-level center became better defined overnight in response to decreased wind shear, and on November 19, the JTWC upgraded the disturbance into a tropical depression.[2] The depression executed a counterclockwise loop for the next two days. Meanwhile, organized deep convection quickly developed over the center, and on November 21, the disturbance was upgraded into a tropical depression by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA).[4][nb 1] At that time, the depression was located 580\u00a0km (360\u00a0mi) east-southeast of Yap.[1] At 00:00 UTC on November 22, the JTWC upgraded the depression into Tropical Storm Page.[2] Several hours later, the JMA followed suit.[6][nb 2] Resuming a westward track, Page began to intensify at a faster pace on November 23 due to decreased wind shear.[2] The JMA upgraded Page to a severe tropical storm at 18:00 UTC on November 23.[4] Following the development of a small eye,[2] Page was upgraded into a typhoon twelve hours later by the JTWC, with the JMA following suit on the evening of November 24.[6] Page then entered a period of rapid deepening; the JTWC estimated that during a three-day period the pressure fell to 898\u00a0mbar (26.5\u00a0inHg) and the winds increased by 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph). Based on the appearance of a 75\u00a0km (45\u00a0mi) well-defined eye, Page was declared a super typhoon by the JTWC, the second of the month, at 06:00 UTC on November 26.[2] Six hours later, the JTWC estimated that typhoon attained its highest intensity, with 1-minute sustained winds of 255\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph).[6] Around this time, the JMA also estimated that Page peaked in intensity, with 10-minute sustained winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 910\u00a0mbar (27\u00a0inHg).[4] Typhoon Page, while maintaining peak strength,[2] began to turn northwest on the evening of November 26[1] as it approached a break in the subtropical ridge.[2] The next day, the typhoon turned northward[1] along the 125th meridian east, then accelerated to the northeast as it rounded a ridge. As a result of the change in steering, Page began to encounter stronger wind shear. A loss in eye definition and a decrease in Dvorak estimates led to the JTWC downgrading Page back to a typhoon at 18:00 UTC on November 27.[2] The storm continued to gradually deteriorate, and on November 30, the JMA downgraded Page to a severe tropical storm. Six hours later, the agency declared Page an extratropical cyclone as the storm passed over central Honshu about 130\u00a0km (80\u00a0mi) south of Osaka.[1] However, the JTWC did not downgrade Page into a tropical storm until 12:00 UTC[6] as wind shear continued to take toll on the system. Later that day, the JTWC issued its last warning based on a combination of land interaction with Honshu and extratropical transition.[2] The JMA stopped tracking the extratropical remnants of Page on December 3.[4]"

As the fourteenth named storm of the season, it originated from an area of circulation southeast of Japan by August 11. The following day, the system strengthened into a tropical storm, gaining the name Kathy. Kathy reached typhoon strength on August 13, passing south of Tokyo, approaching the Ryukyu Islands. The typhoon's winds peaked at 165\u00a0km/h (103\u00a0mph) on August 14, before tapering as the storm curved west-southwest.\u200a For the next four days, Kathy and nearby Typhoon Marie began a Fujiwhara interaction, causing both storms to rotate around each other, which ended when Marie was pulled into Kathy's circulation. Between August 15 and August 16, Kathy weakened into a tropical storm, before strengthening back to typhoon status. The storm's west-southwest path brought the center across the Ryukyu Islands and near Okinawa on August 16 as Kathy began to execute a loop in its track. Two days later, Kathy's winds were estimated by the JTWC to be around 215\u00a0km/h (134\u00a0mph). The typhoon's track made a smaller loop on August 20, before heading northwards. On August 23, Kathy made landfall in Japan with winds of 130\u00a0km/h (81\u00a0mph) and weakened to a tropical storm. It then curved northeast.\u200a On August 25, Kathy transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and continued northeast, reaching the Bering Strait on September 1.

One of them, southwest of Nashville, was an F5 tornado\u2014one of only two (the only official one) ever recorded in the state (the other, unofficial however, being in Pinson, Tennessee in 1923). That tornado remained mainly in rural areas of Wayne and Lawrence counties.[1] Other tornadoes during the 2-day outbreak struck Arkansas, Alabama, Illinois, and Kentucky. 12 people were killed by tornadoes during the outbreak: two in Arkansas, three in Kentucky, and seven in Tennessee (one in Nashville, three in Wayne County, and three more elsewhere).

A very strong low pressure system developed across the central part of North America and was associated with a long cold front. Ahead of the storm, the warm moist air generated from the Gulf of Mexico increased the likelihood for a significant weather event. On April 15, activity developed across the Mid-Mississippi Valley and southern Ohio Valley where several tornadoes touched down in Illinois starting in the late afternoon before moving into Arkansas during the overnight hours where the first fatalities were reported.[citation needed] On April 16, as the main low-pressure system was near the Great Lakes and its cold front crossing the Mississippi River, dew points reached the mid to upper 60s across the Tennessee Valley while later in the day, CAPE values reached 1600 J/kg while dry air intrusion was also on the rise increasing the threat of severe weather across the area. As the bulk of the supercells moved out of Arkansas, the tornadic activity was slower during the morning hours before re-intensifying west of Nashville early in the afternoon. Major tornadoes struck from southern Tennessee to southern Kentucky with additional storms as far north as Michigan and several other storms in Alabama across Walker and Cullman Counties, which was slightly north of the areas that were hardest hit by the previous outbreak.[citation needed]"

The tornado manifested itself as a large area of rapidly rotating rain curtains and dark clouds, rather than a traditional funnel. After crossing the Cumberland River, it passed through East Nashville, Donelson, and Hermitage before finally lifting northwest of Lebanon in extreme northern Wilson County. An ROTC student from Vanderbilt University was trapped under a fallen tree in Centennial Park and later died from his injuries. The tornado blew many windows out of office buildings. Many large buildings, including skyscrapers, were damaged. The TPAC building had over 100 windows blown out. 30 small airplanes were damaged at Cornelia Fort Airport. 35 total buildings in downtown Nashville were deemed structurally unsound after the tornado. The tornado blew down 3 construction cranes on the construction site of the Tennessee Oilers' football stadium near the Cumberland River, before crossing the river. Many signs were downed throughout downtown as well.[1] The tornado continued east and hit the residential section of East Nashville. At least 300 homes were damaged in East Nashville, many of which lost a good part of their roofs, with a few destroyed. Trees were uprooted and telephone poles were knocked down in this area. A nursing home was hit and all the residents had to be evacuated. A church, which was well over 100 years old, received major damage. It then re-crossed the Cumberland River, where more trees were downed and more homes and other buildings were damaged across Donelson and Hermitage. Over a thousand trees were blown down at Andrew Jackson's home, The Hermitage. Some of those trees were well over 200 years old, with a few having been planted by Andrew Jackson himself.[1] The tornado moved into Wilson County, downing many trees, power lines, and signs. Several homes suffered mostly roof damage in the area. A baseball field and a lumber yard were damaged in Mt. Juliet. Part of the roof was taken off a bank in Mt. Juliet as well. The tornado then continued across rural Wilson County and produced sporadic damage before it dissipated just south of the Cumberland River in extreme northern Wilson County.[1] A 2013 reanalysis noted that tornado would have likely been rated EF2 if the Enhanced Fujita Scale was operational at that time. Nearly 22 years later, a long-tracked high-end EF3 tornado passed just north of Downtown Nashville just after midnight on March 3, 2020. That tornado moved along a more easterly path that intersected with the path of this tornado in East Nashville. It then continued east along Interstate 40 through Wilson and Smith counties. That tornado killed five people, injured 220, and caused $1.504 billion in damage, making it the 6th costliest tornado in US history.[4][5][6]"

There were 21 injuries, however. It did not significantly affect any towns along its 19.3 miles (31.1\u00a0km) path. However, many large and well-built homes with anchor bolts were completely leveled with some swept clean from their foundations, and vehicles were thrown hundreds of yards. One truck was rumored to have been taken about 20 miles (32\u00a0km), though this was never confirmed. A 200-foot section of grass was scoured away at a pasture, leaving only bare soil behind. Clumps of dirt were pulled up as well. Many trees and power lines were downed as well as 75 utility poles. Some of the trees were completely debarked, and several livestock were killed as well.[8] It is the most recent Tennessee F5/EF5 and only official one as the March 11, 1923 Pinson tornado took place before the introduction of the Fujita scale and before records were officially kept.[8] This tornado originally extended from Hardin County southeast of Savannah through Wayne, Lawrence, Giles, and Maury counties as one long-track F5. A 2013 reanalysis determined there were three separate tornadoes with distinct path breaks. The first tornado was rated high-end F4 in Hardin and Wayne counties. The second was the F5 tornado in Lawrence County, and the third, another rated F4, tracked from northern Lawrence through Giles and Maury counties.

The storm also caused flash flooding in the area of WKU's main campus. The damage from the hail was so great that it seemed to overshadow the F3 tornado event happening in the southern part of the county, which was more rural. The tornado then moved into Barren County actually crossing a bend in the northern portion of Barren River Lake near the small town of Lucas. The tornado then would pass just south of downtown Glasgow and cross the Cumberland Parkway just west of the Barren/Metcalfe county line. It would then dissipate right at that county line. An F2 was later spawned by this supercell in Metcalfe County, crossing the Cumberland Parkway in the western part of the county and passing just to the south of the county seat, Edmonton."

East of Funing, the tornado caused damage in the village of Wutanzhen before dissipating.[5] Thousands of well-built masonry-construction homes were heavily damaged or destroyed along the path, with many completely leveled. Manufacturing plants, businesses, and rice mills suffered from similar destruction, and multiple large factory buildings were severely damaged at a Canadian Solar plant. Two large school buildings were heavily damaged as well, and multiple large, multi-ton metal shipping containers were lofted and thrown hundreds of yards by the tornado.[6] Structural debris was scattered long distances throughout the damage path, many vehicles were tossed hundreds of yards and mangled; trees were completely denuded and debarked; and numerous metal power line pylons and truss towers were bent and crumpled to the ground.[7] Wind speeds of up to 125 kilometers per hour (78\u00a0mph) were measured at a weather station in Funing as the tornado passed near the area.[5] First responders reported bodies strewn across devastated communities.[8] Damages were calculated at nearly CN\u00a55 billion (US$760 million).[9] As the supercell continued past Funing, it produced another tornado of unknown intensity that destroyed several buildings and killed one person in the Sheyang area.[10]"

Less canopy is provided in the aftermath of a wildfire, hence soil temperatures may rise, rendering the area uninhabitable by certain species and allow new, non-native species to thrive.[8] When soil temperatures rise, permafrost is also revealed and begins to melt away, which can lead to landslides and erosion.[8]"

The nineteenth typhoon and final super typhoon of the 1991 Pacific typhoon season, Yuri was a tropical disturbance that strengthened into a tropical depression on November 22 in the Philippine Sea.[1] Moving rather slowly at first, the system continued to intensify, and was given the name Yuri. It had become a severe tropical storm about 1,480\u00a0kilometers east of Truk Island and took on a west-northwestward track at 22\u00a0km/h. Typhoon intensity was attained that night when Yuri was 1,050\u00a0km. Yuri turned more to the west on 26 November and reached peak intensity the following morning packing winds of over 220\u00a0km/h near its centre. Moving northwestwards at 30\u00a0km/h, Yuri passed 140\u00a0km to the south-southwest of Guam on the evening of November 27. After recurving November 29, Yuri accelerated northeastwards on November 30 and weakened to a severe tropical storm that night. By the morning of December 1, it had degenerated into a tropical storm about a few hundred kilometers east-northeast of Iwo Jima. Extratropical transition was completed soon afterward, and the storm's remnants persisted until December 3.[1] Although Yuri never directly made landfall, it still had managed to cause $3\u00a0million (1991\u00a0USD) in damage to Pohnpei, including the loss of a radio tower. In Guam, the storm caused extensive beach erosion and destroyed between 60 and 350 buildings. There, damage totaled $33\u00a0million (1991\u00a0USD).[2] It is one of the most closely observed storms ever; its eye was studied for research."

The rapid development of thunderstorm activity near the Marshall Islands on November\u00a016 prompted the Joint Typhoon Warning Center\u00a0(JTWC) to monitor the area for signs of development. The disturbance tracked slowly in a counter-clockwise loop over the next few days as it slowly organized,[3] and at 0000\u00a0UTC on November\u00a022, the Japan Meteorological Agency\u00a0(JMA) classified the system as a tropical depression,[4] with the JTWC following suit about a day later. Upon becoming classified as a tropical cyclone, the system underwent explosive intensification, reaching tropical storm strength based on the Dvorak technique on November\u00a023. Yuri later reached typhoon intensity at 1200\u00a0UTC on November\u00a024 located roughly 335\u00a0km (208\u00a0mi) east of Pohnpei while exhibiting an eye.[3] At 0540\u00a0UTC on November\u00a025, Yuri passed 85\u00a0km (53\u00a0mi) north of Pohnpei with winds of 140\u00a0km/h (87\u00a0mph).[4] During this time, the typhoon began a phase of unimpeded and steady intensification, contrary to most intense typhoons which typically strengthen dramatically in rapid deepening. Concurrently, Yuri expanded in size, reaching a maximum diameter of 600\u00a0km (370\u00a0mi) at one point.[3] At 0000\u00a0UTC on November\u00a027, the JMA assessed the storm to have reached its peak intensity with 10-minute maximum sustained winds of 220\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 895\u00a0mbar (895\u00a0hPa; 26.4\u00a0inHg).[4] The JTWC analyzed winds at this time to have been equivalent to a Category\u00a05 major hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale (SSHS).[3] Rounding the western periphery of a subtropical ridge, Yuri began to take a more northerly course, bringing it within 100\u00a0km (62\u00a0mi) of Guam on November\u00a027 as a strong typhoon. After passing south of the island, the typhoon weakened but continued to grow in size, reaching an estimated 900\u00a0km (560\u00a0mi) in diameter upon clearing the Northern Mariana Islands. After recurving towards the northeast the storm accelerated and began transitioning into an extratropical cyclone. Yuri weakened below typhoon status early on December\u00a01 shortly before completing the transition.[3] The remnants restrengthened to a powerful hurricane-force cyclone due to baroclinic processes. Continuing to track northward, they were last noted on December\u00a03.[4]"

But Guam was spared the full brunt of Yuri. It missed the island by 50 miles. No deaths were reported from the storm.[7] Nearly all of Guam (ninety percent of the 133,000 residents) remained without water and electricity on November 29, nearly two days after the powerful tropical cyclone passed Guam. 2,500 of the residents that took shelters were crammed into 12 school shelters on November 28.[8] Overall, the storm caused the area $33\u00a0million (1991\u00a0USD).[3]"

After a short development program, the first production 407 (C-FWQY/N407BT) flew on November 10, 1995.[2] The Bell 407 features the four-blade main rotor developed for the OH-58D (Model 406). The blades and hub use composite construction without life limits, and provide better performance and a more comfortable ride. The 407's fuselage is 8 inches (20\u00a0cm) wider, increasing internal cabin space, and includes 35% larger main cabin windows. The more powerful Rolls-Royce/Allison 250-C47 turboshaft allows an increase in Maximum Takeoff Weight and improves performance at hotter temperatures and/or higher altitudes.[3]   The helicopter has standard seating for two crew and five cabin seats.[5] The 407 was certificated by Transport Canada on February 9, 1996, with the FAA following shortly after on February 23.[2][6]  Full production began in 1996 at Bell's Mirabel, Quebec, Canada plant and produced 140 airframes in 1997, to fill the initial orders.[5] In 1995, Bell tested a shrouded tail rotor on the 407,[4] but did not proceed with it. For a time, Bell studied developing the Model 407T twin-engine variant, but instead chose to develop the essentially all-new twin-PW206D powered Bell 427.[3] Bell began deliveries of the 407 in 1996.  The 1,000th helicopter was delivered on June 15, 2010.[2] 1,400+ by Dec 2017,[7] and over 1600 were produced by early 2023.[1]"

The project also served as a fundraiser for the SOS Children's Villages.[15] In 2009 the Iraqi Air Force ordered three Bell 407 armed scout helicopters (similar to the canceled ARH-70).[16] A contract for 24 additional Bell 407s with an option for 26 more was awarded in April of that same year.[17] The U.S. Army is managing modifications and installation of military equipment on the helicopters.[18]  Three training T-407s were delivered to the Iraqi Army in 2010.  Armed IA-407s were delivered in eight batches of three aircraft from August 2012 to April 2013.  The final Bell 407 for Iraq was delivered on 3 April 2013.[19] There are 30 in service; 24 armed scouts, three gunships, and three trainers.[20] Iraq is using the IA-407 in operations against Islamic State militants.  On October 8, 2014, militants shot down an IA-407 using a shoulder-fired ground-to-air missile, killing the pilot and co-pilot.[21][22] In December 2017, more than 1,400 were operating.[7]"

Investigation by the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) found that the tail rotor crosshead drive plate was not bolted to the tail rotor crosshead. The tail rotor had been installed the day before; it was suspected that the bolts were not properly torqued.[38] On June 8, 2022 a Bell 407 had an inflight separation of its tail boom while in cruise flight near Kalea, Hawaii. The pilot and two passengers sustained serious injuries, while three other passengers had minor injuries. The helicopter was substantially damaged during the crash. The US NTSB determined that the upper-left tail boom attachment hardware was not installed, leaving only three of four attachment points connected. Wreckage markings indicated that the bolt had been present at one point but had fallen out, resulting in progressive fatigue cracking. The NTSB requested immediate action from the US FAA and Transport Canada in the form of an urgent airworthiness directive.[39][40]"

An Army helicopter crew was credited with saving homes near Selah by dumping water.[13] The Soap Lake Fire in early June grew to 2,000 acres (810\u00a0ha) and triggered level 3 evacuations in Grant County.[14] The Ryegrass Coulee Fire on July 9\u201310 burned 1,600 acres, closed 20 miles of Interstate 90 in both directions for most of a day, and forced the complete evacuation of Vantage, Washington. It was the first of the state's fire season to trigger a level three evacuation or a road closure. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) released funds, saying that \"the fire threatened such destruction as would constitute a major disaster\".[15][16][17] The Little Camas Fire at 47\u00b025\u203226\u2033N 120\u00b033\u203240\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff47.424\u00b0N 120.561\u00b0W\ufeff / 47.424; -120.561\ufeff (Little Camas Fire), in the Cascades south of Leavenworth, Washington, started on July 5 and reached over 300 acres. It caused the evacuation of a bible camp. Over 440 firefighters and three helicopters were sent to contain it.[18][19] The Vulcan Mountain Fire at Vulcan Mountain in Ferry County grew to over 20 acres around July 13, before being contained.[20][21] Smoke conditions in mid July were judged as good, in contrast to the 2017 season which had Seattle blanketed in smoke and ash around the same time due to fires in British Columbia, Eastern Washington and Oregon.[11] The Rocky Reach Fire at 47\u00b032\u203210\u2033N 120\u00b017\u203231\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff47.536\u00b0N 120.292\u00b0W\ufeff / 47.536; -120.292\ufeff (Rocky Reach Fire), near Wenatchee, started on Friday, July 13 and reached over 3,386 acres (1,370\u00a0ha) before being contained.[22] The Boylston Fire started on July 19 again shut down I-90 east of Ellensburg for 24 hours. It burned 80,000 acres, mostly on the Yakima Training Center, caused level three \"leave now\" evacuations, and destroyed five buildings while being fought by three fixed-wing aircraft and two helicopters. Military personnel and equipment to fight the fire were sent from Fairchild Air Force Base in Spokane and Joint Base Lewis-McChord in the Puget Sound Area.[23][24][25] The smoke caused \"unhealthy\" air conditions in Spokane on July 20.[26] The Upriver Beacon Fire in Spokane County, on the Spokane city/county border at 47\u00b041\u203238\u2033N 117\u00b018\u203254\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff47.694\u00b0N 117.315\u00b0W\ufeff / 47.694; -117.315\ufeff (Upriver Beacon Fire),[27] caused the evacuation of 800 homes and evacuation warnings for thousands more on July 18.

Nearly all local fire agencies including cities of Spokane, Spokane Valley and Spokane County, and out-of-area fire aircraft, responded.[28] The Cougar Creek Fire at 47\u00b040\u203252\u2033N 120\u00b013\u203201\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff47.681\u00b0N 120.217\u00b0W\ufeff / 47.681; -120.217\ufeff (Cougar Creek Fire) near Entiat started on July 28 as the result of lightning.[29] Forest recreation users were told to leave.[30] Smoke from fires in Siberia was visible over southern British Columbia in late July and was assessed to be a possible health impact to Washington residents.[31] On July 29, the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency stated the Puget Sound region would experience \"moderate air quality at times with some upper level smoke making for pretty sunsets. This smoke comes from distant fires, mostly originating from Siberia.\"[32] On July 30, University of Washington meteorology professor Cliff Mass noted the progressively more smoky situation in Seattle from Siberian wildfires, and said a \"smoke front\" from California's Carr Fire would arrive before sunset.[33] Parts of Goat Rocks Wilderness were closed for the month of September in response to the Miriam Fire at 46\u00b036\u203258\u2033N 121\u00b020\u203210\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff46.616\u00b0N 121.336\u00b0W\ufeff / 46.616; -121.336\ufeff (Miriam Fire), reported July 30 as the result of lightning.[34] 400 campers were evacuated.[35] The Milepost 90 Fire in the Columbia Gorge near Wishram, Washington started on July 31 and reached over 11,000 acres (4,500\u00a0ha) by August 1. Level 2 and level 3 evacuation orders were issued near Wishram.[36] Almost 20 miles of State Route 14 were closed in both directions.[37] On August 3, it burned 14,500 acres (5,900\u00a0ha) and 85% contained.[38] Crescent Mountain and Gilbert Fires at 48\u00b027\u203204\u2033N 120\u00b034\u203244\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff48.451\u00b0N 120.579\u00b0W\ufeff / 48.451; -120.579\ufeff (Crescent Mountain Fire) near Twisp began with lightning on July 29 and grew quickly to over 100 acres (40\u00a0ha) by August 1, driven by evening downslope wind. Four helicopters and other equipment were assigned and smokejumpers sent in to the rough terrain. Hikers and campers were told to leave.[39] Crescent Mountain Fire increased to 7,671 acres (3,104\u00a0ha) by August 5.[40] It was controlled as of October 22, 2018 and burned a total 52,000 acres.[41] The Maple Fire at 47\u00b034\u203252\u2033N 123\u00b007\u203252\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff47.581\u00b0N 123.131\u00b0W\ufeff / 47.581; -123.131\ufeff (Maple Fire) near the Hamma Hamma River on the Olympic Peninsula sent smoke towards Seattle on August 7.[42][43] The fire was caused by illegal logging, and burned 3,300 acres (13\u00a0km2).

The Yankee Hill area was evacuated near midnight, and though firefighters were able to protect the majority of homes several dozen structures were still lost.[7] By 9:00\u00a0a.m. on September 7 the Poe Fire had burned 6,168 acres (2,496\u00a0ha). On its western edge, the fire jumped Highway 70 near Lunt Road, but firefighters were able to contain the slop-over.[6] During the day conditions remained dire\u2014at 3:00\u00a0p.m. the Burning Index was 185, roughly correlating to flame lengths of 18.5 feet (5.6\u00a0m), and the Ignition Component was 100 percent, meaning that a firebrand would be certain to ignite a new fire if it landed in fuel\u2014but the fire grew much less.[7] By 7:00\u00a0p.m. on the 7th the Poe Fire was 6,580 acres (2,660\u00a0ha) and 20 percent contained, having destroyed more than two dozen homes as firefighters worked to stop flames from jumping Lake Oroville and threatening populated areas near Paradise.[7][8][6] On September 8 the fire remained 20 percent contained, and the number of firefighters on the incident increased as crews demobilized from the Darby Fire in Calaveras County.[9] By the next afternoon the Poe Fire had reached 7,800 acres (3,200\u00a0ha) and 50 percent containment, with more than 1,500 firefighters working.[10] The fire primarily moved east, working along the bottoms of the river canyons, and firefighters welcomed improved weather conditions that brought lower temperatures and winds with higher humidity.[11] By the night of September 10 the fire was more than 8,000 acres (3,200\u00a0ha) and 80 percent contained, with peak firefighter staffing at 2,100. The last remaining section of uncontained fire was moving east, between Big Bend Road and the Feather River.[12] By September 11 the fire was 8,149 acres (3,298\u00a0ha) and 95 percent contained.[13] Aircraft fighting the Poe Fire that day were temporarily prevented from flying because of the ground stop order issued nationwide in response to the deadly September 11 attacks in New York, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania. The National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) eventually instructed firefighting agencies to apply for exemptions through the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as needed, and at least one of the aircraft on the Poe Fire was equipped with a special transponder code that broadcast its \"friendly\" status.[14] The restriction began at about 10:00\u00a0a.m. and was in force for about three hours, when the FAA granted Cal Fire's request for exemption.[15] In the meantime, stunned firefighters kept abreast of events, including the deaths of hundreds of their colleagues in New York, via portable televisions and radios as well as a large-screen television brought into base camp.[16] The Poe Fire was declared 100 percent contained on September 12,[17] though firefighters continued to quench hot spots and used controlled burns to burn off vegetation between the fire itself and its containment lines.[18]"

Congressional representative Wally Herger urged the governor to declare a disaster,[25] and the Butte County board of supervisors appealed the decision.[24] The Butte County Office of Emergency Services said that they lacked enough money to even remove debris from the fire, and that the fire had destroyed 43 wells and created a water shortage in the \"financially distressed\" county.[25] Eventually, at the governor's request, the federal Small Business Administration declared Butte County a disaster area, making low-interest federal loans available to victims of the Poe Fire there.[26] Butte County also waived all fees associated with reconstruction from damage from the fire.[27]"

The address of this building was 2 World Trade Center, with the WTC complex having its own ZIP code of 10048. The South Tower was destroyed along with the North Tower in the September 11 attacks. At 9:03 a.m,[b] seventeen minutes after its twin was hit, the South Tower was struck by United Airlines Flight 175. Although it was the second of the two skyscrapers to be hit by a hijacked airliner, it was the first to collapse, at 9:59 a.m.,[c] after burning for 56 minutes. Of the 2,977 victims killed in the attacks, around 1,000 were in the South Tower or on the ground. The new 2 World Trade Center, which is currently on hold, is planned to have a diagonally-pointed roof, with no observation deck, and no mechanical floors.

His original plan called for the towers to be 80 stories tall,[11] but to meet the Port Authority's requirement for 10,000,000 square feet (930,000\u00a0m2) of office space, the buildings would each have to be 110 stories tall.[12] Yamasaki's design for the World Trade Center, unveiled to the public on January 18, 1964, called for a square plan approximately 208 feet (63\u00a0m) in dimension on each side.[11][13] In March 1965, the Port Authority began acquiring property at the World Trade Center site.[14] Demolition work began on March 21, 1966,[15] and groundbreaking for the construction of the World Trade Center took place on August 5, 1966.[16] In January 1967, the Port Authority awarded $74\u00a0million in contracts to various steel suppliers.[17] Construction on the South Tower was under way by January 1969.[18] The topping out ceremony for 2\u00a0WTC (the South Tower) occurred on July 19, 1971.[18] The South Tower began accepting tenants in January 1972,[19] and a ribbon cutting ceremony took place on April 4, 1973.[20]"

The fuel from the planes burned at most for a few minutes, but the contents of the buildings burned over the next hour to hour and a half.[32] The fires might not have been as centrally positioned, nor as intense, had traditionally heavy high-rise construction been standing in the way of the aircraft. Debris and fuel would likely have remained mostly outside the buildings or concentrated in more peripheral areas away from the building cores, which would then not have become unique failure points. In this scenario, the towers might have stood far longer, perhaps indefinitely.[33][34] The fires were hot enough to weaken the columns and cause floors to sag, pulling perimeter columns inward and reducing their ability to support the mass of the building above.[35] The South Tower collapsed at 9:59\u00a0a.m. after burning for 56\u00a0minutes in the fire caused by the impact of United Airlines Flight 175 and the explosion of its fuel.[31]"

Its rooftop observation deck was 1,362\u00a0ft (415\u00a0m) high and its indoor observation deck was 1,310\u00a0ft (400\u00a0m) high.[41] Each tower stood over 1,350 feet (410\u00a0m) high, and occupied about 1 acre (4,000\u00a0m2) of the total 16 acres (65,000\u00a0m2) of the site's land.[42]"

The core of each tower was a rectangular area 87 by 135\u00a0feet (27 by 41\u00a0m), and contained 47 steel columns running from the bedrock to the top of the tower.[51] The South Tower's structural core was oriented with the long axis north to south.[52] The core columns supported about half the towers' weight.[52]  All elevators were located in the core. Each building had three stairwells, also in the core, except on the mechanical floors.[47] The large, column-free space between the perimeter and core was bridged by prefabricated floor trusses, which connected to the perimeter columns.[53] Hat trusses (or \"outrigger truss\") located from the 107th floor to the top of the North and South towers were designed to support a tall communication antenna on top of each building.[53] The South Tower never had an antenna fitted.[54] The framed-tube design using steel core and perimeter columns protected with sprayed-on fire resistant material created a relatively lightweight structure that would sway more in response to the wind.[55] In designing the World Trade Center, Leslie Robertson considered the scenario of the impact of a jet airliner crashing into the building.[56] The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) found a three-page white paper that mentioned another aircraft impact analysis, involving impact of a jet at 600\u00a0mph (970\u00a0km/h), was indeed considered, but NIST could not locate the documentary evidence of the aircraft impact analysis.[57] Sprayed-fire resistant materials (SFRMs), gypsum wallboard, and vermiculite were used to provide fireproofing to the interiors.[47] More fireproofing was added after a fire in February 1975,[58] but after the 1993 bombing, inspections found fireproofing to be deficient.[59] The 1968 New York City building codes did not require sprinklers for high-rise buildings, except for underground spaces,[60] but the entire complex was retrofitted by 2001.[61]"

A southbound street-level stop for the SL5 route of the bus rapid transit Silver Line is outside fare control. The station has two island platforms; each has one disused track, making them effectively side platforms. Boylston is not accessible for Green Line trains. Boylston station was opened in 1897 as part of the original segment of the Tremont Street subway. Originally used by streetcars, from 1901 to 1908 it also served Main Line Elevated trains. Unlike other Green Line stations, Boylston has been little modified, and retains much of its original appearance. Two of the original four headhouses have been removed, however, and a sub-passage connecting the platforms has been sealed. Construction of a proposed underground Silver Line station was proposed in the 1990s; that phase of the project was cancelled in 2010."

The two outer tracks formerly led to the Pleasant Street incline. A stub of the former outer southbound track is used for work car storage. The northbound track has been fully removed; a disconnected segment of track holds two former streetcars for display. The cars (PCC #3295 and Type 5 #5734) were used for fan trips until 1990 and 1998.[2] The Green Line takes a sharp right-angle turn just south of Boylston station, as it turns from Tremont Street onto Boylston Street.  The tight radius of curvature of the track frequently causes loud squealing noises to emit from the train wheels, which are audible at street level near the station entrance at the corner. In 2017, the Green Line added 6 greasing units to the existing 13 in the system; these devices pump grease onto train wheels and the rail as trains pass them. The MBTA also retrofitted flange stick lubricators on newer trains, which scrape graphite onto the side of the wheel and do not affect braking.[3] However in 2018, journalism students from adjacent Emerson College measured sound intensities over 110 dBA in the station.[4]"

        "header": "History",
        "content": "Boylston and Park Street were the first two stations built in the Tremont Street subway. The subway was constructed between 1895 and 1897, and first broke ground on the site of the current Boylston station. When the station opened in 1897, it became the first underground rapid transit station in the United States.[5] Boylston and Park Street were built with rectangular stone headhouses designed by Edmund M. Wheelwright that did not aesthetically match the Common. Unlike the interior decor, the headhouses were sharply criticized as \"resembling mausoleums\" and \"pretentiously monumental\".[6][7] Later stations on the East Boston Tunnel and Washington Street Tunnel incorporated this criticism into their more modest headhouses.[6] As opened, the inner tracks at Boylston ran between the Public Garden incline to the west and the inner loop at Park Street, while the outer tracks ran between the Pleasant Street incline to the south and the outer through tracks at Park Street. Most streetcars from the west looped at Park Street, while those from the south continued through to North Station.[8]:\u200a23\u200a From 1901 to 1908, Main Line Elevated trains ran on the outer tracks (with temporary high-level wood platforms) while streetcars continued to use the inner tracks.[8]:\u200a37 The Boylston Street incline (replacing the Public Garden incline) and Boylston Street subway opened on October 3, 1914, both using the inner tracks. On October 10, the fence dividing the northbound platform was opened, allowing passengers from the west to transfer to northbound streetcars from the south.[9] On October 9, 1915, the fence was again closed, forcing passengers from the west to transfer at Park Street (after cars from the south had dropped off many passengers) rather than at Boylston Street.[10] The 1947 state act that created the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) from the Boston Elevated Railway established four immediate projects for the new agency, one of which was expansion of the Tremont Street Subway to four tracks between Park Street and Scollay Square.[11] As part of the plan, Park Street and Boylston stations were to be combined into a single Boston Common station, with a direct entrance from an underground parking garage.[12] The garage ultimately opened in 1961, but the stations were not combined.[13] The exit-only north headhouse on the southbound platform was removed in 1958, followed by its northbound twin around 1962.[14][15][16]:\u200a22\u200a On November 19, 1961, the Lenox Street line was substituted with buses.[17]:\u200a167\u200a A shuttle service was run between Boylston and Pleasant Street until April 6, 1962, at which time the outer tracks at Boylston were closed.[17]:\u200a171\u200a In 1964, the Tremont Street subway, including Boylston station, was designated a National Historic Landmark. Of the two original stations, Boylston retained more of its original appearance, having undergone only minimal changes in over a century of continuous operation.[7] The sub-passage between the platforms was closed around 1968, and permanently sealed off in 1981.[16]:\u200a22\u200a In 1974, local students installed nine colorful panels in the station as part of the MBTA's arts program.[18] The northbound outer track was removed in 1983.[16]:\u200a22\u200a A planned renovation in 1986 was deferred due to the station's historic status, though the disused outer tracks were fenced off.[16]:\u200a22\u200a The MBTA again planned a renovation of the station \u2013 including elevators for accessibility \u2013 in 1990, but did not construct the project.[19] In mid-2006, the MBTA installed brighter lighting at Boylston station, as well as modern electronic faregates and fare vending machines for the CharlieCard system. Plans for the South Boston Piers Transitway (later part of the Silver Line) were approved in 1993, calling for a bus rapid transit level at Boylston under the Green Line level.[20] This portion was deferred in 1999, to become Phase III of the project.[21]:\u200a25\u200a Silver Line service on the surface, running on Tremont Street, began stopping at Boylston in December 2001.[22] After substantial increases in projected cost, Phase III was cancelled in 2010.[23] In 2019, the MBTA indicated that Boylston was a \"Tier II\" accessibility priority pending the results of conceptual design.[24]"

Illuminating gas had been escaping from an underground main for two months into the cavity between the station's roof and the street above, before a horse-drawn trolley caused a spark which ignited the gas.  Witnesses reported that a fireball engulfed the trolley, and burned several people and horses instantaneously. Six people were killed, and at least sixty were seriously injured. The station was spared any serious damage, as much of the force of the blast had radiated upward.[25] On June 6, 1906, there was another explosion at Boylston station.[26] The origin of the explosion was deemed to be the short-circuiting of the overhead lines in the station,  which began to burn and catch fire.[26] Because of the electrical nature of the fire, spraying water to stop the flames failed, and fire-fighters who attempted to do so were met with electric shocks. Only three people were injured, and the fire extinguished itself.[26] On August 4, 1958, a fire in the fuse box of a streetcar at Boylston injured 23 people.[27]"

        "content": " Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Known for her autobiographical songwriting, artistic reinventions, cultural impact and fandom, Swift is a leading figure in popular music and the subject of widespread public interest. Swift signed with Big Machine Records in 2005, starting as a country pop singer with her first two albums Taylor Swift (2006) and Fearless (2008). Their singles \"Teardrops on My Guitar\", \"Love Story\", and \"You Belong with Me\" were crossover successes on country and pop radio formats. She experimented with rock on Speak Now (2010) and electronic on Red (2012), later recalibrating her image from country to pop music with the synth-pop album 1989 (2014). The ensuing media scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-imbued Reputation (2017); the albums contained the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\", \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", \"Bad Blood\", and \"Look What You Made Me Do\". Shifting to Republic Records in 2018, Swift released the electropop album Lover (2019) and the autobiographical documentary Miss Americana (2020). She explored indie folk styles in the 2020 sister-albums Folklore and Evermore and subdued pop genres on Midnights (2022) and The Tortured Poets Department (2024), while also re-recording four of her albums under the (Taylor's Version) subtitle,[a] after an ownership dispute with Big Machine. The albums garnered the U.S. number one songs \"Cruel Summer\", \"Cardigan\", \"Willow\", \"All Too Well\", \"Anti-Hero\", \"Is It Over Now?\", and \"Fortnight\" in the 2020s. Her sixth concert tour, the Eras Tour (2023\u201a\u00c4\u00ec2024), and its accompanying concert film are respectively the highest-grossing tour and concert film of all time; Swift became the first billionaire with music as the main source of income and the highest-grossing female touring act. Swift is one of the world's best-selling music artists with an estimated global sale of 200 million records. Seven of her albums have opened with over one million pure sales in a week. She has been listed amongst history's greatest artists by publications such as Rolling Stone, Billboard, and Forbes, as well as the only individual from the arts to have been named the Time Person of the Year (2023). Her accolades include 14 Grammy Awards, a Primetime Emmy Award, 40 American Music Awards, 39 Billboard Music Awards, and 30 MTV Video Music Awards; she has won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year and the IFPI Global Recording Artist of the Year at least four times each."

        "content": "Taylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989, in West Reading, Pennsylvania, United States.[1] She is named after singer-songwriter James Taylor.[2] Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, was a stockbroker for Merrill Lynch, and her mother, Andrea Gardner Swift (n\u221a\u00a9e\u00a0Finlay), worked as a mutual fund marketing executive briefly.[3] Swift's younger brother, Austin, is an actor.[4] Their maternal grandmother, Marjorie Finlay (n\u221a\u00a9e\u00a0Moehlenkamp), was an opera singer,[5] whose singing in church became one of Swift's earliest memories of music that shaped her career.[3] The siblings are of Scottish, English, and German descent, with distant Italian and Irish ancestry.[6][7][8] Swift spent her early years on a Christmas tree farm in Pennsylvania that her father had purchased from one of his clients,[9] and she spent her summers at her family's vacation home in Stone Harbor, New Jersey, where she occasionally performed acoustic songs at a local coffee shop.[10] She is a Christian[11] and attended preschool and kindergarten at a Montessori school run by the Bernardine Sisters of St. Francis before transferring to the Wyndcroft School.[12][13] When her family moved to Wyomissing, she attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School.[14][15] As a child, she performed in Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions[16] and traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons.[17] Her early love for country music was influenced by Shania Twain, Patsy Cline, LeAnn Rimes, and the Dixie Chicks,[13] and she spent weekends performing at local festivals and events.[18][19] After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, she became determined to pursue a country-music career in Nashville, Tennessee.[20] At 11, Swift traveled to Nashville with her mother to visit record labels and submit demo tapes of Dolly Parton and Dixie Chicks karaoke covers.[21] She was rejected by all the labels, which led her to focus on songwriting.[22] She started learning the guitar at 12 with the help of Ronnie Cremer, a computer repairman and local musician who also assisted Swift with writing an original song.[23] In 2003, Swift and her parents started working with the talent manager Dan Dymtrow. With his help, Swift modeled for Abercrombie & Fitch and had an original song included on a Maybelline compilation CD.[24] After performing original songs at an RCA Records showcase, 13-year-old Swift was given an artist development deal and began to travel regularly to Nashville with her mother.[25][26] To help Swift break into the country music scene, her father transferred to Merrill Lynch's Nashville office when she was 14 years old, and the family relocated to Hendersonville, Tennessee.[27][28] Swift attended Hendersonville High School[29] before transferring to Aaron Academy after two years, which better accommodated her touring schedule through homeschooling. She graduated one year early.[30][31]"

        "content": "In Nashville, Swift worked with experienced Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally, and the Warren Brothers[32][33] and formed a lasting working relationship with Liz Rose.[34] They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school.[35] Rose called the sessions \"some of the easiest I've ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She'd write about what happened in school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say. And she'd come in with the most incredible hooks.\" Swift became the youngest artist signed by Sony/ATV Tree Music Publishing,[36] but left then BMG-owned RCA Records (later bought by Sony Music) at the age of 14 due to the label's lack of care and them \"cut[ting] other people's stuff\". She was also concerned that development deals can shelve artists[26][19] and recalled: \"I genuinely felt that I was running out of time. I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through.\"[37] At an industry showcase at Nashville's Bluebird Cafe in 2005, Swift caught the attention of Scott Borchetta, a DreamWorks Records executive who was preparing to form an independent record label, Big Machine Records. She had first met Borchetta in 2004.[39] She was one of Big Machine's first signings,[26] and her father purchased a three-percent stake in the company for an estimated $120,000.[40][41] She began working on her eponymous debut album with Nathan Chapman.[19] Swift wrote or co-wrote all album tracks, and co-writers included Rose, Robert Ellis Orrall, Brian Maher, and Angelo Petraglia.[42] Released in October 2006, Taylor Swift peaked at number five on the United States Billboard 200, on which it spent 157 weeks\u201a\u00c4\u00eethe longest stay on the chart by any release in the US in the 2000s decade.[43][44] Swift became the first female country music artist to write or co-write every track on a platinum-certified debut album.[45] Big Machine Records was still in its infancy during the June 2006 release of the lead single, \"Tim McGraw\", which Swift and her mother helped promote by packaging and sending copies of the CD single to country radio stations.[46] She spent much of 2006 promoting Taylor Swift with a radio tour and television appearances; she opened for Rascal Flatts on select dates during their 2006 tour,[47] as a replacement for Eric Church.[48] Borchetta said that although record industry peers initially disapproved of his signing a 15-year-old singer-songwriter, Swift tapped into a previously unknown market\u201a\u00c4\u00eeteenage girls who listen to country music.[46][27] Following \"Tim McGraw\", four more singles were released throughout 2007 and 2008: \"Teardrops on My Guitar\", \"Our Song\", \"Picture to Burn\", and \"Should've Said No\". All appeared on Billboard's Hot Country Songs, with \"Our Song\" and \"Should've Said No\" reaching number one. \"Our Song\" made Swift the youngest person to single-handedly write and sing a Hot Country Songs number-one single,[49] and \"Teardrops on My Guitar\" was Swift's breakthrough single on mainstream radio and charts.[50][51][52] Swift released two EPs, The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection in October 2007 and Beautiful Eyes in July 2008.[53][54] She promoted her debut album extensively as the opening act for other country musicians' tours in 2006 and 2007, including those by George Strait,[55] Brad Paisley,[56] and Tim McGraw and Faith Hill.[57] Swift won multiple accolades for Taylor Swift. She was one of the recipients of the Nashville Songwriters Association's Songwriter/Artist of the Year in 2007, becoming the youngest person given the title.[58] She also won the Country Music Association's Horizon Award for Best New Artist,[59] the Academy of Country Music Awards' Top New Female Vocalist,[60] and the American Music Awards' Favorite Country Female Artist honor.[61] She was also nominated for Best New Artist at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards.[62] In 2008, she opened for Rascal Flatts again[63] and briefly dated the singer Joe Jonas.[64]"

The controversy made Swift a subject of an online \"cancel\" movement.[153] In late 2016, after briefly dating Tom Hiddleston, Swift began a six-year relationship with Joe Alwyn and retreated herself from the public spotlight.[154][155] In August\u00a02017, Swift successfully countersued David Mueller, a former radio jockey for KYGO-FM, who sued her for damages from loss of employment.

Both peaked atop the Billboard 200, and the former was the first re-recorded album to do so.[195] Fearless (Taylor's Version) was preceded by \"Love Story (Taylor's Version)\", which made Swift the second artist after Dolly Parton to have both the original and re-recorded versions of a song reach number one on Hot Country Songs.[196] Red (Taylor's Version) was supported by \"All Too Well (10 Minute Version)\", which became the longest song in history to top the Hot 100.[197] Swift's tenth studio album, Midnights, was released in October 2022.[198] The album incorporates a restrained electropop[199] and synth-pop sound[200] with elements of hip hop, R&B, and electronica.[198][201] In the US, Midnights was her fifth to open atop the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of over one million copies, and its tracks, led by the single \"Anti-Hero\", made Swift the first artist to monopolize the top 10 of the Hot 100.[202] Globally, the album broke the record for the most single-day streams and most single-week streams on Spotify and peaked atop the charts of at least 14 countries.[203] The album's two further singles, \"Lavender Haze\" and \"Karma\", both peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100.[204] According to Billboard, Swift was the top-earning solo artist in the US and the top-earning musician worldwide of 2021.[205][206] She won six American Music Awards including Artist of the Year in 2022.[207] At the MTV Video Music Awards, Swift won her third and fourth trophies for Video of the Year with All Too Well: The Short Film, her self-directed short film that accompanies \"All Too Well (10 Minute Version)\", in 2022[208] and \"Anti-Hero\" in 2023.[209] During this period, Swift won three Grammy Awards: Best Music Video for All Too Well: The Short Film[210] and Best Pop Vocal Album and Album of the Year for Midnights.

Media outlets extensively covered the tour's cultural and economic impact,[227] and its US leg broke the record for the most tickets sold in a day.[202] Ticketmaster received public and political criticisms for mishandling the tour's ticket sales.[228] The Eras Tour became the highest-grossing tour in history, collecting over $1\u00a0billion.[229] Its concert film, released to theaters worldwide on October 13, 2023, grossed over $250\u00a0million to become the highest-grossing concert film and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Cinematic and Box Office Achievement.[230][231] Swift's eleventh studio album, The Tortured Poets Department, was released on April 19, 2024.[232] Topping charts globally, the album broke a string of records: it marked the first album ever to amass 1\u00a0billion Spotify streams in a week; sold 2.6\u00a0million units in its first week in the US; made Swift the first artist to monopolize the top 14 of the Billboard Hot 100 and the top 10 of Australia's ARIA Singles Chart; and went on to spend 15 weeks atop the Billboard 200\u201a\u00c4\u00eeSwift's longest-running number-one album on the chart. The lead single, \"Fortnight,\" featuring Post Malone, became Swift's 12th number one song on the Hot 100.[233][234][235] After the pandemic, Swift's music releases, touring, and related activities culminated in an unprecedented height of popularity.[236] From 2023 onward, Swift found ubiquitous success, albeit more dominant than before, with the successes of the re-recordings, the Eras Tour, its concert film, Midnights, and The Tortured Poets Department, significantly increasing her net worth; Music Business Worldwide remarked this as a \"new stratosphere of global career success\" for Swift.[237][238] In 2023, she began dating the American football player Travis Kelce,[239] and in 2024, won Artist of the Year at the 2024 iHeartRadio Music Awards.[240] The same year, AI-generated fake pornographic images portraying Swift were posted to Twitter and spread to other social media platforms, spurring criticism and demands for legal reform.[241] In July, Swift and Kelce received death threats from a stalker in Gelsenkirchen, Germany,[242] and three children were killed in a stabbing attack at a Swift-themed workshop in Southport, England, leading to civil unrest in the UK.[243] In August, all three of the Eras Tour concerts in Vienna were canceled following the arrest of two suspects for allegedly planning an Islamic State-inspired terrorist attack in the city. The plan was uncovered by US Intelligence and was thwarted by Austrian police forces.[244]"

She credited her mother with igniting confidence and early songwriting interests by helping her prepare for class presentations.[297][298] She enjoyed Disney film soundtracks and would make up lyrics once she had run out of words singing them.[299] Her lyrical influences include female country songwriters such as Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Tammy Wynette, and Dolly Parton;[18][103] 1990s songwriters such as Melissa Etheridge, Sarah McLachlan, and Alanis Morissette;[300] Joni Mitchell;[301] and Fall Out Boy.[302] She listed Paul McCartney, Bruce Springsteen, Emmylou Harris, and Kris Kristofferson as career role models, citing their both evolving and consistent songwriting outputs.[27][303] Her literary influences include the authors William Shakespeare, Nathaniel Hawthorne, F. Scott Fitzgerald,[304] and the poets William Wordsworth, Robert Frost, and Emily Dickinson;[305] the last of whom was a distant cousin of Swift.[306] In The New Yorker in 2011, Swift said she identifies as a songwriter first: \"I write songs, and my voice is just a way to get those lyrics across\".[27] Her personal experiences were a common inspiration for her early songs, which helped her navigate life.[307][308] Her \"diaristic\" technique began with identifying an emotion, followed by a corresponding melody.[309][310] On her first three studio albums, love, heartbreak, and insecurities, from an adolescent perspective, were dominant themes.[94][311] She delved into the tumult of toxic relationships on Red,[312] and embraced nostalgia and post-romance positivity on 1989.[255] Reputation was inspired by the downsides of Swift's fame,[313] and Lover detailed her realization of the \"full spectrum of love\".[314] Other themes in Swift's music include family dynamics, friendship,[315][316] alienation, self-awareness, and tackling vitriol, especially sexism.[298][317] She often references or draws inspiration from historical events and figures.[318] Swift's confessional lyrics received positive reviews from critics,[319][27][320] who highlighted their vivid details and emotional engagement, which they found uncommon in pop music,[321][322][323] although some perceived her as a fragile, juvenile artist, a label she has consistently challenged.[319] Critics also praised her melodic compositions; Rolling Stone described Swift as \"a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture\".[324][325] NPR dubbed Swift \"a master of the vernacular in her lyrics\",[157] remarking that her songs offer emotional engagement because \"the wit and clarity of her arrangements turn them from standard fare to heartfelt disclosures\".[325] Despite the positive reception, The New Yorker stated she was generally portrayed \"more as a skilled technician than as a Dylanesque visionary\".[27] Tabloid media often speculated and linked the subjects of her songs with her ex-lovers, a practice reviewers and Swift herself criticized as sexist.[326][327][328] Aside from clues in album liner notes, Swift avoided talking about the subjects of her songs.[329] On her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, Swift was inspired by escapism and romanticism to explore fictional narratives.[330] She imposed emotions onto imagined characters and story arcs, which liberated her from tabloid attention and suggested new paths for her artistry.[309] Swift explained that she welcomed the new songwriting direction after she stopped worrying about commercial success.[330] According to Spin, she explored complex emotions with \"precision and devastation\" on Evermore.[331] Consequence stated her 2020 albums convinced skeptics of her songwriting prowess, noting her transformation from \"teenage wunderkind to a confident and careful adult\".[332] Swift divides her writing into three types: \"quill lyrics\", songs rooted in antiquated poeticism; \"fountain pen lyrics\", based on modern and vivid storylines; and \"glitter gel pen lyrics\", which are lively and frivolous.[333] Fans noticed that the fifth track of every Swift album was the most emotionally vulnerable of the album.[334] Awarding her with the Songwriter Icon Award in 2021, the National Music Publishers' Association remarked that \"no one is more influential when it comes to writing music today\".[335] The Week deemed her the foremost female songwriter of modern times,[336] and the Nashville Songwriters Association International named her Songwriter-Artist of the Decade in 2022.[202] Swift has also published two original poems: \"Why She Disappeared\" and \"If You're Anything Like Me\".[337] Swift has been referred to as one of the greatest songwriters ever by several publications.[338][339][340] Literature scholars like Jonathan Bate and Stephanie Burt have noted that her literary and melodic sensibility and writing style are rare among her peers.[341][342] Critic Kitty Empire opined in 2024 that Swift is \"a profoundly old-fashioned artist\", whose songs \"tell a story, in succinct, emotive ways that often scan meticulously\" unlike most pop music of the time; Empire attributed it to Swift's country beginnings.[343] Swift's bridges are often noted as one of the best aspects of her songs,[344][332] earning her the title \"Queen of Bridges\" from Time.[345] Mojo dubbed her \"a sharp narrator with a gift for the extended metaphor\".[346] Academics have variably described her as a poet laureate,[347] philosopher,[348] and bard.[349]"

The 1,499,013-acre (2,342.208\u00a0sq\u00a0mi; 6,066.29\u00a0km2) forest is bordered on the north by British Columbia, on the east by Colville National Forest, on the south by the divide between the Methow and the Stehekin\u2013Lake Chelan valleys, and on the west by North Cascades National Park. The closest significant communities are Omak and Okanogan. Managed by the United States Forest Service together with Wenatchee National Forest, its headquarters are in Wenatchee. There are local ranger district offices located in Tonasket and Winthrop. It is the second-largest national forest (after the Nez Perce National Forest in Idaho) that is contained entirely within one county and largest of which in Washington. Most of the Pasayten Wilderness (excluding its westernmost part, which lies in the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest), and the northeast portion (about 63%)[3] of Lake Chelan-Sawtooth Wilderness are part of the forest, with the balance lying in the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. The western part of the forest is wetter than the dry and less temperate east. The vegetation varies similarly, from the western boreal forest, to the eastern high-elevation steppe.  A 1993 Forest Service study estimated that the extent of old growth in the forest was 316,000 acres (128,000\u00a0ha),[4] a majority of which was lodgepole pine forests.  Wildfires are not uncommon in the Okanogan National Forest.  Notable fires include the 2006 Tripod Complex, the 2014 Carlton Complex and the 2015 Okanogan Complex fires. The Okanogan National Forest was established on July\u00a01, 1911, from a portion of the Chelan National Forest.  On July\u00a01, 1921, the entire forest was transferred back to the Chelan National Forest, but on March\u00a023, 1955, the transfer was reverted.[2]"

The forest's initial area of 1,732,820 acres (701,250\u00a0ha) extended from the northern Okanogan River near the Canada\u2013United States border to divide the Lake Chelan and Entiat watersheds to the southern Cascade Crest.[8] On July\u00a01, 1911, the forest partly transformed into Okanogan National Forest. However, Chelan National Forest was still existent, then only occupying the drainage basin of Lake Chelan and Entiat.[9] The Conconully, Loomis, Squaw Creek, Sweat Creek, Twisp and Winthrop ranger districts were formed between 1911 and 1915.[5] On July\u00a01, 1921, the entire forest reunited back into the Chelan National Forest, and the term Okanogan was discontinued.[9] Subsequently, another ranger district was established, the Chelan Ranger District. Portions of the Loomis Ranger District, along with the Sweat Creek Ranger District, absorbed to become the Loomis State Forest, later abandoned. The forest's ranger area underwent a number of smaller changes until the mid-1940s. The Squaw Creek Ranger District was absorbed by the Twisp Ranger District in the early 1930s, while the Forest Service Monument 83\u00a0lookout was constructed in neighboring British Columbia as an accident. The Pasayten Ranger District was later created from a portion of the Winthrop Ranger District, and the Conconully Ranger District became the Okanogan Ranger District.[5] The western part of the Colville National Forest transferred into the Chelan National Forest in 1943. On March\u00a023, 1955, Chelan National Forest again became the Okanogan National Forest, then headquartered in the city of Okanogan. As per the change, the rename of the Conconully Ranger District was reverted.[9] In 1968, the Pasayten Wilderness was established, introducing over 200,000 acres (81,000\u00a0ha) to the forest.[5] The United States Congress designated almost 65\u00a0percent of the forest's area as the Lake Chelan-Sawtooth Wilderness under the National Wilderness Preservation System around 1984, upon land formerly occupied by the former Chelan Division of the Washington Forest Reserve.[10] The first forest supervisor of Wenatchee National Forest was Albert H. Sylvester, who named over a thousand natural features in the region."

        "content": "The area near the confluence of Icicle Creek and the Wenatchee River in modern-day Leavenworth is within the traditional territories of the indigenous Wenatchi and Yakama peoples.[5] The tribes had settlements on both waterways, including the villages of sc\u0259m\u0313 \u0313\u00e1w\u0313s and s\u012dnp\u016dsq\u1ed1\u012dso\u1e23 near modern-day Leavenworth, which was also a camas and root-gathering area.[6] The Wenatchi and Yakama were signatories to the 1855 Treaty of Walla Walla; an Indian reservation for the Wenatchi covering 36 square miles (93\u00a0km2) around a fishery at the confluence was promised in the treaty but never surveyed by the federal government. Most members of the Wenatchi relocated to the Colville Indian Reservation and Yakama Indian Reservation in the early 20th century, while few remained in the Leavenworth and Cashmere area.[5][7] The first non-native settlers in the area established a community named Icicle Flats on the south side of the Wenatchee River in 1891.[8] According to surveyor Albert Hale Sylvester, the \"Icicle\" name was derived from the indigenous name \"Nasikelt\", which translates to a narrow canyon or gorge.[9][10] The Great Northern Railway purchased land on the north side of the river for a division point and railyard for its route across Stevens Pass in October 1892, which prompted residents to move across the river. A new town was established there in 1893 and named Leavenworth for Charles Leavenworth, a Portland-based land investor with the Okanogan Investment Company who surveyed the site and laid its streets.[11][12] Leavenworth was a relative of U.S. Army colonel Henry Leavenworth, the founder of Fort Leavenworth and namesake of Leavenworth, Kansas.[10] The Stevens Pass route, which connected Seattle to Wenatchee, was completed in January 1893 and was the final section of the transcontinental Great Northern Railway.[13] Lafayette Lamb arrived in 1903 from Clinton, Iowa, to build the second largest sawmill in Washington.[citation needed] The settlement had three major fires at the turn of the 20th century that destroyed several buildings.[14] Leavenworth was officially incorporated as a city on September 5, 1906. A small timber community, it became a regional office of the Great Northern Railway in the early 1900s. The railroad relocated to Wenatchee in 1925, greatly affecting Leavenworth's economy. The city's population declined well into the 1950s as the lumber mills closed and stores relocated.[15] The city looked to tourism and recreation as a major economy as early as 1929, when they opened a ski jump.[16] In 1962, the Project LIFE (Leavenworth Improvement For Everyone) Committee was formed in partnership with the University of Washington to investigate strategies to revitalize the struggling logging town. The idea to create a \"Bavarian-Swiss\" alpine theme town came from two Seattle businessmen, Ted Price and Bob Rodgers, who had bought a failing cafe at Coles Corner in 1960.[17] Price and Rodgers had chosen the theme based on the latter's experience in Bavaria while deployed by the U.S. Army during World War II; the cafe was renamed The Squirrel Tree and expanded with a motel and gift shop.[18] Price was chair of the Project LIFE tourism subcommittee, and in 1965 the pair led a trip to a Danish-themed town, Solvang, California, to build support for the idea.[11] The Project LIFE members acquired properties in Leavenworth and were joined by architects Earl Petersen, who designed Solvang's Danish buildings, and Germany-born designer Heinz Ulbricht.[11] The first building to be rebuilt in the Bavarian style was the Chikamin Hotel, which had been damaged in a fire and reopened as the Edelweiss Hotel (named for the state flower of Bavaria) on July 1, 1965.[11][19] Several buildings were renovated later that year after business loans were secured to prepare the city for the 1966 Washington Autumn Leaf Festival.[19][20] By 1970, Leavenworth was hosting several annual festivals and had formed a design review board to enforce and maintain the standards set by Project LIFE.[17][20] On July 28, 1994, the Rat Creek Fire was ignited in the Icicle Creek basin and grew to 24,371 acres (9,863\u00a0ha) over the next three weeks as it moved towards northeast Leavenworth.[21] It was one of 34 fires in the Hatchery Complex Fire that were ignited in late July by thunderstorms and other causes.[22][23] The city was placed under an evacuation alert for several days as the fire surrounded parts of the valley and shut down U.S. Route 2.[24][25] The evacuation alert in Leavenworth was lifted by August 10, coinciding with the reopening of U.S. Route 2.[26] Later fires in 2001, 2004, and 2012 burned areas around Leavenworth.[27]"

        "content": "Leavenworth sits on the southeast side of the North Cascades collage, which is a group of terranes that accreted to North America all about the same time. Marine fossils indicate that the terranes were probably a group of islands originating in the South Pacific hundreds of millions of years ago. The terranes arrived at North America about 90 million years ago in the middle of the Cretaceous period. When they smashed into their new home, they were a puzzle of north\u2013south slices.  As accretion continued, they were cut into horizontal (east-west) slices. During the Eocene epoch, about 50 million years ago, the area was once again cut into vertical slices, creating among others, the Leavenworth fault and the Entiat fault.  In between these two faults the Chiwaukum graben was created. This graben is about 12 miles wide and trends northwest from Wenatchee for about 50 miles. As the graben dropped, it began to fill with clastic sediment from the surrounding hills, creating the Chumstick formation.  About 30 million years ago in the Oligocene epoch, the Chiwaukum graben underwent compressional deformation creating several folds in the region that are visible today. Leavenworth is on the western edge of the graben; in fact, the Leavenworth fault runs through the western edge of town. The area to the west and southwest of Leavenworth was created in the middle Cretaceous period with the uplift of the Mount Stuart batholith, forming the granite rock seen today in Icicle Ridge and Tumwater Mountain. During the Pleistocene and into the Holocene epochs, an alpine glacier originating from the southwest in the Mount Stuart range made its way to where the town is today. Leavenworth sits on the terminal moraine of that glacier. The residential parts of town display many glacial erratics that originated 20 miles up the Icicle Valley near Mount Stuart. About 19,000 years ago, a large rock slide dammed the Columbia River near Rock Island, just south of Wenatchee. The temporary dam, in conjunction with one of the Lake Missoula floods, caused the water to flow back up the Wenatchee Valley, where it was stopped by the glacier at Leavenworth.  As the leading edge of the glacier interacted with the flood, ice rafts formed carrying granite erratics from the Stuart batholith, which ended up in the town of Dryden about 15 miles down the valley from Leavenworth. As the glacier retreated, the south side of Leavenworth was a lake dammed up by the moraine. The bridge on the east side of town is a good vantage point to see where the Wenatchee River cuts through the moraine today."

During the summer, the weather is typically anticyclonic due to the presence of the North Pacific anticyclone, with resultant clear skies and large diurnal temperature ranges. Rainfall is limited by the Cascade rain shadow as well as by the anticyclone, and all months from May to October have recorded zero precipitation on occasions, including 114 consecutive days without precipitation from June to October 2003. When a continental flow enters the Columbia Basin, the temperature can be very hot during the day, with the hottest temperature being 110\u00a0\u00b0F or 43.3\u00a0\u00b0C during the heatwave of July 1941.

The fall months have steady cooling and a gradual increase in the frequency of frontal storms producing rainfall, while winter weather is typically cold and snowy, with an annual mean snowfall of 90.1 inches or 2.29 metres and a maximum monthly total of 92.3 inches (2.34\u00a0m) recorded in December 1996. The snowiest season has been from July 1968 to June 1969 with 217.2 inches (5.52\u00a0m) and the least snowy from July 1962 to June 1963 when just 19.4 inches (0.49\u00a0m) of snow fell. The lowest temperature recorded in Leavenworth was \u221236\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221237.8\u00a0\u00b0C) on December 30, 1968, but typically five mornings per year will fall at or below 0\u00a0\u00b0F or \u221217.8\u00a0\u00b0C. The wettest \"rain year\" was recorded from July 1955 to June 1956 with a total of 41.13 inches (1,044.7\u00a0mm) and the driest was from July 1929 to June 1930 with 11.77 inches (299.0\u00a0mm). The spring months see gradual warming and drying, though frosts remain frequent well into the start of April. During an average year, over 168 mornings see temperatures fall to freezing or below. May 16 is the average date of last freeze; 2016 was the first year to record a last frost in March."

Later, the Washington town of Winthrop followed Leavenworth's example and adopted a Western town theme.[36] The Bavarianization of the town waned by the 1990s but was revived through the establishment of annual events, including an Oktoberfest begun in 1998.[37] The Oktoberfest was later cancelled in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic before the original was moved to Wenatchee beginning in 2022, and the city's Chamber of Commerce started their own Oktoberfest event that remained in town.[38] A Krampusnacht celebration was held in December 2020 and 2021 but later moved out of Leavenworth following complaints from religious groups.[39][40] Leavenworth is home to the Leavenworth Nutcracker Museum, which opened in 1995 and contains more than 7,000 nutcrackers dating from the 16th and 17th centuries to modern examples.[41] The city hosts an annual Christmas tree lighting celebration in December that draws thousands of visitors and causes congestion on local highways.[18][42] By 2001, Leavenworth had 19 annual weekend festivals and events,[43] including a Maifest and Autumn Leaf Festival.[18] In November 2007, Good Morning America went to Leavenworth for Holiday Gifts for the Globe where GMA helped light up the town for the Christmas Holiday. Leavenworth was named the Ultimate Holiday Town USA by A&E Network.[44] The city has also focused on outdoor recreation to draw tourists, including skiing, hiking, and mountain biking. The increased reliance on outdoor tourism has brought non-themed businesses to Leavenworth.[18] The Leavenworth Ski Hill north of downtown was designated a U.S. historic district in 2013 due to its significance as a ski jumping area and its surviving Civilian Conservation Corps architecture.[45] An adventure park that comprises a climbing wall and alpine coaster with 2,700 feet (820\u00a0m) of track and opened in 2023 on a hill on the southwest side of the city.[46] As of 2021[update], Leavenworth had a total hotel capacity of 4,288 rooms.[47]"

Gradually strengthening, the storm reached typhoon status late on June\u00a07 according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center and several hours later according to the Japan Meteorological Agency. After turning towards the northeast, the typhoon brushed Taiwan and reached its peak intensity with 10-minute sustained winds of 150\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph) on June\u00a09. After reaching its peak, Conson gradually weakened, passing through Okinawa before being downgraded to a tropical storm the next day. On June\u00a011, the storm made landfall as a minimal tropical storm in the K\u014dchi Prefecture just before becoming extratropical. The extratropical remnants continued towards the northeast and were last mentioned on June\u00a014 crossing the International Date Line. Typhoon Conson brought heavy rains and high winds to the Philippines, Taiwan, Okinawa, and Japan. Flooding in the Philippines killed two people and caused about PHP1.6\u00a0million (US$35,000) in damages. However, some reports state that up to 30 people died in the Philippines. In the Ryukyu Islands, the storm brought heavy rains and high winds to several islands, damaging crops and leaving many without power. As it became extratropical, Conson caused moderate damage in southern Japan, including a few landslides which prompted evacuations. Throughout Japan, losses reached 355.7\u00a0million yen (US$3.8 million)."

        "content": "Early on June\u00a04, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began monitoring an area of low pressure associated with deep convection about 780\u00a0km (480\u00a0mi) south-southeast of Hong Kong. Later that day, following notable development,[3] they classified the system as Tropical Depression 07W.[4] At the same time, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) also began monitoring the system as a tropical depression.[5] Slowly moving towards the southeast, 07W gradually strengthened, being classified a tropical storm by the JTWC at 1200\u00a0UTC the next day.[4] Around the same time, the storm entered the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration's area of responsibility and was given the local name Frank.[6] Twenty-four hours later, 07W made its closest approach to the Philippines, passing within 295\u00a0km (183\u00a0mi) of Manila.[3] A few hours later, the JMA upgraded the depression to a tropical storm and gave it the name Conson;[5] a name contributed by Vietnam that is a picturesque place in the country, consisting of a mountain, pine forest, streams, pagodas and many historical monuments.[3] A ridge located over the central Philippines caused Conson to turn towards the north. Continuing to intensify,[3] the JTWC assessed the storm to have reached typhoon status at 1800\u00a0UTC on June\u00a07.[4] The JMA also upgraded the storm to a typhoon about twelve hours later.[5] A 28\u00a0km (17\u00a0mi) wide eye developed as the cyclone turned towards the northeast. Originally, forecasts showed the typhoon making landfall in southern Taiwan but the turn towards the northeast spared the island from a direct hit.[3] Shortly after being classified as a typhoon by the JMA, the JTWC upgraded Conson to a Category 2 typhoon on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale with winds of 155\u00a0km/h (96\u00a0mph) 1-minute winds).[4] The eye later became slightly disorganized and the cloud tops around the center warmed. However, the storm reorganized the next day and[3] was upgraded to a Category 3 typhoon by the JTWC with winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph) 1-minute winds).[4] The intensification was the result of the influence of an approaching shortwave trough which enhanced poleward outflow.[7] Around this time, PAGASA issued their final advisory on Typhoon 'Frank' as it moved out of their area of responsibility.[6] The strengthening was the result of Conson passing over the warm waters of the Kuroshio Current.[3] The forward motion on the typhoon also began to increase as it interacted with a baroclinic zone.[8] Shortly after, the JMA assessed the storm to have reached its peak intensity with winds of 150\u00a0km/h (93\u00a0mph) 10-minute winds) and a minimum pressure of 960\u00a0hPa (mbar).[5] Later that day, the storm passed over Okinawa as it weakened. By June\u00a010, Conson began to undergo an extratropical transition.[3] Continuing increase in forward speed caused the low to become exposed from shower and thunderstorm activity on the southern edge of the circulation.[9] Around 1200\u00a0UTC, the center of circulation became separated from deep convection,[3] leading to the typhoon being downgraded to a tropical storm by both agencies several hours later.[4][5] Early on June\u00a011, the JTWC reported that the storm had completed its extratropical transition just south of Japan.[4] However, the JMA kept Conson has a tropical cyclone through its landfall in K\u014dchi Prefecture as a minimal tropical storm. Shortly after landfall, it was classified as an extratropical cyclone. Continuing towards the northeast, the storm remained weak and was last mentioned as it crossed the International Date Line on June\u00a014 near the Aleutian Islands.[5] The Japan Meteorological Agency uses 10-minute sustained winds, while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center uses 1-minute sustained winds.[10] The conversion factor between the two is 1.14x.[11] JMA's peak intensity for Conson was 150\u00a0km/h (93\u00a0mph) 10-minute sustained, or 160\u00a0km/h (99\u00a0mph) 1-minute sustained.[5][11] The JTWC's peak intensity for Conson was 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph) 1-minute sustained, or 155\u00a0km/h (96\u00a0mph) 10-minute sustained.[4][11] The National Meteorological Center of China estimated a peak intensity of 150\u00a0km/h (93\u00a0mph) 10-minute sustained, or 160\u00a0km/h (99\u00a0mph) 1-minute sustained.[3][11] The Hong Kong Observatory assessed Conson to be slightly weaker than other agencies, with peak winds estimated at 130\u00a0km/h (81\u00a0mph) 10-minute sustained, or 150\u00a0km/h (93\u00a0mph) 1-minute sustained.[11][12]"

The highest 24\u2011hour rainfall was recorded in Subic Bay at 230\u00a0mm (9.1\u00a0in).[3] Minor flooding and power outages were reported in Manila.[15] These heavy rains led to flooding which reportedly killed 30 people in Luzon.[16][17] However, the fatalities are uncertain as PAGASA reported that two people were killed by the storm.

As the storm neared the islands, the naval base was put under TCCR Three, indicating that winds of 92\u00a0km/h (57\u00a0mph) were anticipated within 48\u00a0hours.[35] Ahead of the storm, upwards of 254\u00a0mm (10.0\u00a0in) fell across the islands, which were indirectly related to the storm.[36] In southern Japan, several airlines canceled flights due to poor weather conditions.[37] Heavy rains, peaking at 345\u00a0mm (13.6\u00a0in) on Tarama,[38] triggered flooding and landslides throughout the islands.[33] The highest sustained winds on the islands were also recorded on Tarama at 137\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph) and the highest gust was recorded on Miyako-jima at 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph).[3] Despite transitioning into an extratropical cyclone while impacting Japan,[5] Conson brought heavy rains and high winds to Ky\u016bsh\u016b. The highest rainfall and gusts were recorded in Tanegashima at 277.5\u00a0mm (10.93\u00a0in) and 146\u00a0km/h (91\u00a0mph) respectively; the highest sustained wind was recorded in Muroto, K\u014dchi at 109\u00a0km/h (68\u00a0mph).[3] On Ishigaki Island, high winds and heavy rains cut power to many residences and damaged crops. A total of 1,960\u00a0ha (4,800 acres) of agricultural land was damaged by the storm, leaving 31.9\u00a0million yen (US$346,000) in losses.[39] Significant agricultural damage was also sustained on Miyako-jima, leaving 76.5\u00a0million yen (US$805,000) in losses.[40] Okinawa sustained moderate damage during the passage of Conson, with several homes flooded and large lengths of power lines were lost. At the height of the storm, roughly 3,300 residences were without power and 1,305 power lines were downed. Additionally, 1,685\u00a0ha (4,160 acres) of agricultural land was damaged, leaving 32.3\u00a0million yen (US$350,000) in losses.[41] In Kagoshima Prefecture, Conson damaged 1,846\u00a0ha (4,560 acres) of agricultural land and flooded six homes. Agricultural and property damage in the prefecture amounted to 100\u00a0million yen (US$1 million) and 115\u00a0million yen (US$1.2 million) respectively.[42] A large landslide, roughly 30\u00a0m (98\u00a0ft) wide, in Matsuyama, Ehime prompted the evacuation of 19 homes; however, no known damage resulted from the incident.[43] Throughout K\u014dchi Prefecture, several highways were shut down after being damaged by Conson.

Outdoor welding was actually prohibited, because of a statewide burn ban that had gone into effect the previous day.[11]  Weather caused the fire to spread rapidly; the fire marshall of nearby Stillwater, Oklahoma said in an interview that the winds were blowing at 20 miles per hour (8.9\u00a0m/s) and that the high temperature was 107 degrees Fahrenheit. He said it was the 20th straight day of triple-digit temperatures. Only a late wind change spared the town from being totally destroyed. In 2016, a jury decided that, \"...

The main body of the forest stretches from Epping in the north, to Chingford on the edge of the London built-up area. South of Chingford the forest narrows, and forms a green corridor that extends deep into east London, as far as Forest Gate; the forest's position gives rise to its nickname, the Cockney Paradise.[1] It is the largest forest in London.[2] It lies on a ridge between the valleys of the rivers Lea and Roding. It contains areas of woodland, grassland, heath, streams, bogs and ponds, and its elevation and thin gravelly soil (the result of glaciation) historically made it less suitable for agriculture. The forest was historically managed as a common; the land was held by a number of local landowners who exercised economic rights over aspects such as timber, while local commoners had grazing and other rights. It was designated a royal forest meaning that only the monarch had the right to hunt deer. The extensive urban areas on the forest's doorstep bring many visitors to the forest, and cause a strain on the forest's ecology; however local recreational users of the forest were crucial in saving the forest when it was threatened with enclosure and destruction in the late 19th century. The huge public outcry led the City of London Corporation to buy and so save the site in what was the first major success of the environmental movement in Europe \u2013 the Corporation still owns the forest.[3][4] This environmental milestone came at a cost, as the City of London's early conservators did not understand the human processes that shaped the forest and its ecosystems, and discontinued the practice of pollarding trees while allowing grazing to decline. This changed the character of the forest and has led to reduced biodiversity. The modern Conservators are mindful of these historic errors but it is probably not possible to reverse the effects of this long interruption of historic management methods. [citation needed] The forest gives its name to the Epping Forest local government district, which covers part of it, and to Forest School, a private school in Walthamstow towards the south of it."

The former small leaved lime (also known as pry or linden) dominated woodland permanently changed during the Anglo-Saxon period, possibly as a result of the selective cutting of trees. Today's beech-birch and oak-hornbeam-dominated forest may be the result of partial forest clearance in Saxon times.[6]"

        "content": "The area is thought to have been given legal status as a royal forest by Henry II in the 12th century. At the time it was part of the much larger Forest of Essex, which covered nearly all of the county. The term Forest was a legal term, meaning that Forest Law applied, meaning that only the king had the right to hunt deer. The term did not mean the land was well wooded: the large majority of the Forest of Essex was agricultural land. The Forest of Essex gradually shrank in size as land was removed from Forest Law and it was replaced by a number of much smaller forests including Waltham Forest (which gives its name to the modern London Borough of Waltham Forest. Waltham Forest was a legally defined area which included the areas later known as Epping Forest and Hainault Forest; the rest of the Waltham Forest area was only lightly wooded. In physical terms (rather than legal terms), the Forest is thought to have declined to something like its modern extent in the early fourteenth century (possibly long before),[7] the Black Death reached England in 1348, leading to a huge decline in population, perhaps between a third and a half, which took away the pressure on woods and commons, leading to a very long period of stability in the area of these land uses in England.[8] At that time the forest extended slightly further south to the Romford Road in the  Forest Gate area of West Ham; this is the originally Roman A118 road from Aldgate on the City of London wall to Stratford, Romford and Colchester (and also known as the Great Essex Road). There was a coppice woodland on the Romford Road called Hamfrith Wood (meaning the woodland belonging to the Ham area) until around 1700, and an area of plain called Hamfrith Waste which lasted into the mid-1800s.[9] Most of Waltham Forest was later legally deforested (removed form Forest Law) leaving two smaller forests, Epping Forest and Hainault Forest, both of which continued to be very heavily wooded - there was not a reduction in the physical area of woods and commons. The name \"Epping Forest\" was first recorded in the 17th century. Although the monarch held hunting and associated rights, the land was owned by a number of local landowners. It was managed as a common where landowners benefitted from certain rights, while local commoners benefitted from common rights allowing them to gather firewood and foodstuffs, to graze livestock and turn out pigs for mast. The landscape was primarily a mixture of wood-pasture and open plains, rather than thick woodland, and both of these land use types were grazed by cattle."

        "content": "Following the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660, although the deer herd was restocked, royal hunting in the forest never recommenced. The forest was principally used as a source of shipbuilding timber for the Royal Navy, which was taken overland to Barking Creek and then floated in rafts to the Royal Dockyards at Woolwich and Deptford. This exploitation continued until about 1725, when all the suitable oak trees had been felled.[11] The City of London maintained the ancient tradition of an Easter Monday stag hunt in the forest, but official participation ended in 1807 when the office of Master of the City Hounds was abolished. In 1827, the huntsman of Sir William Pole-Tylney-Long-Wellesley chased a forest stag as far as West Ham. The customary Easter Monday hunt was repeated annually by a large and rowdy crowd of ordinary London tradesmen and working people, who gathered at Fairmead Oak to chase a previously captured stag, which was released from a cart and usually escaped unharmed.[12] The last of these hunts was in 1882 when it descended into a riot and had to be dispersed by the police.[13] In the 1830s, the forest took its first significant harm in centuries when a new road, the Epping New Road was built through the forest, to supplement pre-existing ancient roads. In 1830, civil engineer James Nicoll McAdam, the son of John Loudon McAdam, was engaged by a turnpike trust, the Epping and Ongar Highway Trust, to construct a road from Woodford Green to Epping through the heart of the forest, to avoid Goldings Hill on the old road through Loughton and shorten the distance by one mile. The Epping New Road, now part of the A104 was completed in 1834.[14] With the arrival of railway stations in towns close to the forest from the 1850s, the working class people of East London began to use the forest for recreation on Sundays and public holidays, in ever increasing numbers.[15] Others arrived by horsebus which could drive directly to popular spots like High Beach. On Whit Monday 1880, a parliamentary committee estimated that up to 400,000 people had visited Epping Forest on that day.[16]"

        "header": "Fighting enclosure",
        "content": "In the first decades of the 19th century, the Lord Warden of Epping Forest, William Long-Wellesley, acquiesced to the enclosure of 3,000 acres (1,200\u00a0ha) of forest land, about a third of the remaining total, by the lords of the manors who held freeholds in the forest. The government was keen to enclose land for farming and building development and allowed the Commissioners of Woods, Forests and Land Revenues to sell off further freeholds in the forest.[17] In 1851 nearby Hainault Forest, where the Crown owned most of the land, was privatised (enclosed) and nearly all of the trees grubbed out in order to turn the area into poor quality farmland. The modern conservation movement grew out of public disgust at the destruction of Hainault Forest and the need to protect its sister forest, Epping Forest.[18] Epping Forest had fragmented ownership which made it harder to enclose in the same way, though individual landowners began to make encroachments.[19] The urbanisation of nearby areas increased the forest's importance as an area of public recreation helped lead to the establishment of the Open Spaces Society in 1865,[19] whose aim was to protect commons in and around London. The Mile End branch, founded in the February of that year, was particularly important in mobilising East End environmentalism.[20] By 1870, the unenclosed forest had shrunk to only 3,500 acres (1,400\u00a0ha). One landowner, Reverend John Whitaker Maitland, who had enclosed 1,100 acres (450\u00a0ha) in his manor of Loughton, was engaged in a long running dispute with a commoner called Thomas Willingale and his family, who insisted on maintaining his right to lop trees in the forest, despite inducements offered for him to stop. The matter came to the public attention in 1866, when Willingale's son and two nephews were fined for damaging Maitland's trees, and were sent to prison for seven days when they refused to pay. Willingale was encouraged to continue the dispute by Edward Buxton and other members of the Commons Preservation Society, however a court action against Maitland lapsed in 1870 when Willingale died.[21]  In July 1871, around 30,000 East Londoners gathered on Wanstead Flats to protest about fences which had been erected there by Earl Cowley to enclose forest land. Despite clashes with police, including a mounted element, the crowd were able to break down and smash the enclosing fences. The action attracted nationwide attention, much of it critical of the government.[22][23] At this stage the City of London Corporation became involved, since in 1853, the city had purchased a farm at Manor Park for the construction of the City of London Cemetery; this made the City Corporation a forest commoner with the right to graze cattle in the forest.[24] In 1871, the City brought a suit against 16 of the lords of the forest manors, claiming that the enclosures impinged on their ancient grazing rights.[25] Following an appeal in 1874, a judgment by the Master of the Rolls, Sir George Jessel, ruled that all enclosures made since 1851 were illegal.[26] Subsequently, two acts of Parliament in 1871 (34 & 35 Vict. c. 93) and 1872 (35 & 36 Vict. c. 95) allowed the city to purchase the 19 forest manors.[27] The consequence of this victory was that only 10% of Epping Forest had been lost to enclosure (mainly in the south), compared to 92% of Hainault Forest.[28] Under the terms of the Epping Forest Act 1878, the forest ceased to be a royal forest and was purchased by the City of London Corporation whose Epping Forest Committee act as Conservators. The committee is composed of twelve members of the Court of Common Council and four Verderers who are residents of the forest and are elected by the Commoners. A Superintendent is responsible for operational management, supported by twelve Epping Forest Keepers.[29] In addition, the Crown's right to venison was terminated, and pollarding was no longer allowed, although grazing rights continued. This act laid down a stipulation that the Conservators \"shall at all times keep Epping Forest unenclosed and unbuilt on as an open space for the recreation and enjoyment of the people\". In compensation for the loss of lopping rights, Lopping Hall in Loughton was built as a community building.[30] This was the first major victory, in Europe, for the modern conservation movement.[19]"

The City of London Corporation still manages Epping Forest in strict conformity with the Epping Forest Act. This care is funded from 'City's Cash', the private funds of the Corporation rather than any money for its upkeep coming from local rates or taxes. The Conservators administer the forest from The Warren, modern offices built in the grounds of Grade II* listed Warren House, Loughton.[32] Warren House, formerly known as the Reindeer Inn, was built around a smaller hunt standing, known as the Little Standing. Its grounds were redesigned by Humphry Repton in the early 19th century. Until the outbreak of BSE in 1996 commoners still exercised their right to graze cattle and every summer herds of cattle would roam freely in the southern part of the forest.[33][34] Cattle were reintroduced in 2001 but their movements are now more restricted to reduce conflict with traffic.[35] Commoners, who are people who live in a Forest parish and own 0.5 acres (0.20\u00a0ha) of land, can still register and graze cattle during the summer months. The right to collect wood still exists but is rarely practised and is limited to \"one faggot of dead or driftwood\" per day per adult resident.[36] Originally a barn built in the mid-19th century the Grade II listed building Butler's Retreat is one of the few remaining Victorian retreats within the forest. The building, which  is adjacent to the Queen Elizabeth Hunting Lodge, takes its name from the 1891 occupier John Butler. Retreats originally served non-alcoholic refreshments as part of the Temperance movement. After closing in 2009 the building was refurbished by the City of London Corporation and re-opened as a caf\u00e9 in 2012.[37] On 12 July 2012 The Duke of Gloucester\u2014the official Epping Forest Ranger\u2014opened the View interpretation centre at Chingford.

The main body of the forest stretches from Epping in the north, to Chingford on the edge of the London built-up area. South of Chingford the forest narrows, and forms a green corridor that extends deep into East London, as far as Forest Gate. The southern part of the forest was always narrower but enclosure and other destruction in the 19th and 20th centuries mean that this is now more pronounced. The southernmost point of the Forest is now Wanstead Flats but it formerly extended slightly further south, to the Romford Road.[40] The forest occupies a ridge of higher ground, the Epping Forest Ridge, set between the valleys of the Rivers Lea and Roding. These valleys were formed by arms of the Scandinavian ice sheet during the last glacial period, around 18,000 BC. The ridge consists of boulder clay topped with loam, while towards its southern end it is overlain with glacial gravel. The highest points are near Ambresbury Banks to the south of Epping, which is 111 metres (384 feet) above sea level, while Pole Hill near Chingford reaches 91 metres (299 feet). On the western edge of the ridge, High Beach at a similar height, is an expanse of gravel and Bagshot sand, thought to have been deposited by an unknown river which flowed northwards from the Weald of Kent before the creation of the Thames Valley.[41] The following is a simplified list of the various parts of Epping Forest, starting from the north:"

However, the Forests pollards have not been cut since the passing of the Epping Forest Act, have now grown massive crowns of thick, trunk-like branches with correspondingly large boles. This gives the trees an unusual appearance, uncommon in other forests. Often the weight of the branches cannot be supported by the parent tree, and the large amount of dead wood in the forest supports numerous rare species of fungi and invertebrates. Epping Forest has 55,000 ancient trees, more than any other single site in the United Kingdom.[44] Predominant tree species are Pedunculate oak (Quercus robur), European beech (Fagus sylvatica), European hornbeam (Carpinus betuloides), silver birch (Betula pendula) and European holly (Ilex aquifolium). Indicator species of long-uninterrupted woodland include service-tree (Sorbus torminalis) butcher's-broom (Ruscus aculeatus) and drooping sedge (Carex pendula). The pollarded trees allowed light through to the woodland floor, increasing the numbers of low-growing plants.

The last recorded sighting of roe deer in the forest was in 1920.[50] In recent decades, Reeves's muntjac have been reported in the southern part of the forest.[52] The announcement of licensed culling of fallow deer and muntjac in forest \"buffer land\" in 2016 was criticised by local residents but defended by environmentalists as necessary to prevent over-grazing of woodland undergrowth.[53]"

Despite clear signposting, a minority of mountain bikers and horse riders continue to cause damage in these areas,[57] and the Conservators of Epping Forest have expressed their concern.[58] A number of clubs organise rides, particularly on Sunday mornings. The forest is also used as a training area for many national level mountain-bike racers as it is highly regarded for its fast and tight flowing single track trails. This type of terrain is known within the mountain bike fraternity as cross country (or XC). Epping Forest was considered as a venue for the mountain-biking event of the 2012 Summer Olympics, though the final choice was near Hadleigh Castle.[citation needed] Stage 3 of the 2014 Tour de France passed through the forest from Epping to Buckhurst Hill along the Epping New Road.[59] Horse riding is popular in Epping Forest. Riders need to be registered with the Epping Forest conservators before they are allowed to ride in the forest. Running as a form of recreation in Epping Forest goes back almost to the birth of the sport in the 1870s, including hosting the inaugural English Championships in 1876. Orienteering and rambling are also popular. There are numerous guidebooks offering shorter walks for the casual visitor. The most important event in the ramblers' calendar in the area is the traditional Epping Forest Centenary Walk, an all-day event commemorating the saving of Epping Forest as a public space, which takes place annually on the third Sunday in September.[60] High Beach in Epping Forest was the first British venue for motorcycle speedway and opened on 19 February 1928.  The track was behind The King's Oak public house, and drew large crowds in its early days.  The track was closed when a swimming pool was added to the pub's grounds after the Second World War, though enthusiasts and veterans still gather at the site every year on the nearest Sunday to 19 February. The remains of the track are still visible, in the grounds of the Epping Forest Field Centre behind the King's Oak.[61] The field centre in the forest, run by Field Studies Council provides a variety of courses. There are 60 pitches for football with changing facilities on forest land at Wanstead Flats, which are used by amateur and youth teams.[62] There is a public 18-hole golf course at Chingford Plain, which is also used by the Royal Epping Forest Golf Club, Chingford Golf Club and Chingford Ladies' Golf Club. The course was established in the forest in 1888.[63] Cricket is played on forest land at Woodford Green, Bell Common (Epping), Buckhurst Hill, and High Beach.[64] One historic match is recorded in the forest in 1732 between London Cricket Club and an Essex & Hertfordshire side.

In the 18th century, Mary Wollstonecraft, writer, philosopher and feminist, spent the first five years of her life growing up in the forest.[70] In the 19th century, the poet and humorist Thomas Hood published The Epping Hunt in 1829, about the rowdy annual Easter Monday deer hunt for Londoners which started at Buckhurst Hill. In 1832, Hood and his wife moved to the Lake House in Wanstead Park, which was later incorporated into the forest, and his 1838 novel Tylny Hall is set there.[71] Charles Dickens' novel Barnaby Rudge begins with a description of the forest in 1775.[72] Alfred, Lord Tennyson lived at Beech Hill House, High Beach, from 1837 to 1840, where he wrote parts of In Memoriam A.H.H.. Suffering from depression, he stayed as a guest at Dr. Martin Allen's asylum, where he would have encountered poet John Clare, whose behaviour became so erratic that he was removed to the asylum in 1837.[69] William Morris, artist, writer and socialist, was born in Walthamstow in 1834, and spent his early years in what was then rural Essex, close to the outlying sections of the forest.[73] Arthur Morrison, \"the English Zola\", lived successively at Chingford, Loughton, and High Beach in the forest, and \u2013 particularly in To London Town \u2013 the forest is used as a contrast to the East London deprivation he wrote about. Horace Newte, his contemporary and friend, lived at Loughton and Theydon Bois. Rudyard Kipling and Stanley Baldwin spent a seminal long holiday as boys in Loughton adjacent to the Forest, which they loved. This has been documented in detail by Janice Lingley in her\u2032\u2032Loughton Idyll\u2032 (Alderton Press 2020). The poet Edward Thomas was posted to a temporary army camp at High Beach when he enlisted in the Artists' Rifles in 1915.[74] Although the conditions in the camp were squalid, Thomas enjoyed the forest and the following year moved with his wife to a cottage at Paul's Nursery,[75] close to High Beach.[76] One of his last poems, Out in the dark, was written at High Beach at Christmas 1916, shortly before he was killed in France.[77] During the 20th century, several writers used the forest as a setting for their novels, including R. Austin Freeman's Jacob Street Mystery (1940), partly set at Loughton Camp. Dorothy L. Sayers' 1928 mystery Unnatural Death includes the discovery, in Epping Forest, of the body of a young woman possessing knowledge that could incriminate a murderer.  The horror writer James Herbert used Epping Forest as the setting for his novel Lair (1979). In the book, a horde of Giant Black Rats establish a colony in the forest and embark on a murderous campaign against humans. Herbert mentions a now obscure legend attached to the forest \u2013 the legend of the white stag. Supposedly, the sighting of this animal is an omen of trouble and death. Natural historian and author Fred J Speakman lived at the Epping Forest Field Studies Centre, High Beach.[78] He wrote several books about the area, including A Poacher's Tale with Alfred T Curtis, a Waltham Abbey-born poacher,[79] and A Keeper's Tale, describing the life of forest keeper Sidney Butt.[80] T E Lawrence owned an estate at Pole Hill, Chingford; this was added to the Forest in 1929 and Lawrence's hut re-erected in the Forest Headquarters at the Warren, Loughton, where it remains, largely forgotten, today.[81] Actor and playwright Ken Campbell (1941\u20132008) lived in Loughton, adjacent to Epping Forest; his funeral took the form of a woodland burial in the forest.[82]"

In the 18th century, Epping Forest became notorious as the haunt of highwaymen, who preyed on the coaches of wealthy racegoers on the road from London to Newmarket.[94] Dick Turpin and Tom King used the forest as a hideaway, and Jack Rann, known as \"Sixteen String Jack\", had a pub named after him in Theydon Bois.[95] Turpin had a hideout there.[96] The tree cover and the forest's location close to London have made it notorious as a burial area for murder victims. Triple policeman murderer Harry Roberts hid out in the forest for a short time before his arrest in 1966."

It makes landfall on the evening of 29 February, followed by violent gusts of wind reaching a maximum of 150\u00a0km/h (93\u00a0mph). In a number of German regions, these gusts push the authorities to stop the railway and car traffics. At the same time, the air traffic of the Amsterdam Airport Schiphol is greatly disturbed. On the seaside, the dam of the Hollandsche Ijssel is claused by precaution. In Belgium, firemen carry out a hundred interventions throughout the night, mainly due to trees being brought down by the wind. The gusts quickly move towards Bavaria, causing a power outage for nearly 150,000 people. In the wake of the storm, the material damage is of considerable importance, with among other damages, trees were brought down, urban infrastructure and transport is damaged, and the power outage, which makes the authorities expect the financial toll of the storm to go up to \"tens of millions euro in damage\".\nIn North Rhine-Westphalia, more than a million cube meters of windthrow are reported to have been caused by the storm. Aside from this, Germany is also the country that suffered the highest death toll, with 6 left dead. On the morning of 1 March, as the storm is moving to the south-east, gusts cause two accidents. A tree falls on the Intercity-Express. Shortly after, an Airbus A320 of the Lufthansa nearly crashes on the runway of the airport of Hamburg. As the gusts destabilize the plane, the pilot barely manages to land.[5] In France, the region of Alsace is affected by the storm too. In the commune of Pfastatt, part of the roof of a supermarket is torn away, leading to a preventive evacuation. In Austria, the storm pushes the government to cut access to several roads and motorways. Important damage is reported in a number of locations, while winds reaching 190\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph) are measured in the Austrian Alps. In Salzburg and Vienna, winds reaching 140\u00a0km/h (87\u00a0mph). In the latter, a crane falls down on the S\u00fcdbahnhof and nearly 10,000 homes suffer from a power outage. In Switzerland and Liechtenstein, where the winds reach and sometimes go over 200\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph), several people are wounded. The A1 and A3 motorways are temporarily closed to traffic due to trees brought down on the roadways.[6] Poland is also affected by the storm. A train linking Warsaw and Krak\u00f3w is cancelled due to security concerns, while important material damage and the death of two people are reported. Thousands of homes are also the victims of a power outage. In the Czech Republic, the region of Prague is swept with winds reaching 140\u00a0km/h (87\u00a0mph). In the capital city, the roof of a building is torn out, leading to the evacuation of forty residents. A power outage caused by damaged power lines affects 920,000 homes, which represents around 10% of the Czech population, and the railway traffic is heavily disturbed. The total cost of the storm in the country is estimated to be of several hundreds of million Czech crowns by the largest Czech assurance company, Ceska Pojistovna.\nTwo people are killed by the storm.[6] As the storm came to a close, floods caused by heavy rain affect several affected areas, like Bavaria."

The tornado ran ashore on the far south side of Sundown Trail, and it tracked through a field before hitting Davis Road. The tornado inflicted EF0 damage on electrical transmission lines located near Rhea Court, before turning to the north.[5] The tornado then crossed De Cordova Ranch Road, entering the Rancho Brazos subdivision, where all six deaths would occur.[4][6] It would then begin rapidly intensifying to EF3 strength. A manufactured home located off of De Cordova Ranch as completely destroyed. The tornado retained EF3 intensity while crossing Canyon Road and South Sageccrest Court. The tornado also tracked through Tumbleweed Lane. The tornado then briefly strengthened to low-end EF4 intensity, and a two-story home located on Fox Hollow Court was completely destroyed, and the house foundation was swept clean of any debris.[5] The tornado then weakened back down to EF3 intensity while crossing Ranchview Drive. A to-story home was completely destroyed on Ranchview Drive at high-end EF3 intensity, and another manufactured home located nearby was destroyed at high-end EF2 intensity. The tornado continued to move northward, hitting Highview Court and the northern edge of Echo Trail.[5] The tornado reached EF4 intensity a second time on Sundown Court, where two multi-story houses were destroyed and swept clean of debris. These houses were located next to each other. Another house on the same street sustained high-end EF3 damage to its structure, and collapsed walls were observed. It then tracked out of populated areas, heading northward and snapping tree trunks at EF1 intensity.[5] As the tornado continued tracking northward, it struck a barn, heavily damaging it at EF1 intensity. Windspeeds here were at 97 mph. Another farm nearby lost its roof, and windspeeds were estimated to be up to 100 mph at this location. A tree was debarked at EF2 intensity a short distance from the farms, and several other trees sustained EF0 and EF1 damage. The tornado retained large swaths of EF1 damage.[5] The tornado continued moving northward before narrowly avoiding a single home located on Acton Highway. It then abruptly turned to the east, inflicting EF2 damage on trees. It also began to run almost parallel to Bob White Drive while weakening to EF0 intensity. Multiple farm buildings sustained EF0 damage on this road. The tornado also damaged a manufactured home at EF1 intensity before lifting north of Bob White Drive. In total, it tracked around 2.75 miles and had a maximum width of 800 yards.[5]"

The polar front supported multiple cold fronts moving southeastward through the Atlantic toward mainland Europe, as well as an eastward-moving warm front approaching Great Britain. In conjunction with strong high pressure to the south, an extremely tight pressure gradient developed along the deep low and produced a large area of high winds.[10] Because of the high temperature gradient between the warm and cold air masses, the cyclone underwent a phase of explosive deepening.[11] By 08:00\u00a0UTC, the low had attained a minimum barometric pressure of 977\u00a0hPa (28.9\u00a0inHg), bringing gale-force winds to much of western Great Britain.[12] The minimum pressure further dipped to 957\u00a0hPa (28.3\u00a0inHg) around 12:00\u00a0UTC, with maximum sustained winds of at least 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h) observed at the surface.[13][14] An overall pressure drop of 44\u00a0hPa (1.3\u00a0inHg) was observed over just 24\u00a0hours, which combined with the extreme winds earned it the label \"weather bomb\" by meteorologists.[11] A FAAM research aircraft had intercepted the storm on several occasions as part of the DIAMET[15] research project, providing valuable data on its wind profile, temperature and humidity.[16] By 9 December, the low had crossed Great Britain and moved into the North Sea toward western Scandinavia. The weakening occluded portion of the low\u2014located along its centre\u2014produced south-southeasterly gale-force winds across the peninsula. Further north, a large area of heavy snowfall and rough winds developed, while the heaviest rains occurred to the south of the centre.[17] It passed through Sweden with hurricane-force gusts,[18] though its winds and rainfall weakened significantly as it moved over Finland on 10 December.[19] The storm persisted for another three days, before dissipating on 13 December."

Also closed were public museums, galleries, sports centres, and many council buildings and libraries.[23] The Police in Scotland advised the public not to travel, and the Tay, Forth, Skye and Erskine bridges were closed to all traffic.[23] Officials feared widespread structural damage to roofs and weak buildings, resulting in the closure of several tourist attractions in central Scotland, including Edinburgh Castle and Princes Street Gardens.[24]"

Sixty-four passengers on a train running on the West Highland Line were stranded, near Crianlarich, after the line was forced to close[29] In some areas buses ran in place of trains due to line problems.[30] Glasgow Airport cancelled 37 flights, and Edinburgh Airport 21 flights.[31] Ferry services in the Western Isles were also affected, with the majority being cancelled.[29] Bus operators in the Central Belt withdrew double-decker buses from operation after the Scottish Government advised all high sided vehicles not to travel and a number of buses were blown over.[32] In the North Sea, the Petrojarl Banff, a floating production storage and offloading vessel carrying 4,400 tonnes (4,900 short tons) of oil, and the Apollo Spirit, which has 96,300 tonnes (106,200 short tons) on board, lost tension in some of their anchors as they were battered by the hurricane-force winds.

It was the second major outbreak of 2006, in the same area that suffered considerable destruction in a previous outbreak on March 11 and 12, as well as an outbreak on November 15, 2005.[3] The most notable tornadoes of the outbreak struck northeastern Arkansas, the Missouri Bootheel, and West Tennessee, where several communities\u00a0\u2013 including Marmaduke, Arkansas, Caruthersville, Missouri, and Newbern, Tennessee suffered devastating damage. In total, 66 tornadoes touched down across seven states, which is the most in a single day in 2006. In addition, there were over 850 total severe weather reports, including many reports of straight-line winds exceeding hurricane force and hail as large as softballs, which caused significant additional damage in a nine-state region.[4] The outbreak caused 27 tornado-related deaths plus two other deaths from straight-line winds.[5][6] It was the deadliest tornado outbreak in the United States since the tornado outbreak sequence of May 2003, which killed 48 people. Twenty-six of those deaths were caused by a single supercell thunderstorm which produced damaging and long lived tornadoes from north central Arkansas into northwest Tennessee."

        "content": "The outbreak was caused by a cold front that tracked across the central United States, triggered by a deep low-pressure area in the Upper Midwest. The warm humid air mass ahead of the cold front, along with high upper-level wind shear, produced supercells across the region.[7] The outbreak was expected to have started the previous day in the High Plains as the cold front tracked across that region. The supercells didn't really fire up as expected and only one small tornado was reported in Pawnee County, Kansas on April 1. Severe weather that day was largely restricted to significant microbursts and large hail.[8] The Storm Prediction Center (SPC) issued a moderate risk of severe weather for April 2, with the main risks being tornadoes and large hail.[7] The primary risk area was the central Mississippi Valley and lower Ohio Valley up to central Illinois, where most of the tornadoes touched down. Many tornado watches\u00a0\u2013 if not any PDS watches\u00a0\u2013 were issued across the region. While a significant severe weather event was expected, the extreme nature caught many forecasters by surprise, based on the risk levels and the probabilities estimated by the SPC in the area primarily affected.[9] Farther north, the initial thunderstorm development in eastern Missouri quickly developed into a squall line, eventually becoming a derecho that produced many embedded\u00a0\u2013 and generally weak\u00a0\u2013 tornadoes and widespread wind damage across Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, and Ohio. Springfield, Illinois, which was struck by two tornadoes less than a month earlier, was hit again by tornadoes and damaging straight-line winds of up to 80 miles per hour (70\u00a0kn; 130\u00a0km/h), as was the St. Louis, Missouri area.[10] Wind damage was reported in Cincinnati, Louisville, Kentucky, and Indianapolis, among other cities.[4] The line of storms slowly weakened while traveling eastward, and the severe weather events dissipated later that evening."

The tornado first struck the small community of Shannon at F1 intensity. 3 businesses and 5 homes were destroyed. Another two businesses and two homes had major damage, and 18 other homes had minor damage.[74] Past Shannon, the tornado rapidly intensified into a large high-end F3 as it crossed into Greene County and slammed into the town of Marmaduke. The town was devastated, with 130 homes and 25 mobile homes being destroyed. A pharmacy and some industrial buildings were also destroyed, and the town's water tower was damaged. Multiple vehicles were tossed around, and 15 railroad cars were blown off of the tracks as well. 47 people were injured in town, two of which were airlifted to a hospital. Outside of town, 19 homes and 11 mobile homes were destroyed. In addition, seven houses and two mobile homes had major damage in the county. A car was thrown 80 yards from one residence well.[75][76] The tornado then crossed the St. Francis River into Dunklin County, Missouri, where it displayed a multiple-vortex structure. 7 homes were destroyed and 33 others were damaged in rural portions of the county. Multiple power poles were downed as well.[77] The tornado then crossed into Pemiscot County, and struck the town of Braggadocio at F2 intensity. The tornado's only two fatalities occurred at that location when a couple was killed in their car as they tried to flee from the tornado. The tornado then re-intensified to a high-end F3 as it tore through the neighboring town of Caruthersville, destroying roughly half of the community and injuring 130 people. 226 homes were destroyed, and 542 others were damaged in town. The town's water tower, municipal airport, several churches, Caruthersville High School and Middle School, and multiple businesses were destroyed as well. The tornado abruptly dissipated just outside town after traveling 77 miles.[75][78]"

Many homes and businesses had been rebuilt; while many others remained in their tornado-damaged state. The Marmaduke water tower, which was heavily damaged, was torn down shortly after the tornado. The primary employer in the area, American Railcar Industries, rebuilt its facility and quickly returned it to operational status.[79] On August 29, 2006, Caruthersville Emergency Manager and Fire Chief Charlie Jones was awarded the StormReady Community Hero Award for his actions preventing further injuries and fatalities in the area. He ordered the sirens to sound repeatedly and used the fire department's communications frequency to warn of the imminent and extreme danger that lay ahead, which saved many lives that evening. There were no deaths in Caruthersville as a result.[80] More than half the community was destroyed. Charitable outpouring was enormous and several key buildings, including one of the schools, have been rebuilt.[81] Numerous FEMA trailers\u00a0\u2013 intended for Hurricane Katrina victims but unused and sitting nearby\u00a0\u2013 were redirected to the communities affected in Arkansas, Missouri, and Tennessee after the tornadoes hit.[79]"

Chebi is the third typhoon since Typhoon Xangsane to hit the country destructively. The 30th tropical depression developed east of the Mariana Islands on October 31 as a weak disturbance. The system was dubbed into a tropical depression on November 8, until both the JMA and PAGASA upgraded it to a tropical storm on November 9. Chebi rapidly intensified to a Category 4 typhoon the next day and made landfall over northern Philippines on November 11. The system finally dissipated near Hong Kong and Vietnam on November 14. The name Chebi is a misspelling for Jebi and was corrected in 2007, which means swallow in Korean."

        "content": "An area of disturbed weather developed east of the Mariana Islands on October 31, and moved west-northwestward over the next week without any increase in organization due to an unfavorable environment, until November 6, when it encountered more favorable conditions, and the Japan Meteorological Agency declared it a tropical depression on November 8. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the system later that day, and PAGASA named the system Tropical Depression Queenie shortly after. The JTWC classified it as Tropical Depression 23W early on November 9. According to the JTWC, lack of equatorial outflow prevented rapid intensification of the system. Later that day, the JMA upgraded it to a tropical storm named it Chebi. The JTWC and PAGASA both followed suit later that day. In the same time, Chebi started to underwent a 24-hour period of rapid deepening, with an 85 millibar drop until mid of November 10. Early on November 10, the JMA upgraded Chebi to a severe tropical storm as it continued to move west towards the Philippines, following a similar track as Typhoon Cimaron earlier in the season. Just hours later, the JMA upgraded Chebi from severe tropical storm with 10-minute sustained winds of 55\u00a0knots to a typhoon with winds of 95\u00a0knots, with a pressure decrease of 40 hPa over three hours.[citation needed] The JTWC followed suit, upping Chebi from a tropical storm with 1-minute sustained winds of 55\u00a0knots to a Category 4-equivalent typhoon. Nearly the same time after that, Chebi reached its peak intensity with 10-minute sustained winds of 175 km/h (110 mph); 1-min maximum sustained winds of 230 km/h (145 mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 925 millibars. PAGASA raised Public Storm Warning Signal No. 4 for three provinces in Luzon, making Chebi the second storm (Typhoon Cimaron served as the first one that year) in as many weeks to force a Signal #4. After rapidly deepening, Chebi slightly weakened as it approached the Philippines. It made its first landfall near Casiguran, Aurora early on November 11, crossed Lingayen Gulf and its second landfall on Barangay Lucap, Alaminos about 8 hours later.[citation needed] Encountering dry air entrainment and increased vertical wind shear in the South China Sea, Chebi began to gradually weaken to a severe tropical storm on November 12. It continued to weaken, turning northwards towards Hainan, and was downgraded to a tropical storm the next day. On November 14, the JMA issued its last advisory on the dissipating tropical depression. The JTWC issued its final warning later that same day as Chebi dissipated under the strong shear.[citation needed]"

On November 11, just after its peak intensity, Chebi made landfall over Aurora, Philippines near Casiguran.[1][2] Public Storm Warning Signal #2, meaning winds extending from 60 to 100 kp/h, is up over southern Isabela, Quirino, Aurora, northern Quezon and Polillo Island. Cagayan, Isabela, Ifugao, Nueva Vizcaya, Bulacan, Quezon, Camarines provinces and Catanduanes have been placed under Signal #1.[3] On November 13, Chebi exited the PAR with both the PAGASA and NDRRMC stopped warning on the system.[4] The PNRC is also preparing relief supplies to be distributed to families in the barangays of Dibulo and Digomased where an estimated 300 families have been evacuated within the Municipality of Dinapegue. However, initial actions have included the establishment of a tent camp in the city of Calamba, one hour south of Manila, set up in three days from November 8 to 11 to accommodate 87 families. The camp's capacity is 300 families. The ICRC provided two emergency water storage bladders, one for 10,000 litres and one for 5,000 litres. The camp is managed by the city administration, which is finishing constructions of latrines, showers, cooking and laundry facilities.[5] About 8,300 people who evacuated flooded villages in San Jose have returned home, the civil defense office said.[6] All told, the typhoon caused further casualties as well as damage caused by the earlier Typhoon Cimaron.[7] Landslides, overflowing rivers, toppled trees and power lines blocked several roads to Casiguran and Dinapigue town in nearby Isabela province. Strong winds destroyed two houses and damaged a dozen others in Casiguran. The OCD said most of the floodwaters in the area have receded by early of November 12, but some rice crops were damaged in San Jose city in Nueva Ecija province where some farms were submerged under about 1.2 meters (four feet) of water.[6] A total of 1,676 houses were damaged in Dipaculao, Casiguran and Dinalungan, Aurora Province. In Aurora Province, it caused floods, cutting the province's road system,[8] as well as zero visibility, further isolating it from relief efforts.[9] Initial assessments from chapters in Aurora, Isabela and Nueva Ecija say 4,624 families have had their homes destroyed or damaged. There have also been reports of\npower outages and roads once again being cut off.[5] A total of 3,958 families or 21,250 persons were affected in 38 barangays of 7 municipalities and 1 city in the provinces of Isabela, Aurora and Nueva Ecija. There were 10 persons reported injured in Casiguran, Aurora. One person was reported dead in San Jose City, Nueva Ecija with five missing in Sabang, Baler, Aurora.[7][4]"

If the meteorologists have got it right in their latest prediction, the eighth storm to set its sights on Viet Nam this year should begin weakening in the next 24 hours.[11] Chebi had weakened into a tropical depression on November 14 and was no longer threatened the central region, Vietnam's National Hydrometeorological Forecast Center said.[12] Even so, Vietnam's eighth storm of the year, Chebi, was strong enough to produce waves as high as four meters around the Hoang Sa Islands in the Eastern Sea.[13]"

Lee originated from an area of thunderstorm activity near the Truk Atoll towards the end of December. Following an increase in organization, the system was classified as a tropical cyclone on December\u00a022. After becoming a tropical storm, Lee began to slowly strengthen, and attained typhoon status on December\u00a024. While turning west towards the Philippines, Lee began to intensify more rapidly. It is estimated to have reached peak intensity the next day, with winds of 145\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph). At peak intensity, the storm moved ashore the central Philippines later on December\u00a025. Lee emerged into the South China Sea the following day as a tropical storm. Initially, the storm maintained its intensity, but soon began to weaken due to increased wind shear. By December\u00a028, all of the thunderstorm activity was removed from the center, and on December\u00a029, Lee dissipated. However, the remnants of the cyclone was last noted a few hundred kilometers south of Hong Kong. Across the Philippines, Typhoon Lee killed 188 people. In addition, 674,619 people were directly affected by the typhoon. Furthermore, 76,169 dwellings were demolished while 39,586 families, or 208,336 people, were rendered as homeless. A total of 53,314\u00a0houses were partially damaged. Also, 548,525\u00a0people sought refuge in shelters. Additionally, 1,586 individuals were injured due to Lee. Overall, damage totaled to $74.1\u00a0million (1981\u00a0USD), $46.4\u00a0million of which was from infrastructure and an additional $2.2 million came from agriculture.[nb 1] The island of Samar sustained the worst damage caused by the storm. There, 82\u00a0fatalities were reported and 56 were injured. A total of 19,390\u00a0people were displaced; roughly 8,000\u00a0families or 48,000\u00a0people was forced to move to evacuation centers.

        "content": "On December\u00a021, 1981, an area of convection began to organize west of the Truk Atoll. Despite strong wind shear, Hurricane Hunter aircraft data yielded winds of near-gale force and a barometric pressure of 1002\u00a0mbar (29.6\u00a0inHg) the next day. Initially, the aircraft did not find any evidence of a closed low-level circulation. At 1000\u00a0UTC on December\u00a022, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) for the system. Two hours later, the JTWC upgraded the disturbance into Tropical Depression 29 following the discovery of a closed surface circulation by Hurricane Hunters. By that evening, thunderstorm activity had become more concentrated towards the center;[1] as such, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) first classified the system as a tropical cyclone.[2][nb 2] Following a further increase in organization, both the JMA and JTWC upgraded the cyclone into Tropical Storm Lee early on December\u00a023.[4][nb 3] Meanwhile, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Dinang.[6][7] Initially, Lee veered west-northwest due to a mid-latitude trough exiting off the Asia mainland. At 0600 UTC on December\u00a023, the JTWC classified Lee as a typhoon.[1] At 0000 UTC on December 24, the JMA upgraded Lee into a severe tropical storm.[2] Six hours later, the agency classified Lee as a typhoon.[4] Around this time, the JTWC predicted that Lee would turn north after entering the South China Sea due to the influence of an extratropical cyclone. However, as the storm turned west because the trough had moved away, the JTWC kept prolonging the northward turn. Moving in the general direction of the Philippines, Lee began to rapidly intensify. At 0600\u00a0UTC on December\u00a025, the JTWC reported winds of 180\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph), equivalent to a high-end Category 2 hurricane on the United States-based Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. According to the JTWC, this would be the storm's peak intensity.[1] Meanwhile, the JMA estimated peak intensity of 145\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph) and a minimum pressure of 950\u00a0mbar (30\u00a0inHg).[2] That afternoon, the typhoon made landfall along the central portion of the Philippines.[1][2] After landfall, rapid weakening occurred, and when the storm entered the South China Sea on December\u00a026, the JTWC reduced the winds of Lee to 70\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph).[1] Despite this, data from the JMA suggests that system was stronger, with winds of 105\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph).[2] Based on additional reports from Hurricane Hunters, the JTWC revised its forecast and now anticipated the tropical cyclone to move on a westerly course and strike central Vietnam. Moving into an area of decreased monsoonal flow,[1] Lee maintained its intensity for 18\u00a0hours.[4] Satellite imagery showed a banding-type eye. However, by December\u00a027, Lee began to feel the effects of an extratropical cyclone located to the north of the storm; consequently, Lee began to make a gradual turn towards the northwest. Lee began to encounter increased vertical wind shear,[1] and early on December\u00a027, the JMA lowered the intensity of Lee to 105\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph).[2] Later that day, a Hurricane Hunter investigation recorded a pressure of 998\u00a0mbar (29.5\u00a0inHg) as the storm began to turn towards the north,[1] exiting PAGASA's warning zone.[7] By 0000\u00a0UTC on December\u00a028, all of the deep convection was displaced from the center.[1] Six hours later, the JMA estimated that Lee weakened to winds below tropical storm force.[2] By midday, satellite imagery suggested that Lee was no longer a tropical cyclone; however, the JTWC continued to issue warnings on the system until 0000\u00a0UTC on December\u00a029.[1] At 1800\u00a0UTC, the JMA stopped watching the system.[4] The remnants of Lee were last noted by the JTWC roughly 275\u00a0km (170\u00a0mi) south of Hong Kong.[1]"

Railway services to and from Manila was suspended.[9] Even though nine domestic flights were canceled,[11] Manila International Airport remained open throughout the passage of the typhoon. Across Manila, some flooding was reported and high winds tore off some Christmas decorations in hotels along the bay.[10] The Sorsogon Province was one of the hardest hit areas by the typhoon; 20\u00a0casualties happened there because of flooding.[12] In the coastal region of Legaspi, home to a large volcano, 150\u00a0houses were demolished due to storm surge, 25 of which were swept out at sea. Telephone lines were also cut off for four days in the city. Storm surge was also noted in coastal towns in the Sorsogon, Masbate, and Albay provinces.[13] In the latter, three villages were damaged.[14] Just south of the capital city of Manila, in the coastal town of Calapan on Mindoro Island,[15] 5,600 houses were damaged,[16] and 20,000\u00a0persons or 85% of the town's residents were left without a home.[15] Two fatalities were reported in the city.[17] In the fishing village of San Fernando on Masbate Island, 50\u00a0thatched huts were flattened.[18] Elsewhere, four people were killed and three others injured in Naujan, where 86 homes were either damaged or destroyed.[15] According to officials, 82 people were killed on the island of Samar.[19] Throughout the island, the system destroyed schools, residences, an airport terminal,[20] the government house in Catarman,[16] and a jail, enabling 11\u00a0prisoners to escape.[20] Most of damage to Samar was caused by collapsing houses and uprooted coconut trees hurled by the gusty winds.

Scotland saw its first snowfall since March, earlier in the year.[3] The Faroe Islands also reported winds up to 198\u00a0km/h (55\u00a0m/s; 123\u00a0mph)[4][5] and excessive damage. On 25 November, the Norwegian Weather Service named the storm 'Berit'.[6] Another storm, called Yoda, hit Scotland just a day after Xaver. The storm Yoda was widely known as Lille-Berit (Little-Berit) in Scandinavia, as the Norwegian Weather Service did not issue it with an official name.[7]"

Boats and debris were blown about, with some concern that oil might have leaked from a boat dashed against the rocks. Residents of a nursing home in Trongisv\u00e1gur were evacuated mid-storm as the roof was blown off.[6] The storm brought heavy snow over the mountains and large waves to the coastline of Scotland.[3] The UK Met Office issued severe weather warnings for strong winds and heavy rain for the end of November. One woman died after her car got swept into a loch in Harris on 25 November.[10] Twelve Caledonian MacBrayne ferries were cancelled from the Western Isles. Staff members had to move below 610\u00a0m (2,000\u00a0ft) on Ben Nevis as gale-force winds forced the gondola lifts to close.[11] Schools were closed on 25 November due to high winds.[12] The Forth, Skye, Tay, Erskine, Friarton and the Clackmannanshire Bridge had speed restrictions on 25 November.[13] A class II warning for Sweden was issued by SMHI, which means there is a danger to the public.[2] On 26 November, Statoil was forced to close three platforms due to high waves.[14] Waves were expected to reach 15\u00a0m (49\u00a0ft) along the Norwegian coastline.[15] In Stapnes, Norway 3 members of the Skumringslandet film crew were swept out to sea as they filmed the crashing waves. One managed to get back to shore, however the others did not. In Bergen a man was also killed after being hit by a falling tree. A landslide was also initiated close to Myrdal, which resulted in disruption to the Oslo-Bergen train service. There was also severe disruption to ferry services between the Scandinavian countries with thousands of passengers stranded.[16] In England the Environment Agency issued warnings of a storm surge to affect the East Coast on 27 November.[17] Whitby town centre was flooded with reports of flooding around the Tyne, Humber and Norfolk coast.[18][19][20] The highest tide in 14 years of measurement was recorded in Hull, where the Hull tidal barrier was lowered to protect the city.[21] The grey seal colony at Donna Nook in Lincolnshire was inundated during pupping season.[22] In Estonia 100\u00a0m3 (3,500\u00a0cu\u00a0ft) of birch timber were swept off the Lithuanian ship MS Alfalina 22\u00a0km (14\u00a0mi) west of Saaremaa.[23] Eesti Energia estimated that 6500 customers were without electricity countrywide in the wake of the storm, with even the Christmas tree in Tallinn being toppled by the strong wind.[24][25]"

The fire began on August 17, 2000, and was fully contained by September 9; it burned 55,261 acres (22,363 hectares) in total and resulted in minimal property damage or casualties. The cost of containing the Storrie Fire amounted to $22\u00a0million (equivalent to about $37\u00a0million in 2023). The fire was accidentally begun by Union Pacific Railroad workers, who were using a saw tool to repair train tracks in the Feather River Canyon near the community of Storrie. In an effort to recoup the costs of fire suppression as well as damages to federal lands, the U.S. government filed a lawsuit against Union Pacific over the Storrie Fire in 2006. Two years later, after a landmark ruling allowed the government to seek compensation for the full value of the land harmed by the fire, Union Pacific resolved the suit by paying the government a $102\u00a0million settlement."

The work involved using a saw to cut the rail before smoothing the cut with a grinder; the sawing process, later tests showed, could throw small fragments of hot metal nearly 40 feet away. The workers did not employ spark shields and did not clear the area of flammable material.[9] While they were cutting the rail, sparks ignited a bed of dry leaves. The crew made efforts to put out the resulting fire, though their accounts were not consistent. Fifteen minutes after they departed, ostensibly believing the fire extinguished, a train came by and the turbulence from its passage fanned the remaining embers.[10] When the fire was first spotted on a steep slope near Storrie later that afternoon, it was reported as 20 acres (8.1\u00a0ha) in size.[11] At 5:20\u00a0p.m., officials closed a 40-mile (64\u00a0km) section of Highway 70 in the Feather River Canyon between Jarbo Gap and the intersection of Highways 70 and 89.[8][12] By 8:00\u00a0p.m., the fire had burned 200 acres (81\u00a0ha).[8]"

Because of the steep and dangerous terrain, the nearly 1,000 assembled firefighters were unable to directly tackle the fire. The majority of the effort was instead carried out by nine fixed-wing air tankers and seven helicopters, dropping water and fire retardant. Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) de-energized two 230 kV electric power transmission lines to enable the aerial attack.[11] As Forest Service officials warned that the fire was advancing up through the Pacific Crest Trail, Plumas County sheriff's deputies searched for possible hikers or campers in its path on August 18.[11]As the winds pushed the fire north, the station chief for the Plumas National Forest speculated that the fire would burn for \"the rest of the summer\".[13] On August 19, windy conditions continued to drive the fire as the burned area more than doubled to about 11,000 acres (4,500\u00a0ha). The fire spotted (i.e. started a spot fire) more than one mile (1.6\u00a0km) ahead of the main fire front when embers were carried downwind into the Indian Creek drainage. The fire also jumped across the Feather River Canyon and Highway 70 for the first time near Rodgers Flat, beginning to burn in the Bucks Lake Wilderness. Voluntary evacuations were instituted for the Feather River Canyon communities of Belden, Seneca, Caribou Road, and Butt Lake, as well as the Three Lakes Campground near Bucks Lake. By evening the fire was burning in the lower portions of the Chips and Yellow Creek canyons and its perimeter was five percent contained.[14][15] On August 20, the fire burned another 6,000 acres (2,400\u00a0ha), bringing the total to more than 17,000 acres (6,900\u00a0ha). The fire continued to spot ahead of itself, though slackening winds smothered the region in thick smoke and reduced fire activity. Two dozen Forest Service dozers were positioned on the ridge west of the Feather River Canyon should the fire have progressed in that direction. That night more than 20,000 people temporarily lost power from Quincy and Lake Almanor to Susanville when the fire damaged electric power transmission infrastructure. Meanwhile, Highway 70 reopened, and containment of the fire perimeter notched upwards to seven percent.[16][17] On August 21, the fire grew to more than 20,000 acres (8,100\u00a0ha) by late afternoon, though smoky conditions prevailed again as 1,100 firefighters and aircraft continued to tackle the fire.[18] As it continued to burn north towards Lake Almanor, firefighters lit backfires to contain the fire's southwestern perimeter near Storrie and marked the fire 20 percent contained.[19] By August 28, it was about 40,000 acres (16,000\u00a0ha) and 62 percent contained.[20]"

Lassen forest officials proposed to conduct logging on 3,500 acres (1,400\u00a0ha) southwest of Lake Almanor. The forest's plan was appealed by several environmental groups, including the Sierra Club, and the appeal was upheld in October 2001 by the Forest Service regional forester for the Pacific Southwest Region over the plan's unproven benefits to fire danger and possible impacts to endangered species, such as the spotted owl and Pacific marten.[37] A similar 1,798-acre (728\u00a0ha) Plumas National Forest proposal was rejected the following November after environmental groups appealed.[38] Some environmentalists charged forest officials with attempting to pass healthy trees as doomed so as to log even more,[39] and by the time the projects were approved in August 2002\u2014two years after the fire\u2014the trees in question were beginning to rot and logging companies were disinterested.[40]"

Damrell Jr. ruled that the government could seek damages beyond just the destruction of timber and the cost of suppressing the fire. The ruling allowed for the government to seek at least $168\u00a0million, including for damage to habitat and wildlife, \"the area's grandeur\", as well as the loss of recreational usage; the judge also ruled that the government could seek reforestation costs.[10] In remarks on the ruling, U.S. Associate Attorney General Kevin J.

The money, after recouping costs from the $22\u00a0million spent on fire suppression, was directed to the Plumas and Lassen National Forests for alleviation of the ecological damage from the fire.[43][9] The settlement was agreed upon without requiring the five Union Pacific workers to admit liability for the Storrie Fire. A Union Pacific spokesperson said that \"We feel our employees did all the right things\" and called the circumstances of the fire's ignition \"extraordinary\".[9] In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Union Pacific noted that the company had incurred a $10\u00a0million liability at the time of the fire and that the settlement itself would be paid from insurance proceeds, leaving the company's 2008 earnings and cash flow unaffected.[42][44]"

        "content": " Typhoon Cimaron, known in the Philippines as Super Typhoon Paeng, was the most intense tropical cyclone to strike the Philippine island of Luzon since Typhoon Zeb in 1998.[1] Originating from a tropical depression on October\u00a025, Cimaron developed within an environment strongly favoring tropical cyclogenesis east of the Philippines. On October\u00a028, the system underwent rapid intensification, culminating in attaining its peak strength with winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph). Estimates from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ranked the system as a Category\u00a05-equivalent super typhoon with one-minute sustained winds of 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph), though this is argued to have underrepresented the typhoon's strength. The system moved ashore near Casiguran, Aurora in northern Luzon at peak strength. Crossing the island, Cimaron emerged over the South China Sea where conditions allowed for temporary reorganization. After becoming nearly stationary on November\u00a01, the typhoon executed a tight anti-cyclonic loop and rapidly weakened. The storm degenerated into a tropical depression on November\u00a04, before dissipating three days later off the coast of Vietnam. Prior to impacting the Philippines, Public Storm Warning Signals #3 and #4, the two highest levels, were raised for several provinces in Luzon. Thousands of residents were urged to evacuate while local authorities prepared services for quick recovery efforts. With Cimaron initially expected to strike Vietnam, officials planned to evacuate 218,000\u00a0people; however, Cimaron's slow motion and demise over open waters resulted in these plans being suspended. Officials in Thailand and southern China also advised residents of possible effects from the storm. In contrast to the typhoon's extreme intensity, damage was somewhat limited in the Philippines due to the lower population density of the affected areas. Widespread flooding and landslides caused substantial disruptions to travel and isolated some communities. Thirty-four people were killed in various incidents, mostly from flooding. Nearly 365,000\u00a0people were affected by the storm and losses amounted to 1.21\u00a0billion PHP (US$31\u00a0million).[nb 1] Winds along the periphery of Cimaron fanned a large wildfire near Hong Kong, and moisture from it fueled record-breaking rains in British Columbia, Canada.[2]  Relief efforts in the Philippines began soon after the storm's passage; however, two other storms struck the country in November, with one resulting in far greater damage. Following a request for international assistance in early December, more than US$10\u00a0million was provided in relief aid to the Philippines."

Situated south of a strong subtropical ridge, the system maintained a general west-northwest track.[1] On October\u00a027, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm and was assigned the name Cimaron by the JMA.[3][nb 4] The small storm subsequently underwent a period of rapid intensification as dual outflow channels developed;[1] the storm reached typhoon status early on October\u00a028. At the end of this phase on October\u00a029, Cimaron attained its peak intensity with winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph) and a barometric pressure of 920 mbar (hPa; 27.17\u00a0inHg).[3] The JTWC estimated Cimaron to have been a stronger system, attaining its peak intensity as a Category\u00a05-equivalent super typhoon with one-minute winds of 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph).[5][nb 5] However, satellite estimates from forecasters within the agency itself, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Satellite Analysis Branch (SAB), the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA), and Dr. Karl Hoarau of Cergy-Pontoise University stated Cimaron to have been an even stronger system. Using the Dvorak technique \u2013 a method of determining a tropical cyclone's intensity based on satellite appearance \u2013 AFWA and SAB yielded a peak value of T7.5, 285\u00a0km/h (177\u00a0mph), while advanced operational values from the JTWC peaked at T7.8, 305\u00a0km/h (190\u00a0mph). Additionally, a forecaster at SAB noted that the lower estimates were likely due to restrictions on the Dvorak technique stemming from Cimaron's rapid intensification. The forecaster also noted that a second type of estimate gave a maximum value of T8.0, 315\u00a0km/h (196\u00a0mph), the highest rating on the scale.[1] While at its peak strength, Cimaron displayed two small concentric eyewalls, separated by a few kilometres. The storm later made landfall near Casiguran, Aurora in northern Luzon shortly after 1200\u00a0UTC on October\u00a029;[1][3] it became one of the strongest storms to ever hit the region. Interaction with the island's mountainous terrain caused substantial weakening, though Cimaron maintained typhoon status during its 12\u2011hour crossing. After emerging over the South China Sea on October\u00a030, the system initially maintained its west-northwest course. However, the following day, a weakness developed within the ridge previously steering the typhoon, and Cimaron briefly turned north before essentially stalling.[1] During this time, the system reorganized somewhat and reached a secondary peak intensity with winds of 165\u00a0km/h (103\u00a0mph) on November\u00a02.[3] While executing a tight clockwise loop, increased wind shear and entrainment of dry air soon caused Cimaron to dramatically weaken. With a new ridge becoming established over China, the weakening system acquired a general southwestward track.[1] Cimaron weakened to a tropical depression on November\u00a04 and ultimately dissipated three days later, just off the coast of southeastern Vietnam.[3][5]"

        "content": "By October\u00a028, Isabela, southern Cagayan, Quirino, and northern Aurora provinces were placed under Public Storm Warning Signal (PSWS) #3, the second-highest level.[7] More than 20\u00a0provinces overall were placed under varying PSWS levels.[8] Residents living along the coast were urged to evacuate.[7] Early on October\u00a029, several provinces along Luzon's east coast were placed under PSWS #4, the highest level of alert.[9] During a national radio broadcast President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo urged residents to heed warnings and not to venture out during the storm.[10] Throughout Luzon, schools and government offices were closed on October\u00a029 while residents in mountainous areas were urged to evacuate due to threat of mudslides.[11] The National Transmission Corporation deployed power restoration crews across the region to allow for quick post-storm response.[12] Hospitals in Cimaron's projected path requested employees to be present in anticipation of an influx of patients. Quick response teams from the Department of Social Welfare and Development were placed on standby for possible deployment. Within evacuation areas, the Philippine National Police was dispatched to prevent people from returning to these areas. Bus companies suspended all services north of Tarlac City and San Jose.[7] As Cimaron emerged over the South China Sea, officials in Vietnam began preparing for possible effects from the storm.[13] Authorities began evacuating residents in flood-prone areas along the coast from Qu\u1ea3ng B\u00ecnh Kh\u00e1nh H\u00f2a,[14] including 12,500 in Th\u1eeba Thi\u00ean-Hu\u1ebf Province.[13] Fishermen were urged to seek shelter at nearby ports until the storm subsided. The Vietnamese Government also requested the deployment of the nation's Army, Coast Guard, and Navy to assist in evacuation efforts.[13] Residents still recovering from Typhoon Xangsane in early October were forced to secure their homes and evacuate once again. An estimated 218,000\u00a0people were planned to be relocated across Vietnam: 68,000 in Qu\u1ea3ng Nam, 60,000 in Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb, 50,000 in Th\u1eeba Thi\u00ean-Hu\u1ebf, and 40,000 in Qu\u1ea3ng B\u00ecnh.[15][16] Appeals were made to roughly 3,500\u00a0vessels, with a collective crew count of 32,285, to return to port. The Navy deployed 42\u00a0ships for possible search and rescue missions.[17] Following Cimaron's change in course and cessation of movement, the Vietnamese Government suspended all evacuation plans on November\u00a02; however, fishermen were urged to remain at port in fears of repeating the incidents during Typhoon Chanchu in May of that year where over 200\u00a0fishermen died.[18] Officials in Thailand also monitored the storm as a potential flood threat. Many reservoirs in the nation were above 80\u00a0percent capacity and further heavy rains would lead to a major flood event; the main concerns were for the Bhumibol and Sirikit dams in Tak and Uttaradit provinces, respectively.[19] Authorities in Hainan province, China, warned of possible effects from the storm as well beginning on October\u00a031. Heavy squalls, with winds of 50 to 100\u00a0km/h (31 to 62\u00a0mph) were forecast for eastern areas of the island and areas offshore.[20] By November\u00a01, approximately 20,000\u00a0fishing vessels returned to port as conditions over the South China Sea deteriorated; shipping over the Qiongzhou Strait remained unaffected.[21]"

Numerous trees and power lines were felled by the winds as well, causing widespread blackouts in Luzon.[23] The majority of Aurora and Isabela provinces were left without power and telecommunications for more than two weeks.[24] Approximately 90\u00a0percent of the homes in Dinapigue were damaged.[25] Heavy rains across the region swelled many rivers, flooding low-lying areas along their banks. Several bridges became impassable and officials had to release water from two major dams to prevent them from overflowing.[9] The most significant flooding occurred along the Allied-Sinocalan and Tagamusing rivers in Pangasinan. Low-lying areas along the Cagayan, Chico, Magat, Pinacanauan, Tuguegarao Pared rivers throughout Cagayan province were also affected by flooding.[26] Numerous roads were blocked off by landslides or washed away by flooding, severely limiting travel.[27] A landslide temporarily isolated four barangays in Nueva Vizcaya.[28] A Provincial Disaster Coordinating Council search and rescue team was later deployed to Kasibu where at least four people were killed by flooding.[22][27] Fatal landslides took place in Benguet and Kalinga provinces. A traffic accident blamed on the storm in La Union resulted in one death and seven injuries.[22] Throughout the Philippines, damage amounted to roughly 1.21\u00a0billion PHP (US$31\u00a0million), of which 664\u00a0million PHP (US$17\u00a0million) was attributed to agriculture.[29] Approximately eight\u00a0percent of the corn and rice harvest was destroyed.[25] A total of 2,605\u00a0homes were destroyed while another 18,181\u00a0were damaged. Across seven provinces, 364,733\u00a0people were affected by the typhoon, 65,585\u00a0of whom were significantly impacted.[24][29] A total of 34\u00a0people died as a result of Cimaron.[30] Additionally, 65\u00a0people sustained injuries.[29]"

At least 136\u00a0fires ignited on October\u00a030 during the Chung Yeung Festival. The Tai Lam fire grew to be the largest in over a decade, ultimately charring 450 hectares (1,100 acres) and 66,000\u00a0trees.[31] The storm's winds coupled with seasonally low humidity made conditions difficult for firefighters trying to suppress the fire.[32] Over the South China Sea, the 128\u00a0m (420\u00a0ft) long Chinese cargo ship, Tongda 998, became stranded amid 5\u00a0m (16\u00a0ft) swells and 75-to-88\u00a0km/h (47-to-55\u00a0mph) winds after its engine failed. All 18\u00a0crewmen were unharmed after the vessel was towed to port in Zhuhai by the rescue ship Dejin.[33] Moisture from the typhoon also fed an extratropical cyclone, in an atmospheric river known as the Pineapple Express,[2] that brought heavy rains to southern British Columbia, Canada, prompting flood watches for the region[34][35] Southern areas of the province were deluged by the storm, with some areas receiving 250 to 300\u00a0mm (9.8 to 11.8\u00a0in) of rain. The daily rainfall record for November\u00a06 of 20.6\u00a0mm (0.81\u00a0in) at Victoria International Airport was shattered with 50.4\u00a0mm (1.98\u00a0in) falling. Widespread flooding occurred as rivers over-topped their banks; hundreds of homes were inundated, prompting numerous evacuations. The Vedder River reached a 25-year high and forced the evacuation 200\u00a0residences.[36]"

        "content": "Damage assessments in the Philippines began on October\u00a031, with aerial surveys being utilized for isolated areas. With numerous roads blocked off or washed away, clearing operations were a priority.[28] The Philippine Red Cross assisted in the immediate aftermath of Typhoon Cimaron, evacuating people in La Union and providing relief goods to more than 16,000\u00a0people in Aurora.[37] The majority of relief work was handled by local governments, though some assistance from the National Disaster Coordinating Council was received. By November\u00a01, the estimated cost of humanitarian assistance reached 3.2\u00a0million PHP (US$81,000).[27] Teams from the Red Cross were already deployed in the Philippines due to Typhoon Xangsane in September and were able to quickly respond in Cimaron's aftermath. Relief efforts for Cimaron were cut short as just two weeks later, Typhoon Chebi struck nearly the same areas. A weaker, though still powerful typhoon, damage from Chebi was relatively limited.[24] In late November, Typhoon Durian brought even greater devastation to the Philippines and prompted greater need for international assistance. On December\u00a011, President Arroyo declared a national state of calamity and released 1\u00a0billion PHP (US$25.6\u00a0million) in relief and rehabilitation funds.[38] Throughout 2006 as a whole, the Philippines was devastated by multiple natural disasters that collectively killed well over 1,000\u00a0people and left more than US$1.6\u00a0billion in damage. Consequently, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs appealed for emergency assistance to the nation, in the form of US$46\u00a0million in funds for the most severely affected areas.[39][40] The European Commission Humanitarian Aid department also provided \u20ac2\u00a0million (US$1.9\u00a0million) in emergency funds in relation to the four major typhoons that struck the country, with a focus on areas affected by Typhoon Durian.[41] The Red Cross ultimately provided US$9.67\u00a0million in assistance to the nation in relation to the four typhoons as well as Typhoon Fengshen in June 2008 which struck while relief efforts from the 2006 storms were still ongoing.[42]"

Some reports called it the storm of the decade; BBC meteorologist Alex Deakin said, \"Saturday's storm is being described as the most damaging since that of December 1999 which killed 88 people.\" Mich\u00e8le Alliot-Marie, the French interior minister, stated that in addition to the 300 civil security agents located in the Landes region of France, another 715 agents would be deployed. In Bordeaux's Gironde region, 19 residents of a retirement home were evacuated by rescuers after the rooftop blew away. Authorities also evacuated campers from the pine forests in Les Landes. Thousands were evacuated from nearby housing estates in La Nuc\u00eda, north of Benidorm in Alicante, as the Spanish Army helped to fight a forest fire, which was started by a felled electricity pylon. There were also wildfires in the region of Catalonia, while Spain put emergency services on high alert. Waves over 20 metres high were registered off the northern coast of Spain and dolphins were stranded on beaches in the region as a result of high winds.[5] The storm left millions without electricity mobile telephone, including 1-1-2."

Storm Eunice was named by the UK Met Office on 14 February 2022. A red weather warning was issued on 17 February for parts of South West England and South Wales, with a second red warning issued on 18 February, the day the storm struck, for London, the South East and East of England. Eunice set a new record for the fastest wind gust recorded in England with 122 miles per hour (196\u00a0km/h) at The Needles, Isle of Wight. The storm was one of the most powerful to impact the south coast of England since the Great Storm of 1987.[7] The storm caused a huge amount of damage in parts of Western, Central and Northern Europe; millions of people were left without power across affected areas, and many homes had sustained damage. The UK was particularly hard hit, with 1.4 million homes left without power at its peak. Several other countries were struck hard by Eunice, with wind damage being mostly the cause of it. Heavy winds damaged parts of buildings, and wind gusts in excess of 120 miles per hour (190\u00a0km/h) were recorded. Eunice caused 17 fatalities, and multiple injuries."

On the evening of June 13, they reportedly lit numerous fireworks, and ignited several burn piles they subsequently failed to ensure were properly extinguished before retiring for the evening. The following afternoon reports came in to local authorities of a fire near their cabin, including a 911 call Dewitt herself made, though she reportedly did not offer any identifying details to the operator, including the specific address of the fire. The couple later admitted to investigators that they then quickly fled the cabin, leaving behind numerous items out in the open. They told the police they did so because a \"a wall of fire\" coming from forest onto their property made it dangerous to remain. They stopped along the road and advised other local residents to flee as well. The couple was found not guilty on all charges in 2017.[12] Prior to trial, fire investigators excluded fireworks as the cause of the fire. In addition, the point of origin for the fire was not on the Imigs' property. The prosecution theory, therefore, focused on the possibility that heat from a burn pile the day before had traveled through the subsurface peat until it encountered and ignited microfuels deeper in the forest. That theory was disputed by the defense wildfire experts."

        "content": " A civil defense siren is a siren used to provide an emergency population warning to the general population of approaching danger. Initially designed to warn city dwellers of air raids (air-raid sirens) during World War II, they were later used to warn of nuclear attack and natural disasters, such as tornadoes (tornado sirens). The generalized nature of sirens led to many of them being replaced with more specific warnings, such as the broadcast-based Emergency Alert System and the Cell Broadcast-based Wireless Emergency Alerts and EU-Alert mobile technologies. By use of varying tones or binary patterns of sound, different alert conditions can be called. Electronic sirens can transmit voice announcements in addition to alert tone signals. Siren systems may be electronically controlled and integrated into other warning systems."

        "header": "Sirens in integrated public warning systems",
        "content": "Sirens are sometimes integrated into a warning system that links sirens with other warning media, such as the radio and TV Emergency Alert System, NOAA Weather Radio, telephone alerting systems, Reverse 911, Cable Override, and wireless alerting systems in the United States and the National Public Alerting System, Alert Ready, in Canada. This fluid approach enhances the credibility of warnings and reduces the risk of assumed false alarms by corroborating warning messages through multiple forms of media. The Common Alerting Protocol is a technical standard for this sort of multi-system integration.[2] Siren installations have many ways of being activated. Commonly used methods are dual-tone multi-frequency signaling (DTMF) or public switched telephone network (PSTN) using telephone lines, but activation can also be done via radio broadcast. This method opens up vulnerability for exploitation, but there are protections from false alarms. These sirens can also be tied into other networks such as a fire department's volunteer notification/paging system. The basics of this type of installation would consist of a device (possibly the same pager the firefighters have) connected to the controller/timer system of the siren. When a page is received, the siren is activated.[3]"

        "content": "A mechanical siren uses a rotor and stator to chop an air stream, which is forced through the siren by radial vanes in the spinning rotor. An example of this type of siren is the Federal Signal 2T22, which was originally developed during the Cold War and produced from the early 1950s to the late 1980s. This particular design employs dual rotors and stators to sound each pitch. Because the sound power output of this type of siren is the same in every direction at all times, it is described as omnidirectional. The Federal 2T22 was also marketed in a 3-signal configuration known as the Federal Signal 3T22, with the capability for a \"hi-lo\" (High-Low) signal.[5] While some mechanical sirens produce sound in all directions simultaneously, other designs produce sound in only one direction, while employing a rotator mechanism to turn the siren head through 360 degrees of rotation. One rare type of mechanical siren, the Federal Signal RSH-10 (\"Thunderbeam\"), does not rotate or produce equal sound output in all directions. It instead uses a slowly rotating angled disc below the siren which directs the siren's output throughout 360 degrees.[6]"

        "header": "Supercharged",
        "content": "A variation of the electromechanical siren is a \"supercharged\" siren. A supercharged siren uses a separate source, usually a supercharger-like blower, which forces air into the rotor assembly of the siren. This increases the air pressure in the rotor assembly, causing the sound output of the siren to increase heavily, which in return increases the sound range by a large amount. The blower is generally driven by an electric motor, but in rare cases, can be driven by an engine. Federal Signal took advantage of this design and created their Thunderbolt Siren Series, utilizing Sutorbilt Roots Blowers of different varieties and outputs.[7][8][9][10] Within the Thunderbolt product line, three different configurations were offered: the Thunderbolt 1000, a single-tone siren; the Thunderbolt 1000T, a dual-tone siren; and the Thunderbolt 1003, a variation of the 1000T that employs solenoid-actuated slide valves to create a \"hi-lo\" (High-Low) signal primarily used as a fire signal.[11] A very early model called the Thunderbolt 2000 was offered in both single tone and dual tone. The only notable difference between the Thunderbolt 2000 and later editions is that its blower is driven by an Onan two cylinder gasoline engine.[12] Another example of a siren that has a separate blower is the Alerting Communicators of America (ACA) Hurricane. One more example of a siren with a blower is the SoCal Edison Model 120, utilizing a Centrifugal Style Blower, built specifically for the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station. The SoCal Edison Model 120 is no longer standing out in public, as only one exists, and is owned privately.[13]"

        "header": "Pneumatic",
        "content": "Another variation on the electromechanical siren is the pneumatic siren. Similar to supercharged sirens, pneumatic sirens also force air into the rotor assembly of the siren. However, these sirens use a pressurized air reservoir instead of a motor-driven blower.[14] hochleistungssirene (HLS), first produced by the German firm Pintsch-Bamag and later by the German firm H\u00f6rmann. Soon afterward, H\u00f6rmann improved on the design to create the HLS 273, which did away with the massive siren head of the original in favor of a more compact head and cast aluminum exponential-profile horns. These sirens stored a reservoir of compressed air, recharged periodically by a diesel engine-driven compressor in a vault in the base of the massive siren unit. The later HLS 273 placed the large (6,000 liter) air tank underground beside the machinery vault, instead of in the mast itself as in the earlier HLS units."

        "header": "Electronic sirens",
        "content": "Electronic sirens consist of an electronic tone generator, a high-power amplifier, and a horn loudspeaker. Typically, the loudspeaker unit incorporates horn loading, causing them to be similar in appearance to some electromechanical sirens. Many of these loudspeakers incorporate a vertical array of horns to achieve pattern control in the vertical plane. Each cell of the loudspeaker horn is driven by one or more compression drivers. One type of compression driver for this type of loudspeaker uses two doughnut-shaped permanent magnet slugs to provide magnetic flux. For siren applications, high-fidelity sound is a secondary concern to high output, and siren drivers typically produce large amounts of distortion which would not be tolerable in an audio system where fidelity is important. Most newer (and some older) electronic sirens have the ability to store digital audio files. These audio files could be custom sounds, or emergency messages.[15] Depending on the situation, the stored sound file can broadcast through the siren.[16] These sirens could also come with a Microphone Jack to broadcast live messages via microphone.[17] As with electromechanical sirens, there are both omnidirectional, directional, and rotating categories. Whelen Engineering produces sirens which oscillate through 360 degrees, rotating in one direction and then in the other to allow a hard-wired connection between the amplifiers and the siren drivers.[18] These sirens can also be set to rotate any amount from 0 to 360 degrees, allowing sirens to broadcast only in certain directions.[citation needed] Electronic sirens may be mechanically rotated to cover a wide area, or may have transducers facing in all directions to make an omnidirectional pattern. A directional siren may be applied where notification is only required for a defined area in one direction.[19]"

All the other sirens are HPSS32 models made by Acoustic Technologies (ATI). During the early 2010s, mechanical sirens were gradually phased out and replaced by electronic ones, although the mechanical ones were generally left standing. The air-raid sirens are called \u05d0\u05d6\u05e2\u05e7\u05d4 (az'aka 'alarm'), and consist of a continuous ascending and descending tone. The \"all clear\" signal, called \u05e6\u05e4\u05d9\u05e8\u05ea \u05d4\u05e8\u05d2\u05e2\u05d4 (tzfirat harga'a), is a constant single-pitch sound. In recent conflicts, use of the \"all clear\" signal has been discontinued, as it was seen as causing unnecessary confusion and alarm. In certain regions in the south of Israel, which regularly undergo rocket attacks from Gaza, a specialized system called Red Color is used. There is an earthquake warning system in Israel, which uses the sirens, which called \"\u05ea\u05e8\u05d5\u05e2\u05d4\" (Trua). The \"all clear\" signal is used three times per year to denote a moment of silence (of one or two minutes): once on Israel's Holocaust Remembrance Day and twice on the Day of Remembrance."

        "content": "In Germany, the Warn\u00e4mter ('warning authorities') were closed in the 1990s after the threat of the Cold War was over, since the ability to alert the public was then considered unnecessary. As the civil defense sirens were also frequently used to alert volunteer firefighters, many sirens were sold to municipalities for a symbolic price; others were dismantled. In the 2000s, it was realized that the ability to warn the public is not only necessary in cases of war, but also in events like natural disasters, chemical or nuclear accidents, or terrorist attacks. As a result, some cities like D\u00fcsseldorf and Dresden began to rebuild their warning sirens. In Hamburg, the sirens are still operational. They also warn the public during storm surges; for instance, all towns in the Moselle Valley continue to operate and test their warning sirens. The majority of operational sirens in Germany are either electric-mechanical type E57 or electronic sirens. There are no precise official numbers as to how many sirens there used to be, as most of the documents regarding the system's construction and upkeep have been disposed of after the Cold War ended. However, estimates place the number of operational sirens during the system's peak at around 80,000 in West Germany alone. Accounts as to how many of those sirens are still in operation vary significantly depending on the source. The most prominent German company regarding manufacturing and maintenance of sirens, H\u00f6rmann Industries, states on its website that they are in charge of maintaining over 60,000 sirens. Granted, that includes mobile sirens that can be mounted on vehicles, but one can deduct from this information that there could be at least around 50,000 stationary sirens still in operation today, many of the once electro-mechanical sirens having been replaced with newer electronic models. During World War\u00a0II, Berlin's air raid sirens became known by the city's residents as \"Meier's trumpets\" or \"Meier's hunting horns\" due to Luftwaffe chief Hermann Goering's boast that \"If a single bomb ever falls on Berlin, you can call me Meier!\".[38] Audio sample of an older mechanical siren in Germany\u24d8 "

        "header": "Hungary",
        "content": "The wail of the sirens in Hungary go back as far as World War 2, when the country was destroyed by enemy raiders. The installation of sirens over the country was requested by the Minister of National Defence in 1938. Sirens were built by many different companies, some were manufactured here in Hungary with a license from the original company. The \"FM Si 41\" Siren originates from Germany, the \"TESLA/Braun-Bovery\" siren originates from a Swiss company, and the \"EKA\" series and \"DINAMO\" sirens were made right here in Hungary. There were 25 air raid warning zones in Hungary back then, which means that only the bigger towns and cities had electric sirens. The rest of the country used hand-crank sirens, the warnings were also given out by radios. The electric sirens were controlled via phone lines and could have been set off from a central location in the town like a city hall, fire station, local military or a post office. In the beginnings, there were only 2 siren signals, similar to Britain's siren signals, \"Red Alert/Air Raid Warning\", which meant that danger is coming and \"All Clear\", which meant that people can come out of their shelter. In 1944, they changed the signals, when enemy raiders were in a 150 km radius, a signal called \"Air Warning\" would be sounded, 30 seconds of continous siren sound. When the enemy raiders were 15 minutes away, the original \"Red Alert/Air Raid Warning\" would be sounded. When the attack was over the \"Air Warning Over\" signal would be sounded. And finally, when the enemy raiders left the 150km radius, the \"All Clear\" would be sounded. After war, siren installations continued throught the country, the towns that didn't have sirens before were equipped with sirens with the same type of sirens that were used in the war, because those were kept in production even after the war. In the 1960s, because Hungary had some trouble with the Soviet Union, they became a communist country as well, so they had to choose from the sirens that were produced in other communist countries like Czechoslovakia, East Germany. The plan was to replace the ageing sirens that remained from the War, so in the early 1970s, a massive siren-replacement program began. Nearly all of the sirens were replaced with the DDR DS977 and MEZ Sirens. Some of the siren types that were used during the war were also still being made at this point, so it's possible that you might see \"WW2-Type Like\" sirens in some cities, towns or villages, but those are probably not from WW2. The sirens installed during the 70s were the property of the National Civil Defense and they still are. The time this System was installed, the controls were a bit different, this time the remote control wasn't run by telephone lines, this time it was controlled by sound frequencies (don't ask me how that works, I'm writing this from like 30-40 Year old, archived manuals that were given to Civil Defense workers) What that manual says is that every police station or fire station or local Civil Defense office had a siren control machine that was supposed to give out the frequencies that activated the sirens in the surrounding towns and villages. The manual said that during check-ups, this equipment most not be used to test the sirens, that's why the Civil Defense workers had to go to every siren location that was registered to their station (every county has around 3-4 Civil Defense stations, that is/was supposed to do check-ups and growl tests on the sirens near the surrounding towns and villages). Tha manual also said that the remote control can only be used if there is a real emergency or war. It was a really rare thing to see later Cold War sirens equipped with phone line controls, but they did in fact exist, mostly around nuclear shelters. In the late 1990s, the remote control was deemed unstable/unreliable and because of the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the idea of war was unlikely and the National Warning System was abandoned. Years went by and in the mid 2000s, the MoLaRi System was built around factories that work with hazard materials to warn the locals in case something goes wrong in there. These Systems are being installed near facilities that work with hazard materials even to this day. Moving on to 2011, they held a National Civil Defense Drill to see how many of the sirens still work that were abandoned since a decade. Many of them didn't work, after this some counties decided to repair the sirens and start doing yearly growl tests again, but some abandoned them again, but a very few cities/counties kept the sirens active and they are still doing repairs, check-ups, and yearly full or growl tests, like Gy\u0151r-Moson-Sopron county, Heves county, Hajd\u00fa-Bihar county, J\u00e1sz-Nagykun-Szolnok county. In 2014 they started testing the MoLaRi sirens near the facilites that work with hazard materials, this date is the first monday of the month at 11AM, this is the siren test you Will most likely catch if you visit Hungary, because they are found in a big part of Budapest. And for the rest of the country, sirens are either fully removed or left to rot in place, because it's cheaper to not remove them. What's weird is that on paper, these sirens should still be active, because the emergency plans for towns still say that the citizens Will be alarmed with the use of sirens, which Will be hard if the sirens do not work or do not even exist anymore. And you may ask, \"If these sirens are deconmissioned, why can't they give it to collectors?\" That's a very good question and the reason why is that the government does everything to destroy these sirens and won't let them get into the hands of regular people, because \"they might cause panic\" if they turn it on\", some siren enthusiasts have reported that sirens can rarely be found in scrapyards, but it's unsure if they are allowed to give you the sirens. So there is no \"legal way\" to get a siren, the only way I could think of getting a siren here is that if you have a family member or friend at the Civil Defense they might be able to give you a siren, but even then you won't be able to sound it, because again, it might cause panic. The Civil Defense is currently relying on radio, TV, phone alerts to warn the population in case of an emergency, some emergency plans also say that they could warn the locals with the chruch bells. And for last, here are the current siren signals, that could be given out by MoLaRi, H\u00d6RMANN, and on the old sirens at places where they still maintain them: Air-Raid alert signal on the civil defense alarm system: a siren sound of alternating pitch (between 280 Hz and 400 Hz) repeated three times in a row, lasting 30 seconds, with 30 second pauses between signals Emergency alarm signal: continuous siren sound with alternating pitch (between 133 Hz and 400 Hz) for 120 seconds The signal that the alarm has passed: a siren sound with a constant pitch (400 Hz) repeated twice in a row for 30 seconds, with a 30-second pause between the signals (Figure 3).\nThe alarm past signal also applies to the cancellation of the air raid warning and the disaster alarm past signal. Test - In the first part of the waveforms used during the test, a signal ramping up to 400 Hz is emitted for a duration of 6 seconds, after which the signal decays"

Production was entrusted to La Sonora, founded in 1911 and still active today.[39] During World War\u00a0II, every town had a siren, and several were present in each large city. Even after the danger of bombings had ended, they were kept to provide warning in case of any threat (e.g. high water in Venice). As of 2015, some of them still survive. For instance, as many as 34 have been located in Rome using crowdsourcing. Up until the 1980s, they underwent routine maintenance and sounded at noon.[40] Additionally, the Protezione Civile (Civil Protection) operates sirens to warn the public in case of a threat to the citizen population. Protezione Civile also provides transport needs and military defence for the Government of Italy. These defence systems were put in place in the 1990s and are occasionally still used today.[41] Urbania, Italy has a British Secomak GP3 air raid siren which is annually activated in honor of the Bombing in Urbania, which took place during World War II. Ferrara, Italy has a system of Whelen (remodeled HSS-TWS series) sirens that warn of industrial risks in the area. [42]"

Originally, each street had a small siren on top of a high-rise building, which could be powered mechanically. During World War\u00a0II, the sirens had a single continuous tone to warn of an air strike.[47] Throughout the Cold War, larger sirens were manufactured locally and installed on various public buildings and residences.[48] The sirens were able to transmit a comprehensive variety of tones, each with a different meaning such as a chemical disaster, an earthquake, a flood, or an imminent air or nuclear strike; each of these tones required the population to either move to higher ground or an ABC shelter. An \"all clear\" signal was played after the area had been deemed safe for the general public.[citation needed] Since the 1990s, civil defense sirens have been replaced by electronic sirens and the procedure has been simplified. As of 2013, there are four playable tones: a natural disaster warning, an upcoming air/nuclear strike, an imminent air/nuclear strike, and an \"all clear\" signal. Taking shelter is no longer a legal requirement, although ABC shelters are still operational.[49] In August 2017, Romanian authorities started to perform monthly defence siren tests. The first such test took place on 2 August 2017 and is scheduled to be repeated on the first Wednesday of each month, between 10:00 and 11:00\u00a0am local time.

These sirens were first tested in 1931, and were mounted to cars and bikes sent out by the government. The sirens can be found on tall buildings all around Sweden. They are driven by compressed air in giant tanks, but are successively being replaced by modern electronic sirens which use speakers. The emergency services are also able to send out spoken messages through the new sirens. The outdoor signals used are as follows: The outdoor sirens are tested four times a year on the first non-holiday Monday of March, June, September, and December at 15:00 local time. The test consists of the general alarm for 2 minutes, followed by a 90-second gap before the \"all clear\" is sounded. There are usually around 15 to 20 general alarms, occurring locally, per year. The most common cause of general alarms is fire, specially in situations that involve industries, landfills, and other facilities containing dangerous substances which can create hazardous smoke. The 2018 peak in alarms (54 that year) is attributed to the 2018 Sweden wildfires which alone caused over 20 general alarms.

        "content": "During World War\u00a0II, Britain had two warning tones: These tones would be initiated by the Royal Observer Corps after spotting Luftwaffe aircraft coming toward Britain, with the help of coastal radar stations. The \"red warning\" would be sounded when the Royal Observer Corps spotted enemy aircraft in the immediate area. The sirens were tested periodically by emitting the tones in reverse order, with the \"all clear\" tone followed by the \"red warning\" tone. This ensured the public would not confuse a test with a real warning.[citation needed] Every village, town, and city in the United Kingdom used to have a network of dual-tone sirens to warn of incoming air raids during World War\u00a0II. The operation of the sirens was coordinated by a wire broadcast system via police stations. In towns and cities with a population of over 3,000, powered sirens were used, whereas in rural areas hand-operated sirens were used (which were later put to use as warnings for nuclear attack during the Cold War). At the end of the Cold War in 1992, the siren network was decommissioned, and very few remain.[61] These sirens, mostly built by Carter, Gents, Castle Castings, and Secomak (now Klaxon Signal Co.), have 10 and 12 ports to create a minor third interval (B\u266d and D\u266d notes) and are probably the world's most recognised World War\u00a0II air raid siren sound. Recordings of British sirens are often dubbed into movies set in countries which never used this type of siren.[citation needed] Around 1,200 sirens remain, mostly used to warn the public of severe flooding. They are also used for public warning near gas or nuclear power plants, nuclear submarine bases, oil refineries and chemical plants. The remaining sirens are a mix of older motor driven models (usually from World War\u00a0II), such as the Carter siren manufactured by Carter's of Nelson or the \"syren\" manufactured by Gent's of Leicester, and Cold War like Castle Castings and Secomak (now Klaxon Signal Co.) and newer electronic sirens like Hormann ECN, Whelen, Federal Signal Modulator, ATI HPSS and COOPER WAVES. Most of them usually tested annually between August and September if they're not in a siren system. They are also used to start and finish silences on Armistice Day and Remembrance Sunday[62] There was a siren system consisted mainly of Castle Castings and 2 Secomak GP3s for their flood warning system sector. When MoD was decommissioning these systems across the country, Norfolk kept their sector back for flood warning. With the advent of digital services and mobile technology, many local authorities are now retiring their siren networks in favour of contacting people by telephone. In January 2007, proposals to retire a network of sirens in Norfolk were made by the Norfolk Resilience Forum. In November 2007, residents were angered after the sirens had not sounded following a tidal surge in Walcott. In 2008, a review of the current and future role of flood warning sirens was undertaken by Norfolk County Council, after plans to retire them were halted following concerns from nearby residents.[63] Although some of the sirens were initially withdrawn, 40 out of the 57 were eventually temporarily reinstated.[64] Despite this, in July 2010 the flood warning sirens were finally retired in favour of alerting people by telephone, SMS or e-mail. After three years of consultations, the council had failed to demonstrate that refurbishing the sirens would be a worthwhile investment.[65] The whole siren system was completely gone by late 2013, with only 2 sirens remaining, which are both inactive with one of them refurbished and put on display on a beach not far from its original location, and another, in Mundesley Fire Station, just standing there, extremely unlikely to ever sound again. Lincolnshire, which had one of the largest siren systems in the country consisting of Carters,[66] had 46 sirens based in North Somercotes, Mablethorpe, Boston, Skegness, Spalding and Sutton Bridge, as well as inland at Louth, Horncastle, Middle Rasen and Gainsborough, the areas most at risk of being hit by floods.[67][68] Following serious flooding in the summer of 2007, investigations took place into how the flood warning system could be improved. The Environment Agency admitted that the warning system in Louth had not sounded early enough.[69] In April 2008, Lincolnshire County Council began to investigate the possibility of replacing the flood warning sirens with mobile phone alerts.[70] A council report in November 2009 described the sirens as being \"outdated, in the wrong places and difficult to repair\".[71] The sirens were eventually decommissioned in November 2011 and replaced with Floodline.[72] In January 2010, 13 public warning sirens on the island of Guernsey that had first been installed in 1937 were due to be retired and replaced by text messages. This followed claims by the Home Department that the sirens had \"reached the end of their useful working life\". The sirens had previously been used to warn of major incidents.[73] From 1950 to 2010, the Civil Defence Committee took responsibility for the sirens, and had tested them annually since 9 May 1979.[74] Members of the public had criticised the decision,[61] and Deputy Janine Le Sauvage claimed that sirens were the only way everyone knew there was an emergency.[75] In February 2010, 40 islanders formed a protest march opposing the proposal to retire the sirens.[76] The campaigners accused the government of not listening to them, as an online petition calling for the sirens to be saved was signed by more than 2,000 people.[77] In April 2010, it was decided to dismantle the public warning system.[78] Emergency planners had proposed to use a new warning system that would contact residents by telephone; however, this was abandoned due to technical limitations and local media and other communication methods are used instead.[79] Only 2 remain in Guernsey, one in Victoria Tower, which sounded off once at around 2017, and another, active for a quarry. Following severe flooding in Upper Calder Valley in June 2000, the Environment Agency replaced its network of sirens, with eight being placed around Walsden, Todmorden, Hebden Bridge and Mytholmroyd. The network was designed to complement the agency's Floodline service.[80] These sirens became what is now known as the Todmorden Flood Warning System. There are 9 sirens that are part of the system, 5 of them being Secomak, 3 of them being Klaxon and one of them being Carter (which was recently confirmed to be inactive according to the local environment agency). In November 2010, 36 flood warning sirens in Essex, including nine on Canvey, were retired following concerns from the county council that the system was \"no longer fit for purpose\".[81] The sirens were due to become obsolete in 2014.[82] Only 5 sirens from the entire system remain, 2 of them in Canvey Island. In September 2012, new flood warning sirens were installed in the Dunhills Estate in Leeds, as part of flood defence work at Wyke Beck.[83] In January 2014, flood sirens sounded for the first time in 30 years on the Isle of Portland.[84] Broadmoor Hospital used 13 sirens installed in 1952, which were tested weekly.[85] These were consisted of Secomak CS8s, which were similar to a Secomak GP8 except the CS8 had coded shutters which could do an alternating hi-lo signal, and if designed to do so, could also do a pulse signal. For emergencies, they sounded the hi-lo and for all clear, they sounded a steady tone. In tests, they would sound the all-clear. In July 2014, plans were put forward to retire 7 of the 13 alarms, which had last been properly activated in 1993.[86] The alarms are located in areas such as Sandhurst, Wokingham, Bracknell, Camberley and Bagshot.[87] In June 2016, the West London Mental Health Trust, who manages the hospital, proposed decommissioning the sirens altogether and replacing them with social media alerts through websites such as Twitter.[88] In December 2019, this entire system was decommissioned, in favour of a new Electronic siren located at the hospital. This siren is tested silently, however on occasion (with prior notice from the hospital) it is audibly tested, but not at full volume. A similar siren system in Carstairs, Scotland, called the Carstairs Hospital Siren System, uses 9 sirens, 7 of them being Secomak CS8, 1 being a Klaxon GP8 and 1 being Secomak GP12. The hi-lo signal is rarely used since during emergencies, they sound a continuous tone for 8 minutes and in all clear, they sound a long wail, consisting of 30 seconds startup and alert and a 30-second wind-down 3 times. Test schedule is the third Thursday of every month at 1PM with the all-clear. There are several sirens in use around Avonmouth near Bristol to warn of chemical incidents from industry in the area. These are known as the Severnside Sirens. These sirens consist of Federal Signal Modulators and two DSAs, which were installed in 1997 for the public. The system is tested every third day of every month at 3PM. This consists of rising tones and a steady pulsing tone, followed by a steady tone for all clear. In emergencies, they will run for as long as the batteries can allow since they are off-grid powered."

The system was maintained until the 1970s, when advancements in military technology reduced the Soviet nuclear missile strike time from 3\u20135 hours to less than 15 minutes. Sirens can still be found in many Canadian cities, all in various states of repair. In Toronto, for instance, the network has been abandoned to the point where no level of government will take responsibility for its ownership.[90] A handful of sirens still remain in Toronto in older established neighbourhoods: Sirens have recently been built within 3 kilometers (2 miles) of the Darlington and Pickering nuclear power plants in the province of Ontario. (Both plants are within 30 kilometers; 20 miles of each other.) These sirens will sound in the event of a nuclear emergency that could result in a release of radioactivity. Sirens have also been placed (and are tested weekly) in Sarnia, Ontario due to the large number of chemical plants in the vicinity.[91][92] These consist mainly of ATI HPSS32 sirens, as well as a Federal Signal Modulator in the rail yards and 3 Thunderbolt 1003s located at the Suncor plant.[93][94]\nSirens have also been installed in and around the Grey Bruce Nuclear Generating Station. The sirens are on the plant and in the surrounding communities such as Tiverton, Ontario. One notable siren is a Federal Signal Modulator at the Bruce Nuclear Visitor's Centre. The Public Siren network as it is called, consists of mostly Whelens, Modulators, and Model 2s. One of the sirens in this network (a Model 2) is at Tiverton, which is about 10\u00a0km (6 miles) from the plant. Many warning sirens in Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta are now used as tornado warning instruments. Smithers, British Columbia uses an old air raid siren as a noon-day whistle. New Waterford, Nova Scotia uses a siren to signal the daily curfew. One of the warning sirens was even used as a goal horn for the Quebec Nordiques between the mid-1980s and 1991. Caledonia, Ontario routinely uses an air raid siren to call in their local volunteer firefighters to the fire hall.

        "header": "United States",
        "content": "In the United States, several sets of warning tones have been used that have varied due to age, government structure, and manufacturer. The initial alerts used during World War\u00a0II were the alert signal (a 3\u20135-minute steady, continuous siren tone) and the attack signal (a 3\u20135-minute warbling tone, or series of short tone bursts on devices incapable of warbling, such as whistles). The Victory Siren manual stated that when a manual generation of the warbling tone was required, it could be achieved by holding the \"Signal\" switch on for 8 seconds and off for 4 seconds. In 1950, the Federal Civil Defense Administration revised the signals, naming the alert signal \"red alert\" and adding an \"all clear\" signal, characterized by three 1-minute steady blasts with 2 minutes of silence between the blasts.[95] Beginning in 1952, the Bell and Lights Air Raid Warning System,[96] developed by AT&T, was made available to provide automated transmission of an expanded set of alert signals: The \"yellow alert\" and \"red alert\" signals correspond to the earlier \"alert\" signal and \"attack\" signal, respectively, and the early Federal Signal AR timer siren control units featured the \"take cover\" button labeled with a red background and the \"alert\" button labeled with a yellow background. Later AF timers changed the color-coding, coloring the \"alert\" button blue, the \"take cover\" button yellow, and the \"fire\" button red (used to call out volunteer firefighters), thus confusing the color-coding of the alerts. In 1955, the Federal Civil Defense Administration again revised the warning signals, altering them to deal with concern over nuclear fallout. The new set of signals were the \"alert\" signal (unchanged) and the \"take cover\" signal (previously the \"attack\" signal). The \"all clear\" signal was removed because leaving a shelter while fallout was present would prove hazardous.[97] Sirens began to replace bells for municipal warning in the early 1900s, but became commonplace following America's entry into World War\u00a0II. Most siren models of this time were single-tone models which often sounded almost an octave higher in pitch than their European counterparts. Dual-tone sirens became more common in the 1950s, but had been used in some areas since about 1915. During the Cold War, standard signals were used throughout the country for civil defense purposes, referred to as \"alert\" and \"attack.\" Volunteer fire departments generally used a different siren signal. Many towns, especially in California and New England, used coded air horns or diaphones for fire calls and reserved sirens for civil defense use. Today, signals are determined by state and local authorities, and can vary from one region to another. The most common tones produced by sirens in the United States are \"alert\" (steady) and \"attack\" (wail). Other tones include Westminster Chimes (commonly used for the testing of electronic sirens), hi-lo (high-low), whoop, pulse (pulsing), air horn, and fast wail. The U.S. federal standard regarding emergency warning signals is defined in FEMA's Outdoor Warning Systems Guide, CPG 1\u201317,[98] published on March 1, 1980, which describes the Civil Defense Warning System (CDWS) and its warning signals. The language was slightly revised by FEMA's National Warning System Operations Manual, Manual 1550.2[99] published 03-30-2001: The most common tone, \"alert\", is widely used by municipalities to warn citizens of impending severe weather, particularly tornadoes which have earmarked the sirens as \"Tornado Sirens\". This practice is nearly universal in the Midwest and parts of the Deep South, where intense and fast-moving thunderstorms that can produce tornadoes occur frequently. The \"alert\" sound is a steady, continuous note. In seaside towns, \"alert\" may also be used to warn of a tsunami. Sirens that rotate will have a rising-and-falling tone as the direction of the horn changes. The \"attack\" tone is the rising and falling sound of an air raid or nuclear attack, frequently heard in war movies. It was once reserved for imminent enemy attack, but is today sometimes used to warn of severe weather, tsunamis, or even fire calls, depending on local ordinance. There is no standard \"fire\" signal in the United States, and while the use of sirens by volunteer fire departments is still common, it is diminishing. In the dry areas of the American West, residents may be required to shut off outdoor water systems to ensure adequate pressure at fire hydrants upon hearing the signal. The \"fire\" signal can vary from one community to another. Three long blasts on a siren is one common signal, similar to the signal used by volunteer brigades in Germany and other countries, while other locales use the hi-lo (high-low) signal described above. Some communities, particularly in New England and northern California, make use of coded blasts over a diaphone or air horn for fire signals, reserving the use of sirens for more serious situations. Still others use the \"attack\" tone as their fire call. Some communities make use of an \"all clear\" signal, or sound separate signals for fire calls and ambulance runs. Some fire signals in the U.S. are often blasted at least once a day, mostly at noon, to test the system, and are often referred to as \"noon sirens\" or \"noon whistles\". These also function as a time tick for setting clocks.[citation needed] CPG 1-17 recommends that a monthly test be conducted, consisting of the steady \"attention\" signal for no more than one minute, one minute of silence, and the \"attack\" signal for no more than one minute. A \"growl test\" signal is also described by CPG 1\u201317, when a siren must be tested more than once a month. This is typically a 1-second burst of sound to verify the proper operation of the siren without causing a significant number of people to interpret the test as an actual alert. Many cities in the U.S. periodically sound their sirens as a test, either weekly, monthly, or yearly, at a day and hour set by each individual city.[citation needed] In the United States, there is no national level alert system. Normally, sirens are controlled on a county or local level, but some are controlled on a state level, such as in Hawaii. Sirens are usually used to warn of impending natural disaster; while they are also used to warn of threats of military attacks, these rarely occur in the United States. Throughout the Great Plains, Midwest, and South, they are typically used to warn the public to take cover when a tornado warning is issued, sometimes even for severe thunderstorm warnings, and very rarely used for anything else. They are generally required in areas within a ten-mile radius of nuclear power plants. In the South and on the East Coast (except for Texas, Maine, Florida and New Hampshire), sirens are used to inform people about approaching hurricanes. In Pierce County, Washington there is a system of sirens set up along the Puyallup and Carbon River valleys to warn residents of volcanic eruptions and lahars (giant mudslides) from Mt. Rainier. Coastal communities, especially those in northern California, Oregon, Washington, Alaska, and Hawaii, use siren systems to warn of incoming tsunamis. In 2011, the city of Honolulu created an \"Adopt-A-Siren\" website for its tsunami sirens. The site is modeled after Code for America's \"Adopt-a-Hydrant\", which helps volunteers in Boston sign up to shovel out fire hydrants after storms.[100] Some U.S. volunteer fire departments, particularly in rural areas, use sirens to call volunteers to assemble at the firehouse. This method is being used less frequently as technology advances and local residents within earshot often file complaints with their town boards.[101] Some areas utilize their sirens as a last resort, relying more on cellular and paging technology; however, a decreasing number of rural departments are still outside the range of wireless communications and rely on sirens to activate the local volunteer departments. Many college campuses in the U.S., especially in the wake of the Virginia Tech shooting, have begun installing sirens to warn students in the event of dangerous incidents.[102] Sirens in the United States have been replaced by NOAA Weather Radios for advance warnings about future severe storms whenever people are inside cars or buildings."

        "content": "Argentina Around mainly suburban areas of big cities like Bahia Blanca, Mar De Plata, Rosario, Cordoba and Comodoro Rivadavia, in police stations, fire stations, factories, weather stations, city halls and amongst common public neighbourhoods, warning sirens can be found. Most of the common models are a special model which isn't completely identified yet as of now, which however, looks like a vertical Klaxon GP6/10, a Mechtric MS22 or a vertically installed mechanical or electro-mechanical 8, 9, 11, or 12 port single tone siren, most of which have 6 rectangular horns and is most likely identified as a Kingvox. They sound off for terrorism attacks, bushfires, dam leakages, chemical plant issues, life-threatening/extremely severe weather alerts which are certain to happen, incoming enemy attack and any other common natural disasters. Other models present in the country's warning system include Federal Signal, Elektror/Siemens, Whelen, Telegrafia, Klaxon and H\u00f6rmann. In extremely urban areas like Buenos Aires, most of the mechanical sirens which used to operate in a large amount were decommissioned and replaced with a smaller amount of electronic sirens, SMS alerts to phones and in some cases, as EAS alerts to TV. In some areas around the suburban areas of the big cities, over the years and since the 2010s, some sirens were decommissioned due to maintenance upkeep even though most of them remain active. Two signals are commonly used. Here are the signals: The all clear is mainly used during the nationwide siren testing in Argentine Volunteer Firefighters' Day, in the 2nd of June and sometimes, in some sirens, the general warning is tested after the all-clear."

While installed in the months preceding the 2007 APEC conference, they are designed to be a permanent fixture and are tested on a monthly basis.[103] Some large-scale sirens are also deployed, like the Grifco Model 888, Grifco Model 777, or Klaxon SO4, which are used at fire stations for call-outs and at Sydney's beaches for shark alarms. Alarms are also used around prisons for breakouts and at many factories and schools to announce start and finish times. A siren is located at the Kwinana BP plant south of Perth, which is tested every Monday. It is used to evacuate the plant in case of an emergency and can be heard in Kwinana and certain parts of Rockingham. It can also be used to warn of severe weather and potentially dangerous emergencies on the Kwinana Industrial Strip. In South Australia, a number of Country Fire Service stations have a siren on or near the station. These are only activated when the brigade are responding to bushfire or grassfire events and for testing. They are not activated for every call, only as a public alert for the presence of bushfires. As had been in Australia, Electro-mechanical sirens and electronic sirens had been used for alerting the community areas, towns and cities in Australia as in an imminent emergency. Emergency broadcast speakers will be turned on and will be informing important information as the standard emergency warning signal the affected communities within 24 hours. There are electronic sirens that include Whelen, Telegrafia, SiRcom, Klaxon and Grifco. In Victoria, many Country Fire Authority stations or near the fire station have a siren installed that is used to summon volunteers to an emergency callout, as well as consequently alerting the local community of brigade activity. Due to a variety of siren models in use across the state, there are 2 signals that are used, differentiated by length:[104] In Melbourne's CBD, there is a set of sirens installed to warn of attack and extreme flooding. These became necessary after the Bourke and Flinders St. attacks, where people were killed as a result of a vehicle purposefully driving into pedestrians. In Queensland, Whelen Vortex-R4 sirens have been installed as part of the Somerset Regional Council Flood Warning System. At nearby Grantham, Queensland, a Whelen WPS-2906, which features both warning tones and pre-recorded messages provides early warning in the event of flooding. As well, Cairns Regional Council have installed 9 Whelen WPS-2900 series sirens to alert to a dam breach of the nearby Copperlode Falls Dam. A map of the system can be found here,[105] as well as additional information. Other Whelen WPS-2900 series sirens can be found in a few towns around Queensland as well."

The networks in Lower Hutt and Napier are bolstered by fire sirens that also function as civil defense sirens. Lower Hutt's network is further bolstered by selected industrial sirens that double as civil defence sirens. In the western Bay of Plenty Region, several fire sirens also serve as civil defense sirens, and there are dedicated civil defense sirens at the Bay Park Raceway in Mount Maunganui, Tokoroa, and Whangamat\u0101 (which has two). Additionally, Tokoroa, Put\u0101ruru, T\u012brau, and Whangamat\u0101 have fire sirens serving double duty as civil defense sirens.[110] In the years following the tsunamis of the Indian Ocean earthquake in 2004, Meerkat electronic sirens were installed in all populated areas of the west coast lower than 10 metres. Warning sounds vary from area to area, including rising and falling notes and Morse code sirens. Communities with volunteer fire brigades use a continuous note on all sirens for civil defense, and a warbling siren on the fire station siren only for fire callouts. Civil defense uses a distinctive \"sting\" siren that is used by all radio stations nationwide, but is currently only used for civil defense sirens in Wanganui."

However, not all cities are equipped with this system. These sirens are typically located at fire stations and city halls. They were first introduced during the French and Spanish colonial era, and while some have been dismantled, many continue to operate to this day.\nThese sirens are strategically positioned in areas with high population densities like Casablanca, or in regions that are susceptible to natural disasters like floods, such as the Eureka siren. Additionally, they can also be found in tourist areas such as M'Diq and Chefchaouen, as well as in areas where dangerous industries are located.\nAlthough these sirens are seldom used due to the rarity of imminent danger, they were recently utilized during the quarantine period of the pandemic. Sirens sounded in various cities, including Oujda, to alert the population of the nightly curfew. During the holy month of Ramadan, these sirens are employed to signal the arrival of the Fotour time.\nIn the past, these sirens were used in small towns to call for volunteer paramedics in emergencies such as fires or drowning incidents. However, in cities without sirens, the state utilizes alternative means to alert the public, such as broadcasting warning messages on television or radio, or sending SMS messages to citizens' phone numbers. In dangerous situations, police patrol car horns are also used to warn the public.\nSurprisingly, the state does not allocate any specific days to test the sirens, and the reasons behind this remain unknown."

Formed as the twelfth named storm of the 2018 typhoon season near Okinotorishima on July 24, Jongdari gradually intensified and developed into the fourth typhoon of the year on July 26. Influenced by an upper-level low and a subtropical ridge, Jongdari executed a rare counter-clockwise southeast of Japan on the next day. At that time, it also reached peak intensity. The typhoon made landfall in Kii Peninsula, over Mie Prefecture of Japan locally early on July 29. Jongdari is one of the four Pacific tropical cyclones since 1951 that approached Honshu on a westward trajectory; the others were Typhoon Viola in 1966, Tropical Storm Ben in 1983, and Typhoon Lionrock in 2016.[1]"

        "content": "A tropical disturbance formed southeast of Guam on July 19 and tracked westward steadily.[2] After issuing a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on July 21, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) upgraded the system to a tropical depression early on July 22, although the location of its low-level circulation center was not clear.[3] The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), however, kept reporting it as a low-pressure area until it was upgraded to a tropical depression late on July 23.[4] After the slow consolidation for several days, the system was upgraded to a tropical storm near Okinotorishima at around 18:00 on July 24 by agencies such as JMA and JTWC, with an international name Jongdari.[5][6] A microwave imagery revealed a low-level forming eyewall next day, indicating a consolidating system. After JMA upgraded Jongdari to a severe tropical storm at noon,[7] the system accelerated northeastward under the influence of a near-equatorial ridge to the south.[8] On July 26, as Jongdari started to interact with an upper-level cold-core low to the north which significantly enhanced poleward outflow,[9] it intensified to a typhoon in the afternoon despite increasingly unfavorable vertical wind shear.[10] Over the warm sea surface temperatures between 29 and 30\u00a0\u00b0C (84 and 86\u00a0\u00b0F) near the Ogasawara Islands, JMA reported that Jongdari had reached peak intensity at 00:00 UTC on July 27, with ten-minute maximum sustained winds of 140\u00a0km/h (87\u00a0mph), and a minimum central pressure of 965\u00a0hPa (28.5\u00a0inHg).[11] Although JTWC indicated Jongdari reached peak intensity at 12:00 UTC with one-minute maximum sustained winds of 175\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph), the rugged eye of Jongdari kept periodically visible with an elongated structure due to the further interaction of the upper-level low which had moved to the northwest side of the typhoon. As the steering influence transitioned to a subtropical ridge to the northeast, Jongdari executed a rare counter-clockwise turn to the southeast of Japan.[12] Jongdari began to be inundated by subsidence on July 28, as the Fujiwhara effect had made the upper-level low move to the west of the typhoon.[13] It also initiated a weakening trend while accelerating northwestward and then westward toward the Japanese island of Honshu. At around 01:00 JST on July 29 (16:00 UTC July 28), Typhoon Jongdari made landfall over Ise, Mie Prefecture with ten-minute maximum sustained winds at 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph) and the central pressure at 975\u00a0hPa (28.8\u00a0inHg).[14][15] The storm weakened rapidly inland and made its second landfall over Buzen, Fukuoka Prefecture, at around 17:30 JST (08:30 UTC), with ten-minute sustained winds of 75\u00a0km/h (47\u00a0mph) and a central pressure of 992\u00a0hPa (29.3\u00a0inHg).[16] At around 10:30 CST (02:30 UTC) on August 3, Tropical Storm Jongdari made landfall over Jinshan District, Shanghai.[17] Jongdari rapidly weakened after landfall, dissipating on the next day."

The outbreak was responsible for three fatalities, all of which occurred in Oklahoma.[3] Damage was estimated to be over $595 million in central Oklahoma alone.[1] Tornado activity continued to a lesser extent until May 13, with a few tornadoes occurring across parts of Oklahoma, Missouri, and Arkansas, as the system lingered for several days."

        "content": "An intense trough with dry line activity moved across the southern Plains, especially Oklahoma and southern Kansas, on May 10. For the fourth time in less than three weeks, a high risk of severe weather was issued by the Storm Prediction Center; the high risk covered portions of Oklahoma and Kansas from the interchange of I-35, I-40 and I-44 in the Oklahoma City area, northeastward into southeastern Kansas and eastern Oklahoma;[4] these areas were in the warm sector. Temperatures in the upper 70s to mid 80s\u00b0F (upper 20s \u00b0C), dewpoints in the upper 60s \u00b0F (near 20\u00a0\u00b0C), very strong deep layer wind shear aided by a strong 500mb jet streak and mixed-layer CAPE values well in excess of 3000 J/kg,[5][6] aided in highly unstable conditions capable of explosive thunderstorm development and the likelihood of strong, long-track tornadoes with any severe thunderstorms. Two \"particularly dangerous situation\" tornado watches were issued that day covering the majority of Oklahoma and portions of Arkansas, Kansas and Missouri.[7][8] Strong jet stream winds above the surface permitted storm cell motions of more than 40 miles per hour (64\u00a0km/h) in many of the storms, creating even more of a dangerous situation for residents in the path of the storms as it aided in any tornadoes that touched down to track several miles in a relatively short period of time. Supercell thunderstorms erupted in the early and mid-afternoon hours in southern Kansas and northern and central Oklahoma. One supercell in northern Oklahoma produced large, multiple-vortex tornadoes that caused significant damage in Medford, Oklahoma.[9] The National Weather Service forecast office in Norman issued the first severe thunderstorm warning of the outbreak for this particular storm at 2:11\u00a0p.m. CDT,[10] which was quickly upgraded to a tornado warning 11 minutes later at 2:22\u00a0p.m. CDT.[11] Hail was measured as large as 4\u20136 inches (10\u201315 centimetres) in diameter in Oklahoma and Kansas.[12] Later in the afternoon, another tornado touched down near Yukon, Oklahoma in the western part of the Oklahoma City metropolitan area, followed by numerous others in the area with a trailer park flattened near Norman, Oklahoma according to KWTV coverage with at least one fatality and many injuries reported. Within a time span of three hours from about 3:30 to 6:30\u00a0p.m. CDT (2030 to 2330 UTC), coinciding with the afternoon rush hour, a total of 39 tornadoes touched down (including most of the strongest tornadoes), with 21 tornadoes touching down in a single hour between 5:00 and 6:00\u00a0p.m. CDT at the peak of the outbreak. During that hour, there were periods that several tornadoes were on the ground simultaneously. A large grocery store along Highway 9 east of Norman and Lake Thunderbird was severely damaged by a large tornado. Early that evening, a long-lived supercell tracked parallel to Interstate 40 and produced several large and destructive tornadoes from the Oklahoma City metro area through eastern Oklahoma to nearly the Arkansas state line, finally lifting for the last time just before 9:00\u00a0p.m. CDT (0200 UTC). Initially, three people were reported to have been killed in Tecumseh, however emergency management officials later advised that there were no fatalities in Tecumseh. Due to the fast movement of the storms, the National Weather Service had, at a couple of points during the outbreak, issued polygonal severe thunderstorm and tornado warnings encompassing several counties, including one tornado warning that included the entire Oklahoma City metropolitan area and neighboring suburbs in Grady, Canadian and Cleveland counties.[11] The Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management reported that 103\u00a0homes were destroyed and that 70\u00a0homes had major damage from the storm.

Initially, the damage was mostly limited to trees as it tracked across mostly undeveloped land in southeast Moore and extreme southeast Oklahoma City near Stanley Draper Lake, with a few houses sustaining minor damage. Damage increased substantially when it reached near the intersection of SE 89th Street and Hiawassee Road as it turned north-northeast through the semi-rural areas of eastern Oklahoma County.[15] As it approached Interstate 40, severe damage was done to several businesses at Choctaw Road (exit 166), including a Love's Travel Stop which was destroyed and a Sonic Drive-In which was heavily damaged; employees and several motorists took shelter inside the Love's Travel Stop, they were not hurt. Two people were killed by the tornado and 49 others were injured, including many motorists in afternoon rush hour traffic on I-40 who had their cars thrown. Numerous other houses were heavily damaged or destroyed, with a few flattened, as the tornado tracked across residential subdivisions near Choctaw and Harrah. The most severe damage was in the Deerfield West subdivision. The tornado lifted in Harrah, just northeast of Reno and Harrah Road, after being on the ground for 24 miles (39\u00a0km).[15] Initially, the tornado was rated EF3. However, due to additional damage surveys finding houses flattened in subdivisions that were difficult to access due to damage, it was upgraded to EF4.[16]"

The tornado gradually intensified as it tracked eastward through the southeastern part of Norman towards Lake Thunderbird. The tornado crossed Lake Thunderbird, severely damaging a marina with about 300 boats in total damaged.[15] Footage from NBC affiliate KFOR-TV's news helicopter captured footage of a van belonging to a plumbing repair company being tossed by the tornado; the man driving the van was uninjured.[17] The tornado then hit Little Axe Public Schools, causing significant damage to the property, with concrete pillars and metal bleachers thrown considerable distances. A large grocery store near Little Axe was severely damaged, its roof completely collapsed, and only a few sections of its walls remained standing. Severe damage was reported in several subdivisions in and east of Little Axe, with numerous houses destroyed or completely flattened, and trees were stripped of their bark and branches as it crossed into Pottawatomie County near the community of Pink. The tornado weakened after crossing the county line and lifted between Pink and Tecumseh just before 6:00 pm CDT after being on the ground for about 22 miles (35\u00a0km). A 27-year-old woman was killed by this tornado and her three children, initially reported as having been killed as well, were seriously injured.[15] In total, 32 people were injured. Like the Moore \u2013 Choctaw tornado, this was initially rated as an EF3. However, it was upgraded to EF4 in subsequent surveys after additional damage assessments found flattened houses on the eastern end of the track.[16]"

Ciara caused widespread wind and flooding damage across Europe, and at least 13 fatalities. The system emerged into the North Atlantic and underwent explosive cyclogenesis; the first severe weather warnings were issued for the United Kingdom and Ireland on 4 February well in advance of the storm's arrival. It was officially named Ciara by the Met Office the following day, becoming the twelfth named storm of the 2019\u201320 European windstorm season. Ciara subsequently made landfall in northern Scotland on 9 February and Norway the next day. The precursor low named Winter Storm Kade by The Weather Channel brought heavy snowfall to the northern United States and eastern Canada, especially Newfoundland, New England and New York; further south in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern U.S., flooding and tornadoes were reported.[2] The worst effects from Ciara were felt in Ireland and the United Kingdom, where the storm arrived over the weekend of 8\u20139 February, bringing high winds and heavy rainfall that caused severe damage, widespread flooding, and three fatalities in the latter country.[3][4] As Ciara moved across northern Europe with an unusually large wind field, eight further fatalities were recorded in a wide range of countries in mainland Europe, including as far away as Slovenia."

Severe thunderstorms produced wind gusts up to 76 miles per hour (122\u00a0km/h) in Florida, capable of toppling a crane near Tampa. Several inches of rain fell, causing severe flash flooding across the Carolinas and Virginia.

At the time, no name was issued for the system involved. The following day, the storm was formally named Ciara by the Met Office. For 9 February, an amber wind warning for much of England was issued, with the rest of the United Kingdom remaining under a yellow wind warning. The agency forecasted wind gusts of 50 to 60\u00a0mph (80 to 97\u00a0km/h) across the country, with the possibility of gusts up to 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) along coastal regions.[19][20] On 9 February, heavy rainfall from Ciara caused severe disruption across the British Isles. As a result, the Environment Agency issued 186 flood alerts, 251 flood warnings and 1 severe flood warning in England.[21] The severe warning, which was later withdrawn, was issued for the River Nidd at Pateley Bridge where a water level of 5.1\u00a0m (17\u00a0ft) was expected to pose a \"danger to life\" and overtop flood defences. In the United Kingdom as a whole, around 539,000 people were also left without power due to the storm.[3] The strongest gust recorded was 97\u00a0mph (156\u00a0km/h) at The Needles on the Isle of Wight.[5] \nA wind gust of 109.5\u00a0mph (176.2\u00a0km/h) was recorded at Capel Curig. The highest rain total was at Honister Pass in Cumbria, where the Environment Agency recorded 179.8\u00a0mm (7.08\u00a0in) of rain over the weekend.[20] High winds created by Storm Ciara over the United Kingdom and the North Atlantic meant that a British Airways Boeing 747-400 with the registration G-CIVP[22] broke the record for the fastest subsonic flight between John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City and London Heathrow. The aircraft was propelled by a strong tailwind and the jet stream across the Atlantic Ocean, completing the journey in 4 hours and 56 minutes. During the flight, the aircraft hit a maximum ground speed of 825\u00a0mph (1,328\u00a0km/h) and arrived 78 minutes ahead of schedule.[23] Alongside two Virgin Atlantic flights which arrived around the same time, it surpassed the previous world record of 5 hours and 13 minutes, set by a Norwegian 787 Dreamliner in January 2018.[24][25] In Hawick, Scottish Borders, part of a guest house and cafe collapsed into the River Teviot, leaving some rooms exposed.[26] On 10 February, a 58-year-old man from Micheldever, Hampshire, died after a tree fell on his car during the storm, where wind speeds were estimated to be in excess of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h).[27][28] The following day, a 77-year-old man from Clydebank, West Dumbartonshire, in Scotland, was killed after falling on ice and hitting his head.[29] A man also died in Woolton, Liverpool, due to a tree branch falling in high winds.[30] On 11 February, a major incident was declared in Cumbria due to problems with water supply following the storm. A 100\u00a0m (330\u00a0ft) section of the water main was damaged according to United Utilities, who had detected higher than normal levels of chlorine in the water. Twenty water tankers were placed on stand-by on bridges across the M6.[31] More than 20 schools in the Penrith area were consequently closed, and approximately 5,000 households had poor pressure or no water due to the damage.[32]"

Previous and current threatened and endangered species include the Gulf Sturgeon, the Fat threeridge mussel, the Purple bankclimber mussel, and the Chipola slabshell mussel.[6]  According to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, changes in flow rate affect the physiological processes of mussels in the Apalachicola Bay. Temperature decreases with rising flow rate, while oxygen concentrations increase.[7] Low flow and dissolved oxygen displayed a direct relationship with mussel mortality in Flint River.[7][8] Drought in the Apalachicola Bay has led to growing concerns for its threatened and endangered mussel species.[7]"

Apalachicola oysters are a critical component of the Bay's ecosystem as well as Florida's economy. The growth and maintenance of oyster reefs depends on water circulation, salinity, temperature, sedimentation, food web dynamics, commercial harvesting and weather.[9] In 2012, Apalachicola oyster populations began to decline , leading to the declaration of a fishery disaster by the Secretary of Commerce in 2013. The oyster population in Franklin County experienced a 98% decrease. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission aimed to restore the fishery by prohibiting oyster fishing for five years.[10]  Periods of low flow cause an increase in salinity concentrations and in turn, lead to increases in predation rates by stone crabs and oyster drills. Past studies have hypothesized that high rates of freshwater discharge cause a high mortality rate in oysters due to low salinity. In oysters, low salinity is known to cause hindrances in gametogenesis, gonad disintegration, delays in spawning, post-settlement mortality, and declining larval and adult filtration rates. However, further research is necessary to provide a widely accepted explanation for the relationship between Apalachicola discharge and oyster fisheries.[11]"

Beginning in 2007, drought within federal reservoirs has led to a dispute regarding the fate of water flow management within the ACF.[12] The three states have a experienced a long-term dispute regarding the U.S Army Corps of Engineers' (Corps) ability to change the rate of water discharge such that water storage is preserved, particularly in Lake Lanier. The Corps controls water from Lake Lanier such that it flows into the Apalachicola to meet its minimum flow requirement.[12] The Apalachicola Bay and its oyster industry is dependent on discharge from the Apalachicola River. The Army Corps of Engineers have issued Exceptional Drought Operations that allow for 16% lower flow into the Apalachicola River.[12]  The minimum flows to the Apalachicola are necessary to the survival of the species listed under the Endangered Species Act."

Strong winds lofted lumber for hundreds of yards, leaving pieces lodged in trees.[8] Next to the school, the tornado struck a log house that was built in the 1850s, picking up the entire structure and carrying some of its furniture up to 4\u00a0mi (6.4\u00a0km) away.[9] A teacher at the seven-room, wooden school heard the wind increasing outside but did not alert her students.[8] Moments later, the tornado struck, reportedly causing it to \u201cexplode\u201d[9] and violently spread debris over a wide area. The powerful storm killed one teacher and 12 students, carrying their bodies up to 75 yards (69\u00a0m) from the school\u2019s limestone foundation.[9] After the devastation at the school, the 0.25\u00a0mi (0.40\u00a0km)-wide tornado[9] destroyed five farmhouses before lifting. The legacy of the tornado lived on in local folklore[10] as A. P.

The central pressure of Dennis dropped by 84 millibars over 54 hours, an incredibly fast rate for an extratropical cyclone.[3] By 15 February, as Dennis stalled to the south of Iceland, it had a near-record central low pressure of 920\u00a0mb (27\u00a0inHg) and winds gusting up to 140\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h) offshore. After performing a tight anticyclonic loop off the coast of Iceland under the influence of the Fujiwhara effect from a second, weaker low to the west, Dennis accelerated briskly southeastwards and began to weaken, with the centre passing north of Scotland on 16 February before making landfall in Norway on 17 February."

On 16 February, a man was found dead in a flooded river near Trebanos, Wales.[8] The army was deployed to assist in rescue efforts.[9][10] The UK Met Office issued a red weather warning, meaning \"danger to life\", for prolonged periods of heavy rain in south Wales on 16 February until 11:00 GMT, covering nine council areas including Neath Port Talbot.[11] A fourth person, a woman, went missing and was later found dead, in Wales.[12]  A fifth person, a woman, died when she was swept away by floodwater near Tenbury Wells in Worcestershire.[13] High winds caused disruption to ferry services across Scotland and England. The Caledonian MacBrayne ferry MV Caledonian Isles was filmed lurching violently from side to side while attempting to dock at Ardrossan on a sailing from the Isle of Arran; the ferry crew were praised after eventually bringing the ship into port successfully in the difficult conditions.[14] The ship subsequently made a delayed and \"choppy\", but otherwise uneventful, return journey to Arran. Red Funnel services from Southampton to East Cowes on the Isle of Wight were adversely affected on 15 February, forcing passengers to stay onboard one of the ROPAX vessels after sea conditions became too treacherous both for the vessel to disembark or proceed onward. Passengers were stuck on the ferry for 14 hours and the journey (which normally takes approximately an hour) wasn't completed until 9:15 am the following morning.[15] In Northern Ireland, high winds caused some disruption. The Foyle Bridge in Derry was closed to high-sided vehicles, and a temporary speed restriction was imposed to all other vehicles. On Gilnahirk Road in east Belfast, numerous shop fronts collapsed onto the pavement below as a result of high winds; there were no injuries.[16]"

Portuguese officials dispatched more than 1,700\u00a0firefighters nationwide to combat the blazes and Prime Minister Ant\u00f3nio Costa declared three days of national mourning. Spain, France, Morocco and Italy deployed firefighters and Water Bombers to help extinguish the fires. Although most early official reports pointed to a dry thunderstorm as the cause of the tragedy, the President of the Portuguese Firefighters League expressed his conviction the fire was sparked by arsonists.[5] Four months later, the October 2017 Iberian wildfires would cause 45 deaths in Portugal and four in Spain, for a total of 115 deaths (111 in Portugal, 4 in Spain) between the two incidents."

It is not known how this tree was identified out of the many thousands of other burnt trees. [11] The forests of Pinhal Interior Norte, where Pedr\u00f3g\u00e3o Grande is located, are predominately composed of farmed Eucalyptus and pine trees, the Eucalyptus having surpassed pine as the dominant tree in the country in the last ten years.[12][13]"

Of this, 29,693 hectares (73,370 acres) was in the Pedr\u00f3g\u00e3o Grande area.[17] The greatest loss of life took place on a rural road in Pedr\u00f3g\u00e3o Grande, where 47\u00a0people died in or near their cars when a fire overtook the area; 30 people died while trapped in their vehicles while the other 17 died nearby trying to escape on foot. Another 11\u00a0people died in Nodeirinho, near the IC8 road.[6][8] Twelve people survived near M\u00f3 Grande as fire overtook the roads by taking refuge in a large water tank near the motorway.[16] Dozens of small communities were severely affected.[18][19][20] Prime Minister Ant\u00f3nio Costa called the disaster \"the greatest tragedy we have seen in recent years in terms of forest fires\".[6] Three days of national mourning were declared beginning on 18 June.[6] Arriving at Pedr\u00f3g\u00e3o Grande before midnight on 17\u00a0June, President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa was visibly shaken, and gave long hugs to Jorge Gomes, the Secretary of State of Internal Administration (who had been on the scene since the fire broke out),[21] Valdemar Ramos, the Mayor of Pedr\u00f3g\u00e3o Grande and, after addressing the journalists, Constan\u00e7a Urbano de Sousa, the Minister of Internal Administration.[22] The President met with survivors who were evacuated to Leiria.[9] More than 1,700\u00a0firefighters were deployed to combat the fires. France and Spain provided a collective five water-bombing planes along with 200 members of the Military Emergencies Unit and the European Union began coordinating international relief efforts on 18 June.[6][8][23] Many people were evacuated to neighboring Avelar, where residents provided them with shelter.[9] Low-hanging smoke prevented helicopters from providing support, hampering firefighting efforts. Some survivors criticized inadequate response from the government, claiming no firefighters reached them for hours after the blaze began. They also stated poor forestry planning and \"depopulation of remote villages that left many wooded areas untended\" were to blame.[8] In the afternoon of 20\u00a0June, according to reports, one of the foreign aid Canadair water bombers crashed over Pedr\u00f3g\u00e3o Grande,[24] though Secretary of State of Internal Administration Jorge Gomes could not confirm the reports.[25] Later, the National Authority for Civil Defence dismissed all reports of a plane crash, attributing eye-witness reports of the crash to a gas explosion on a camper trailer.[26]"

Among the most damaged areas were Greater London, Kent, the East Anglian coast, the Home Counties, the west of Brittany, and the Cotentin Peninsula of Normandy, all of which weathered gusts typically with a return period of 1 in 200 years.[4][5] Forests, parks, roads, and railways were strewn with fallen trees and schools were closed. The British National Grid suffered heavy damage, leaving thousands without power. At least 22 people were killed in England and France.[6][3] The highest measured gust of 135 miles per hour; 217 kilometres per hour (117\u00a0kn) was recorded at Pointe Du Roc, Granville, France and the highest gust in the UK of 120\u00a0mph; 190\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0kn) was recorded at Shoreham, West Sussex.[7] The storm has been termed a weather bomb due to its rapid development.[8] That day's weather reports had failed to indicate a storm of such severity, an earlier, correct forecast having been negated by later projections. The apparent suggestion by the BBC's Michael Fish of a false alarm is celebrated as a classic gaffe, though he claims he was misquoted.[9] As a result of this storm, major improvements were later implemented in atmospheric observation, relevant computer models, and the training of forecasters.[10]"

By 1800 UTC, it had moved north-east to about 47\u00b0 N, 6\u00b0 W, and deepened to 964\u00a0hPa (28.5\u00a0inHg). At 2235 UTC, winds of Force 10 were forecast. By midnight, the depression was over the western English Channel, and its central pressure was 953\u00a0hPa (28.1\u00a0inHg). At 0140 on 16 October, warnings of Force 11 were issued. The depression now moved rapidly north-east, filling a little as it did, reaching the Humber Estuary at about 0530 UTC, by which time its central pressure was 959 hectopascals (28.3\u00a0inHg). Dramatic increases in temperature were associated with the passage of the storm's warm front. In some sea areas, warnings of severe weather were both timely and adequate, although forecasts for land areas left much to be desired.\nDuring the evening of 15 October, radio and TV forecasts mentioned strong winds, but indicated that heavy rain would be the main feature, rather than wind. By the time most people went to bed, exceptionally strong winds had not been mentioned in national radio and TV weather broadcasts. Warnings of severe weather had been issued, however, to various agencies and emergency authorities, including the London Fire Brigade. Perhaps the most important warning was issued by the Met Office to the Ministry of Defence (MoD) at 0135 UTC, 16 October. It warned that the anticipated consequences of the storm were such that civil authorities might need to call on assistance from the military."

To the north-west of this region, there were two maxima in gust speeds, separated by a period of lower wind speeds. During the first period, the wind direction was southerly. During the latter, it was south-westerly. Damage patterns in south-east England suggested that tornadoes accompanied the storm. In the UK, winds at Shoreham-by-Sea, Sussex reached 190\u00a0km/h; 120\u00a0mph (100\u00a0kn) before the anemometer failed.[3][13][14] Many anemometers were reliant on mains power, and ceased recording as the south east of the United Kingdom was blacked-out by power cuts, thus losing much valuable data.[12]\nWinds with an estimated 200-year return period hit the counties of Kent, Sussex, Berkshire, Hampshire, and along the coastal strip of Essex, Suffolk, and south-eastern Norfolk.[12] North of a line from Portland Bill, Dorset to Cromer, Norfolk the return period of the respective gusts were under 10 years.[12] Sustained winds speeds greater than 121\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph) were recorded for over an hour in southern Britain.[15] According to the Beaufort scale of wind intensities, this storm had winds of hurricane force 12 (117\u00a0km/h\u00a0[73\u00a0mph] or greater); as the term hurricane refers to tropical cyclones originating in the North Atlantic or North Pacific, the descriptor \"great storm\" has tended to be reserved for those storms in recent years reaching this velocity. Hurricanes have a very different wind profile and distribution from storms, and significantly higher precipitation levels."

The strongest gusts, of up to 100 knots (190\u00a0km/h; 120\u00a0mph), were recorded along the south-eastern edge of the storm, hitting mainly Berkshire, Hampshire, Sussex, Essex, and Kent. The Royal Sovereign lighthouse 6 miles (9.7\u00a0km) off Eastbourne recorded the highest hourly-mean wind speed in the UK on its instruments at 75\u00a0kn (139\u00a0km/h; 86\u00a0mph).[7] The counties of Dorset[16] and Surrey were also heavily affected.[17] The storm caused substantial damage over much of England, felling an estimated 15\u00a0million trees[18] (including six of the seven eponymous oaks in Sevenoaks,[19] historic specimens in Kew Gardens, Wakehurst Place, Nymans Garden, Hyde Park in London, and Scotney Castle[20] and most of the trees making up Chanctonbury Ring). At Bedgebury National Pinetum, Kent almost a quarter of the trees were brought down.[21][22] There have been many claims that the damage to forestry was made worse by broadleaf trees still being in leaf at the time of the storm, though this was not borne out by an analysis by the Forestry Commission.[23] Fallen trees blocked roads and railways, and left widespread structural damage primarily to windows and roofs. More than 5,000 trees fell on railway tracks in the Southern Region, and the Midland and West Coast main lines were blocked.[24] Beach huts were blown onto tracks at Leigh-on-Sea.[24] The roofs and canopies at Limehouse and Benfleet stations were destroyed, and \u00a3300,000 of damage was caused to construction work on a new train ferry pier at Dover Western Docks station.[24] Several hundred thousand people were left without power, not fully restored until more than two weeks later. Local electric utility officials later said they lost more wires in the storm than in the preceding decade. At sea, as well as many small boats being wrecked, a Sealink cross-channel ferry, the MV Hengist, was driven ashore at Folkestone and the bulk carrier MV Sumnea capsized at Dover, Kent.[25] The Radio Caroline ship MV Ross Revenge weathered the storm in the north sea, being one of the few ships to be in the North Sea during the storm; it being a radio ship, it also provided radio broadcasts to thousands while most stations were offline.[26] The National Grid sustained heavy damage during the event, as crashing cables short-circuited, which in some cases overheated the main system. Its headquarters faced the choice of keeping the grid online to help London as the storm approached but risk an incremental system breakdown, failure and burnout, or to shut down most of South East England including London and avert that risk. The headquarters made the decision, the first one like it since before World War II: to shut down the South East power systems to maintain the network as soon as signs of overheating began.[27] At Clayton, West Sussex, one of the village's recently restored windmills, Jill, sustained severe damage to its mechanisms and caught fire during the storm. The mill's brakes had been applied prior to the storm's arrival, but the high winds were able to rotate the sails and overcome the brakes, creating friction which set the mill's antique timbers on fire. Members of the Jack and Jill Windmills Society were able to put the fire out, carrying water up the hill to douse the flames.[28] In London, many of the trees lining streets, particularly plane trees, were blown down overnight, blocking roads and crushing parked cars. Building construction scaffolding and billboards collapsed in many places, and many buildings were damaged. The following morning, the BBC's Current Affairs Production Centre at the former Lime Grove Studios in Shepherd's Bush, was unable to function due to a power failure \u2013 ITV's TV-am and BBC1's Breakfast Time programmes were broadcast from different emergency facilities in emergency formats. TV-am broadcast from Thames Television's Euston Road studios, while BBC newsreader Nicholas Witchell had to broadcast from the BBC1 continuity studio at BBC Television Centre, with the wall decorations used for Children's BBC hastily taken down. Much of the public transport in the capital was not functioning, and people were advised against trying to go to work. TV-am host Anne Diamond did go back to the regular TV-am studio with reporter Kay Burley, whilst Richard Keys remained in the Thames Television studio in case the power supply situation became even worse, and indeed, power did go back down at around 8:15 am."

The total damage was estimated at \u20a323 billion. M\u00e9t\u00e9o France announced \"une petite temp\u00eate en provenance des A\u00e7ores\" (a little storm coming in from the Azores), which reached Brittany's coast at about 18:00, later than expected. This depression caused little damage, with only 50 to 60\u00a0km/h (31 to 37\u00a0mph; 27 to 32\u00a0kn) winds. A much deeper depression hit Ushant on the extreme western tip of Brittany at midnight. It was measured at 948\u00a0mbar (28.0\u00a0inHg) at the Brest-Guipavas weather station, the lowest reading in its records dating back to 1945.[29] Weather stations on the coast at pointe du Raz, pointe Saint-Mathieu and Penmarch gave no readings, as they were damaged by the high winds. The wind speed measured at Brest was 148\u00a0km/h (92\u00a0mph; 80\u00a0kn). The centre of the storm crossed Brittany from Penmarch to Saint-Brieuc at 110\u00a0km/h (68\u00a0mph; 59\u00a0kn), with gusts of wind up to 187\u00a0km/h (116\u00a0mph; 101\u00a0kn) at Quimper, 200\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph; 110\u00a0kn) at Ushant, and 220\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph; 120\u00a0kn) at la pointe de Penmarch and Granville. Waves were measured at 16\u00a0m (52\u00a0ft) off Ushant and Belle \u00cele.[29] Similar strength storms in France since 1960: The church at Concarneau was damaged but never rebuilt, and was finally demolished a few years later. The MS Herald of Free Enterprise was caught in the storm off Cape Finisterre as it was making its way for scrapping in Taiwan. The ship was cast adrift after its tow rope parted, finally resuming its journey on 19 October 1987.[30]"

        "content": "The storm cost the insurance industry \u00a32 billion, making it the second most expensive UK weather event on record to insurers after the Burns' Day Storm of 1990.[31] Peak wind velocities were in the early hours of the morning, which may have helped reduce the death toll. \nThe storm hit the Isle of Wight at 02:00. Shanklin Pier, a central landmark in the seaside resort of Shanklin on the south-east coast of the island, was broken into three pieces as a result of mountainous waves in Sandown Bay that struck the structure. Plans to rebuild the pier were soon abandoned as the company supervising the pier's refurbishment prior to the storm went bankrupt, and the rest of the pier was demolished by contractors shortly afterwards. A monument now stands in front of what used to be the pier entrance. A great deal of effort and money was put into the post-storm clean-up of forests and wooded areas. The writer Oliver Rackham and the charity Common Ground were active in trying to prevent unnecessary destruction of trees which, although fallen, were still living.[32][33] Some landowners, such as the National Trust, did not attempt complete clearing and replanting, realising that there was a unique opportunity to study the patterns of natural regeneration after such an event.[34] A number of wild boar may have escaped from captivity during the storm, after enclosures were damaged by falling trees. These boar have since bred and established populations in woods across southern England.[35] A more positive aspect could be found among some British gardeners; as Heather Angel wrote in the Royal Horticultural Society's Journal: In some places this natural disaster has resulted in splendid vistas- views long since forgotten by some and never before seen by a whole new generation. Because of gaps left by fallen trees, visitors to Arundel Castle, the ancestral home of the Dukes of Norfolk, can now look out over the picturesque town... At the renowned woodland rhododendron garden at Leonardslee, Sussex, the gale... opened magnificent views by removing about a thousand trees which owner Robin Loder said he would never have had the courage to thin out himself.[36]"

        "header": "Criticism of the Met Office",
        "content": "The Met Office was severely criticised by most of the national press for failing to forecast the storm correctly.[11] The Met Office conducted an internal inquiry, scrutinised by two independent assessors, and a number of recommendations were made. Chiefly, observational coverage of the atmosphere over the ocean to the south and west of the UK was improved by increasing the quality and quantity of observations from ships, aircraft, buoys and satellites. Continued refinements were made to the computer models used in forecasting, and changes were made in the training of forecasters. In addition, reforms in the way the Met Office reports warnings of severe weather were implemented, leading to substantially more warnings being issued in the future. Further deployment of improved tracking devices and improvements in the computer model simulations were supported by the purchase of an additional Cray supercomputer. Warnings for the Burns' Day Storm just over two years later were accurate and on time, although the model forecast hinged on observations from two ships in the Atlantic near the developing storm the day before it reached the UK.[37] BBC meteorologist Michael Fish drew particular criticism for reporting several hours before the storm hit: Earlier on today, apparently, a woman rang the BBC and said she heard there was a hurricane on the way; well, if you're watching, don't worry, there isn't, but having said that, actually, the weather will become very windy, but most of the strong winds, incidentally, will be down over Spain and across into France.[38] Fish has subsequently claimed that his comments about a hurricane had nothing to do with the UK; they referred to Florida, USA, and were linked to a news story immediately preceding the weather bulletin, but had been so widely repeated out of context that the British public remains convinced that he was referring to the approaching storm. According to Fish, the woman in question was actually a colleague's mother who was about to go on holiday in the Caribbean, and had called regarding Hurricane Floyd to see if it would be safe to travel.[39] Fish went on to warn viewers that it would be \"very windy\" across the south of England, but predicted that the storm would move further south along the English Channel and the British mainland would escape the worst effects. The remainder of his warning has frequently been left out when this forecast has been repeated on television, which only adds to the public's misconception[citation needed] of that day's forecasting. His analysis has been defended by weather experts. In particular, the lack of a weather ship in the Southwest Approaches, due to Met Office cutbacks,[40] meant the only manner of tracking the storm was by using satellite data, as automatic buoys had not been deployed at the time. Ironically, earlier forecasts as far back as the preceding weekend had correctly identified that gale-force winds would affect Southern England. However, later runs of the model had indicated a more southerly track for the low pressure system, incorrectly indicating that the strongest winds would be confined to Northern and Central France. The French meteorological office used a different computer weather model to the British, and the French model proved more accurate in predicting the severity of the storm in the Channel. The French meteorological service did correctly predict and warn for the storm and its intensity, but it might have been otherwise. Indeed, the ECMWF model forecast from 14 October 12 UTC failed to predict the strong winds and the storm position (although previous runs were closer to reality), and this could have led to inadequate warnings. This unusual inconsistency of ECMWF could have been a data assimilation issue, or came from poor data. In contrast, the French large scale model EMERAUDE made better predictions, while still underestimating the winds. It is recognised that without the experience of the forecasters, the exceptional aspects of the storm would have been missed.[41] In the wake of the storm, the Met Office set up the National Severe Weather Warning Service.[10] It has been said[42] that as 15\u201316 October 1987 approached, shipping weather forecasts warned of storm movements in the North Atlantic, with the result that ships stayed away from North Atlantic storm tracks, depriving North Atlantic meteorology of a major necessary source of weather report data."

During reanalysis of the storm they identified a mesoscale flow where the most damaging winds were shown to be emanating from the evaporating tip of the hooked cloud head on the southern flank of the cyclone. This cloud, hooked like a scorpion's tail, gives the wind region its name the \"sting jet\".[13][43]"

Storms of such a strength have a return period of 30 to 40 years.[3] The unusual aspect of the storm was that it struck the densely populated southeast of England.[4][5] That winds in the South East had return periods of 1 in 200 years does not mean the winds of this strength occur once every 200 years, but that the winds have a 0.5% probability of happening in a given year.[Note 1] Following this storm 1.3 million incidents of damage were reported, which is only exceeded by the Gale of January 1976 where destruction covered a wider area of the UK, with 1.5 million incidents of damage reported.[2] The Burns' Day storm hit the United Kingdom in January 1990, less than three years later and with comparable intensity. The Great Storm of 1968 (Hurricane Low Q) had crossed Great Britain between the Pennines and Perthshire with the highest-ever recorded peak wind speeds (134\u00a0mph). The 1968 storm, for which no warning was given, devastated agriculture and 5% of forestry in Scotland, toppled shipbuilding cranes on the Clyde, and left almost 2000 people homeless in the Central Belt."

        "content": " Typhoon Alice was an unusual West Pacific tropical cyclone that caused extensive damage in the Marshall Islands in January\u00a01979. The first tropical cyclone and the first typhoon of the 1979 Pacific typhoon season, Alice formed on December 31, 1978 from a tropical disturbance at both an atypically low latitude near the equator and during a time of year climatologically unfavorable for tropical cyclogenesis. The system strengthened as it tracked northwest, reaching tropical storm strength on January 1, 1979. Alice then began to move erratically through the Marshall Islands, causing heavy rainfall and gusty winds that destroyed crops throughout the archipelago. Significant damage occurred in Majuro and Enewetak Atoll, where gusts of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) were reported and one person was injured. Nuclear cleanup operations on Enewetak in the wake of postwar nuclear tests there were disrupted, with repair of cleanup facilities lasting several months. The damage toll was estimated at between US$50,000\u2013$500,000. After January\u00a06, Alice strengthened into a typhoon and took a westward course, strengthening to its peak intensity with winds of 125\u00a0mph (205\u00a0km/h) two days later. A weakening trend began thereafter as the storm tracked south of Guam on January\u00a010, prompting thousands to evacuate to shelters though ultimately causing minor damage. After passing the island Typhoon Alice reintensified to a secondary peak intensity before strong wind shear induced rapid weakening, resulting in the storm's dissipation on January\u00a015."

        "content": "The origins of Alice were traced back to a tropical disturbance over the Gilbert Islands on December 27, 1978, during a climatologically unfavorable time for tropical cyclone formation.[1] The disturbance was segmented into two components directly north and south of the equator.[2] Initially, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center\u00a0(JTWC) believed that the disturbance's placement near the equator meant further storm development was unlikely.[1] However, the system progressively organized and was classified as a tropical depression by the Japan Meteorological Agency\u00a0(JMA) by 12:00\u00a0UTC on December\u00a031.[3] The JTWC followed suit in the upgrade twelve hours later, and soon after declared a tropical cyclone formation alert at 03:00\u00a0UTC on January\u00a01, 1979. Tracking towards the northwest, atmospheric conditions became more favorable for intensification farther from the equator. The tropical depression became sufficiently organized to be named Tropical Storm Alice by the JTWC at 18:00\u00a0UTC that day.[1] Over the next several days, Alice meandered through the Marshall Islands without much change in strength,[1][4] steered by a transient shortwave trough.[1] The trough's influence soon abated, allowing a nearby ridge of high pressure to restrengthen and induce a westerly bearing to Alice's motion that would continue for five days.[1] Alice strengthened into a typhoon on January\u00a06 and continued to intensify thereafter, reaching a peak intensity on January\u00a08 with maximum sustained winds of 125\u00a0mph (205\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 930\u00a0mbar (hPa; 27.46\u00a0inHg).[4] Concurrently, the typhoon accelerated to a forward speed of 16\u00a0mph (26\u00a0km/h) and began to weaken. An area of wind shear southeast of Guam, described by the JTWC as a \"frontal shear-line\", slowed Alice's movement on January\u00a09. A region of cooler and drier air north of this region was entrained also into the storm, causing Alice to lose some organization and weaken further. Two days later, a second trough over eastern Asia resulted in Alice curving north.[1] During this trek, the typhoon restrengthened and reached a secondary peak intensity with winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h) on January\u00a011, with satellite imagery indicating robust outflow.[1][4] However, this second peak was short-lived as Alice's circulation began to vertically decouple in the face of strong wind shear, exacerbated by Alice's low-level circulation  moving directly into the westerly wind flow aloft.[1] The typhoon degenerated into a tropical storm on January\u00a013 and weakened further into a tropical depression 18\u00a0hours later; these remnants dissipated by January\u00a015.[1][3]"

On January\u00a04, storm preparations were ordered for military assets on the atoll, beaching boats, evacuating cargo ships, and securing buildings. Most personnel stationed at Lojwa Camp were evacuated to Enewetak Camp.[5] The center of the storm tracked within 50\u00a0mi (80\u00a0km) northeast of Kwajalein Atoll on the morning January\u00a04 before passing within 30\u00a0mi (48\u00a0km) south of Enewetak two days later. Rough surf at Kwajalein damaged breakwaters and piers.[6] Sustained winds there reached 36\u00a0mph (58\u00a0km/h) with gusts to 51\u00a0mph (82\u00a0km/h). Significant shoreline damage occurred along the lagoon-facing shores of the Kwajalein Missile Range, compounded by Alice's nearly stationary movement.[7] Gusts of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) were measured at Enewetak where \"considerable\" damage was observed;[6] the tropical storm battered the atoll for over six hours.[8] The damage was worst at Enewetak Camp and minor at Japtan and Lojwa Camps on the atoll. A water tower was blown down and sheet metal was torn from the roofs and walls of buildings. Some buildings collapsed due to the winds.[5] Large rocks were washed onto the runway at Enewetak Auxiliary Airfield.[6] Storm surge inundated the Mid-Pacific Research Laboratory grounds under 5\u00a0ft (1.5\u00a0m) of water and washed out roads. A few boats, including a Landing Craft Utility and LCM-8, sustained minor damage.[5] The storm cut off all power, forcing nuclear waste cleanup crews on the atoll to use emergency generators.[8] \"Extensive\" damage was reported in Majuro, the capital of the Marshall Islands, and crops were destroyed throughout the archipelago.[9] One person suffered minor injuries at Enewetak,[10] and the damage toll was estimated at between US$50,000\u2013$500,000.[6] Population density and species richness of the sea snail genus Conus decreased as a result of the typhoon.[11] Alice's presence also disrupted U.S. Coast Guard search and rescue operations for a missing sailboat with two onboard, preventing search planes from departing out of Kwajalein Atoll.[12] U.S. President Jimmy Carter declared the Marshall Islands a disaster area,[1] with federal disaster assistance activated for eight atolls.[13] Initial recovery efforts following Alice at Enewetak lasted three weeks and cost over $264,000, while longer-term repair and replacement of nuclear cleanup facilities lasted several months.[5] With Typhoon Alice expected to track near Guam, the island's civil defense force was placed on alert.[9] All schools were closed aside from 20\u00a0used as shelters,[14] housing thousands of evacuees.[15] The United States Navy evacuated a submarine tender and submarines from the island.[9] The United States Air Force was evacuated 14\u00a0B-52 bombers and five tanker planes from Andersen Air Force Base to Kadena Air Force Base in Okinawa.[9][15] Alice ultimately moved within 90\u00a0mi (140\u00a0km) south of Guam on January\u00a010, causing minor damage as strong winds and large waves affected the island.[6]"

The villages suffered extensive damage after flash floods caused by an exceptional amount of rain that fell over eight hours that afternoon. The flood in Boscastle was filmed and extensively reported, but the floods in Crackington Haven and Rocky Valley were not mentioned beyond the local news. The floods were the worst in local memory. A study commissioned by the Environment Agency from hydraulics consulting firm HR Wallingford concluded that it was among the most extreme ever experienced in Britain. The peak flow was about 140 m3/s, between 5:00\u00a0pm and 6:00\u00a0pm BST. The annual chance of this (or a greater) flood in any one year is about 1 in 400.[2] The probability each year of the heaviest three-hour rainfall is about 1 in 1300 (although rainfall probability is not the same as flood probability). At midday on 16 August 2004, heavy thundery showers had developed across the South West due to a weak disturbance to the northeast of the United Kingdom.[3] The last time Boscastle had suffered notable flooding was in 1996 as a result of Hurricane Lili, but floods are recorded in 1847, 1957, on 3 June 1958 (one man drowned) and on 6 February during the Winter of 1962\u201363 in the United Kingdom. On 16 August 1952, 52 years to the day before Boscastle's 2004 flood, the small town of Lynmouth, 50 miles (80\u00a0km) north-east along the north coast in Devon near Exmoor, suffered extensive damage in a catastrophic flood, in which 34 people lost their lives."

        "content": "On 16 August, warm air picking up moisture \u2013 due to residual heat from the Atlantic Ocean \u2013 travelled toward the Cornish coast as prevailing winds. Upon contact with the topographically vertical coast, these winds experienced a strong up-drafting force, thus causing internal moisture to rise and consequently cool as a string of storm clouds. With convergence[4] and coalescence, enhanced moisture levels resulted in heavy rainfall on the afternoon of 16 August 2004. 185\u00a0mm (7\u00a0inches) of rain fell over the high ground just inland of Boscastle. At the peak of the downpour, at about 15:40 GMT, 24.1mm of rain (almost one inch) was recorded as falling in just 15 minutes at Lesnewth, 2.5 miles (4\u00a0km) up the valley from Boscastle. In Boscastle, 89 millimetres (3.5\u00a0in) of rain was recorded in 60 minutes. The rain was very localised: Otterham and Lesnewth, both a few miles inland from Boscastle, recorded 24-hour totals of 200\u00a0mm and 185\u00a0mm respectively on the day,[5] whereas four of the nearest 10 rain gauges showed less than 3\u00a0mm of rain in the same period. The cause of the very heavy localised rain is thought to be an extreme example of what has become known as the Brown Willy effect. The torrential rain led to a 2\u00a0m (7\u00a0ft) rise in river levels in one hour. A 3\u00a0m (10\u00a0ft) wave, believed to have been triggered by water pooling behind debris caught under a bridge and then being suddenly released as the bridge collapsed, surged down the main road. Water speed was over 4\u00a0m/s (10\u00a0mph), more than enough to cause structural damage. It is estimated that 20,000,000 cubic metres (5.3\u00d7109\u00a0US\u00a0gal) of water flowed through Boscastle that day alone. The steep valley sides and the saturated surface ensured a high amount of surface run-off. Changes in farming practice in the area also possibly contributed, sewage could have been a cause as well, with a reduction of trees and hedges higher up the valley causing water to flow through more quickly than would have been the case in the past. No one died in the flood."

This was lost during the flood, but then recovered from the harbour in good condition. This bridge has now been replaced with a new one. The new bridge, which is a few metres further down the river than the old bridge, was installed on 18 December 2007, and was made by Cornish Concrete, a company based near Truro. The main arch is made from reinforced concrete, with metal railings. The old bridge, which was over 100 years old, was demolished in early April 2008."

After an afternoon of intense localised rainfall, and a week of steady rain everyday, a small flood happened on 21 June 2007. 30\u00a0mm fell on the area in one hour. Roads had become flooded in the area and in the village, most water came from the saturated fields around the village. Many drains had become blocked. Roads around the Tintagel, Camelford and Davidstow area were closed off to stop people visiting the village. River levels were alarmingly high, but the banks contained the water. However the many culverts of the River Jordan had overflowed onto the villages roads, adding to the amount of water on the roads. The new storm culvert joining the River Jordan to the River Valency was at full capacity, but did not flood. Services and organisations called in included: The Environment Agency's flood defences installed after the 2004 flood worked and kept the water in the river channel. A few properties in the village were flooded by 3\u00a0ft (1\u00a0m) from water flowing down the streets, rather than from the river flooding, although the damage was not nearly as bad as the 2004 flood. The two main roads (B3266, B3263) were blocked with flood waste and debris, although this was cleared and the roads reopened the following morning. The Environment Agency looked at the culverts around the village and will change them all to modern drainage"

It then crossed over Morocco before dissipating. It was the 26th\u00a0tropical or subtropical storm to form in the 28-storm 2005\u00a0season. Tropical Storm Delta, like many late-season storms, developed out of an extratropical low. The storm gradually gained tropical characteristics and was briefly a subtropical storm on 22\u00a0November before transitioning to a tropical storm. Delta moved erratically for a few days before moving towards the Canary Islands. It became extratropical just before it passed to the north of the archipelago."

        "content": "On 19\u00a0November, a broad area of eastward-moving low pressure formed in the central Atlantic Ocean about 2,200\u00a0km (1,400\u00a0miles)  southwest of the Azores.[1]  It moved steadily eastward through 20\u00a0November, but on 21\u00a0November, under the influence of a cold front to its north, the low turned northeastward and started to develop central convection.[1]  On 22\u00a0November, the non-tropical low pressure system began to gain some tropical characteristics, and its northward motion slowed to a stop. Late that afternoon, the low transitioned into a subtropical storm while stalled about 1,300\u00a0km (800\u00a0mi) west-southwest of the Azores.[1]  Operationally, the National Hurricane Center considered that the storm had already gained enough tropical characteristics to be classified as a tropical storm, but in post-storm analysis, this was reconsidered.[2] The storm's convection organized around a central core, and the system became a tropical storm on 23\u00a0November and received the name Delta.[1] An eye-like feature appeared near the storm's circulatory center several times that day.[2] The larger-scale deep-layered cyclonic circulation within which it was embedded steered it on a slow southward and then south-southwesterly track.[3] Strong wind shear prevented immediate development and the system added an eastward component to its drift.[3] Moving out of the high-shear environment on 24\u00a0November, Delta gained organization.[4] Outflow and convective banding increased[4] and an eye feature became well defined.[5] This eye signaled the storm's peak strength of 110\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph), just below hurricane status. However, the official forecast at the time predicted Delta to strengthen further and become a minimal hurricane.[5] Delta's motion stalled as it reached the southern base of a large cyclonic trough over the northern Atlantic within which it was embedded.[5] Maintaining its intensity, Delta remained motionless for half a day[6] until, that evening when it began a slow southward drift at 9.7\u00a0km/h (6\u00a0mph).[7] Maintaining its intensity, Delta remained motionless for half a day[7] Convection broke down in the storm's western semicircle early on 25\u00a0November; the decreased organization caused slight weakening.[5] Maintaining its intensity, Delta remained motionless for half a day[8] The southward motion slowed[9][10] and the weakening trend continued into the evening.[10] Cooling cold tops were counteracted by wind shear which exposed most of the low-level center.[11] The storm moved southwestward on 25\u00a0November, then turned toward the southeast and east-northeast the following day. During these maneuvers, Delta grew weaker due to strong wind shear, with its winds decreasing to an estimated 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph).[1] Delta then accelerated to the northeast on 27\u00a0November, towards the Canary Islands. As it did, the system intensified again, reaching a second peak of just under hurricane strength. In post-storm analysis, the NHC noted that there was a possibility that Delta had briefly reached hurricane strength that day; however, the data was not conclusive enough to justify an upgrade to hurricane status. On 28\u00a0November, as it neared the Canary Islands Tropical Storm Delta lost its tropical characteristics. The extratropical storm, which maintained winds of near-hurricane strength, passed about 169\u00a0km (105\u00a0mi) north of the islands that night. The storm moved over Morocco early on 29\u00a0November and rapidly weakened overland, dissipating late that day over northwestern Algeria.[1]"

Tropical cyclones there are extremely rare and the islands had no tropical warning systems in place. The government issued a general emergency advisory and advised citizens to stay indoors.[12] Tenerife North Airport was closed, stranding hundreds of passengers for the duration of the storm.[12] The Education Board of the Canary Islands Government suspended Tuesday classes for all non-university schools for 320,000 students.[13][14][15] The shipping company Fred Olsen suspended services linking the islands of Tenerife and La Palma and La Gomera.[13] On the island of El Hierro the exposed road to Sabinosa Health Center was closed as a precaution.[13] Delta caused considerable damage in the Canary Islands. The storm claimed nineteen lives[14] and caused a total of \u20ac312\u00a0million ($364\u00a0million 2005 US dollars) damage throughout the archipelago.[16] Eighteen died when a boat sank off the Canary Islands; twelve of the bodies were never found. The nineteenth man was killed when while trying to repair his roof during the storm; winds threw him from his ladder.[14] The islands of Tenerife and La Palma were hardest hit, with many uprooted trees and landslides reported. The peak gust recorded at La Palma was 152\u00a0km/h (94\u00a0mph), and at North Tenerife the maximum gust was 147\u00a0km/h (91\u00a0mph).[17] Some patients at Tenerife's University Hospital were evacuated to a safer part of the building when paneling from the hospital's heliport was torn free and smashed some of the building's windows.[14] Off Santa Cruz's southern quay a tug boat broke its ties, collided with another vessel, and sank. Passengers at Tenerife North Airport, who were stranded when their flights canceled, witnessed parts of the new international terminal's roof tear off in the wind.[14] In La Palma a falling palm tree, trunk snapped by the wind, injured the leg of a German tourist.[13] Many palm trees along the Avenida Mar\u00edtima were also blown down. The storms winds blew out windows and collapsed cornices, although other structural damage was minimal. Metal plates that had been used to board up buildings were strewn all over the island.[13] Over 225,000\u00a0residents lost electricity and 12,000 lost telephone service.[14][18] Some vandalism and looting was reported during the loss of power, and the police made several arrests during the night.[14] For over 24\u00a0hours roads were closed on the islands of El Hierro, Tenerife and La Palma: the first two due to landslides and the third by the collapse of an old house and a massive tree.[13] One of the most famous geological features of the island of Gran Canaria,[19] El Dedo de Dios (or God's finger), which had been pointing towards the sky for over a millennium, was destroyed by Delta's wind and wave action along Gran Canaria's shore. Upon hearing of the destruction of the natural monument one man, later found to be clinically insane, unsuccessfully tried to kill himself and then stabbed three members of his own family.[20] When the remnants of Delta arrived in Morocco they were described as a \"normal atmospheric disturbance\". No damage was reported there and in fact the system was welcomed by farmers who needed the rain to complete the sowing of cereal crops.[18]"

In La Corujera in Santa \u00darsula, these generators were poorly received and over 1,000\u00a0local residents claimed to be affected by the noise and pollution. Children, the elderly and people with respiratory problems suffered most acutely.[21] Roughly \u20ac25\u00a0million (US$37.25\u00a0million) was allocated by the government of the Canary Islands in relief and reconstruction funds. Of this total, \u20ac22.5\u00a0million (US$33.5\u00a0million) was used to repair infrastructure and utilities; \u20ac1.5\u00a0million (US$2.2\u00a0million) was used for agricultural relief; and \u20ac1\u00a0million (US$1.5\u00a0million) was used in home repairs.[22] Due to the severity of crop losses, farmers would be given a grant from the government that would cover 50% of their losses, including infrastructural. A tax break was also given to most residents who suffered damage from Delta.[23] Fishermen of the Canary Islands had to return to and remain in port for several days while weathering the storm, and this disruption was blamed for a 10\u201315% reduction of the islands' tuna catch.[24] Tropical Storm Delta also had some further-reaching effects. The political opposition Popular Party challenged that the impact of Tropical Storm Delta proved the need for the island to prepare an emergency plan to deal with natural and man-made disasters. Only five of the island's many municipalities had an emergency plan, and there was no coordination across the entire island chain.[25] Delta also served to highlight the islands' aging power grid,[16] prompting the regional director general of industry and energy to consider building another power plant on the archipelago.[26] The storm sparked a vigorous debate on the island about the effects of global climate change, how they will affect the islands, and how these effects can be avoided.[27][28]"

At the time, it had persistent deep convection over the southern side of its poorly-organized low-level circulation center, and was under a marginal environment of weak vertical wind shear and diffluent northeasterly flow.[2] Three hours later, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) designated the low as a tropical depression, before initiating advisories on the system early by the next day.[3][4] As it moved westward, it organized its broad center, with curved banding wrapping into it.[5] By 10:30 UTC on October 22, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the system, as it continued to improve its structure.[6] Five hours later, the PAGASA started issuing advisories on the tropical depression, as it developed in the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR), assigning its local name Ofel.[7] Late on the next day, both the JMA and PAGASA reported that the tropical depression intensifed into a tropical storm, with the former naming it Son-Tinh.[8][9] At the same time, the JTWC started issuing advisories on Son-tinh as a tropical depression,[10] before subsequently upgrading it to a tropical storm by the next day, noting deep convection along the eastern half of the system's center wrapping to its western half.[11] Son-Tinh didn't intensify further,[12] as it made landfall over Leyte Province,[13] before emerging to the Visayan Sea,[14] and make landfall over three more locations: southwestern Masbate, Sibuyan Island,[15] and southern Mindoro.[16] Upon emerging to the West Philippine Sea on October 25, Son-Tinh struggled to intensify, with the continued effects of land interaction in the eastern quadrant.[17][18] Late on the same day, the JTWC noted that Son-Tinh had started to develop banding over its northern and southern peripheries, with deep convection wrapping to its center.[19] At 06:00 UTC the next day, the JMA upgraded Son-Tinh to a severe tropical storm, as it continued westward under the influence of the subtropical ridge to its north, leaving the PAR.[20][21][22] Twelve hours later, the JTWC upgraded Son-Tinh to a typhoon, as its structure continued to improve, with its center having tightly-curved banding.[23] The JMA would not upgrade Son-Tinh to a typhoon until 06:00 UTC on October 27, when it developed a 15-nautical-mile-wide (28\u00a0km) eye.[24][25] Son-Tinh then reached its peak intensity six hours later, as it rapidly intensified to a category 3-equivalent typhoon, while entering a hostile environment of moderate wind shear and strong westerlies to its north.[12][26] With its eye soon filled,[27] the system started weakening by the next day, as it slowed its movement, with wind shear increasing.[28] As a result, the JTWC downgraded Son-Tinh to a category 2-equivalent typhoon, as it turned to the north-northwest.[29] By 12:00 UTC that same day, the JMA downgraded the system to a severe tropical storm.[12] As it made landfall between Nam \u0110\u1ecbnh Province\u2013Th\u00e1i B\u00ecnh Province in Vietnam,[30] the JMA downgraded Son-Tinh to a tropical storm, while the JTWC downgraded the system to a category 1-equivalent typhoon.[12][31] The JTWC downgraded Son-Tinh to a tropical storm and issued their final advisory at 00:00 UTC on October 29, as it turned northeast while weakening from land interaction.[32] Six hours later, the JMA issued their final advisory on the system, as it weakened to a tropical depression.[33] Son-Tinh then dissipated late on the same day.[34]"

The Chernobyl Exclusion Zone borders a separately administered area, the Polesie State Radioecological Reserve, to the north in Belarus. The Chernobyl Exclusion Zone is managed by an agency of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine, while the power plant and its sarcophagus (and replacement) are administered separately. The Exclusion Zone covers an area of approximately 2,600\u00a0km2 (1,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)[8] in Ukraine immediately surrounding the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant where radioactive contamination is highest and public access and habitation are restricted. Other areas of compulsory resettlement and voluntary relocation not part of the restricted Exclusion Zone exist in the surrounding areas and throughout Ukraine.[9] In February 2019 it was revealed that talks were underway to redraw the boundaries of the Exclusion Zone to reflect the declining radioactivity of the Zone's outer areas.[10] The Exclusion Zone's purpose is to restrict access to hazardous areas, reduce the spread of radiological contamination, and conduct radiological and ecological monitoring activities.[11] Today, the Exclusion Zone is one of the most radioactively contaminated areas in the world and draws significant scientific interest for the high levels of radiation exposure in the environment, as well as increasing interest from tourists.[12][13] The zone has become a thriving sanctuary with natural flora and fauna with some of the highest biodiversity and thickest forests in all of Ukraine. This is due to the lack of human activity in the Exclusion Zone and is despite the radiation.[14] The Chernobyl Exclusion Zone was the site of fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces during the capture of Chernobyl on 24 February 2022, and during its eventual liberation during a Ukrainian counterattack two months later, as part of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[15] The exclusion zone remains closed to tourists pending the eventual cessation of hostilities in the Russo-Ukrainian War.

The borders were based on soil deposits of strontium-90, caesium-137, and plutonium as well as the calculated dose rate (sieverts/h) as identified by the National Commission for Radiation Protection of Ukraine.[17] Responsibility for monitoring and coordination of activities in the Exclusion Zone was given to the Ministry of Chernobyl Affairs. In-depth studies were conducted from 1992 to 1993, culminating the updating of the 1991 law followed by further evacuations from the Polesia area.[8] A number of evacuation zones were determined: the \"Exclusion Zone\", the \"Zone of Absolute (Mandatory) Resettlement\", and the \"Zone of Guaranteed Voluntary Resettlement\", as well as many areas throughout Ukraine designated as areas for radiation monitoring.[9] The evacuation of contaminated areas outside of the Exclusion Zone continued in both the compulsory and voluntary resettlement areas, with 53,000 people evacuated from areas in Ukraine from 1990 to 1995.[7] After Ukrainian Independence, funding for the policing and protection of the zone was initially limited, resulting in even further settling by samosely (returnees) and other illegal intrusion.[3][4] In 1997, the areas of Poliske and Narodychi, which had been evacuated, were added to the existing area of the Exclusion Zone, and the zone now encompasses the exclusion zone and parts of the zone of Absolute (Mandatory) Resettlement of an area of approximately 2,600\u00a0km2 (1,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[8] This Zone was placed under management of the 'Administration of the exclusion zone and the zone of absolute (mandatory) resettlement' within the Ministry of Emergencies. On 15 December 2000, all nuclear power production at the power plant ceased after an official ceremony with then-President Leonid Kuchma when the last remaining operational reactor, number 3, was shut down.[18]"

An estimated 100 plant workers and 200 Ukrainian guards who were at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant when the Russians arrived had been unable to leave. Normally they would change shifts daily and would not live at the site. They had limited supplies of medication, food, and electricity.[20] According to Ukrainian reports, the radiation levels in the exclusion zone increased after the invasion.[21] The higher levels are believed to be a result of disturbance of radioactive dust by the military activity[20] or possibly incorrect readings caused by cyberattacks.[22] On 10 March, the International Atomic Energy Agency stated that it had lost all contact with Chernobyl.[23] On 22 March, the Ukrainian state agency responsible for the Chernobyl exclusion zone reported that Russian forces had destroyed a new laboratory at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. The laboratory, which opened in 2015, worked to improve the management of radioactive waste, among other things. \"The laboratory contained highly active samples and samples of radionuclides that are now in the hands of the enemy, which we hope will harm itself and not the civilized world\", the agency said in its statement.[24] On 27 March, Lyudmila Denisova, then\u201a\u00c4\u00ecVerkhovna Rada Commissioner for Human Rights, said that 31 known individual fires covering 10,000 hectares were burning in the zone.[25] These fires caused \"...an increased level of radioactive air pollution\", according to Denisova. Firefighters were unable to reach the fires due to the Russian forces in the area. These wildfires are seasonal; one fire that was 11,500 hectares in size took place in 2020, and a series of several smaller fires occurred throughout the 2010s. On 31 March, it was reported that most of the Russian troops occupying Chernobyl withdrew. An Exclusion Zone employee made a post on Facebook suggesting that Russian troops were suffering from acute radiation sickness, based on a photo of military buses unloading near a radiation hospital in Belarus.[26][27] Chernobyl operator Energoatom claimed that Russian troops had dug trenches in the most contaminated part of the Chernobyl exclusion zone, receiving \"significant doses\" of radiation.[28] BBC News reported unconfirmed reports that some were being treated in Belarus.[28] On 3 April, Ukrainian forces retook the Chernobyl power plant.[29]"

Residence is now informally permitted by the Ukrainian government. Approximately 3,000 people work in the Zone of Alienation on various tasks, such as the construction of the New Safe Confinement, the ongoing decommissioning of the reactors, and assessment and monitoring of the conditions in the zone. Employees do not live inside the zone, but work shifts there. Some of the workers work \"4-3\" shifts (four days on, three days off), while others work 15 days on and 15 days off.[32] Other workers commute into the zone daily from Slavutych. The duration of shifts is counted strictly for reasons involving pension and healthcare. Everyone employed in the Zone is monitored for internal bioaccumulation of radioactive elements. The town of Chernobyl, located outside of the 10-kilometre Exclusion Zone, was evacuated following the accident but now serves as a base to support the workers within the Exclusion Zone. Its amenities include administrative buildings, general stores, a canteen, a hotel, and a bus station. Unlike other areas within the Exclusion Zone, the town is actively maintained by workers, such as lawn areas being mowed and autumn leaves being collected."

Most overnight tourists stay in a hotel within the town of Chernobyl, which is located within the Exclusion Zone. According to an exclusion area tour guide, as of 2017, there are approximately 50 licensed exclusion area tour guides in total, working for approximately nine companies. Visitors must present their passports when entering the Exclusion Zone and are screened for radiation when exiting, both at the 10\u00a0km checkpoint and at the 30\u00a0km checkpoint.[33] The Exclusion Zone can also be entered if an application is made directly to the zone administration department. Some evacuated residents of Pripyat have established a remembrance tradition, which includes annual visits to former homes and schools.[34] In the Chernobyl zone, there is one operating Eastern Orthodox church, St. Elijah Church. According to Chernobyl disaster liquidators, the radiation levels there are \"well below the level across the zone\", a fact that president of the Ukrainian Chernobyl Union Yury Andreyev considers miraculous.[35] The Chernobyl Exclusion Zone has been accessible to interested parties such as scientists and journalists since the zone was created. An early example was Elena Filatova's online account of her alleged solo bike ride through the zone. This gained her Internet fame, but was later alleged to be fictional, as a guide claimed Filatova was part of an official tour group. Regardless, her story drew the attention of millions to the nuclear catastrophe.[36] After Filatova's visit in 2004, a number of papers such as The Guardian[37] and The New York Times[38] began to produce reports on tours to the zone. Tourism to the area became more common after Pripyat was featured in popular video games[39] S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl and Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. Fans of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. franchise, who refer to themselves as \"stalkers\", often gain access to the Zone.[40] (\"The Zone\" and \"stalker\" derive from Arkady and Boris Strugatsky's science fiction novel Roadside Picnic, which preceded the accident but which described the evacuation of part of Russia after the appearance of dangerous alien artifacts. It served as the basis for the classic film Stalker.) Prosecution of trespassers became more severe after a significant increase in trespassing in the Exclusion Zone. An article in the penal code of Ukraine was specially introduced,[41][42] and horse patrols were added to protect the zone's perimeter. In 2012, journalist Andrew Blackwell published Visit Sunny Chernobyl: And Other Adventures in the World's Most Polluted Places. Blackwell recounts his visit to the Exclusion Zone, when a guide and driver took him through the zone and to the reactor site.[43] On 14 April 2013, the 32nd episode of the wildlife documentary TV program River Monsters (Atomic Assassin, Season 5, Episode 1) was broadcast, featuring the host Jeremy Wade catching a wels catfish in the cooling pools of the Chernobyl power plant at the heart of the Exclusion Zone. On 16 February 2014, an episode of the British motoring TV programme Top Gear was broadcast, featuring two of the presenters, Jeremy Clarkson and James May, driving into the Exclusion Zone. A portion of the finale of the Netflix documentary Our Planet, released in 2019, was filmed in the Exclusion Zone. The area was used as the primary example of how quickly an ecosystem can recover and thrive in the absence of human interference.[44] In 2019, Chernobyl Spirit Company released Atomik Vodka, the first consumer product made from materials grown and cultivated in the exclusion zone.[45] On 11 April 2022, the zone administration department suspended the validity of passes that allowed access to the exclusion zone, for the duration of martial law in Ukraine.[46]"

In 2007, the Ukrainian government adopted more severe criminal and administrative penalties for illegal activities in the alienation zone,[48] as well as reinforced units assigned to these tasks. The population of Przewalski's horse, introduced to the Exclusion Zone in 1998,[39] has reportedly fallen since 2005 due to poaching.[49]"

Commenting on the issue, UN Development Programme officials mentioned the plans to achieve \"self-reliance\" of the local population, \"agriculture revival\" and development of ecotourism.[54] However, it is not clear whether such plans, made by the UN and then-President Victor Yushchenko, deal with the zone of alienation proper, or only with the other three zones around the disaster site where contamination is less intense and restrictions on the population are looser (such as the district of Narodychi in Zhytomyr Oblast). Since 2011, tour operators have been bringing tourists inside the Exclusion Zone[55] (illegal tours may have started even before).[56] Tourists are accompanied by tour guides at all times and are not able to wander too far on their own due to the presence of several radioactive \"hot spots\". Pripyat was deemed safe for tourists to visit for a short period of time in the late 2010s, although certain precautions must be taken.[57][58] In 2016, the Ukrainian government declared the part of the exclusion zone on its territory the Chernobyl Radiation and Environmental Biosphere Reserve.[59] It was reported in 2016 that \"A heavily contaminated area within a 10-kilometer radius\" of the plant would be used for the storage of nuclear waste.[60] The IAEA carried out a feasibility study in 2018 to assess the prospect of expanding the local waste management infrastructure.[61] In 2017, three companies were reported developing plans for solar farms within the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone.[62] The high feed-in tariffs offered, the availability of land, and easy access to transmission lines (which formerly ran to the nuclear power station) have all been noted as beneficial to siting a solar farm.[63] The solar plant began operations in October 2018.[64] In 2019, following a three-year research project into the transfer of radioactivity to crops grown in the exclusion zone conducted by scientists from UK and Ukrainian universities, one bottle of vodka using grain from the zone was produced.[65] The vodka did not contain abnormal levels of radiation because of the distillation process. The researchers consider the production of vodka, and its sales profits, a means to aid economic recovery of the communities most adversely affected by the disaster.[65][66] The project later switched to producing and exporting \"Atomik\" apple spirit, made from apples grown in the Narodychi District.[67]"

        "content": "There has been an ongoing scientific debate about the extent to which flora and fauna of the zone were affected by the radioactive contamination that followed the accident.[68][69] As noted by Baker and Wickliffe, one of many issues is differentiating between negative effects of Chernobyl radiation and effects of changes in farming activities resulting from human evacuation.[69] \"Twenty-five years after the Chernobyl meltdown, the scientific community has not yet been able to provide a clear understanding of the spectrum of ecological effects created by that radiological disaster.\"[69] Near the facility, a dense cloud of radioactive dust killed off a large area of Scots pine trees; the rusty orange color of the dead trees led to the nickname \"The Red Forest\" (\u2013\u2020\u2014\u00c9\u2013\u00a5\u2013\u220f\u2013\u03c0 \u2013\u00aa\u2014\u00f1\u2014\u00c5).[69] The Red Forest was among the world's most radioactive places; to reduce the hazard, the Red Forest was bulldozed and the highly radioactive wood was buried, though the soil continues to emit significant radiation.[70][71] Other species in the same area, such as birch trees, survived, indicating that plant species may vary considerably in their sensitivity to radiation.[69] Cases of mutant deformity in animals of the zone include partial albinism and other external malformations in swallows[72][73][74] and insect mutations.[75] A study of several hundred birds belonging to 48 different species also demonstrated that birds inhabiting highly radioactively contaminated areas had smaller brains compared to birds from clean areas.[76] A reduction in the density and the abundance of animals in highly radioactively contaminated areas has been reported for several taxa, including birds,[77][78] insects, spiders,[79] and mammals.[80] In birds, which are an efficient bioindicator, a negative correlation has been reported between background radiation and bird species richness.[81] Scientists such as Anders Pape M\u221a\u220fller (University of Paris-Sud) and Timothy Mousseau (University of South Carolina) report that birds and smaller animals such as voles may be particularly affected by radioactivity.[82] M\u221a\u220fller is the first author on 9 of the 20 most-cited articles relating to the ecology, evolution and non-human biology in the Chernobyl area.[83] However, some of M\u221a\u220fller's research has been criticized as flawed.[84] Prior to his work at Chernobyl, M\u221a\u220fller was accused of falsifying data in a 1998 paper about asymmetry in oak leaves, which he retracted in 2001.[85][86][87] In 2004, the Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty (DCSD) reported that M\u221a\u220fller was guilty of \"scientific dishonesty\". The French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) subsequently concluded that there was insufficient evidence to establish either guilt or innocence.[85][88][89] Strongly held opinions about M\u221a\u220fller and his work have contributed to the difficulty of reaching a scientific consensus on the effects of radiation on wildlife in the Exclusion Zone.[68] More recently, the populations of large mammals have increased due to a significant reduction of human interference.[90][82] The populations of traditional Polesian animals (such as the gray wolf, badger, wild boar, roe deer, white-tailed eagle, black stork, western marsh harrier, short-eared owl, red deer, moose, great egret, whooper swan, least weasel, common kestrel, and beaver) have multiplied enormously and begun expanding outside the zone.[91][92] The zone is considered as a classic example of an involuntary park.[93] The return of wolves and other animals to the area is being studied by scientists such as Marina Shkvyria (National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine), Sergey Gaschak (Chernobyl Centre in Ukraine), and Jim Beasley (University of Georgia). Camera traps have been installed and are used to record the presence of species. Studies of wolves, which are concentrated in higher-radiation areas near the center of the exclusion zone, may enable researchers to better assess relationships between radiation levels, animal health, and population dynamics.[39][82] The area also houses herds of European bison (native to the area) and Przewalski's horses (foreign to the area, as the extinct tarpan was the native wild horse) released there after the accident. Some accounts refer to the reappearance of extremely rare native lynx, and there are videos of brown bears and their cubs, an animal not seen in the area for more than a century.[94] Special game warden units are organized to protect and control them. No scientific study has been conducted on the population dynamics of these species. The rivers and lakes of the zone pose a significant threat of spreading polluted silt during spring floods. They are systematically secured by dikes."

Grass and forest fires have happened inside the contaminated zone, releasing radioactive fallout into the atmosphere. In 1986, a series of fires destroyed 2,336 hectares (5,772 acres) of forest, and several other fires have since burned within the 30\u00a0km (19\u00a0mi) zone. A serious fire in early May 1992 affected 500\u00a0ha (1,240 acres) of land, including 270\u00a0ha (670 acres) of forest. This resulted in a great increase in the levels of caesium-137 in airborne dust.[95][100][101][102] In 2010, a series of wildfires affected contaminated areas, specifically the surroundings of Bryansk and border regions with Belarus and Ukraine.[103] The Russian government claimed that there was no discernible increase in radiation levels, while Greenpeace accused the government of denial.[103] On 4 April 2020, a fire broke in the Zone on at least 20 hectares of Ukrainian forests. Approximately 90 firefighters were deployed to extinguish the blaze, as well as a helicopter and two aircraft. Radiation is still present in these forests, making firefighting more difficult; authorities stated that there was no danger to the surrounding population. The previous reported fire was in June 2018.[104]"

Though the immediate effects of the accident were negative, the area quickly recovered and is today seen as very healthy. The lack of people in the area has increased the biodiversity of the Exclusion Zone in the years since the disaster.[105] In the aftermath of the disaster, radioactive contamination in the air had a decidedly negative effect on the fauna, vegetation, rivers, lakes, and groundwater of the area. The radiation resulted in deaths among coniferous plants, soil invertebrates, and mammals, as well as a decline in reproductive numbers among both plants and animals.[106] The surrounding forest was covered in radioactive particles, resulting in the death of 400 hectares of the most immediate pine trees, though radiation damage can be found in an area of tens of thousands of hectares.[107] An additional concern is that as the dead trees in the Red Forest (named for the color of the dead pines) decay, contamination is leaking into the groundwater.[108] Despite all this, Professor Nick Beresford, an expert on Chernobyl and ecology, said that \"the overall effect was positive\" for the wildlife in the area.[109] The impact of radiation on individual animals has not been studied, but cameras in the area have captured evidence of a resurgence of the mammalian population \u201a\u00c4\u00ec including rare animals such as the lynx and the vulnerable European bison.[109] Research on the health of Chernobyl's wildlife is ongoing, and there is concern that the wildlife still suffers from some of the negative effects of the radiation exposure. Though it will be years before researchers collect the necessary data to fully understand the effects, for now, the area is essentially one of Europe's largest nature preserves. Overall, an assessment by plant biochemist Stuart Thompson concluded, \"the burden brought by radiation at Chernobyl is less severe than the benefits reaped from humans leaving the area.\" In fact, the ecosystem around the power plant \"supports more life than before\"."
