        "content": " Hurricane John, also known as Typhoon John, was the farthest-traveling tropical cyclone ever observed worldwide. It was also the longest-lasting tropical cyclone on record globally at the time, until it was surpassed by Cyclone Freddy in 2023.[1] John formed during the 1994 Pacific hurricane season, which had above-average activity due to the El Ni\u00f1o of 1994\u20131995,[2] and peaked as a Category\u00a05 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale, the highest categorization for hurricanes. Over the course of its existence, John followed a 13,180\u00a0km (8,190\u00a0mi) path from the eastern Pacific to the western Pacific and back to the central Pacific, lasting 31\u00a0days in total.[3][4][5] Because it existed in both the eastern and western Pacific, John was one of a small number of tropical cyclones to be designated as both a hurricane and a typhoon. Despite lasting for a full month, John barely affected land at all, bringing only minimal effects to the Hawaiian Islands and the United States military base on Johnston Atoll. Its remnants later affected Alaska."

        "content": "The origins of Hurricane John were thought by the United States National Hurricane Center (NHC) to be from a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa on July 25, 1994.[6][7] The wave subsequently moved across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean without distinction, before it crossed Central America and moved into the Eastern Pacific Ocean on or around August 8.[6][7] Upon entering the Eastern Pacific the wave gradually developed, before the NHC initiated advisories on the system and designated it as Tropical Depression Ten-E on August 11.[8] The system was at this time moving westwards and located around 345 miles (555\u00a0km) to the south-southeast of Acapulco, Mexico.[6][7] Quickly developing banding features and well-defined outflow, it was upgraded to a tropical storm and named John later that day.[3] A strong ridge of high pressure over the northeastern Pacific Ocean forced John westward, where upper level wind shear kept John a tropical storm. Intensity fluctuated considerably, however, as shear levels varied. More than once, shear cleared away most of the clouds above John and nearly caused it to weaken to a tropical depression.[3] However, after eight days of slow westward movement across the Pacific Ocean, shear lessened greatly on August 19, and John intensified significantly and was designated as a hurricane at 17:00 PDT. During an eighteen-hour period between August 19 and 20, John further strengthened from a weak Category\u00a01 hurricane to a Category\u00a03 major hurricane. Around 1100 PDT on August 20, John crossed into the central Pacific, the first of three basin crosses John would make.[3] After entering the central Pacific, John left the area monitored by the NHC and was instead monitored by the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC). As the storm moved slowly westward, Hurricane John continued to strengthen considerably in an increasingly favorable environment well south of the Hawaiian Islands; on August 22, John was designated a Category\u00a05 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale (the highest classification for hurricanes) and later that day (by Hawaii Standard Time) reached its peak intensity, with 1-minute sustained winds of 175 miles per hour (280\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 929 millibars (27.4\u00a0inHg).[9] Also, on August 22 (by Hawaii Standard Time), John made its closest approach to the Hawaiian Islands, 345 miles (555\u00a0km) to the south. John had threatened to turn north and affect the islands days before, but the ridge of high pressure that typically shields the islands from hurricanes kept John on its southerly path. Nonetheless, heavy rains and wind from the outer bands of John affected the islands.[9] With the Hawaiian Islands behind it, John began a slow turn to the north, taking near-direct aim at Johnston Atoll, a small group of islands populated only by a United States military base. The storm slowly weakened from its peak as a Category\u00a05 hurricane in the face of increasing shear, dropping down to a Category\u00a01 hurricane with maximum winds of 90\u00a0mph (150\u00a0km/h). On August 25 local time, John made its closest approach to the Johnston Atoll only 15 miles (24\u00a0km) to the north. On Johnston Atoll, sustained winds were reported up to 60 miles per hour (97\u00a0km/h), the equivalent of a strong tropical storm, and gusts up to 75 miles per hour (121\u00a0km/h) were recorded.[10] Clearing Johnston Atoll, John turned to the northwest and began strengthening again as shear decreased. On August 27 local time, John reached a secondary peak strength of 130\u00a0mph (215\u00a0km/h), and shortly thereafter it crossed the International Date Line at approximately 22\u00b0 N and came under the surveillance of the Guam branch of the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). By crossing into the western Pacific, John also became a typhoon and was referred to as Typhoon John during its time in the western Pacific.[10] Immediately after crossing the Date Line, John again weakened and its forward motion stalled. By September 1, John had weakened to a tropical storm and was nearly motionless just west of the Date Line. There, John lingered for six days while performing a multi-day counterclockwise loop. On September 7, a trough moved into the area and quickly moved John to the northeast. John crossed the Date Line again on September 8 and reentered the central Pacific.[10] After reentering the central Pacific, John briefly reached a tertiary peak strength of 90\u00a0mph (150\u00a0km/h), a strong Category\u00a01 hurricane, well to the north of Midway Island. However, the trough was rapidly pulling apart John's structure, and the cold waters of the northern central Pacific were not conducive to a tropical cyclone. On September 10, the 120th advisory was released on the system, finally declaring John to have become extratropical approximately 1,000 miles (1,600\u00a0km) south of Unalaska Island.[10]"

        "content": "John's 31-day existence made it the longest-lasting tropical cyclone recorded in the Pacific Ocean, surpassing Hurricane Tina's previous record of 24\u00a0days in the 1992 season, and the longest-lived globally on record, surpassing the San Ciriaco hurricane's duration of 28\u00a0days in the 1899 Atlantic season.[11] John's global record stood until 2023, when it was broken by Cyclone Freddy, which traversed the Indian Ocean in the Southern Hemisphere for 36\u00a0days.[1] Additionally, despite its slow movement throughout much of its path, John was also the farthest-traveling tropical cyclone in both the Pacific Ocean and globally, with a distance traveled of 13,180\u00a0km (8,190\u00a0mi), only behind 2023's Cyclone Freddy, with a distance traveled of 12,785 km (7,945 mi), or about 33% of the Earth's circumference,[1] outdistancing the previous record of 4,700 miles (7,600\u00a0km) set by Hurricane Fico in the 1978 season.[4] In addition, John was the first tropical cyclone on record to become a hurricane in the Eastern Pacific (east of 140\u00b0W), traverse the entire Central Pacific at hurricane strength, and then cross into the Western Pacific at the International Date Line (180\u00b0W) and become a typhoon, a feat matched only by Hurricane Dora in 2023.[12] Pressure readings from John's peak are not consistently available as the CPHC did not monitor pressures at the time, but Air Force Reserve aircraft did measure a surface pressure of 929 mbar (hPa), making John one of the most intense hurricanes recorded in the central Pacific; both hurricanes Emilia and Gilma of 1994, as well as hurricanes Ioke of 2006 and Lane and Walaka of 2018 all recorded lower pressures in the central Pacific. However, all five had lower wind speeds than John. (Intensity is measured by minimum central pressure, which correlates with but is not directly linked to wind speeds.) John was also only the fourth Category\u00a05 hurricane recorded in the central Pacific (the first was Hurricane Patsy in 1959, the second was Hurricane Emilia and the third one was Hurricane Gilma, both earlier in 1994). John also possessed the highest recorded wind speed in a central Pacific hurricane, 175\u00a0mph (280\u00a0km/h), a record shared with the aforementioned Patsy of 1959.[9] Since 1994, only three Category\u00a05 hurricanes, Ioke in 2006, and hurricanes Lane and Walaka in 2018 have formed in or entered into the Central Pacific. Despite this however, John's pressure record is incomplete; the 929 millibars (27.43\u00a0inHg) reading was only measured when the winds were 160\u00a0mph (260\u00a0km/h); there is no pressure estimate for when it had winds of 175\u00a0mph (280\u00a0km/h), so it could have been more intense than Emilia, Gilma, Ioke, Lane, or Walaka.[13]"

        "content": "John affected both the Hawaiian Islands and Johnston Atoll, but only lightly. While John passed over 345 miles (555\u00a0km) to the south of Hawaii, the islands did experience strengthened trade winds and rough surf along the southeast- and south-facing shores, and, while moving westward, on west-facing shores as well.[10] The waves, ranging from 6 to 10\u00a0ft (1.8 to 3.0\u00a0m) in height, flooded beach parks in Kailua-Kona.[14] Additionally, heavy rains on the Big Island of Hawai\u02bbi caused minor, localized flooding and some short-term road closures. No deaths, injuries or significant damages were reported in Hawai\u02bbi.[10] Although John passed within 25\u00a0km (16\u00a0mi) of Johnston Atoll, it had weakened greatly to a Category\u00a01 system by closest approach.[10] Prior to the storm's arrival, waves between 20 and 30\u00a0ft (6.1 and 9.1\u00a0m) were reported on the island.[15] Additionally, in the Northern Hemisphere, the strongest winds and heaviest rain lie to the north of a tropical cyclone, so the atoll, which lay to the south of the storm's path, was spared the brunt of the storm. Nonetheless, the 1,100-man personnel for the United States military base on Johnston Atoll had been evacuated to Honolulu as a precaution while John approached. Damage to structures was considerable, but the size of the island and relative functionality of the base led to low damage; monetary losses were estimated at close to $15\u00a0million (1994 US$).[10] The remnants of John moved through the Aleutian Islands, producing a wind gust of 46\u00a0mph (74\u00a0km/h) in Unalaska. The storm brought a plume of warm air, and two stations recorded a high temperature of 66\u00a0\u00b0F (19\u00a0\u00b0C).[16]"

The tropical disturbance soon developed into Tropical Depression 09 on 9 February.[2] On the same day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded the system, giving it the designation \"12S\". The storm intensified into a moderate tropical storm and was given the name Giovanna.[3] On 10 February, Giovanna continued to strengthen into a severe tropical storm.[4] Later the same day, Giovanna went through a rapid intensification period and became an intense tropical cyclone, due to favorable environmental conditions.[5] Soon, Giovanna began an eyewall replacement cycle[6] and weakened into a Category 3-equivalent tropical cyclone on 11 February, due to high wind shear around the system.[7] However, the wind shear surrounding the storm soon weakened,  and Giovanna was able to restrengthen back into an intense tropical cyclone as it finished the eyewall replacement cycle, resulting with a new, larger eye 50 kilometres (31\u00a0mi) across.[8] At about 2200 UTC on February 13 (0100 EAT February 14), Giovanna made landfall at Andevoranto, Madagascar.[9] Giovanna then weakened into an overland tropical depression on 14 February.[10] Early on 15 February, Giovanna moved back out into open water, and drifted southwestward over the next few days. On February 18, Giovanna turned eastwards, and the storm was steered into warmer waters off the southern coast of Madagascar by a strong anticyclone located to the south. Giovanna strengthened into a Category 2 tropical cyclone again and developed a small eye. However, the eye soon underwent another eyewall replacement cycle, and again began to weaken. On February 20, Giovanna entered an area of strong vertical wind shear, which displaced the system's convection to the south of the circulation center and quickly weakened the system into a tropical depression.[11] On 22 February, the continued strong shear caused Giovanna to degenerate into a remnant low.[12] The remnants of the storm moved further northwestward the next day, due to a Fujiwhara interaction with a stronger system to the east, Moderate Tropical Storm Hilwa, and late on 24 February, Giovanna's remnants dissipated east of Madagascar."

On September\u00a05, an abrupt shift in steering currents caused the system to turn north-northwestward. Early on September\u00a06, the system intensified into a typhoon. Over the following two days, Babe quickly intensified, ultimately attaining its peak intensity early on September\u00a08 with winds of 240\u00a0km/h (150\u00a0mph) and a barometric pressure of 905 mbar (hPa; 26.72\u00a0inHg). Not long after reaching this strength, another shift in the steering patterns caused the typhoon to execute a prolonged counter-clockwise arc, causing it to track through the Ryukyu Islands southwest of Japan, as it interacted with a low pressure originating from the Korean Peninsula. During this time, the system gradually weakened and eventually it made landfall near Shanghai, China on September\u00a011 as a minimal typhoon before dissipating inland the following day. Coincidentally, Typhoon Babe and Atlantic Hurricane Babe existed at the same time from September\u00a03\u20139.[3] Passing through the Ryukyu Islands as a powerful typhoon, Babe caused considerable damage in the region. More than 1,000\u00a0homes were destroyed and nearly 7,000\u00a0more were damaged or flooded. One person was killed on Amami \u014cshima and 77\u00a0others were injured throughout the country. Total losses reached \u00a56.1\u00a0billion (US$23\u00a0million). Offshore, over 100\u00a0vessels were affected by the storm, including a Panamanian freighter where 13\u00a0people died. In China, more than 24,000\u00a0homes were destroyed and nine people were killed."

        "content": "In late August 1977, an area of disturbed weather was noted south of Pohnpei. By September\u00a01, a weak surface low accompanied by organized convection developed within the disturbance. Situated to the south of a tropical upper tropospheric trough, conditions were favorable for further organization and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the system. Tracking steadily west-northwestward in response to a well-developed subtropical ridge extending from the International Date Line to China, the system was soon classified a tropical depression early on September\u00a02. Hours later, a weather reconnaissance mission into the depression revealed winds of 75\u00a0km/h (47\u00a0mph), prompting the JTWC to designate the system as Tropical Storm Babe.[2] Due to the cyclone's proximity to the Philippines, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Miling.[4] Initially, forecasters anticipated Babe to maintain its westward course as it strengthened and threaten the Philippines; however, its forward motion gradually slowed as it neared the region. On September\u00a05, an upper-level trough formed over northeastern Asia and created a weakness in the subtropical ridge, allowing Babe to turn north-northwestward. Over the following two days, the storm quickly strengthened as divergence increased ahead of the storm, with Babe attaining typhoon status early on September\u00a06 Between 0832\u00a0UTC on September\u00a05 and 2204\u00a0UTC on September\u00a07, the storm's barometric pressure dropped from 988 mbar (hPa; 29.18\u00a0inHg) to 907 mbar (hPa; 26.78\u00a0inHg), approximately 1.3 mbar (hPa; 0.04\u00a0inHg) per hour. Early on September\u00a08, Babe attained its peak intensity with winds of 240\u00a0km/h (150\u00a0mph) while situated approximately 465\u00a0km (289\u00a0mi) southeast of Ishigaki Island. This ranked it as the first and only super typhoon of the 1977 season.[2] At this time, the Japan Meteorological Agency estimated the storm to have had peak ten-minute sustained winds of 205\u00a0km/h (127\u00a0mph) and a minimum pressure of 905 mbar (hPa; 26.72\u00a0inHg).[5] Until September\u00a08, Babe was forecast to continue northwestward into Taiwan and later China; however, another upper-level trough moved into northeastern China and further weakened the ridge. This in turn allowed a new area of low pressure to develop over the Korean Peninsula and cause Babe to curve northeastward. While moving northeastward, Babe gradually weakened and began to undergo a Fujiwhara-like interaction with the low near Korea as that system moved southwestward. Accelerating along a counter-clockwise arc, Babe moved through the Ryukyu Islands as a weakening typhoon on September\u00a09 before taking a steady westward course into China.[2] As the system passed through the archipelago, a pressure of 907.3 mbar (hPa; 0.089\u00a0inHg) was measured on Okinoerabujima.[1] Babe eventually made landfall near Shanghai with winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph) before rapidly weakening over land.[2] The system was last noted early on September\u00a012 over Anhui Province.[5]"

The seventh named storm and fourth typhoon of the season, Imbudo formed on July\u00a015 to the east of the Philippines. The storm moved generally west-northward for much of its duration due to a ridge to the north. Favorable conditions allowed Imbudo to intensify, gradually at first before undergoing rapid deepening on July\u00a019. After reaching typhoon status, Imbudo strengthened further to peak 10\u2013minute sustained winds of 165\u00a0km/h (103\u00a0mph) on July\u00a020. The typhoon made landfall on northern Luzon near peak intensity on July\u00a022, but quickly weakened over land. Once in the South China Sea, Imbudo re-intensified slightly before making its final landfall in southern China near Yangjiang on July\u00a024, dissipating the next day. In the Philippines, Imbudo was the strongest typhoon in five years, causing widespread flooding and power outages in the Cagayan Valley for weeks. Damage was heaviest in Isabela province near where the storm struck. Most of the banana crop was destroyed, and other crops sustained similar but lesser damage. Imbudo disrupted transportation across much of Luzon.

With weak wind shear, the system slowly became better organized.[2] On July\u00a015, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA)[nb 4] estimated that a tropical depression formed.[3] The next day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)[nb 5] issued a tropical cyclone formation alert (TCFA), noting that outflow had increased due to an upper-level low to the northeast. At 1800\u00a0UTC on July\u00a016, the JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Depression 09W about 665\u00a0km (413\u00a0mi) east of Yap.[2] A subtropical ridge near Okinawa steered the nascent depression to the west-northwest for much of its duration. With warm waters and favorable upper-level conditions, the depression quickly organized,[5] and the JMA upgraded it to Tropical Storm Imbudo on July\u00a017.[3] After becoming a tropical storm, Imbudo passed about 35\u00a0km (22\u00a0mi) north of Yap.[2] The JMA upgraded Imbudo to a severe tropical storm late on July\u00a018,[3] around the same time that the JTWC upgraded it to a typhoon. An increase in outflow to the south and to the north from a tropical upper tropospheric trough (TUTT) caused a 36\u2011hour period of rapid development beginning on July\u00a019.[5] During that time, the JMA upgraded Imbudo to typhoon status,[3] the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) began issuing advisories as the storm approached the Philippines,[1] and a 30\u00a0km (19\u00a0mi) wide eye formed.[2] At 1200\u00a0UTC on July\u00a020, the JMA estimated peak 10\u00a0minute sustained winds of 165\u00a0km/h (103\u00a0mph).[3] At the same time, the JTWC estimated 1\u00a0minute sustained winds of 240\u00a0km/h (150\u00a0mph), making it a super typhoon.[5] By late on July\u00a020, the typhoon had developed concentric eyewalls, and the TUTT was moving away, thus diminishing outflow.[2] Imbudo maintained peak winds for about 12\u00a0hours,[3] before the innermost eye contracted to a diameter of 11\u00a0km (6.8\u00a0mi) in the midst of an eyewall replacement cycle.[2] At 0300\u00a0UTC on July\u00a022, Imbudo struck northern Luzon, with 1\u00a0minute winds estimated at 205\u00a0km/h (127\u00a0mph) by the JTWC.[5] Rapidly weakening over land, Imbudo emerged into the South China Sea about six hours after landfall.[2][3] The JTWC estimated winds had decreased to 150\u00a0km/h (93\u00a0mph), although the agency estimated Imbudo quickly re-intensified to a secondary peak of 165\u00a0km/h (103\u00a0mph) in 1\u00a0minute winds. Dry air prevented convection from redeveloping significantly, and the eye had become large over open waters.[2] At 0300\u00a0UTC on July\u00a024, Imbudo made its final landfall west of Macau,[3] near Yangjiang, Guangdong.[6] It was the strongest to hit the province since Typhoon Sally in 1996,[7] striking China with 10\u00a0minute winds of 140\u00a0km/h (87\u00a0mph), as estimated by the JMA. The storm rapidly weakened over land while moving over southern China. Late on July\u00a025, Imbudo dissipated near the border of China and Vietnam.[3]"

The military stated it was due to the typhoon, although newspapers suggested it was to prevent a coup attempt;[12] a failed coup ultimately did occur on July\u00a027 in what would become known as the Oakwood mutiny.[13] The Hong Kong Observatory issued a number 8 warning signal, indicating the potential for gale-force winds within the territory.[6] At Hong Kong International Airport, at least 100\u00a0flights were canceled or delayed.[14] Most ferry and some bus lines were temporarily suspended.[6] The threat of the storm caused 16\u00a0flights to be canceled and another 54\u00a0delayed at Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport.[6] On Hainan island, 32\u00a0canceled flights stranded about 1,500\u00a0travelers.[14]  The threat of the storm forced British Prime Minister Tony Blair to shorten a trip to the territory.[15] The Hong Kong Stock Exchange opened 30\u00a0minutes late as a result of the typhoon.[16] On the mainland at Yangjiang, more than 30,000\u00a0people evacuated ahead of the storm.[17]"

In Isabela province, the banana crop was almost entirely destroyed, and most of the corn and rice crops were heavily damaged.[10] The high damage caused the gross regional product, or overall economy of the Cagayan Valley, to decrease by 0.3% than what would have happened without the typhoon.[20] Power outages affected Metro Manila, and several billboards were damaged in the city, although there was minimal flooding in the capital. Adverse conditions caused the Manila Light Rail Transit System Line 1 to close for two hours, stranding hundreds. High winds knocked over a 12\u00a0m (39\u00a0ft) tree that killed five on Romblon Island. The rains brought the Magat Dam on Luzon to capacity.[11] Landslides blocked a national highway in Nueva Ecija with debris and fallen trees, which were quickly cleared within a few days.[19] On Mindanao, flash flooding from the outer periphery of the storm affected 18\u00a0towns, killing 11\u00a0people.[22][23] In Maguindanao in the southern Philippines, flooding washed away 50\u00a0houses, forcing over 2,000\u00a0people to evacuate.[8] Damage extended as far south as the Western Visayas.[20] Across the Philippines, Imbudo damaged 62,314\u00a0houses, of which about 20% were destroyed. Housing damage was estimated at P1.2\u00a0billion (PHP, US$22\u00a0million), most of which in the Cagayan Valley.[nb 6][20] Overall damage in the country was estimated at P4.7\u00a0billion (PHP, US$86\u00a0million).[1][nb 6] Of the total, about P1.9\u00a0billion (PHP, US$35\u00a0million)[nb 6] was in agriculture damage.[18] Imbudo killed 64\u00a0people in the Philippines, mostly in Cagayan Valley, and injured another 154.[1][20]"

There, a weather station measured a peak wind gust of 85\u00a0km/h (53\u00a0mph); winds of similar intensity were reported in Yap. Rainfall from Imbudo in Micronesia peaked at 226\u00a0mm (8.9\u00a0in) over a six-hour period on Yap. The rainfall from the passing tropical cyclone caused $75,000\u00a0in property damage and $25,000\u00a0in agricultural and crop-related damage.[25] Before Imbudo struck mainland China, it passed south of Taiwan, dropping heavy rainfall reaching 137\u00a0mm (5.4\u00a0in) in Taitung County.[2] The outer rainbands reached as far as Okinawa, where 2\u00a0mm (0.079\u00a0in) was reported.[26] Peak rainfall in Hong Kong was 53.5\u00a0mm (2.11\u00a0in) at Kwai Chung,[6] only a day after Tropical Storm Koni dropped rainfall in the territory,[27] and the highest storm surge was 1.13\u00a0m (3.7\u00a0ft) at Tsim Bei Tsui. As the storm passed to the south, Imbudo produced winds of 101\u00a0km/h (63\u00a0mph) on Cheung Chau, the highest in the Hong Kong territory, although a gust of 164\u00a0km/h (102\u00a0mph) was observed at Tai Mo Shan. High winds killed a man after knocking him off a platform. The winds knocked down 83\u00a0trees, injuring 11\u00a0people. Rough waves injured 34\u00a0people traveling by boat near Lantau Island.[6] In the territory, ten boats were damaged or sank, and one fishing pier was damaged.[27] At its final landfall in Guangdong, Imbudo produced strong winds, with a peak gust of 200\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph) measured at Shangchuan Island. At Yangjiang, gusts reached 159\u00a0km/h (99\u00a0mph),[2] causing eleven boats to sink.[14] There, over 10,000\u00a0trees fell due to the strong winds, more than half in the city,[28] and 7,649\u00a0homes were damaged or destroyed.[29] In Zhanjiang, the storm damaged power lines and water pumps, leaving residents without access to water.[2] Imbudo spawned tornadoes in Luoding and Zhanjiang, damaging dozens of houses and killing 6,000\u00a0chickens.[30] Throughout Guangdong, Imbudo destroyed 595,000\u00a0houses and caused \u00a51.9\u00a0billion (CNY, US$230\u00a0million).[nb 7] There were at least eight deaths in the province.[2] In Hainan island to the south of the storm track, rainfall reached 230\u00a0mm (9.1\u00a0in) in Ding'an County.[2] Imbudo caused flooding in the capital Haikou, and several houses were wrecked.[31] The typhoon affected most of the population, causing an estimated \u00a555.35\u00a0million (CNY, US$6.7\u00a0million) in damage.[nb 7][2] Heavy rainfall spread across southern China, peaking at 343\u00a0mm (13.5\u00a0in) at Hepu County in Guangxi province,[2] which increased water levels in 45\u00a0reservoirs to warning levels.[32] The Nanliu River in Bobai County rose to 50.21\u00a0m (164.7\u00a0ft), or 0.71\u00a0m (2.3\u00a0ft) above flood stage.[33] In Guangxi, 12\u00a0people died from storm damage or drowning, and at least 130\u00a0livestock were killed. Imbudo destroyed 4,950\u00a0houses,[2] 3,170\u00a0of which in the city of Yulin,[34] causing \u00a5499.6\u00a0million (CNY, US$60.3\u00a0million) in damage in the province.[nb 7][2] Across southern China, the typhoon damaged over 10\u00a0million hectares (25\u00a0million acres) of crop fields.[6]"

        "content": " Typhoon Maemi (pronounced [m\u025b.mi])  (pronounced [ma.emi\u02d0]), known in the Philippines as Typhoon Pogi,[1] was the most powerful typhoon to strike South Korea since record-keeping began in the country in 1904. Maemi formed on 4\u00a0September 2003, from a disturbance in a monsoon trough in the western Pacific Ocean. It slowly intensified into Tropical Storm Maemi while moving northwestward, becoming a typhoon on September\u00a08. That day, favorable conditions facilitated more rapid strengthening; the storm developed a well-defined eye and reached peak maximum sustained winds of 195\u00a0km/h (121\u00a0mph).[nb 1] While near peak intensity, Maemi decelerated and began turning to the north-northeast. Soon after, the eyewall passed over the Japanese island of Miyako-jima on September\u00a010 and produced an air pressure reading of 912\u00a0mbar (26.9\u00a0inHg), the fourth-lowest recorded in the nation. Due to warm waters, Maemi was able to maintain much of its intensity before it made landfall just west of Busan, South Korea, on September\u00a012. The typhoon became extratropical in the Sea of Japan the next day, although its remnants persisted for several days, lashing northern Japan with strong winds. The typhoon first affected the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. On Miyako-jima, strong winds damaged 104\u00a0buildings and left 95% of residents without power. Maemi caused heavy rainfall there, with rates of 58.5\u00a0mm (2.30\u00a0in) in an hour and 402.5\u00a0mm (15.85\u00a0in) in 24\u00a0hours, the latter setting a record. One person died on Miyako-jima after being struck by airborne debris. Elsewhere in Japan, the storm caused flights to be canceled, and rainfall-induced landslides blocked roads. There were two other deaths in Japan, and damage totaled \u00a511.3\u00a0billion yen (JPY, $96\u00a0million USD).[nb 2] Damage was heaviest in South Korea, particularly where it moved ashore. On Jeju Island, Maemi produced a peak wind gust of 216\u00a0km/h (134\u00a0mph) and a minimum pressure of 950\u00a0mbar (28\u00a0inHg), both setting records for the country; the pressure reading broke the longstanding lowest pressure set by Typhoon Sarah in 1959. Winds in Busan near the landfall location reached 154\u00a0km/h (96\u00a0mph), the second-highest on record. The port there sustained heavy damage, restricting exports in the months following the storm. Nationwide, the high winds destroyed about 5,000\u00a0houses and damaged 13,000\u00a0homes and businesses, leaving 25,000\u00a0people homeless. About 1.47\u00a0million households lost power, and widespread crop damage occurred, resulting in the poorest rice harvest in 23\u00a0years. Across South Korea, Maemi killed 117\u00a0people, and overall damage totaled \u20a95.52\u00a0trillion won (KRW, US$4.8\u00a0billion)."

        "content": "In early September 2003, a monsoon trough created a tropical disturbance near Guam.[3] The system consisted of a disorganized area of convection, or thunderstorms, in an area of moderate wind shear. By September\u00a04, the convection was becoming better organized around a weak low-level circulation. Despite the wind shear, the system continued to develop,[5] becoming a tropical depression north of Chuuk State.[2] At 0200\u00a0UTC on September\u00a05, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)[nb 3] issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert, and later that day initiated advisories on Tropical Depression 15W just west of Guam. By that time, the convection had increased over the center. For the first week of its existence, the cyclone tracked generally northwestward, steered by a subtropical ridge to the north.[5] Early on September\u00a06, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA)[nb 4] upgraded the depression to a tropical storm and named it Maemi,[2] meaning \"cicada\" in Korean. With more favorable conditions, including lesser wind shear and enhanced outflow, the storm continued to intensify.[5] The JMA upgraded Maemi to a severe tropical storm on September\u00a07 and to typhoon status\u00a0\u2013 winds of over 119\u00a0km/h (74\u00a0mph)\u00a0\u2013 the next day.[2] The JTWC had upgraded Maemi to typhoon status on September\u00a07 after an eye feature appeared on satellite imagery.[5] Also around that time, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) began issuing advisories on the storm, giving it the local name \"Pogi\", although the typhoon would remain away from the country.[1] On September\u00a08, Maemi began undergoing rapid deepening due to enhanced outflow,[3] aided by the flow of an approaching shortwave trough.[5] At 1200\u00a0UTC on September\u00a09, the JTWC estimated 1-minute sustained winds of 240\u00a0km/h (150\u00a0mph) and designated Maemi as a super typhoon. The next day, the same agency estimated peak winds of 280\u00a0km/h (170\u00a0mph) and gusts to 335\u00a0km/h (208\u00a0mph), the equivalent of a Category\u00a05 on the Saffir-Simpson scale.[3] At 1200\u00a0UTC on September\u00a010, the JMA estimated peak 10-minute winds of 195\u00a0km/h (121\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 910\u00a0mbar (27\u00a0inHg) while the storm was 155\u00a0km (96\u00a0mi) southeast of the Japanese island of Miyako-jima.[2] At peak intensity, Maemi was a small typhoon, with gale-force winds extending only 240\u00a0km (150\u00a0mi) from the well-defined eye.[5] Around the time of peak intensity, Maemi was slowing its forward motion and began turning to the north, after the eastward-moving trough weakened the ridge.[3] At 1900\u00a0UTC on September\u00a010, the typhoon passed within 10\u00a0km (6.2\u00a0mi) of Miyako-jima.[2] While the eye was passing over the island, the pressure fell to 912\u00a0mbar (26.9\u00a0inHg) and winds reached 250\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph).[5] Maemi weakened slightly as it continued north, passing about 220\u00a0km (140\u00a0mi) west of Okinawa on September\u00a011 while undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle.[3] Increasingly hostile conditions from the approaching trough caused further weakening, and the JTWC estimated the typhoon passed just east of Jeju Island with 1-minute winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph) at 0600\u00a0UTC on September\u00a012. Shortly after, Maemi made landfall just west of Busan, South Korea,[2] with the JMA estimating 10-minute winds of 140\u00a0km/h (87\u00a0mph),[2] and JTWC estimating 1-minute winds of 165\u00a0km/h (103\u00a0mph).[3] Risk Management Solutions estimated landfall winds of 190\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph), which surpassed Typhoon Sarah in 1959. This made Maemi the strongest typhoon to strike the country since the Korea Meteorological Administration began keeping records in 1904.[7] The storm was able to maintain much of its intensity due to warm sea surface temperatures and its fast forward motion.[8] Maemi rapidly weakened to tropical storm status while moving over land,[2] and was undergoing extratropical transition by the time it entered the Sea of Japan. Increasing wind shear removed the convection from the increasingly ill-defined circulation center. The JTWC issued its final warning on Maemi early on September\u00a013, declaring the storm extratropical.[5] The JMA followed suit later that day, tracking Maemi over northern Japan and declaring it extratropical over the Sea of Okhotsk. The remnants of Maemi persisted for several more days, until the JMA stopped tracking it on September\u00a016 southwest of the Kamchatka Peninsula.[2] According to the Mariners Weather Log, the remnants of Maemi continued to the east, eventually striking the coast of Alaska on September\u00a021.[9]"

About 25,000\u00a0people were forced to evacuate,[7] either to schools or relatives' houses.[12] The Korea Meteorological Administration advised travelers to take precaution in advance of the storm.[13] Ferry and airplane services were canceled to Jeju island, stranding residents ahead of the Chuseok holiday.[14] Officials in Primorsky Krai in the Russian Far East issued a storm warning, noting the potential for strong winds and heavy rainfall.[15]"

For 16\u00a0hours, excluding the 2-hour passage of the eye, the pressure fell to 912\u00a0mbar (26.9\u00a0inHg), the second-lowest on record on the island after Typhoon Sarah in 1959, and at the time the fourth lowest in all of Japan.[5] The typhoon produced heavy rainfall on Miyako-jima totaling 470\u00a0mm (19\u00a0in), of which 402.5\u00a0mm (15.85\u00a0in) fell in 24\u00a0hours, breaking the daily record. Also on the island, 58.5\u00a0mm (2.30\u00a0in) fell in one hour, and 22\u00a0mm (0.87\u00a0in) fell in just 10\u00a0minutes.[5][16] On the island, Maemi damaged 104\u00a0buildings,[16] including two severely damaged houses.[11] The storm damaged roads in 36\u00a0locations and caused a power outage,[16] affecting about 20,900\u00a0people, or 95% of the island.[17] One person on Miyako-jima died after being struck by flying glass.[18] News agencies considered Maemi the strongest typhoon to affect Okinawa since 1968.[18] Elsewhere in Okinawa Prefecture, wind gusts reached 109\u00a0km/h (68\u00a0mph) in Nago.[5] On Ishigaki Island, strong winds damaged houses and crops, while high tides flooded low-lying buildings.[19] Across the region, 94\u00a0people were injured, mostly from broken glass.[18] Shortly before Maemi made its final landfall, it produced wind gusts of 167\u00a0km/h (104\u00a0mph) at Izuhara, a Japanese island halfway between South Korea and Japan. Along the southwest coast of Japan, a weather station in Hirado reported gusts of 113\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph).[5] The typhoon resulted in heavy rainfall on the Japanese main island of Kyushu, reaching 457\u00a0mm (18.0\u00a0in) at a station in Miyazaki Prefecture.[20] Rainfall-induced landslides in Nagasaki forced 191\u00a0people to evacuate their homes.[21] Heavy rainfall also caused landslides in \u014cita Prefecture,[22] and K\u014dchi Prefecture, where several roads were closed.[23] The threat of the storm caused schools to close in Yamaguchi Prefecture.[24] The storm spawned an F1 tornado in K\u014dchi that damaged several houses and flipped over a car, injuring a woman inside.[25] As an extratropical storm, Maemi left 2,500\u00a0people in Hokkaido without power after producing gusts of 108\u00a0km/h (67\u00a0mph) in Hakodate.[26] Wind gusts reached 116\u00a0km/h (72\u00a0mph) in Akita, the third-highest September wind gust at the station.[27] A falling tree in Sapporo killed one person and injured two others.[28] High waves damaged fisheries and 54\u00a0ships in Matsumae alone,[26] and nationwide 262\u00a0ships were damaged.[20] Rough seas also killed one person in Akita Prefecture.[27] The typhoon destroyed 1,498\u00a0homes across the country and flooded 363\u00a0others. The storm also damaged 9\u00a0ha (22 acres) of fields. In total, Maemi killed three people and injured 107 in Japan, two severely. Overall damage totaled \u00a511.3\u00a0billion (JPY, $96\u00a0million USD).[nb 5][20]"

        "content": "Since Typhoon Maemi took a path closer to the form of a parabolic, a typical pattern of typhoons from outbreak to extinction, it was relatively possible to predict its course and the possibility of landing on the Korean Peninsula was expected fairly early. The Korea Meteorological Administration officially announced the typhoon's possible landing off the southern coast of the Korean Peninsula at 5 p.m. on 10 Sep, making the news widely known through major media organizations.[30] When Typhoon Maemi struck South Korea, it caused heavy rainfall that peaked at 453\u00a0mm (17.8\u00a0in).[7] Rainfall reached 401.5\u00a0mm (15.81\u00a0in) in Namhae County,[5] and 255\u00a0mm (10.0\u00a0in) on Jeju Island.[14] The rain was less widespread and caused less flooding than Typhoon Rusa, which struck the country a year prior, but damage from Maemi was heavier due to strong winds.[31] On Jeju Island, Maemi produced a wind gust of 216\u00a0km/h (134\u00a0mph) and a minimum pressure of 950\u00a0mbar (28\u00a0inHg), both setting records for the country.[8] The winds broke the record of 210\u00a0km/h (130\u00a0mph) set by Typhoon Prapiroon in 2000,[32] and the pressure was 1.5\u00a0mbar lower than that during Typhoon Sarah in 1959,[8] which was one of the strongest storms to strike South Korea after Maemi.[7] On the South Korean mainland, the Pusan International Airport reported wind gusts of 143\u00a0km/h (89\u00a0mph).[5] Winds in Busan reached 154\u00a0km/h (96\u00a0mph), the second-highest wind speed for the city after Typhoon Thelma in 1987.[33] Due to high winds, five nuclear power plants were shut down automatically, but were ultimately unaffected.[34] In South Korea, damage was heaviest in South Gyeongsang Province, where 71\u00a0people were killed.[35] Damage was particularly heavy in Busan, as well in as Yecheon, Ulsan, and Daegu. In Busan, strong winds wrecked 11\u00a0lifting cranes, each weighing about 900\u00a0tons,[7] which injured five people and killed two in one incident.[36][37] Many shipyards in the region were closed,[7] and initial reports estimated it would take a year to fully reopen the Busan port.[38] The estimated damage to the Busan port was about $50\u00a0million (USD),[39] causing cargo capacity to be cut by 20%.[40] High waves turned a large ship on its side in Busan, and in Ulsan the waves knocked an offshore shipbuilding plant into a petroleum facility, damaging them both.[7] Sixteen people were killed in Busan.[41] High tides flooded hundreds of houses along the coast, particularly in areas without seawalls.[42] In Masan, the storm caused 12\u00a0fatalities when it flooded an underground shopping center.[35] On Jeju Island to the south of the country, Maemi destroyed sets of the Korean drama TV series All In,[43] and wrecked 32\u00a0houses. Two people were killed on the island,[44] one of whom while attempting to secure his boat.[45] Throughout the country, 465\u00a0boats were damaged or beached. The heavy rainfall caused mudslides, one of which in Chungcheong derailed a train, injuring 28\u00a0aboard.[7] Mudslides closed several roads,[12] and damaged five rail lines in ten locations.[46] Nationwide, the storm damaged 2,278\u00a0roads and bridges,[8] as well as nearly 40,000\u00a0cars.[7] Intense rainfall also caused flooding along the Nakdong River, reaching a flood stage of 5.06\u00a0m (16.6\u00a0ft) near Busan. There, the river produced a discharge of about 13,000\u00a0m3/s (460,000\u00a0ft3/s), strong enough to destroy a section of the Gupo Bridge.[47] Along a tributary of the Nakdong River, floods destroyed a dyke near Daegu.[48] Maemi also flooded 37,986\u00a0ha (93,870 acres) of fields before the fall harvest,[7] causing widespread damage to the rice crop.[47] On Ulleungdo island off the eastern coast, Maemi washed away the primary road and many houses, killing three. Residents there complained about the lack of advance warning.[49] Typhoon Maemi left about 1.47\u00a0million electric customers without power around the country,[34] causing \u20a912.9\u00a0billion (KRW, US$11.61\u00a0million)[nb 6] in damage to power companies.[36] Widespread damage interrupted mobile and cell phone service.[50] United States military bases in the country sustained about $4.5\u00a0million in damage.[51] Nationwide, Maemi destroyed about 5,000\u00a0houses and damaged 13,000\u00a0homes and businesses,[7] leaving 25,000\u00a0people homeless.[36] About 150\u00a0businesses in Gangwon Province were destroyed by Typhoon Rusa in 2002, only to be destroyed again by Maemi when they were rebuilt.[52] Insured damages from Maemi were estimated at \u20a9650\u00a0billion (KRW, $565\u00a0million), mostly property damage.[nb 7] The insured damage was over four times the amount of insured damage from Typhoon Rusa the year prior. Overall damage was estimated at \u20a95.52\u00a0trillion (KRW, US$4.8\u00a0billion). By comparison, this total was \u20a92.52\u00a0trillion (KRW, US$1.9\u00a0billion) less than Rusa; the discrepancy between the insured and overall damage was due to Maemi causing heavier industrial damage, while Rusa caused more damage overall.[7] The storm killed 117\u00a0people throughout South Korea.[8]"

        "content": "Following the storm, South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun declared the entire of the country excluding Seoul and Incheon as special disaster areas,[7] after touring the storm damage in Busan.[55] The government provided tax breaks and allocated \u20a91.4\u00a0trillion (KRW, $1.2\u00a0billion) in assistance to the affected residents,[7] after an additional budget was passed in late September 2003.[56] This included \u20a9100\u00a0billion (KRW, US$90\u00a0million)[nb 6] in immediate funds for search and rescue missions.[34] After the storm, residents complained they did not receive adequate warning and not enough coastal areas were evacuated, which led to the high death toll.[57] Widespread damage and continued flooding caused traffic jams in the days following the storm.[54] A damaged rail line prompted operators to provide alternate bus service. Landslides throughout the country forced travelers to use alternate routes.[14] By three days after the storm, most damaged roads and highways were reopened.[58] About 33,000\u00a0members of the South Korean Army were deployed to assist in relief efforts,[59] such as clearing roads and delivering aid to storm victims. Workers quickly restored power to 95% of customers within 24\u00a0hours.[34] The government installed four new cranes for the Busan port, and assisted operators to ensure exports would not be delayed.[60] Heavy crop damage caused fruit and vegetable prices to rise,[35] and fish and crop exports rose 9.2% on average.[61] The rice harvest was the lowest in 23\u00a0years, due to the storm and a government effort to limit production.[62] To assist farmers, the government increased purchases in federal contracts. Three government-run banks provided low-rate loans for businesses damaged by the storm.[56] Residual flooding from Maemi contributed to an outbreak of conjunctivitis in the southern portion of the country.[49] To prevent additional outbreaks, the Korean National Institute of Health sent 1,000\u00a0workers to storm-damaged areas.[63] The Korea Exchange fell 1.8% due to fears that storm damage would disrupt exports.[64] For the month of September 2003, the Korea Electric Power Corporation waived electric bills for residents who lost their homes, and cut bills in half for residents and businesses who lost power.[65] The South Korean government allowed companies to increase premiums for car insurance by 3.5% due to the widespread car damage.[7] Due to storm damage, 34\u00a0companies were forced to temporarily close.[66] Loss of production and disruptions were expected to subtract 0.5% from the forecast economic growth in 2003.[7] The Consumer Confidence Index dropped to its lowest level in five years, largely due to the typhoon damage and weakened economic conditions.[67] Following the strikes of Rusa and Maemi in consecutive years, the South Korean government worked on disaster management and mitigation programs.[31] In March 2004, the government passed the \"Emergency and Safety Management Basic Act\", largely due to the storm as well as the Daegu metro fire, which effectively set up a nationwide emergency management system.[68] The Gupo bridge damaged during the storm was repaired in 2007.[69] Although the South Korean government did not request international aid, several countries sent aid to the country.[55] A few days after Maemi struck, the United States Agency for International Development sent $50,000 (USD) to the Korean Red Cross.[70] Later, the government of Japan sent \u00a59.5\u00a0million (US$85,000)[nb 5] worth of supplies to South Korea, including sleeping mats, generators, and water units.[71] Taiwan also provided $100,000 in aid.[72] The Republic of Korea National Red Cross utilized 700\u00a0volunteers and 200\u00a0staff members to distribute food and blankets to 8,190\u00a0houses, while local offices provided over 5,500\u00a0meals.[12] Members of Food for the Hungry delivered food and clothing to storm-damaged residents in Masan.[73] As a result of the damage and deaths caused by the storm, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Maemi in 2006 and replaced it with Mujigae.[74]"

        "content": " Typhoon Kujira, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Amang,[1] was a long-lived tropical cyclone that lasted for 16\u00a0days and affected the island nations of Micronesia, Taiwan, and Japan in April\u00a02003, as well as the earliest typhoon in a calendar year to ever make landfall on the latter. Forming from a broad area of disturbed weather as a tropical depression on April\u00a09 well removed from any landmasses, Kujira quickly intensified in its early stages, and was upgraded to a tropical storm just two days after cyclogenesis. Strengthening slowed afterwards, though the storm attained typhoon intensity on April\u00a014. Intensification continued and late on April\u00a015, Kujira reached its peak intensity with winds of 165\u00a0km/h (103\u00a0mph)[nb 1] and a minimum barometric pressure of 930\u00a0mbar (hPa; 27.46\u00a0inHg). Following peak intensity, Kujira began to track northwest and oscillate in strength, cresting an additional two times in intensity. On April\u00a021, the typhoon was downgraded to tropical storm intensity and began to track erratically for several days east of Taiwan. However, on April\u00a024, Kujira resumed a northward track and begin to weaken, and on April\u00a024 was downgraded to tropical depression strength as it made landfall on Kyushu. Following landfall Kujira transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and continued to persist before these extratropical remnants crossed the International Dateline towards the end of April\u00a02003. Shortly after developing, Kujira caused two fatalities in Pohnpei in addition to minor agricultural and infrastructure damage; similar effects were felt in Guam. Several days later, the typhoon prompted cyclone warnings and other precautionary measures in the Philippines after forecasts indicated the potential for strong winds and rain. However, effects on the island chain associated with the storm remained minimal. The typhoon also prompted warning products in Taiwan, making it the first April typhoon since 1978 to cause such a feat. Unlike in the Philippines, however, Kujira would bring significant rainfall to Taiwan. Effects from the typhoon were most significant in Japan, particularly in the Ryukyu Islands. Strong winds, rain, and waves caused US$230,000 (\u00a527.8\u00a0million)[nb 2] in agricultural damage on Ishigaki Island. One person was killed due to injuries resulting from the waves. In Kyushu, heavy rainfall, peaking at 196\u00a0mm (7.7\u00a0in) in \u014cita Prefecture, was reported. Overall, despite its distance away from land and weak intensity at the time of its sole landfall, Kujira resulted in three fatalities."

        "header": "Meteorological history",
        "content": "The systems that would develop into Typhoon Kujira began as a broad area of convection on April\u00a06 centered south of Pohnpei and near the equator. At the time, the area of disturbed weather exhibited multiple circulation centers, and thus the system remained generally disorganized.[2] On April\u00a08, however, the convection began to consolidate towards a common center within an area of low wind shear.[1] As such, both the Japan Meteorological Agency\u00a0(JMA) and Joint Typhoon Warning Center\u00a0(JTWC) classified the storm system as a tropical depression at 0000\u00a0UTC on April\u00a09.[2][3] For much of the cyclone's early existence, the low-level circulation center remained east of the primary convection cell as it tracked northward. Nonetheless, the JTWC upgraded the depression to tropical storm intensity just six hours after cyclogenesis,[2] while the JMA continued to classify the system as a tropical depression.[3] Intensification was more gradual following April\u00a09. At 0000\u00a0UTC on April\u00a011, the JMA upgraded the system to tropical storm intensity, thus identifying it with the name Kujira.[1] At roughly the same time, Kujira began to curve towards a westward track due to a high pressure area to the north. Concurrently the ambient wind shear abated and the storm further consolidated, allowing for more quicker strengthening.[2] Throughout the following day, Kujira developed a banding eye feature that would later consolidate into a distinct circular eye; this was reflected with an upgrade to typhoon status by both the JTWC and JMA at 1800\u00a0UTC on April\u00a012 and 0000\u00a0UTC on April\u00a014, respectively.[2][3] On April\u00a014, a shortwave trough caused Kujira to track slightly more northwestward.[2] Marked intensification continued, and late on April\u00a015, the JTWC upgraded the typhoon to super typhoon intensity, the first of the year, while Kujira was located 400\u00a0km (250\u00a0mi) north-northwest of Yap State.[1] At roughly the same time Kujira reached its peak intensity with winds of 165\u00a0km/h (103\u00a0mph).[3] Estimated 1-minute sustained winds at that time were 250\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph), equivalent to that of a Category\u00a04 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson wind scale.[2] Following peak intensity, Kujira continued to track westward as it entered the area of responsibility of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration\u00a0(PAGASA) at 1200\u00a0UTC on April\u00a016, and as such the name Amang was assigned to the typhoon by the agency.[nb 3][1] On April\u00a017, the tropical cyclone began to track slightly southwestward and encountered an area of dry air and enhanced wind shear,[2] thus temporarily weakening Kujira.[1] Despite the prolonged effects from these inhibitors, the typhoon restrengthened to a secondary peak intensity the following day.[1] Though the JTWC indicated a significant increase in maximum sustained winds,[2] the intensification was only reflected by the JMA with a slight drop in barometric pressure.[3] Over the next two days Kujira would begin to track more northward due to a weakness in the nearby subtropical ridge and oscillate in strength due to an eyewall replacement cycle; a tertiary peak in strength occurred on April\u00a020 before subsequent weakening.[1] This trend continued, and at 1800\u00a0UTC on April\u00a021, both the JMA and JTWC downgraded Kujira to tropical storm status.[2][3] Following the system's downgrade, Kujira became quasi-stationary due to the presence of two nearby high pressure areas, and its motion became erratic.[1][2] Despite hostile atmospheric conditions, the tropical storm remained intact with persistent, deep convection and organized rainbands.[1] Late on April\u00a023, however, the cyclone began to drift towards the north as it made its closest approach to Taiwan. Throughout the following day, Kujira continued to accelerate towards the northeast and weaken at the same time. At 1200\u00a0UTC on April\u00a024, PAGASA ceased issuing advisories on the storm as it had exited the agency's area of responsibility.[1] At 0300\u00a0UTC the next day, the JMA downgraded the storm to tropical depression intensity while the JTWC ceased monitoring of the system three hours later.[2][3] At roughly the same time, Kujira made landfall near Ushibuka, Kumamoto at the same intensity.[1] Weakening continued, and the JMA continued to classify the system as a tropical depression until 1200\u00a0UTC on April\u00a025, when it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone.[3] The JMA continued to track the extratropical remnants of Kujira until they crossed the International Dateline on April\u00a030.[1]"

        "content": "Shortly after forming, Kujira tracked near Pohnpei, resulting in heavy rainfall across the island, peaking at 250\u00a0mm (9.8\u00a0in). Despite the typhoon's far distance from the island, two people were killed\u00a0\u2013 one died after being crushed by a prostrated tree, while the other was killed offshore for unknown reasons.[4] It also caused minor damage to buildings and crops on the island.[2] The outer rainbands of the typhoon later brought gale-force winds and heavy precipitation as it passed well south of Guam.[5] Afterwards, the storm remained well removed from landmasses for a period of time. On April\u00a018, however, PAGASA issued a public storm warning signal No.\u00a01 for Catanduanes in the Philippines due to the likelihood for gusty winds and rainfall.[6] As Kujira neared the archipelago, the No.\u00a01 warning was expanded to include the Babuyan Islands while a No.\u00a02 warning was introduced for the Batanes Islands in northern Philippines.[7] In preparation for the typhoon, the National Disaster Coordinating Council readied regional disaster coordinating councils and contingency plans while the Armed Forces of the Philippines prepared for any potential emergency situation.[8][9] The Philippine Coast Guard patrolled Filipino waters throughout Kujira's close passage in order to redirect ships away from the typhoon.[10] Though the typhoon had also threatened to cancel the biennial San Fernando Race, the concurrent SARS outbreak which had impacted the Philippines ultimately resulted in its cancelling.[11] Eventually any effects in the Philippines remained minimal.[12] As Kujira began to track towards Taiwan, the Taiwanese government issued land- and sea-based warnings in advance of the storm.[13] The local weather bureau specifically alerted vessels off the southern and southeastern coasts of the island.[14] Continued strengthening of Kujira prompted the Central Weather Bureau to issue medium typhoon warnings for several portions of Taiwan, though these warnings were downgraded to light typhoon status following the subsequent weakening of the typhoon on April\u00a022.[15] This made Kujira the first April typhoon to prompt the issuance of any cyclone-related warnings in Taiwan since 1978.[1] Impacts on the island were expected to be limited to rainfall,[16] though the forecasted precipitation was also expected to lessen ongoing drought conditions.[17] However, mudslides were also a potential impact from the typhoon. The National Fire Administration and Taiwan Power Company developed a contingency plan for the typhoon and had also undertaken other precautionary measures.[18] Airports on Orchid Island and Green Island were closed.[1] The resultant rainfall from Kujira's outer rainbands would be some of the most significant for the island in several months.[19] Effects from Kujira in Japan were of the greatest extent as opposed to other regions. Several flights were cancelled due to poor visibility in Ehime Prefecture as a result of cloudy conditions onset by the nearby typhoon, and roughly 1,800\u00a0passengers were affected by these cancellations.[20] Similar flight delays and cancellations also occurred in K\u014dchi Prefecture.[21] As Kujira approached Japan, the storm brought rough seas to the Ryukyu Islands, where wave heights of 2.5\u00a0m (8.2\u00a0ft) were recorded. In Okinawa, a woman was swept away by the wave action. Though she was later rescued and transported to a nearby hospital, she later died of resulting injuries.[22] Further south, on Ishigaki Island, intense rainfall and near-record high wind gusts were reported. These combined effects caused US$230,000 (\u00a527.8\u00a0million) in agricultural damage spread out over an area of 190 hectares (470 acres).[23] However, the heaviest rainfall associated with Kujira in Japan were on Kyushu. There, precipitation peaked at 196\u00a0mm (7.7\u00a0in) in Shakadake, \u014cita Prefecture. Five other locations, all of which were on Kyushu, reported rainfall totals in excess of 125\u00a0mm (4.9\u00a0in).[24] Upon its final landfall near Ushibuka, Kumamoto, Kujira became the earliest typhoon in any given calendar year to make landfall in Japan.[1]"

Etau formed an eye and became a large storm by the time it approached Okinawa on August\u00a07. The typhoon attained peak winds of 155\u00a0km/h (96\u00a0mph) before weakening slightly while turning to the northeast. Etau made landfall on the Japanese island of Shikoku on August\u00a08, and later moved across portions of Honshu and Hokkaido. After weakening to tropical storm status, the cyclone became extratropical on August\u00a09 and dissipated three days later. While passing northeast of the Philippines, the typhoon caused light damage in the archipelago. The eye crossed over Okinawa, where Etau left 166,800\u00a0people without power and caused 10\u00a0injuries. Near where Etau first struck Japan, Muroto reported a peak wind gust of 166\u00a0km/h (103\u00a0mph), at the time the third strongest on record there. The typhoon also dropped torrential rainfall peaking at 683\u00a0mm (26.9\u00a0in). The combination of winds and rainfall caused landslides, particularly on Hokkaido. Nationwide, Etau killed 20\u00a0people, destroyed 708\u00a0houses, and caused \u00a535.1\u00a0billion (JPY, $294.8\u00a0million USD) in damage.[nb 1]"

        "content": "The origins of Typhoon Etau were from an area of convection that persisted along the west side of a weak circulation near Chuuk State on July\u00a031. With initially moderate but steadily decreasing wind shear, the system was able to organize as it moved generally westward.[2] On August\u00a02, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)[nb 2] initiated advisories on Tropical Depression 11W.[4] That day, another circulation was developing on the western side of the system, briefly classified by the Taiwan Central Weather Bureau as a tropical depression. The eastern circulation became dominant with pronounced outflow to the south, although it was initially broad and elongated.[2] Later on August\u00a02, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA)[nb 3] classified the system as a tropical depression to the northeast of Yap.[5] With a subtropical ridge in the vicinity of the Marianas Islands, the nascent depression moved to the northwest.[2] On August\u00a03, the JMA upgraded the depression to tropical storm status, naming it Etau.[5] An upper-level low to the northeast improved northerly outflow, allowing the storm to strengthen quickly.[4] On August\u00a04 the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) began issuing advisories as the storm approached the region, naming it Kabayan.[1] Late on August\u00a04, the JMA upgraded Etau to typhoon status,[5] with the storm later developing an eye. An approaching shortwave trough weakened the ridge, causing Etau to turn more to the north.[2] At around 0030\u00a0UTC on August\u00a07, the typhoon made its closest approach to Okinawa,[5] passing within 120\u00a0km (75\u00a0mi), and close enough for the 100\u00a0km (62\u00a0mi) wide eye to cross over the island.[2][6] Later that day, the JMA estimated peak maximum sustained winds of 155\u00a0km/h (96\u00a0mph), sustained over a duration of 10\u00a0minutes;[5] the JTWC estimated 1\u00a0minute winds of 205\u00a0km/h (127\u00a0mph).[4] After reaching peak winds, Etau began turning to the north-northeast due to the approaching trough, passing near Amami \u014cshima. By that time, the typhoon had become large, with gale-force winds extending 870\u00a0km (540\u00a0mi) in diameter.[2] Increasing wind shear and cooler air caused Etau to weaken.[4] The typhoon still maintained 10\u00a0minute winds of 140\u00a0km/h (87\u00a0mph) when it made landfall near Muroto on the Japanese island of Shikoku, shortly before 1300\u00a0UTC on August\u00a08. Continuing northeastward, the typhoon weakened into a severe tropical storm as it passed near Awaji Island, before making landfall on Honshu near Nishinomiya at 2100\u00a0UTC on August\u00a08.[5] While accelerating to the northeast, Etau lost tropical characteristics over land. After briefly reaching open waters to the northeast of Honshu, the storm made its final landfall near Erimo, Hokkaido at 1630\u00a0UTC on August\u00a09, shortly before becoming extratropical. This was based on analysis from the JMA,[5] whereas the JTWC assessed the storm remaining offshore Hokkaido.[4] The remnants of Etau entered the Sea of Okhotsk and persisted for several more days, dissipating on August\u00a012 to the west of the Kamchatka Peninsula.[5]"

        "content": "Rough waves from Typhoon Etau produced rip currents on Saipan that swept up four swimmers, who were later rescued after holding onto a buoy.[7] The outer periphery of the storm caused P36.98\u00a0million (PHP, $673,000 USD) in damage,[nb 4] mostly to infrastructure with some minor crop damage.[9] Late in its duration, Etau caused damage in Russia's Kuril Islands.[10] While Etau was in the vicinity of Okinawa, wind gusts at Kadena Air Base reached 181\u00a0km/h (112\u00a0mph).[4] Rainfall on Okinawa peaked at 215\u00a0mm (8.5\u00a0in), while on nearby Yakushima to the north, rainfall reached 57\u00a0mm (2.2\u00a0in).[11] Throughout Okinawa prefecture, the typhoon left 166,800\u00a0buildings without power due to the strong winds. Etau damaged seven buildings, blocked one road, and caused moderate damage to crops and fisheries.[6] In the Amami Islands, about 45,000\u00a0houses, lost power due to high winds from the storm, affecting 53% of residents. Etau injured ten people in the island group, including one man who was blown off his roof.[12] Officials closed the Naha Airport due to the typhoon, causing 293\u00a0flights in the region to be canceled.[13] Ahead of the storm, ExxonMobil oil refineries in Okinawa were closed, but were reopened after sustaining minimal damage.[14] On Shikoku, Muroto reported typhoon-force winds for eight hours,[2] and wind gusts peaked at 166\u00a0km/h (103\u00a0mph).[15] At the time, this was the third strongest gust ever reported there, behind Typhoon Nancy in 1961 and Typhoon Shirley in 1965.[2] Sustained winds there reached 180\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph).[16] In Tokushima Prefecture, Etau dropped heavy rainfall peaking at 683\u00a0mm (26.9\u00a0in), although similarly heavy totals of 639 and 543\u00a0mm (25.2 and 21.4\u00a0in) were reported in K\u014dchi and Miyazaki prefectures, respectively. About 95% of the rainfall total in K\u014dchi fell in 24\u00a0hours. In Miyazaki, a station reported an hourly rainfall total of 79\u00a0mm (3.1\u00a0in).[15] Rainfall at Biratori, Hokkaido reached 306.2\u00a0mm (12.06\u00a0in) in a 48\u2011hour period, the highest at the station since records began in 1962. The heavy rainfall caused landslides across Hokkaido, particularly in areas where rainfall totaled over 330\u00a0mm (13\u00a0in). In the area around the Saru River, shallow landslides displaced about 13,000,000\u00a0m3 (460,000,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft) of soil, of which about 190,000\u00a0m3 (6,700,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft) entered the river.[17] This caused the highest sediment levels in the river since the 1960s,[18] washing about 50,000\u00a0m3 (1,800,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft) into the Nibutani Dam.[17] Landslides also swept about 65,000\u00a0m3 (2,300,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft) of soil and trees into the Appetsu River, which caused additional damage by washing away adjacent homes and bridges.[17] In addition the rainfall, Etau spawned a weak tornado near Kumagaya on the Honshu mainland, rated around an F1.[19] The typhoon brought a plume of warm air to the country that caused the warmest temperatures of the year at that point.[20] The heavy rainfall in Tokushima caused landslides and blocked roads, resulting in disruptions to bus and train service. Strong winds overturned a truck, injuring the two occupants.[21] In Muroto, several people were injured by flying glass. Rough waves killed two people in the same city,[16] one in Fukuoka,[22] damaged the seawall in Kyoto,[23] and damaged 25\u00a0ships.[15] In Takamatsu, Kagawa, Etau left about \u00a51.2\u00a0billion (JPY, $10\u00a0million USD) in crop damage, mainly due to damaged greenhouses.[24] Two workers were killed in Higashiuwa after being swept away by a river.[25] On Hokkaido, heavy rainfall caused landslides, damaging hundreds of roads and bridges and isolating several villages.[26] River flooding swept away a vehicle in Kamishihoro, killing the five occupants.[27] Along Mount Poroshiri, 29\u00a0people were rescued by helicopter from a mountain lodge after Etau blocked off their descending trail.[28] Throughout Japan, Etau caused over 1,000\u00a0flights to be canceled,[29] and for bullet trains to operate at a slower speed, causing delays.[30] About 62,000\u00a0people lost power during the storm, and across the country.[31] The typhoon destroyed 708\u00a0houses and flooded 2,253\u00a0others,[15] causing over 6,000\u00a0people to evacuate to storm shelters.[31] About 295\u00a0ha (730 acres) of fields were damaged. Throughout Japan, Etau killed 20\u00a0people and injured 93\u00a0others, 19 of them seriously. Overall damage totaled \u00a535.1\u00a0billion (JPY, US$294.8\u00a0million).[nb 5][15] Largely because Etau remained tropical and weakened over Japan, damage was much less than Typhoon Tokage a year later, which produced comparable rainfall totals at a similar intensity but struck the country while extratropical.[33]"

It formed on November\u00a018, 2003, from the monsoon trough to the west of the Marshall Islands. Early in its duration, it moved generally to the west or west-southwest. On November\u00a021, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Lupit, the 21st storm named by the Japan Meteorological Agency of the 2003 Pacific typhoon season. Two days later, it strengthened into a typhoon and developed an eye. Lupit later began a prolonged movement to the northwest, during which it passed near several islands in Yap State. The typhoon reached peak intensity on November\u00a026, with peak 10-minute sustained winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph).[nb 1]  It later weakened due to increasing wind shear and drier air, and after recurving to the northeast, Lupit became extratropical south of Japan on December\u00a02. Typhoon Lupit first affected Pohnpei with tropical storm-force winds, and later it damaged or destroyed about 200\u00a0homes in Chuuk State. There, high waves flooded roads and homes, while high winds damaged crops. Damage was heaviest in Yap State, mostly in the small Ulithi atoll and Fais Island. On both islands, the typhoon contaminated the water supply and wrecked crops. Rainfall reached 263\u00a0mm (10.4\u00a0in) on Ulithi, and gusts reached 158\u00a0km/h (98\u00a0mph). Throughout the FSM, damage totaled about $1.7\u00a0million,[nb 2] although there were no deaths. The damage prompted the FSM government to declare two states as disaster areas, as well as a disaster declaration from the United States federal government. While Lupit was becoming extratropical, it became the first typhoon in December to threaten Japan in 13\u00a0years. There, the storm dropped rainfall that resulted in mudslides and flight cancellations."

        "content": "The origins of Typhoon Lupit were from a tropical disturbance that persisted in the monsoon trough on November\u00a014 to the northeast of Kwajalein Atoll.[3] There was a weak circulation with pulsating convection (thunderstorms) and weak outflow. The system drifted to the southwest without much organization. On November\u00a017, the circulation intensified, although convection was initially unable to persist. The next day, outflow increased to the northeast, and the thunderstorms developed over the center.[1] At around 1200\u00a0UTC on November\u00a018, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA)[nb 3] classified the system as a tropical depression to the west of the Marshall Islands.[4] Due to low wind shear, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)[nb 4] issued a tropical cyclone formation alert, indicating that tropical cyclogenesis was likely.[1] Late on November\u00a019, the JTWC issued its first advisory on Tropical Depression 26W when the system was about 465\u00a0km (289\u00a0mi) east-northeast of Pohnpei.[1][3] With a ridge located to the north, the depression tracked to the west-southwest upon forming. Late on November\u00a020, the JTWC upgraded the depression to a tropical storm following an increase in deep convection, although the thunderstorms were located south of the center. After it turned more to the west,[1] the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Lupit to the northwest of Pohnpei on November\u00a021.[4] Outflow gradually increased, and an eye feature was evident by November\u00a022.[1] Around that time, Lupit passed about 165\u00a0km (103\u00a0mi) north of Chuuk.[3] Based on the development of a 30\u00a0km (19\u00a0mi) eye, the JTWC upgraded Lupit to a typhoon that day,[1] and the JMA followed suit on November\u00a023 when the storm was near the Caroline Islands.[4] While the typhoon was intensifying, it briefly turned to the west-southwest on November\u00a023, before a strengthening ridge to the southeast turned Lupit to the northwest.[1] The eye gradually became better-defined as the typhoon strengthened, and it passed well to the south of Guam. On November\u00a025, Lupit passed about 315\u00a0km (196\u00a0mi) north of Yap in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM). The next day, the JTWC upgraded the system to a super typhoon, or a storm with maximum 1-minute sustained winds of 240\u00a0km/h (150\u00a0mph).[1] On November\u00a026, the JMA estimated that Lupit attained peak 10\u2011minute winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph) in the Philippine Sea,[4] and the next day the JTWC estimated peak 1\u2011minute winds of 270\u00a0km/h (170\u00a0mph).[3] On November\u00a027, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration classified the system as Super Typhoon \"Yoyoy\" after the storm entered the agency's area of warning responsibility.[6] While around peak intensity, Typhoon Lupit had good outflow channels to the north and south. It had a 26\u00a0km (16\u00a0mi) eye, and gale-force winds reached a diameter of more than 740\u00a0km (460\u00a0mi). After peaking in intensity, Lupit underwent an eyewall replacement cycle, which caused the outflow to decrease and convection around the eye to diminish.[1] Steady weakening began on November\u00a028,[4] accelerated by increasing wind shear, and late that day it weakened below super typhoon status.[1] Lupit entered a weakness in the subtropical ridge, resulting in a turn to the north and later northeast into an area of cooler waters and drier air.[3] The typhoon accelerated into the westerlies, and dry air entered the circulation while the convection rapidly diminished.[1] While moving northeast off the southeast coast of Japan, Lupit weakened into a tropical storm on December\u00a01.[4] That day, the JTWC issued its last advisory on the storm,[3] and the JMA declared Lupit as an extratropical cyclone on December\u00a02. The next day, Lupit dissipated off the east coast of Japan.[4]"

        "content": "While it was first intensifying as a tropical storm, Lupit affected Pohnpei, passing about 120\u00a0km (75\u00a0mi) north of Oroluk. Wind gusts peaked at 69\u00a0km/h (43\u00a0mph), and the storm dropped 160\u00a0mm (6.3\u00a0in) of rainfall.[7] Later, the storm affected Chuuk Atoll in the FSM on November\u00a023. Tropical storm force winds were experienced through the state, and rainfall reached 162\u00a0mm (6.4\u00a0in) on Chuuk and 195\u00a0mm (7.7\u00a0in) on Ulul.[7] The Chuuk state government helped people in low-lying areas to evacuate. High waves flooded homes, and damaged roads and seawalls. About 200\u00a0houses were damaged or destroyed, and many homes affected by the typhoon had unsanitary conditions, a contaminated water supply, or lack of food.[8] High winds downed banana and palm trees, and salt water damaged or wrecked all of the food crops in Chuuk.[7] Most of Yap State was affected by the typhoon,[8] and the eye of Typhoon Lupit passed near the small atoll of Ulithi.[9] The typhoon also passed near Fais, producing estimated gusts of over 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph). On both islands, Lupit produced waves of 4.2 to 5.5\u00a0m (14 to 18\u00a0ft), causing severe beach erosion, and sea spray and flooding contaminated water supplies. In Fais, there was little flooding because it is an elevated island, although several buildings were damaged, mostly to roofs. On Ulithi, areas along the coast were flooded up to 1.5\u00a0m (4.9\u00a0ft) deep. Crops were wrecked on both islands, and on Ulithi, it was estimated that the soil would be unfit for growing for at least a year. Stations on Ulithi reported wind gusts of 158\u00a0km/h (98\u00a0mph), and 263\u00a0mm (10.4\u00a0in) of rainfall. Lupit affected other islands in Yap State with coastal flooding of around 1\u00a0m (3.3\u00a0ft), severe beach erosion, and wrecked crops. Several islands' water supply were contaminated. On Woleai, the storm downed trees and power lines, and the runway was closed for a week after being covered with water. Damage in Yap State was least on Yap, where winds gusted to 93\u00a0km/h (58\u00a0mph) and rainfall totaled 128\u00a0mm (5.0\u00a0in) in a 24\u2011hour period.[7] There, Lupit downed trees and damaged crops, while high seas flooded areas.[9] There was moderate beach erosion, and some seawalls and coastal roads were damaged.[7] Throughout the FSM, Typhoon Lupit caused about $1.7\u00a0million in damage, although there were no deaths or serious injuries.[7] After the storm, the governor of the FSM declared Chuuk and Yap states as disaster areas.[8] The government sent water to affected areas via a private airline, although damaged runways prevented 60% of flights from being delivered. A government boat was also used to deliver supplies, but its motor was damaged.[10] After it was repaired, the boat delivered 25,312\u00a0litres of water and 730\u00a0bags of rice.[11] On December\u00a019, United States President George W. Bush declared Yap State as a federal disaster area, which allocated funds for repairing damaged public buildings and debris removal. FEMA also provided emergency food assistance to nine islands in Yap, including Ulithi and Fais.[12] The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs provided $10,000 for purchasing supplies to the most affected areas.[11] As part of Operation Christmas Drop, Japanese and American Air Force units sent four planes to various islands with various supplies and gifts, including to areas affected by the typhoon.[13] While Lupit was becoming extratropical, it produced a gust of 133\u00a0km/h (83\u00a0mph) on the Japanese island of Chichi-jima, and 130\u00a0km/h (81\u00a0mph) on Hachij\u014d-jima.[1] The storm dropped heavy rainfall across Japan, peaking at 283\u00a0mm (11.1\u00a0in) in \u014cshima Subprefecture.[14] In the Izu Islands, the high rains caused mudslides and flooding that affected eight buildings.[15] Winds reached 83\u00a0km/h (52\u00a0mph) in Miyake-jima.[14] In Yakushima, five flights were canceled due to the typhoon.[16] Lupit was the first typhoon in 13\u00a0years to threaten Japan in the month of December.[17]"

Red soil, dust and sand from Central and Southeastern Australia was swept up in high winds and carried southeast through Victoria. The dust storm was one of the most dramatic consequences of the 1982/83 drought, at the time the worst in Australian history and is, in hindsight, viewed as a precursor to the Ash Wednesday bushfires which were to occur eight days later."

        "content": "In late 1982 and early 1983, the El Ni\u00f1o weather cycle had brought record drought to almost all of eastern Australia, with Victoria's Mallee and northern Wimmera severely affected. During the morning of Tuesday 8 February 1983, a strong but dry cold front began to cross Victoria, preceded by hot, gusty northerly winds. The loose topsoil in the Mallee and Wimmera was picked up by the wind and collected into a huge cloud of dust that heralded the cool change. At Horsham in western Victoria, raised dust was observed by 11:00am.  Within an hour, it had obscured the sky. Fed by the strong northerly, the temperature in Melbourne rose quickly and by 2:35pm it had reached 43.2\u00a0\u00b0C (109.8\u00a0\u00b0F), at that time a record February maximum. Around the same time, a dramatic red-brown cloud could be seen approaching the city. The dust storm hit Melbourne just before 3:00pm, accompanied by a rapid drop in temperature and a fierce wind change that uprooted trees and damaged houses. Within minutes, visibility in the capital had plunged to 100 metres (330\u00a0ft). City workers huddled in doorways, covering their mouths from the choking dust, and traffic came to a standstill. The worst of the storm was over by 4:00pm, when the wind speed dropped.  The dust cloud was approximately 320 metres (1,050\u00a0ft) high when it struck Melbourne, but in other areas of Victoria it extended thousands of metres into the atmosphere.[1] It was estimated that about 50,000 tonnes of topsoil were stripped from the Mallee (approximately 1,000 tonnes of it being dumped on the city). The combined effect of drought and dust storm inflicted damage on the land that, according to the then President of the Victorian Farmers and Graziers' Association, would take up to 10 years and tens of millions of dollars to repair.[2] The exact weather pattern that had caused the dust storm was repeated one week later, when the Ash Wednesday fires caused enormous destruction and loss of life."

It quickly organized until attaining the name Mindulle. Mindulle eventually became a Category 1 typhoon on September\u00a025 in 3:00 UTC.[1][2] Wind shear slowed its rapid intensification, but it still managed to intensify. Mindulle eventually reached Category 5 typhoon the next day, as the storm had a large eye in its center.[3] Wind shear weakened the storm, but reintensified. On October\u00a02, JMA issued its last advisory as it becomes extratropical as it continues moving northeast.[4]"

        "content": "On September\u00a021, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center spotted an area of convection formed approximately 703\u00a0nmi (1,302\u00a0km; 809\u00a0mi) southeast of Guam.[5] The system rapidly consolidated itself and formed a well-defined LLCC,[6] and thus, the system strengthened into a tropical depression on 00:00 UTC of September 22.[7] The JTWC did the same later that day, designating the system as 20W.[8] At 09:00 UTC of September 23, the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical storm, as its low-level circulation center became partially exposed.[9] The Japan Meteorological Agency did the same three hours later, and named it Mindulle.[10] At 12:00 UTC of September\u00a024, the JMA upgraded it to a severe tropical storm.[11] By 03:00 UTC the next day, the JTWC upgraded it to a Category 1-equivalent typhoon, as it developed a small eye. The presence of dry air had slowed its intensification, but it still managed to become a typhoon.[12][13] Mindulle started to rapidly intensify as it quickly intensified into a Category 2-equivalent typhoon. Its eye expanded but became ragged due to the presence of dry air.[14] Mindulle continued its rapid intensification, as it further intensified into a Category 4-equivalent typhoon at 15:00 UTC. Mindulle's eye became well-defined and at 03:00 UTC the next day, it became a Category 5-equivalent super typhoon, making it the third super typhoon of this season. Satellite imagery showed that the typhoon had developed a well defined 15\u00a0nmi (28\u00a0km; 17\u00a0mi) eye and deepening of the central core.[15] At 15:00 UTC, Mindulle weakened into a Category 4-equivalent super typhoon as the eye and the convective structure started to degrade. It also underwent an eyewall replacement cycle, as it developed another eyewall.[16] At 03:00 UTC of September 27, the JTWC further downgraded the system to a Category 3-equivalent typhoon,[17] and six hours later, the agency had further downgraded it to a Category 2-equivalent typhoon because of the effects of the eyewall replacement cycle and the increasing presence of dry air.[18] At 15:00 UTC of September\u00a028, Mindulle re-intensified into a Category 3-equivalent typhoon, as it moved over favorable conditions. Satellite imagery showed that the typhoon continued to struggle to intensify. Its 20\u00a0nmi (37\u00a0km; 23\u00a0mi) eye had steadily shrunk but it remained cloud covered and ragged.[19] By the next day at 03:00 UTC, the JTWC re-upgraded it to a Category 4-equivalent typhoon as the eye cleared out again.[20] At 21:00 UTC of September\u00a029, it rapidly weakened and by 15:00 UTC the next day, it weakened from a Category 3-equivalent typhoon to a Category 1-equivalent typhoon. Cool dry air and cool sea-surface temperatures were responsible for the weakening.[21][22][23] At 21:00 UTC of October 1, the JTWC issued its final warning as it downgraded to a tropical storm.[24] Three hours later, JMA also issued its final warning, as it became extratropical cyclone, off the coast of Hokkaido.[25] The storm continued northeast towards Alaska until losing its identity."

        "content": " Typhoon Bolaven, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Julian, was regarded as the most powerful storm to strike the Korean Peninsula in nearly a decade,[1] with wind gusts measured up to 186\u00a0km/h (116\u00a0mph). Forming as a tropical depression on August\u00a019, 2012, to the southwest of the Mariana Islands, Bolaven steadily intensified as it slowly moved west-northwestward in a region favoring tropical development. The system was soon upgraded to a tropical storm less than a day after formation and further to a typhoon by August\u00a021. Strengthening became more gradual thereafter as Bolaven grew in size. On August\u00a024, the system attained its peak intensity, with winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph)[nb 1] and a barometric pressure of 910\u00a0mbar (hPa; 26.87\u00a0inHg). Weakening only slightly, the storm passed directly over Okinawa on August\u00a026 as it began accelerating toward the north. Steady weakening continued as Bolaven approached the Korean Peninsula and it eventually made landfall in North Korea late on August\u00a028 before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone. The remnants rapidly tracked northeastward over the Russian Far East before turning eastward and were last noted on September\u00a01 crossing the International Dateline. Although Bolaven struck the Ryukyu Islands as a powerful typhoon, damage was less than expected. Relatively few buildings were damaged or destroyed across the region. The most significant effects stemmed from heavy rains, amounting to 551.5\u00a0mm (21.71\u00a0in), that caused flash flooding and landslides. One person drowned on Amami \u014cshima after being swept away by a swollen river. In mainland Japan, two people drowned after being swept away by rough seas. In South Korea, 19 people were killed by the storm. Many buildings were damaged and approximately 1.9\u00a0million homes were left without power. Losses in the country reached \u20a9420\u00a0billion (US$374.3\u00a0million), the majority of which was due to destroyed apple orchards. Significant damage also took place in North Korea, where at least 59 people were killed and 50 others were reported missing. Additionally, 6,700 homes were destroyed. Offshore, nine people drowned after two Chinese vessels sank."

        "content": "On August\u00a018, an area of showers and thunderstorms associated with a trough formed about 520\u00a0km (320\u00a0mi) west-southwest of Guam.[2] Over the following day, a low-level circulation developed within the trough. Tracking slowly northeastward into a region of warm sea surface temperatures, low wind shear, and favorable divergence, continued development was anticipated.[3][4] Later on August\u00a019, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)[nb 2] issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert as the system was anticipated to develop further.[6] Hours later, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA)[nb 3] classified the low as a tropical depression.[4] The JTWC followed suit early on August\u00a020, designating the system as Tropical Depression 16W.[8] Following the development of convective banding features along the southern side of the low, both the JMA and JTWC upgraded the depression to a tropical storm, with the former assigning it the name Bolaven. By this time, the storm began turning northwestward in response to a subtropical ridge south of Japan.[9][10] Later on August\u00a020, microwave imagery from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite depicted a weak eye-like feature.[11] Early on August 21, the JMA upgraded Bolaven to a severe tropical storm, with maximum estimated winds at 95\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph).[12] Throughout the day, a large central dense overcast developed around the low-level circulation and banding features became more prominent, especially over the southern half of the storm. However, the northwestern quadrant of Bolaven struggled to organize as quickly due to moderate wind shear produced by a nearby upper-level anticyclone. Due to the improved structure, both the JMA and JTWC upgraded Bolaven to a typhoon during the latter half of August\u00a021.[13][14] Gradual intensification ensued over the following days as the storm became increasingly organized.[15] A second anticyclone developed over the center of Bolaven later that day and enhanced the cyclone's poleward outflow.[16] Although subsidence and wind shear increased along the northern edge of the storm on August\u00a023, the system's outflow allowed it to mitigate the negative effects ahead of it.[17] Due to the storm's large size, it began turning towards the north-northwest along the subtropical ridge on August\u00a024, earlier than anticipated.[18] During this brief turn, the center of Bolaven crossed 135\u00b0E, entering the area of responsibility of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA). As such, the administration assigned the typhoon with the local name Julian.[19] Later that day, a well-defined, 18\u00a0km (11\u00a0mi) wide eye developed within the central dense overcast and several additional feeder bands formed along the south side of the circulation. Based on the improved structure, the JTWC estimated that the system attained one-minute sustained winds of 215\u00a0km/h (135\u00a0mph), equivalent to a Category\u00a04 on the Saffir\u2013Simpson Hurricane Scale.[20][21] By the morning of August\u00a025, Bolaven began to undergo an eyewall replacement cycle.[22] Despite the slightly degrading structure, the JTWC estimated the storm to have intensified slightly, attaining one-minute winds of 230\u00a0km/h (145\u00a0mph).[23] On August\u00a025, Bolaven began to interact with Typhoon Tembin, which was located over the South China Sea, causing Tembin to execute a slow counter-clockwise loop.[24] An outer eyewall became more apparent late on August\u00a025, with a clear second ring of deep convection surrounding the original eye.[25] Similar to the JTWC, the JMA continued to indicate that Bolaven was intensifying through early on August\u00a026. At that time, the JMA estimated the typhoon to have reached its peak intensity with winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph) and a barometric pressure of 910\u00a0mbar (hPa; 26.87\u00a0inHg).[26] As the system approached Okinawa, radar imagery showed a 55\u00a0km (34\u00a0mi) wide eyewall surrounding a small, but well-organized 11\u00a0km (6.8\u00a0mi) wide inner eyewall.[27] Shortly before 1500\u00a0UTC on August\u00a026, the center of Bolaven passed directly over Okinawa. At the time, the JTWC assessed the system to have had one-minute sustained winds of 195\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph) while the JMA estimated the winds to be 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph).[28][29] Early on August\u00a027, the storm's inner eyewall collapsed as the eyewall replacement cycle finished, with the new eye estimated to be about 220\u00a0km (140\u00a0mi) in diameter. In addition to its unusually large eye, the storm itself was large, spanning approximately 890 to 1,020\u00a0km (550 to 630\u00a0mi).[30] However, microwave satellite imagery indicated an overall weakening of the western side of the storm. Accelerating northward, Bolaven maintained a well-defined outflow due to a large tropical upper-tropospheric trough to its southeast and a mid-latitude trough to the northwest.[31] As the storm moved northward over the Yellow Sea, atmospheric conditions became increasingly hostile, with significantly lower sea surface temperatures and high wind shear.[30] During the overnight of August\u00a027\u201328, the typhoon brushed South Korea as a weakening cyclone. Convection on the west side of the storm diminished and its feeder bands began to collapse.[32] Increasing shear started taking its toll early on August\u00a028 as convection became displaced from the center of circulation, leaving part of the southwestern quadrant exposed. This also indicated that Bolaven had begun to undergo an extratropical transition as it approached the Korean Peninsula. Following structural weakening, the JMA and JTWC downgraded Bolaven to a severe tropical storm and tropical storm, respectively.[33][34] Hours before moving onshore in North Korea, the majority of the convection had moved over land while the circulation and the center itself had only stratocumulus clouds covering it.[35] Around 1500\u00a0UTC on August\u00a028, Bolaven made landfall in North Korea with winds of 100\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph).[36] Rapidly moving towards the northeast, the storm became fully embedded within a baroclinic zone near the China\u2013North Korea border later that day.[37] The JMA continued to monitor Bolaven as a tropical cyclone until early on August\u00a029, at which time the system was situated over the southern region of the Russian Far East.[38] The extratropical remnants later turned eastward and were last noted on September\u00a01 crossing the International Dateline.[39]"

Residents were urged to have all their preparations complete as soon as possible before the storm arrived.[44] This was further raised to TCCR 1-C (caution) as tropical storm force winds began impacting the island.[45] Across Ishigaki Island, all public activities were canceled by August\u00a024 and flights to mainland Japan were suspended. Ferry service to Kagoshima Prefecture was also canceled.[46] Throughout Okinawa, 850 people, including 300 in Naha, evacuated to public shelters due to the threat of flooding.[47] Transportation across the island was paralyzed due to the storm as ferry terminals, airports, and bus and rail services were shut down.[48] During the evening of August\u00a025, All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines canceled all flights to and from the Ryukyu Islands, south of Amami \u014cshima, for August\u00a026 and the morning of August\u00a027.[49] The slow motion of the storm led meteorologists at the JMA to warn residents of a potential record rainfall event, stating that localized areas could receive between 400 and 600\u00a0mm (16 and 24\u00a0in) of rain. Rainfall rates were expected to reach nearly 150\u00a0mm (5.9\u00a0in) per hour during the height of the storm.[50][51] Due to the significant threat of flash flooding and mudslides, residents living in flood-prone or mountainous areas were urged to evacuate.[52]"

More than 400 flights were canceled across the country, including 109 international flights from Incheon International Airport. The majority of cancelations were domestic flights, mainly from Ningbo to Jeju Island.[59][60] Local authorities conducted safety inspections of areas prone to landslides and closed off beaches and seawalls. Residents in flood-prone areas were encouraged to evacuate for their own safety, as well. Along the coast, hundreds of ships sought refuge from rough seas in various harbors and ports.[57] Numerous ports banned sea travel and shut down activities by August\u00a027, and 68 of the nation's 87 ferry routes were canceled. In Busan, all ships were not allowed access to the docks until the typhoon's passage.[59] Storm warnings were issued as far north as the Russian Far East as officials anticipated the remnants of the typhoon to cause significant disruption in the region. Residents were advised to avoid outdoor activities from August\u00a028 to 29 as the storm moved through.[61] In the Sea of Japan, more than 100 ships sought refuge in bays across the Primorsky Krai.[62] Ferry service to all islands in the region was also suspended.[63] All military personnel in the region were placed at an elevated state of readiness for the storm.[64] On August\u00a028, crisis centers were opened in 12 cities and 22 districts across Primorsky Krai.[65] Although the storm was expected to cause significant disruptions in the region, Russian Emergencies Minister Vladimir Puchkov stated that the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in Vladivostok would continue as planned.[66]"

On Amami \u014cshima, one person drowned after being swept away by a swollen river.[75] Numerous landslides took place across the islands, damaging roads and buildings.[76] During the height of the storm, the highest level of warning, TCCR 1-E (emergency), was issued for the island, indicating that all outdoor activities were banned.[70] Numerous roads and bridges were either shut down or blocked by debris across many of the islands, making travel difficult.[77] Damage to public facilities throughout Kagoshima reached JP\u00a56.3\u00a0billion (US$80.1\u00a0million).[78] Due to the threat of landslides, 5,500 households were evacuated across the Amami Islands on August\u00a027.[68] One home was destroyed and 1,065 residences were evacuated in Tokunoshima.[79] Eight people were injured across the island and 549 sought refuge in public shelters.[69][80] In Yonabaru, the typhoon's storm surge and large swells flooded coastal highways and inundated nearby buildings.[81] Large sections of roads were also washed away by the storm.[72] Cellphone service was lost late on August\u00a026 throughout much of Okinawa Prefecture.[82] Passing over Okinawa with a central pressure of 910 mbar (hPa; 26.87\u00a0inHg), Bolaven became one of the most intense typhoons to ever strike the region.[79] Off the coast of Wakayama Prefecture, swells from the typhoon battered fishing vessels and knocked the captain of one ship overboard. Although a rescue helicopter was quick to reach him, he was later pronounced dead at a local hospital.[83] Just off the coast of Jogashima Misaki-cho in Miura, Kanagawa, two boys were swept away by large swells. A mother attempted to swim after them to save them but later drowned. The two boys were later rescued with minor injuries by the Coast Guard.[84] Although the storm did not strike the Japanese mainland, its outer bands brought showers and thunderstorms to parts of Kyushu.[85] Due to the rains, rail service in Saga Prefecture was temporarily suspended, affecting 4,200 passengers. In Isahaya, one person was injured after being struck by a billboard downed by high winds.[86] Throughout Japan, losses to agriculture and fisheries amounted to JP\u00a5423\u00a0million (US$5.38\u00a0million).[87]"

There, high winds from the storm downed power poles, broke street lamps, and damaged buildings. More than 70,000 households on the island lost power.[88] On Jeollanam-do Wando, a wind gust of 186\u00a0km/h (116\u00a0mph) was recorded during the storm's passage.[89] Across the country, approximately 1.9\u00a0million people lost power, though it was quickly restored to all but 34,000 within a day.[90] In Seoul, strong winds damaged street lamps, church spires, and downed signs.[91] Due to various storm-related incidents, hundreds of people had to be evacuated. Throughout the country, at least 19 people were killed by Typhoon Bolaven.[1][92] Reports indicated that there was extensive property damage from the storm. Many buildings lost their roofs, several collapsed, and smaller structures were blown over.[89] In Gwangju, a record 10,004 emergency calls were made in one day in relation to the storm, the majority of which were about fallen billboards.[93] In Naju, the country's largest producer of pears, approximately 1,400\u00a0hectares (3,460\u00a0acres) of pear trees, or 60% of the total crop, was destroyed. Agriculture as a whole suffered significantly from the storm, with a total of 9,000\u00a0hectares (22,000\u00a0acres) of apple and pear plantations being destroyed. As a result, the price of produce across the nation jumped substantially.[94] In Yesan alone, a town where more than 1,500 families rely on their apple orchards for a living, losses to the orchards reached \u20a9300\u00a0billion (US$264\u00a0million).[95] The prices of spinach, cabbage, and lettuce rose by 124%, 72%, and 26%, respectively, in just one day.[94] Total damage throughout the country, along with Typhoon Tembin, were calculated at \u20a9636.5\u00a0billion (US$567.2\u00a0million).[96] More than 500 people were left homeless as a result of Bolaven, mostly in South Jeolla Province.[90][97] Additionally, economic losses to airlines related to the typhoon reached \u20a917\u00a0billion (US$15\u00a0million). Korean Air and Asiana Airlines suffered the greatest losses of the affected companies.[98] About 2\u00a0km (1.2\u00a0mi) off the coast of Jeju Island, two Chinese vessels with a total of 33 people aboard, sank during the storm on August\u00a028. According to local media, 18 of the crewmen were rescued or swam back to shore while 9 drowned and 6 others remained missing.[1][99] Off the coast of South Gyeongsang Province, a 77,458\u00a0ton cargo ship ran aground during the storm and broke in half.

In the city alone, 25 roads were flooded and 20 power poles were downed.[105] Thousands of people were evacuated due to flooding triggered by the storm.[103] Gale-force winds in Jilin Province damaged approximately 690,000\u00a0hectares (1.7\u00a0million acres) of crops.[106] Rainfall amounting to 139\u00a0mm (5.5\u00a0in) caused localized flooding, disrupting transportation in Heilongjiang Province. Throughout Northeastern China, an estimated 40\u00a0million people were affected by the typhoon.[107] Total economic losses in China were counted to be CN\u00a519.82 billion (US$3.12 billion).[108] On August\u00a029, the remnants of Bolaven brought winds up to 90\u00a0km/h (56\u00a0mph) in the Primorsky Krai, leaving 9,800 people without power. Power was soon restored to all, except for 195 residents in the town of Vityaz.[109] In Vladivostok, wind gusts reached 118\u00a0km/h (73\u00a0mph), downing numerous trees.[citation needed] Rains associated with the storm were light, with only 5\u00a0mm (0.20\u00a0in) recorded in Vladivostok.[110] Gale-force winds prompted the temporary closure of the Bridge to Russky Island, which was built specifically for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit. With ferries already canceled, residents were unable to leave the island until the storm passed.[63] In the Khabarovsk Krai, heavy rains from the storm proved beneficial as they allowed firefighters to extinguish six wildfires and contain five others within a 24\u2011hour span.[111] Along the coast, large waves caused some beach erosion and prompted evacuations in Manchzhurka. Additionally, five people had to be rescued after ignoring warnings and wading into the sea.[112] In some areas, large numbers of crabs, fish, and oysters washed ashore during the storm.[113]"

        "content": "Typhoon Sanba, known in the Philippines as Super Typhoon Karen, was the strongest tropical cyclone worldwide in 2012. The sixteenth named storm and tenth typhoon of the annual typhoon season, Sanba formed as a tropical depression east of the Philippines on September\u00a010. The storm gradually intensified as it moved generally northward in an area favorable for tropical development. The system was soon upgraded to a tropical storm less than a day after formation and subsequently further to a typhoon on September\u00a012. Later that day, Sanba entered a phase of rapid intensification, and quickly strengthened. On September\u00a013, the system attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 125\u00a0mph (205\u00a0km/h),[nb 1] and a barometric pressure of 900\u00a0mbar (hPa; 26.58\u00a0inHg), becoming the strongest typhoon in the Western Pacific Ocean since Megi in 2010. Accelerating towards more northerly latitudes, a period of gradual weakening ensued afterwards as its eye expanded. It made landfall on South Korea late on September\u00a017 as a typhoon before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone the following day. Sanba's remnants tracked into the Primorsky Krai region of eastern Russia before they were last noted on September\u00a019. Passing just to the west of Japan, Sanba caused extensive losses to agriculture, forestry, and fishing industries on the islands of Okinawa Prefecture. Further inland on K\u014dchi and Gifu Prefectures, heavy rains damaged agricultural regions and washed out numerous roads. Losses on both prefectures totalled to \u00a52.5\u00a0billion (US$31.8\u00a0million).[nb 2] Upon its landfall on the Korean Peninsula on September\u00a017, it became the first time in 50\u00a0years that the peninsula had been struck by at least four typhoons in a single year.[1] In South Korea, torrential rainfall also washed out road systems and inundated crop land, as well as damaged infrastructure. Losses there associated with Sanba totaled to \u20a9365.7\u00a0billion (US$328\u00a0million). In North Korea, the heavy precipitation worsened preexisting flood conditions initially started by Tropical Storm Khanun two months prior. In all, the typhoon killed six people and caused US$361\u00a0million in losses."

        "content": "On September 9, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started to monitor an area of convection approximately 150 nautical miles (280\u00a0km) to the east of Palau. At the time, its low-level circulation center had been developing under persisting deep convection, and was under an environment of moderate to strong vertical wind shear offset by strong, diffluent easterly flow.[2] By the next day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) had upgraded the system into a tropical depression.[3] As it continued to organize, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on the system at 14:00 UTC on the same day.[4] 7 hours later, the agency started issuing advisories on the depression, designating it as 17W.[5] By September 11, the depression intensified into a tropical storm, with the JMA naming the system as Sanba.[6] The PAGASA had also started issuing advisories on the storm, handing its Philippine name Karen.[7] Nine hours later, the JTWC also upgraded Sanba to a tropical storm, as its convective banding deepened and wrapped tighter to its low-level circulation center.[8] As wind shear decreased, Sanba continued to strengthen as it moved northwestward.[9] At 06:00 UTC on September 12, the JMA upgraded Sanba to a severe tropical storm.[10] Six hours later, Sanba intensified into a typhoon, as it formed a pinhole eye.[10][11] The system then started its rapid intensification, becoming a Category 2-equivalent typhoon on the Saffir-Simpson scale at 03:00 UTC on the next day,[12] before becoming a Category 4-equivalent typhoon six hours later, with a 18\u00a0nmi (33\u00a0km) eye present on satellite imagery. This was owed to the favorable environment the storm was in, with 29\u201330\u00a0\u00b0C (84\u201386\u00a0\u00b0F) sea surface temperatures, low wind shear, radial outflow, an excellent poleward outflow being enhanced by a tropical upper tropospheric trough (TUTT) to the northwest, as well as a subtropical low southeast of Honshu, and an equatorial channel.[13] Sanba ultimately reached its peak intensity at 18:00 UTC that same day, with 10-minute sustained winds of 110 knots (205\u00a0km/h; 125\u00a0mph) and a central pressure of 900 hectopascals (27\u00a0inHg), according to the JMA.[14] The JTWC estimated Sanba to have 1-minute sustained winds of 155 knots (285\u00a0km/h; 180\u00a0mph), making the storm a Category 5-equivalent super typhoon.[10] On September 14, Sanba showed signs of undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle, as concentric rings were seen in microwave imagery.[15] It later weakened into a Category 4-equivalent typhoon at 15:00 UTC that same day, due to wind shear increasing once again as it continued northward.[16] By the next day, it further weakened into a Category 3-equivalent typhoon, as dry air had started to encircle the system while it redeveloped its eye.[17] A 25\u00a0nmi (46\u00a0km) eye soon reappeared on satellite imagery, with the subtropical jet stream enhancing its poleward outflow as it turned to the north-northwest under the influence of a deep-layered subtropical ridge positioned to the east of Japan.[18] Sanba later exited the Philippine Area of Responsibility, with the PAGASA issuing its last advisory on the storm.[19] At 6:30 am JST on September 16 (21:30 UTC September 15), Sanba made landfall over Okinawa.[20] Sanba then further weakened to a Category 2-equivalent typhoon, as higher amounts of wind shear began affecting its northwestern quadrant, along with decreasing sea surface temperatures.[21] As it continued weakening, the tight banding into its ragged eye began to unravel, with strong poleward outflow continuing to sustain the system as wind shear became even stronger as it got embedded into the subtropical jet stream.[22] By the next day, it weakened into a Category 1-equivalent typhoon, as it commenced its extratropical transition.[23] Around 11:30 am KST (02:30 UTC), Sanba made landfall over Namhae County, South Gyeongsang Province, South Korea.[24] The JMA downgraded Sanba to a severe tropical storm 3 hours later, before the JTWC subsequently issued their final advisory on the system.[25][26] Turning to the north-northeast and emerging into the Sea of Japan, Sanba further weakened into a tropical storm.[27] By September 18, Sanba transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, as it moved over Russia.[28]"

        "content": "At 06:00 UTC on August 1, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began to monitor an area of convection, associated with a gale-force non-tropical low embedded within the eastern end of a monsoon trough, located approximately 550\u00a0nmi (1,020\u00a0km; 630\u00a0mi) to the north of Guam. At the time, the low had a poorly-defined low-level circulation center, with a large area of deep convection surrounding it, and was under an environment of good equatorial outflow and moderate wind shear.[2][3] Six hours later, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the low to a tropical depression.[4] As the system was developing its center rapidly under increased wind shear, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) late on the same day.[5] Although it lacked deep convection near its center, the JTWC started issuing advisories on the depression at 21:00 UTC the next day, designating it as 12W.[6] The JMA subsequently upgraded it to a tropical storm three hours later, naming it as Haikui.[7] Moving westward under the southern periphery of a deep subtropical ridge to its north, Haikui continued organizing, with formative banding feeding to the northern side of its ragged center.[8] By August 4, the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical storm, as persistent deep convection built over its center; however, the system had a dry air intrusion in the upper levels, which wrapped into its west and southern quadrants.[9] It later resumed its strengthening, as the dry air began to thin and its convection rebuilding over the system.[10] As it passed near Okinawa by the next day,[11] the JMA reported that Haikui had intensified to a severe tropical storm.[12] By August 6, the system became partially exposed at its northern side, and had slowed its movement down due to the steering subtropical ridge weakening because of a mid-latitude trough developing over the Sea of Japan.[13] However, the trough passed to the northeast, allowing for the ridge to build back on the system.[14] Under an environment of 27\u201329\u00a0\u00b0C (81\u201384\u00a0\u00b0F) sea surface temperatures and weak wind shear, Haikui intensified to a Category 1-equivalent typhoon on the Saffir-Simpson scale at 15:00 UTC that same day.[15] By the next day, Haikui developed a large, 50\u00a0nmi (93\u00a0km; 58\u00a0mi) ragged eye as it continued west-northwest, nearing China.[16] At 12:00 UTC that same day, the JMA upgraded the system to a typhoon;[17] however, the storm began to deteriorate, as its eye became elongated, with the convection being more shallow and loose.[18] At 19:20 UTC, Haikui made landfall on Xiangshan County, Zhejiang, China, at typhoon strength.[19][20] Both the JMA and JTWC downgraded the system by the next day, to a severe tropical storm and a tropical storm respectively, with the latter issuing its final advisory as it tracked slowly inland.[21][22] The JMA later downgraded the system to a tropical storm.[23] Continuing west-northwest, it reached Anhui Province by 15:00 UTC that same day.[24] Haikui then further weakened to a tropical depression on August 9, before the JMA ceased issuing advisories on the system late on the same day.[25][26] The remnants of Haikui remained stationary inland, before dissipating two days later.[25]"

During the afternoon of 7 August, the river reached a height of 20.6\u00a0m (68\u00a0ft), well beyond the flood level of 16\u00a0m (52\u00a0ft) and about 3\u00a0m (9.8\u00a0ft) below the record level set during Typhoon Ketsana. About 70\u00a0percent of Metro Manila  were affected by flooding.[30] Some areas were submerged in up to 3\u00a0m (9.8\u00a0ft).[31] Due to the expanding floods, officials in the city evacuated more than 23,000 residents from flood-prone areas and relocated them to shelters set up across the area.[30] According to a reporter from the British Broadcasting Corporation, many residents were reluctant to leave their belongings behind, and some traveled back through flood waters to retrieve their belongings. Officials feared the flooding could worsen as the La Mesa Dam continued to overflow by then.[32] At least nine people were killed and four others were injured in a landslide in Quezon City.[33] Numerous schools in Metro Manila, Central Luzon, and Calabarzon had suspended classes.[33] As a precautionary measure, officials cut power to some areas of National Capital Region (NCR).[32] At least 250,000 people left their homes as flooding covered more than a third of the city. The head of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) compared the deluge to the Kevin Costner film Waterworld.[34] In response to the flooding, the NDRRMC allocated approximately \u20b113,000,000 worth of relief funds and deployed 202 personnel to assist in search and rescue missions.[27] The search and rescue missions were hampered by strong currents in flooded streets.[32] Philippine President Benigno Aquino ordered officials to maximize the effort on rescuing and aiding affected residents.[31] On 8 August, more than 1 million families were already affected. The NCR and nine nearby provinces were already placed under a state of calamity, with some areas were flooded up to 2 storeys. 90 percent of Metro Manila were already submerged in flooding. Communications were affected badly, though distress calls and SMS from thousands of Metro Manila residents and their worried relatives flooded television and radio stations as most power and water connections were lost. Red warning was already downed to yellow during morning but turned back into red warning during afternoon after another set of continuous heavy rain falls again in Metro Manila until midnight of August 9, 2012. Some schools extended their suspension of classes until Saturday. Airports also had severe flooding, forcing some flights to land at Clark International Airport in Pampanga and other airports nationwide or altogether rebooking.[35][36][37][38] Throughout the Philippines, a total of 112 people have been confirmed dead and 14 people were injured. In terms of damage, a total of 14,280 homes were damaged, of which 3,871 were totally destroyed. Economic losses were totalled at \u20b13.18\u00a0billion (US$76.3\u00a0million), in which most of them were agricultural loss.[39]"

Port officials also called 30,000 ships back to shore to ride out the storm.[28][41] Throughout the country, an estimated one million people were evacuated ahead of the storm's arrival.[1] In Anhui Province, officials temporarily closed access to the Huangshan mountain range, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Approximately 19,000 people in the area were also evacuated due to the threat of high winds and heavy rain.[42] Across Zhejiang Province, Haikui caused widespread and severe damage. According to the local flood and drought relief headquarters, 4,452 homes were destroyed and 184,800 hectares were submerged in flood waters.[43] In Sanmen County, where the storm made landfall, nearly 100 villages lost power.[1] In the province alone, economic losses were estimated in excess of \u00a510\u00a0billion (US$1.57\u00a0billion). Additionally, an estimated 4.03\u00a0million people were affected by the storm.[44] In Shanghai, two people were killed and seven others were injured in storm-related accidents.[44] On the morning of August\u00a010, the Shenjiakeng Reservoir in Zhoushan collapsed, flooding the surrounding area and killing at least ten people. Local officials \"vowed to make all-out efforts to locate the missing\" according to the Xinhua News Agency.[45] Local residents feared the death toll could rise significantly as many people living in the area were undocumented migrant workers from other provinces. There has also been criticism over the effectiveness of the rescue effort, with one resident stating that it took an hour for rescue personnel to arrive in the area after the dam collapsed. Hospitals around the disaster area were reportedly overwhelmed with an influx of casualties stemming from the collapse, though no number was stated.[46] Heavy rains, in excess of 600\u00a0mm (24\u00a0in) in Anhui Province triggered severe flooding that destroyed 4,473 homes and affected 3\u00a0million people.[47][48] Authorities evacuated approximately 156,000 people in the province.[49] High winds, measured up to 117\u00a0km/h (73\u00a0mph) on Mount Guangming in the Huangshan mountain range,[49] left 962,000 households without power.[50] At least three people were killed in the province and economic losses amounted to \u00a53.28\u00a0billion (US$515\u00a0million).[48] One person was also killed in Jiangsu Province.[43] In Jiangxi Province, heavy rains, measured up to 328\u00a0mm (12.9\u00a0in) in Jingdezhen, triggered significant floods that affected more than one million people. More than 145,000 people were relocated as homes became submerged in water.[51][52] Flooding along the Wuhu-Guixi Railway line stranded 12 trains and trapped thousands of people. In one train, more than 1,000 people were trapped for 10 hours as repairs were conducted.[53] In the wake of widespread flooding brought about by the typhoon, the National Commission for Disaster Reduction and the Ministry of Civil Affairs activated level four emergency plans in Anhui, Jiangxi, Shanghai, and Zhejiang Provinces. Relief teams were dispatched to the four provinces to assist in relief efforts.[52] In all, 6 people were killed, and total economic losses amounted to be CNY 37.09\u00a0billion (US$5.83\u00a0billion).[19]"

The system later intensified in favorable conditions, and reached typhoon intensity on June 15. It reached peak intensity late on June 17, before making landfall over Japan as a typhoon on June 19. The system became extratropical shortly after traversing Japan and was last noted by the Japan Meteorological Agency on June 22. Authorities issued evacuation orders for more than 150,000 people in central, eastern and northeastern Japan, Kyodo News said, with warnings of dangerous landslides from the heavy rain. Heavy rains and strong winds affected much of Honshu as the storm moved across the region. One person was killed and fifty-two others were injured across the country. The name \"Guchol\"  means \"turmeric\" in a Micronesian language."

        "content": "In early June, a tropical disturbance, embedded within the end of a monsoon trough, formed to the southeast of Guam.[2] The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) then started to monitor the system late on June 7, as it had scattered deep convection over its poorly-defined low-level circulation center (LLCC), but was under an environment of 28\u201330\u00a0\u00b0C (82\u201386\u00a0\u00b0F) sea surface temperatures, low vertical wind shear, good divergence and enhanced poleward outflow.[3] As the system moved westward, it significantly organized, prompting the JTWC to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) by the next day.[4] However, the JTWC canceled the TCFA late on June 9, as its center became elongated.[5] The system then started to reorganize by the next day,[6] and by June 11, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the system into a tropical depression.[7] The JTWC later followed suit, as formative bands wrapped around its center.[8] As it continued westward, the system struggled to organize, with its center becoming ill-defined.[9] By 03:00 UTC the next day, the JTWC reported that the tropical depression had intensified into a tropical storm, as improved convective banding began wrapping into its center.[10] The JMA upgraded the storm three hours later, naming it as Guchol.[11] Over the next few days, Guchol slowly intensified, as convection continued to wrap into the system.[12] By 00:00 UTC on June 14, the JMA upgraded Guchol to a severe tropical storm.[13] It subsequently entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility, with the PAGASA naming it locally as Butchoy.[14] At 15:00 UTC, the JTWC upgraded the system to a Category 1-equivalent typhoon on the Saffir-Simpson scale, as it built a central dense overcast.[15] By the next day, it further strengthened to a Category 2-equivalent typhoon, as an outflow channel became apparent while it took a north-northwestward turn around the western periphery of the subtropical ridge.[16][2] At 21:00 UTC that same day, the JTWC upgraded Guchol to a Category 3-equivalent typhoon.[17] The JMA upgraded Guchol to a typhoon three hours later, on June 16.[18] Nine hours later, Guchol strengthened into a Category 4-equivalent typhoon, as a 18\u00a0nmi (33\u00a0km) symmetric eye formed.[19] Guchol ultimately reached its peak intensity at 18:00 UTC that same day, with 10-minute sustained winds of 100 knots (185\u00a0km/h; 115\u00a0mph) and a central pressure of 930 hectopascals (27\u00a0inHg), according to the JMA.[20] The JTWC estimated Guchol to have 1-minute sustained winds of 130 knots (240\u00a0km/h; 150\u00a0mph), although it noted that the system's eye had become less symmetric.[21] By the next day, Guchol started its eyewall replacement cycle, as double eyewalls were seen in microwave imageries.[22] The system then started to weaken from its peak intensity at 12:00 UTC that day,[20] as it was completing the replacement cycle while moving into slightly cooler sea surface temperatures.[23][2] At 09:00 UTC on June 18, Guchol weakened into a category 3-equivalent typhoon, as its eyewall deteriorated while turning to the north-northeast, along with increasing wind shear.[24] It then exited the Philippine Area of Responsibility three hours later, with the PAGASA issuing its final advisory on the system.[25] The JTWC further downgraded Guchol to a category 2-equivalent typhoon as its eye became cloud-filled.[26] On June 19, Guchol weakened to a category 1-equivalent typhoon, as its convection began to elongate while interacting with the mid-latitude westerlies,[27] before further weakening to a tropical storm as it rapidly approached the Kii Peninsula.[28] At 08:00 UTC, Guchol made its first landfall over southern Wakayama Prefecture, as it began its extratropical transition.[1][2] Three hours later, it made its second landfall in eastern Aichi Prefecture.[1] Subsequently, the JMA downgraded Guchol to a severe tropical storm,[29] and the JTWC issued their final advisory on Guchol.[30] Traversing the Kanto-Koshin region, the system emerged to the coast of Fukushima Prefecture, with the JMA issuing their final advisory by the next day, as it fully became an extratropical cyclone.[1][31] The remnants of the system was last noted near Hokkaido two days later.[20]"

Later that day, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the system;[5] soon, PAGASA upgraded it to a tropical depression and named it Ferdie.[6] The JTWC also upgraded the system to a tropical depression late on the same day.[7] After the system moved into the South China Sea on July 21, the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm and named it Vicente,[8] while the storm moved out of the Philippine Area of Responsibility.[9] As the system's convection began wrapping around the circulation center, the JTWC upgraded Vicente to a tropical storm late on July 21.[10] On July 22, Vicente slowed down and looped, for the subtropical ridge northeast to the storm suddenly weakened. Late on the same day, the JMA upgraded Vicente to a severe tropical storm.[11] On July 23, because of weak vertical wind shear and high sea surface temperature, Vicente's structure became better organized, and it started to form an eye when it moved towards Guangdong, China, prompting the JTWC upgrading Vicente to a Category 1 typhoon.[12] As system continued to strengthen, it developed a few hot towers, reaching 9.3\u00a0mi (15.0\u00a0km) high. Soon after, Vicente began a phase of rapid intensification near the Pearl River Delta, leading the JTWC to amend their advisory at 12Z from a Category 1 typhoon to a Category 4 typhoon in six hours, and the JMA upgraded Vicente to a typhoon around the same time.[13] When Vicente was located about 110 kilometres south-southwest of Hong Kong at 16:45 UTC on July 23, the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) issued the Hurricane Signal, No. 10, the first since York in 1999 and the farthest from Hong Kong on record.[1][14] Then, Typhoon Vicente made landfall over Taishan, Guangdong, China at 20:15 UTC, 111 kilometers west of Hong Kong, as a Category 4 typhoon with winds of 213\u00a0km/h (132\u00a0mph).[2] On July 24, Vicente was still holding typhoon strength over land, as a Category 3 typhoon, with winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph), as the JMA downgraded Vicente to a severe tropical storm.[15][16] Later, the JMA downgraded Vicente to a tropical storm, then downgraded it to a tropical depression later that day.[17][18]"

As Vicente moved away and local winds gradually subsided, the Southeast Gale or Storm Signal Number 8 was issued at 03:35\u00a0HKT (19:35\u00a0UTC) to replace Signal No. 10.[24][25] The Southeast Gale or Storm Signal Number 8 was then replaced by the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 at 10:10\u00a0HKT (02:10\u00a0UTC), which allowed business and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange to reopen and trade again.[24][27] The Signal No. 3 was replaced by Standby Signal No. 1 subsequently at 14:40\u00a0HKT (06:40\u00a0UTC). Vicente moved further away during the rest of the day and after its circulation was no longer affecting Hong Kong, all tropical cyclone warning signals were cancelled at 23:15\u00a0HKT (15:15\u00a0UTC).[24][25] However, a monsoon trough continued to bring strong winds to Hong Kong, thus requiring the issuance of Strong Monsoon Signal immediately afterwards, until 5:20\u00a0am on the next day. The weather in Hong Kong remained poor for 3 more days because of Vicente's outer rain bands and the monsoon trough. The Observatory had to issue the Amber Rainstorm Warning Signal several times, until the weather became fine on 28 July. During July 23 and 24, Typhoon Vicente's rainbands brought heavy squally showers to Hong Kong, during which over 200\u00a0mm (7.9\u00a0in) of rainfall was recorded over many parts of the territory, while a maximum storm surge of about 1.51 metres (5.0\u00a0ft) was recorded at Tsim Bei Tsui.[25] In Hong Kong, at least 138 people were injured during the passage of Vicente.[25]  The number of fallen trees amounted to about 8,800.[25]  There were two reports of landslip and 7 reports of flooding.[25] Dangerous signboards or fallen scaffoldings were reported in many parts of the territory, resulting in closure of some roads and damage to many vehicles.[25] A wooden board was blown up by strong winds in Connaught Road Central, hitting a number of passers-by and knocking one of them unconscious.[25] During the storm, the East Rail line of the Mass Transit Railway had to halt service because of damage of overhead cables by toppling trees.[25]  As a result, hundreds of commuters were forced to spend the night in trains or at the MTR stations. Crops were damaged by flood waters in some farmlands in Sheung Shui.[25]  A small craft ran aground in Deep Water Bay and was damaged.[25] At Hong Kong International Airport, at least 90 flights were cancelled, over 446 flights delayed and 50 flights were diverted on July 23\u201324.[25] 8,800 trees were destroyed and much debris crashed into downtown streets as people made their way home from work, being told to take shelter. Ferry, bus and train services were suspended or ran at reduced capacity. The ports and schools were closed, and at least 60 passenger flights were cancelled, while more than 270 flights were delayed. The stock exchange was also closed in the morning. Almost 140 injured people sought medical treatment and 268 people took refuge in storm shelters in Hong Kong. Hong Kong local media also reported that more than 100 people stayed in the Tai Wai train station overnight, unable to get home after services were suspended. There were no deaths.[1][28][29][30]"

After Vicente intensified into a typhoon and moved further to the north, the Bureau hoisted Signal No. 8 NE at 7:00\u00a0pm on the same day. Vicente posed a threat of direct hit with its northwest track, but the Bureau did not consider issuing higher signals until the next day. By then, storm-force winds were all over the region, with 10-minute sustained winds reaching hurricane level on the 3 bridges. As Vicente started its direct hit on Macau, the Bureau finally announced at 1:12\u00a0am on 24 July, that it would switch for a higher signal in 2 to 3 hours. The Bureau hoisted the Signal No. 9 at 2:15\u00a0am, which was the first one since Typhoon York in 1999, as well as the first issuance after the transfer of sovereignty over Macau. Vicente skirted at 40\u00a0km south-southwest of Macau at 3:00\u00a0am, which marked the closest point of approach to the region, and proved that Vicente was closer to Macau than Hong Kong. Despite recording hurricane in the region, as well as Vicente being closer to Macau, Signal No. 10 was not hoisted, which led to controversy along with the late issuance of Signal No. 9. As Vicente made landfall at Taishan, Guangdong, Signal No. 9 lasted for less than 3 hours, and was changed to Signal No. 8 SE at 5:00\u00a0am, which was subsequently switched to Signal No. 3 at 9:30\u00a0am.

        "content": "On August 16, a tropical disturbance formed southeast of Taiwan.[1] On August 17, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) mentioned it as a tropical depression, as a subtropical ridge pushed the system southwards.[2] The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the system late on August 18;[3] early the next day, the JMA upgraded it to a tropical storm and named it Tembin, and the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical depression.[4][5] Soon, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also upgraded it to a tropical depression and named it Igme.[6] On August 20, Tembin entered a period of explosive intensification, on encountering warm and deep Oceanic heat content. The JMA first noted this, and immediately upgraded Tembin into a Typhoon.[7] Only 3 hours later, the JTWC pointed out that an eye of radius 20 nautical miles (37\u00a0km; 23\u00a0mi) has formed under the low-level circulation center (LLCC) and is being powered by a self-induced meso-anticyclone. Also, there was an excellent poleward and equatorward outflow. A building western extension of a ridge close to the equator started showing a steering effect on the system, at that time. Tembin was expected to reach peak intensity within 48 hours.[8] Later that morning, Tembin contained tracking north-northeastward at 04 knots (7.4\u00a0km/h; 4.6\u00a0mph) while its eye grew a little large and its eyewall became more consolidated. The cloud-tops further cooled down and the eyewall was nearly symmetric. The poleward outflow was enhanced by a strong tropical upper tropospheric trough (TUTT). The windspeed rose from 65 knots (120\u00a0km/h; 75\u00a0mph) to 95 knots (176\u00a0km/h; 109\u00a0mph) within 6 hours. A deep mid-latitude trough across the Korean region resulting in a temporary slow-down or perhaps quasi-stationary motion east of Taiwan.[9] At the same time, the PAGASA updated Tembin, otherwise known as Igme, locally, to a typhoon.[10]"

By August 21, Tembin reached a maximum 1-minute sustained windspeed of 115 knots (213\u00a0km/h; 132\u00a0mph). The system maintained deep convective banding, tightly wrapped into a well-defined, small 10 nautical miles (19\u00a0km; 12\u00a0mi) eye surrounded by a highly symmetric eyewall. A nearby ridge started steering Tembin west. The JTWC were then anticipating a peak intensity of 130 knots (240\u00a0km/h; 150\u00a0mph).[11] Thereafter, the TUTT cell over the system started weakening it. The eyweall started getting eroded. The JTWC no longer expected Tembin to strengthen.[12] By that afternoon, it became clear that the weakening was the result of increased upper-level convergence caused by a rapidly strengthening TUTT extending southwestward from a TUTT cell. At that time, Tembin was tracking north-northwestward at 08 knots (15\u00a0km/h; 9.2\u00a0mph) and was located approximately 280 nautical miles (520\u00a0km; 320\u00a0mi) southeast of Taipei, Taiwan. A deep mid-latitude shortwave trough was tracking northeastward across eastern China. It was expected to track north of the system and then track into the Sea of Japan and steer Tembin westward.[13] Later that night, Tembin slowed down on its track. Located approximately 255 nautical miles (472\u00a0km; 293\u00a0mi) southeast of Taipei, the system tracked north-northwestward at 05 knots (9.3\u00a0km/h; 5.8\u00a0mph) during the past six hours. Animated enhanced infrared satellite imagery showed that the system maintained overall tight consolidation and symmetry even as poleward outflow had slightly diminished. Upper level analysis indicated that Tembin sustained a mesoscale anticyclone that continues to provide good outflow despite two TUTT cells, one to the north and one to the southwest of the typhoon causing subsidence and strong shear along the west to southwestern flank.[14] On the morning on August 22, Animated multispectral satellite imagery showed that the central convection has slightly warmed as the overall structure became more elongated, an indication of increased shear. The system was tracking along the southwestern periphery of a deep-layered subtropical ridge to its north.[15]"

        "content": "Soon, it became clear that the typhoon started to undergo an eyewall replacement cycle. Satellite imagery showed a new eye-like feature developing within the system. Tembin continued weakening due to the eyewall replacement cycle and was expected to weaken even further at that moment.[16] Tembin continued to slow down on its track and remained almost stationary.  Located approximately 210 nautical miles (390\u00a0km; 240\u00a0mi) southeast of Taipei, the storm system became a little less organized over the past couple of hours.  Poleward outflow also started diminishing, as a result.[17] Track speeds continued to be slow as a primary steering influence, a deep layered subtropical ridge to the storm's north, was being weakened by a transiting mid-latitude trough located over the Korean Peninsula. Upper-level analysis indicated that the poleward outflow towards the tropical upper-tropospheric trough cell that was located over southern honshu shut down.[18] Early on August 23, Tembin slowed down even further, to under 02 knots (3.7\u00a0km/h; 2.3\u00a0mph) towards the west. Microwave image revealed a nearly uniform concentric deep eyewall structure that was slightly fragmented over the southwestern quadrant.[19] Finally, a couple of hours later, Tembin started picking up track speed. A mesoscale anticyclone over the system generated excellent radial outflow.[20] Later that afternoon, Tembin re-intensified into a strong category 3 equivalent on the SSHS with winds of up to 105 knots (194\u00a0km/h; 121\u00a0mph) on the 1-minute sustained average. The dual banding features along the northern and southern halves continued feeding the low level circulation center. Upper level analysis indicated that the dual channel outflow to the poleward and equatorward directions had been instrumental in the system maintaining its intensity.[21]"

        "content": "At 19:00 UTC on August 23, Typhoon Tembin made landfall over Mudan Township in Pingtung, Taiwan, and it arrived the Taiwan Strait two hours later.[22] Early on August 24, the JTWC said that the eyewall structure had only slightly degraded as Tembin moved inland. Located approximately 180 nautical miles (330\u00a0km; 210\u00a0mi) south-southwest of Taipei, the storm system was drifting west-southwestward at nearly 10 knots (19\u00a0km/h; 12\u00a0mph). At that time, Tembin was expected to accelerate east-northeastward and interact with another nearby typhoon, Bolaven and go around Taiwan in loops.[23] Later that morning, animated multispectral satellite imagery depicted that the structure of the low level circulation center suffered a significant inflow issue as winds along the southeastern quadrant tracked over southern Taiwan. The JTWC declared that Tembin weakened into a strong Tropical Storm from a Typhoon as winds dropped to under 60 knots (110\u00a0km/h; 69\u00a0mph), although the Hong Kong Observatory kept it at typhoon status. An Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) pass revealed that winds along the western half of the system were in the 35 to 40 knot range, with a band of winds in the luzon strait showing 30 knots.[24] Later that day, animated enhanced infrared satellite imagery depicted that the organization has been able to consolidate with convection beginning to wrap into the LLCC, as the LLCC was moving away from land.[25] While tracking west-southwestward at nearly 07 knots (13\u00a0km/h; 8.1\u00a0mph), convection started to wrap anew into the LLCC. A microwave eye feature was also observed. Upper level analysis indicated a weak point source anticyclone that continued providing good outflow and low vertical wind shear environment. After developing an eye, Tembin rapidly intensified into a category 3 typhoon, before gradually weakening due to an easterly wind shear from Bolaven, which caused the LLCC to become slightly exposed, associated with a few burst of convection, and made its closest approach to Taiwan on 17:30(UTC) as a tropical storm.[26][27][28]"

The residents of Yilan, Hualien, and Taitung were asked to stay alert regarding the storm system.[32] By August 22, the Ministry of National Defense of Taiwan helped evacuate several residents in the typhoon-prone areas and provided accommodation to some in their own military camps. More than 49,000 soldiers were on standby to provide relief and rescue to those in need when the typhoon strikes. About 107 military bases in and around the typhoon-prone regions were ready to provide shelter to well over 53,000 evacuees.[33] The next day, Taiwanese authorities evacuated another 3000 residents from mountainous areas anticipating torrential rain that could cause landslides.[34] Later that day, the outer rainbands of Tembin started brushing Taiwan. The system unexpected sped up towards land and started re-intensifying.[35] Late that night numerous cities and counties across the island shut down schools and offices for up to two days.[36] Farmers also immediately harvested their crops like they earlier did in 2010 anticipating Fanapi's arrival. People in eastern Taiwan boarded up their windows to try to minimize structural damage. Valentine's Day celebrations across Taiwan were also cancelled.[37] On August 24, Tembin made landfall in southern Taiwan. The storm poured torrential rains, toppled trees, and caused flash flooding in several farmlands. Reportedly, 167.5\u00a0mm (6.59\u00a0in) of rain fell within one hour, the heaviest downpour in over 100 years.[38] The local weather bureau data showed Pingtung as a whole received 724\u00a0mm (28.5\u00a0in) of rain since August 22.[39] The typhoon dropped up to 500 millimetres (20\u00a0in) of rainfall on Hengchuen during the overnight of August\u00a023.[40] Hengchun also recorded its highest rainfall since 1896.[39] However, the most heavily populated areas were spared as the storm quickly reemerged into sea. Authorities in Pingtung reported that the town of Hengchun was hit by heavy flooding, with waters reaching 3\u00a0m (9.8\u00a0ft) high in some places. Northern Taiwan was largely spared and schools and offices in the region remained open. Flights to and from southern Taiwan were also cancelled as the typhoon struck.[41] In some parts of southern Taiwan, Tembin blew off the rooftops of many houses. The toppled trees covered busy roads leading to severe traffic jams. Police also intentionally set up roadblocks in some regions anticipating landfalls.[42] Despite no casualties, livelihoods of farmers and poor slum-dwellers were significantly affected by the typhoon. An official of the local highway administration said that the situation would have been even worse if the highways were not blocked.[43] On August 25, about 500 military personnel helped clean up flooded areas in Hengchun. The power outages and roadblocks were cleared by then. Also, railway services between Neishih and Fangshan which were earlier affected by the storm were restored after intensive repair work that, as the Taiwan Railways Administration claims, was done overnight.[38] At the same time, Taiwan forecasters warned residents that tropical storm Tembin could return early next week. Tembin was interacting with nearby Typhoon Bolaven and was expected to go around in loops, eventually making a second landfall over Taiwan. \"Flooding in the Hengchun area Friday was very serious, and worse even than Morakot,\" said Chen Cheng-chia, a Pingtung Fire Agency official.[39] later reports revealed that at least 5 people had been injured while the typhoon made its first landfall.[44] Agricultural damage across the island reached NT$196.87 million (US$6.57 million).[45]"

By late on July 30, Damrey began to accelerate west-northwestward. The storm struggled to make deep convection wrap around itself due to vertical wind shear and dry air since formation, until it passed near Kyushu on August 1.

        "content": "Late on July 26, a tropical disturbance formed southwest of Minamitorishima, which was originally associated with the divergent north of a tropical upper tropospheric trough (TUTT). On July 27, as the original TUTT cell weakened, an upper-level anticyclone was building on the system. Although not being a fully warm-core system initially, it intensified into a tropical depression according to the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), when sea surface temperature ranged from 29 to 31\u00a0\u00b0C.[2] However, the low-level circulation center (LLCC) became exposed later.[3] On July 28, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the system, before JMA upgraded it to a tropical storm and named it Damrey.[4] Late on the same day, JTWC upgraded Damrey to a tropical depression, with a partially exposed LLCC under moderate northwesterly vertical wind shear.[5] Damrey drifted southwestward slowly on July 29, as it was positioned south of a col region produced by an upper-level mid-latitude shortwave trough digging east of Japan. At noon, JTWC upgraded Damrey to a tropical storm based on consolidation within the LLCC, although overall convection has slightly decreased. A second TUTT cell located to the east approached and began to enhance eastward outflow, yet the south TUTT which provided convergence filled up.[6] On July 30, Damrey began to track northwestward. The LLCC of Damrey became well-defined and fully exposed, as dry air surrounded the west semi-circle.[7] By late on July 30, Damrey intensified into a severe tropical storm northeast of Chichi-jima and began to accelerated west-northwestward along the southern periphery of a deep-layered subtropical ridge to the north.[8] The storm started to rebuild central convection on July 31, yet troughing and dry air entrainment degraded outflow over the southern portion.[9] On August 1, deep convection finally wrapped around the LLCC because of tracking over the warmest regions of the Kuroshio Current, as well as dry air began to weaken. When Damrey passed near Yakushima at 06Z, the system developed a central dense overcast.[10] According to JTWC Best Track Data, Damrey became a typhoon at 12Z. Poleward outflow channel still remained, but increasing convergence from the outflow of Typhoon Saola produced subsidence on the southern semi-circle and limited convection.[11] Based on RSMC Best Track Data, Damrey intensified into a typhoon west of Jeju at 00Z on August 2, when it just arrived at the Yellow Sea. At the moment, the typhoon featured a 25 nautical miles (46\u00a0km; 29\u00a0mi) ragged eye with a symmetric eyewall, yet deepest convection was mostly confined to the northern semi-circle. As Saola weakened into a severe tropical storm and became quasi-stationary near Taiwan, its outflow has weakened due to an increase in distance between two systems.[12] Unlike JTWC analyses that Damrey began to gradually weaken after 00Z on August 2, JMA analyses that the typhoon reached peak intensity at 06Z, with ten-minute maximum sustained winds at 70 knots (130\u00a0km/h, 80\u00a0mph) and the atmospheric pressure at 965\u00a0hPa (14.00\u00a0psi). Damrey was still tracking along the southern periphery of a deep-layered subtropical ridge anchored over Kyushu, Japan, when the system had a 20 nautical miles (37\u00a0km; 23\u00a0mi) ragged eye with a symmetric eyewall.[13] After slightly weakening, Damrey made landfall as a minimal typhoon over Xiangshui County in Jiangsu, China at 13:30 UTC (21:30 CST).[14] Because of land interaction, the system weakened into a severe tropical storm near Lianyungang at 18Z, when JTWC also downgraded it to a tropical storm with a final warning.[15] Early on August 3, Damrey weakened into a tropical storm north of Linyi in Shandong, and then it turned northward. A half of day later, the system weakened into a tropical depression northeast of Binzhou, before it turned northeastward and arrived at the Bohai Sea. The system dissipated near the coast of Qinhuangdao in Hebei on August 4."

The twenty-third tropical depression and twenty-third named storm of the record-breaking 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, Beta originally formed from a trough of low pressure that developed in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico on September\u00a010. The low moved slowly southwestward, with development hampered initially by the development of nearby Hurricane Sally. After Sally moved inland over the Southeastern United States and weakened, the disturbance became nearly stationary in the southwestern Gulf, where it began to organize. By September\u00a016, the storm had gained a low-level circulation center and had enough organization to be designated as Tropical Depression Twenty-Two.[nb 1] The system held its intensity for a day due to the influence of strong wind shear and dry air, before eventually attaining tropical storm strength. It slowly moved northward and intensified to a mid-range tropical storm before dry air and wind shear halted its intensification. Beta then became nearly stationary on September\u00a019, before starting to move west towards the Texas coast the next day, weakening as it approached. On September\u00a021, Beta made landfall near Matagorda Peninsula, Texas as a minimal tropical storm.[2] It subsequently weakened to a tropical depression the next day before becoming post-tropical early on September\u00a023. Its remnants moved northeastward, before the center elongated and merged with a cold front early on September\u00a025. The storm's sprawling nature and slow-movement caused numerous areas along the Gulf Coast to be pounded by heavy surf and high waves for several days, while torrential rainfall and storm surge affected areas that were already struggling to recover from previous tropical cyclones, such as Hurricanes Laura and Sally. Several streets, highways, and even interstates in Houston were closed due to flooding. Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, the Carolinas were all impacted by flooding, gusty winds, and severe weather as well. One fatality in Texas due to Beta's impacts has been confirmed.

The hurricane watches were later dropped when the storm failed to strengthen past 60\u00a0mph, but most of the other watches were upgraded to warnings.[23] Several voluntary evacuations were issued by city and county governments over concerns of particularly vulnerable areas around Houston and Galveston.[24] Flood warnings and watches of various types were issued throughout Texas and Louisiana as the storm approached coastal Texas and then made landfall.[25] As the storm moved inland into Louisiana, a tornado watch was issued for the southern and eastern part of the state as well as Southern Mississippi.[26] On September\u00a018, prior to the system being upgraded into a tropical storm, a Hurricane Hunter mission which started at Keesler Air Force Base in Mississippi was aborted when lightning from the system struck the Lockheed WC-130J Hercules sent to gather data causing the plane's radar systems to go down, endangering the occupants of the flight.[27] A tornado warning was issued for Galveston County, Texas on the afternoon of September\u00a021, although no tornadoes was confirmed.[28] A number of flash flood warnings were also issued as rainbands began to continually move over the same areas.[29][30] On September\u00a023, favorable atmospheric conditions led to a flurry of tornado, severe thunderstorm and special marine warnings as the remnants of the storm moved through Louisiana and into Mississippi, but again no tornadoes were confirmed.[31][32] Heavy surf and high waves from Beta destroyed part of a pier in Galveston, Texas while storm surge flooding left many areas of the Texas coast under water. Around the time of landfall, a wind gust of 48\u00a0mph (77\u00a0km/h) was recorded in Port Lavaca.[33] Parts of I-69 and TX 288 were closed by flooding and high water rescue teams responded to dozens of calls for help.[34] By the time Beta had weakened to a tropical depression on September\u00a022, over 100\u00a0high-water rescues had taken place in Houston as portions of the city became heavily inundated by the storm's high rainfall totals,[25] exceeding 9\u00a0in (23\u00a0cm) in parts of the city. Dozens of streets and highways in the city, including parts of I-69, I-45, and TX\u00a0288 and 290, were closed by fast-rising water. Officials urged residents to stay home and avoid driving if possible. The sprawling nature of the storm also brought heavy rainfall to Louisiana, which was still recovering from a number of other systems that had affected the state during the season. Texas Governor Greg Abbott issued disaster declarations for 29\u00a0counties, while Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards declared a state of emergency.[34] A missing fisherman who had gone into Brays Bayou during the storm was later discovered drowned.[35] Heavy rainfall, flooding, and gusty winds also impacted Mississippi, Tennessee, Arkansas, Alabama, and Georgia.[34] The remnants of the storm fueled a small severe weather event across the Carolinas on September\u00a025 with severe thunderstorms producing wind damage and unusually significant hail up to 2.25 inches (5.7\u00a0cm) in diameter. An EF0\u00a0tornado was also confirmed in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina as well, although it was not directly associated with the storm.[36]"

It severely disrupted the 13th World Scout Jamboree, which was being held in Fujinomiya, Shizuoka Prefecture. The twentieth depression, nineteenth named storm, and twelfth typhoon of the 1971 Pacific typhoon season, the system was first noted as an area of circulation in a near-equatorial trough, located to the east of Guam on July 24. After moving through the area, the system took a northward direction due to the influence of a trough. It then commenced a northeast move before organizing, though it didn't strengthen to a tropical depression until July 29. Slow but gradual intensification occurred, becoming a tropical storm in the early hours of July 31 as it moved to the west, before taking a north-northwest track as it intensified to a typhoon on August 2 while approaching the Ryukyu Islands. On the next day, it reached its peak intensity of 155\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph) and an unusually low barometric pressure of 935 mbar, equivalent to a mid-level typhoon as it started to batter the third-largest island of Japan, Kyushu. It then moved to the north, while weakening back to a minimal typhoon before making landfall on the area, with the records pointing it to the east of Nagasaki on August 5. It rapidly weakened while traversing Kyushu, before entering the Sea of Japan. At this time, it passed near the southern part of Korea before curving to the northeast. It then passed near Russian Manchuria before weakening below gale-force, shortly before becoming extratropical as it passed through the La P\u00e9rouse Strait on August 9. It then accelerated through the Pacific Ocean before dissipating on the next day. 90 deaths were attributed from Olive, with the majority in Japan. The system also caused widespread flooding and landslides through the country and nearby South Korea. The total damages are unknown."

The 21st named storm of the 1971 Pacific typhoon season, Rose developed from an area of disturbed weather while west of Guam on August\u00a09. Moving west-northwestward, the storm briefly became a typhoon on the following day. After weakening to a tropical storm on August\u00a011, Rose re-intensified into a typhoon several hours later. The system then curved westward and reached a primary peak intensity with winds of 205\u00a0km/h (127\u00a0mph) on August\u00a013. Later that day, the typhoon made landfall near Palanan, Isabela in the Philippines. Rose weakened significantly while crossing the island of Luzon and was a minimal typhoon upon reaching the South China Sea on August\u00a014. The storm intensified significantly and re-curved northwestward in response to a weakening high-pressure area. Early on August\u00a016, Rose attained its maximum sustained wind speed of 220\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph) \u2013 equivalent to a Category\u00a04 hurricane on the National Hurricane Center's Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale. Later that day, a ship observed the typhoon's minimum barometric pressure of 950\u00a0mbar (28\u00a0inHg). Thereafter, the storm weakened slightly before making landfall at Lantau Island, Hong Kong, with winds of 165\u00a0km/h (103\u00a0mph) late on August\u00a016. Rose rapidly weakened to a tropical storm early the following day and dissipated several hours later. Mostly minor wind impact was recorded in the Philippines, limited to downed communication lines and damaged houses. Offshore Hong Kong, storm surge and heavy waves sank or severely damaged at least 300\u00a0boats, causing 110\u00a0deaths and 283\u00a0injuries. Inland, heavy rainfall flooded low-lying areas and resulted in numerous landslides. A fire ignited at a large power sub-station in Kwun Tong and was difficult to extinguish due to strong winds. The fire caused blackouts in Kowloon Peninsula and New Territories, trapping thousands of people in elevators. A total of 5,644\u00a0people were left homeless, while 653\u00a0huts were destroyed.

Radars at Fleet Weather Central and Andersen Air Force Base on Guam detected spiral convective bands crossing the island on August\u00a09.[2] At 00:00\u00a0UTC the following day, the system developed into Tropical Storm Rose while located 110\u00a0mi (180\u00a0km) west of Guam.[1] Around that time, a reconnaissance aircraft flight indicated a \"mini-storm\" with sustained winds between 40 and 45\u00a0mph (64 and 72\u00a0km/h). Initially, Rose moved west-northwestward at about 13\u00a0mph (21\u00a0km/h). The storm was a small cyclone, covering an area of 100\u2013150\u00a0mi (160\u2013240\u00a0km).[2] Rose quickly strengthened and became a typhoon around 12:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a010. Early the following day, the system briefly weakened back to a tropical storm, before re-acquiring typhoon status hours later.[1] Rose intensified further while tracking generally westward at 16\u00a0mph (26\u00a0km/h). Around midday on August\u00a013, the typhoon attained a primary peak intensity with winds of 125\u00a0mph (201\u00a0km/h), equivalent to a Category\u00a03 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale. Rose weakened slightly before making landfall in Palanan, Isabela, Philippines, with winds of 110\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h).[1] The storm weakened further while crossing island of Luzon and emerged into the South China Sea early on August\u00a014 as a minimal typhoon. Rose immediately began to re-intensify. A high-pressure area that had steered the typhoon for the last several days weakened significantly, causing Rose to re-curving northwestward and decelerated to a forward speed of 8\u00a0mph (13\u00a0km/h).[2] Deepening continued, with the typhoon peaking with maximum sustained winds of 140\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h) \u2013 equal to a Category\u00a04 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale \u2013 early on August\u00a016.[1] Later that day, a ship in the vicinity of the eye observed a barometric pressure of 950\u00a0mbar (28\u00a0inHg) \u2013 the lowest in relation to the cyclone.[2] At around 12:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a016, reports from the JTWC indicate that Rose weakened slightly while approaching the Hong Kong and the coast of China. Hours later, the storm made landfall at Lantau Island with winds of 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h).[1] Rose was the most intense typhoon to strike Hong Kong since Wanda in 1962.[2] Moving inland, the system rapidly weakened to a tropical storm early on August\u00a017 and dissipated shortly thereafter.[1]"

Downed communication lines and damage to houses were reported.[4] Rose produced a fog bank before making landfall, which is unusual for a tropical cyclone. The storm was the strongest cyclone to strike Hong Kong since Typhoon Wanda in 1962. Along the coast, the typhoon generated waves of 9.5\u00a0m (31\u00a0ft) and a storm surge of 0.375\u00a0m (1.23\u00a0ft) was recorded in Lantau. The storm surge and heavy waves proved dangerous to ships offshore, at least 300\u00a0boats sank or were badly damaged by the typhoon. Eighty-eight deaths occurred after the Hong Kong-Macau ferry SS\u00a0Fatshan capsized.[3] The USS Regulus, a United States Navy vessel, was among the ships that suffered damage.[5] Three United States Seventh Fleet rescue ships searched for survivors. Additionally, Royal Navy minesweepers and Royal Air Force whirlwind helicopters also arrived at Hong Kong, with the latter coordinating with the marine police.[6] Overall, the sinking ships resulted in 110\u00a0fatalities,[3] as well as 300\u00a0injuries.[5] Strong winds were reported, including a gust up to 278\u00a0km/h (173\u00a0mph) at Tai Mo Shan. Many scaffolds, signboards, trees, and boughs were knocked down.[3] Fire broke out around 15:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a016 at a large power sub-station in Kwun Tong. Due to the strong winds, firefighters were unable to sometimes unable to control the flames. By 16:30\u00a0UTC, the fire was put out. However, it triggered power outages, with blackouts in the Kowloon Peninsula and New Territories. Thousands of people were trapped in elevators during the widespread electrical failures.[3] Heavy rainfall was also recorded, with up to 161.7\u00a0mm (6.37\u00a0in) of precipitation. Several low-lying areas were flooded. Numerous landslides blocked approximately 110\u00a0roads, 30\u00a0of which were severely obstructed.[3] One landslide buried four children after crashing into their village hut, killing two, while one survived and was taken to the hospital, and the fourth remained missing.[6] A total of 5,644 people \u2013 approximately 1,032\u00a0families \u2013 were left homeless, with 653\u00a0huts destroyed. Twenty-four buildings were damaged, with six beyond repair or demolished. Communications were disrupted, with 30,000\u00a0telephones out of service. Hundreds of pigs and over 40,000\u00a0chickens as well as other poultry were killed. Roughly 1,356 hectares of vegetable and garden crops damaged. Additionally, 20,000\u00a0fruit trees were blown down. Considerable loss of pond fish due to overflow was also reported.[3] On land, Rose was attributed to 24\u00a0fatalities.[7]"

At this time, Hester was located approximately 400\u00a0km (250\u00a0mi) east of northern Mindanao in the Philippines.[1] Due to the cyclone's proximity to the country, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Goying.[3] Early on October\u00a020, Hester brushed northern Mindanao before crossing the Visayas.[2] The storm passed approximately 75\u00a0km (45\u00a0mi) south of Cebu City later that day before moving into the South China Sea.[1] Early on October\u00a021, Hester intensified into a typhoon hours before crossing Palawan.[1][2] Once over the South China Sea, a strong ridge built over southern China resulting in Hester turning northwestward and accelerating. It reached a forward speed of 33\u00a0km/h (20\u00a0mph), twice the climatological average for typhoons in that region during October. Between October\u00a022 and 23, the storm developed an eye before reaching its peak intensity as a Category\u00a02-equivalent typhoon. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center estimated peak winds to have reached 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph) along with a central pressure of 967\u00a0mb (hPa; 28.56\u00a0inHg). Hester subsequently made landfall near Hu\u1ebf, South Vietnam. Once onshore, the storm's structure rapidly degraded as it weakened.[1] The storm later dissipated over central Laos on October\u00a024.[2]"

Making landfall directly over the United States military installation in Chu Lai, Hester damaged or destroyed 75\u00a0percent of the structures in the base. Sustained winds and gusts in the base were estimated to have reached 130\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph) and 160\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph) respectively.[1] Four hangars collapsed in the Chu Lai airbase, with total aircraft losses amounting to 36 destroyed and 87 damaged.[1] Losses from the destroyed helicopters exceeded $3.6\u00a0million (1971\u00a0USD).[5] Dozens of barracks were damaged in Chu Lai and communications were hampered. The 91st Evacuation Hospital was mostly destroyed and was forced to transfer patients to Quy Nh\u01a1n.[6] Nearly 50\u00a0percent of the structures at the Marble Mountain Air Facility were damaged by the storm's high winds.[7] Heavy rains accompanying the storm, peaking at 5.44\u00a0in (138\u00a0mm) at Camp Eagle, caused considerable flooding in the country. Approximately 370\u00a0km (230\u00a0mi) of coastline between Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb and \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng were inundated. About 90\u00a0percent of homes in \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng were damaged.[1] Flooding from the storm washed out a bridge between Fire Support Base Birmingham and Camp Eagle, temporarily isolating two units within the 94th Field Artillery Regiment.[8] Extensive losses to agriculture also took place, with major crop losses reported and 900\u00a0cattle killed.[1] According to government officials, the entire banana, rice, and sugar cane crop was destroyed and harvests could not be made until the following spring.[9] Offshore, nearly 500\u00a0vessels sank or were destroyed by the storm and the 1,000\u00a0ton Union Pacific ran aground.[1] According to newspaper reports, 100\u00a0Vietnamese perished during Hester.[5] Thirty-three fatalities took place after a Republic of Vietnam Air Force transport crashed near Quy Nh\u01a1n.[9] Thee Americans were killed due to flying debris during the storm and twenty-one others were injured.[1][9] On October\u00a025, thunderstorms associated with Hester were blamed on a helicopter crash Nha Trang that killed ten Americans.[10] Roughly 550,000\u00a0homes were destroyed across the country, leaving an estimated 200,000\u00a0people homeless.[1][5] On October\u00a025, Premier Tran Thien Khiem toured some of the storm-ravaged areas and made on-the-spot grants of $19,000 to each province and $3,500 to \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng. He also promised that 50,000\u00a0sheets of tin roofing would be sent to aid in reconstruction. Later that day, President Nguyen Van Thieu ordered $725,000 be made available for disaster relief in the northern provinces following an emergency meeting. The Social Welfare Ministry estimated that $1.5\u00a0million would be needed for civilian relief.[9]"

The seventh named storm and fifth typhoon of the 2023 Pacific typhoon season, Lan originated from an area of low pressure several hundred kilometers east of Iwo Jima. It initially tracked north-northwestward, gradually intensifying into a tropical storm and later to typhoon status, reaching its peak as a Category 4-equivalent typhoon with sustained winds of 215\u00a0km/h (130\u00a0mph) and a central pressure of 940\u00a0hPa (27.76\u00a0inHg). Lan then quickly weakened the following day due to the effects of inner ring of cloud tops and well-defined eyewall. Lan re-strengthened again to 155\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph), Lan made landfall near Cape Shionomisaki in Japan. Once inland, Lan rapidly weakened and degenerated into a tropical storm over the region's rough terrain. Lan emerged back over the southern Sea of Japan, before declared it an extratropical low on August 17. The low moved east-northeast and was last noted on the next day. Lan caused widespread damage. In addition to causing landslides and flooding, the storm also uprooted trees and damaged electrical lines. At least 100,000 homes are without power, and more than 237,000 individuals have been forced from their homes. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) issued purple heavy rain\u2014the second highest level on a four-tier scale\u2014and landslide warnings for parts of Kyoto Prefecture in Kansai region and Iwate Prefecture in T\u014dhoku region as of late August 14. One person has been reported dead and 64 are reported to have remained injured following the typhoon. Total losses are estimated to be around $500 million (2023 USD) according to AON."

        "content": "The origins of Typhoon Lan can be traced back to August 5, when the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) reported that a low-pressure area had formed east-northeast of Iwo Jima. Deep convection shifted towards the southeastern semicircle of the circulation, while the still-poorly defined center.[1][2] Environmental conditions were assessed as being marginally conducive for tropical cyclogenesis, with warm sea surface temperatures (SST) near 29\u201330\u00a0\u00b0C (84\u201386\u00a0\u00b0F) and low vertical wind shear, and good equatorward outflow.[3] At the same time, the JMA upgraded it to a tropical depression, before the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the system.[4][5] The agency followed suit and designated the system 07W.[6] The same day, the agency upgraded to a tropical storm,[7] with the JMA assigning the name Lan for the system.[8] Satellite imagery depicting a convective banding feature with some deep convection over the northern and eastern semicircle.[9] A banding eye began to appear on satellite imagery; the deep convection had started to consolidate and wrap around the low-level circulation center.[10] Lan continued to strengthen as it turned more westward under the influence of the SST and weak vertical wind shear, the JMA upgraded Lan to a severe tropical storm at 06:00 UTC on August 9 as its maximum sustained winds increased to 95\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph).[11] Organization began to steadily increase within the developing eyewall, but the JTWC reported that it did not intensify over the past twelve hours.[12] Lan began to intensify more quickly, reaching typhoon status.[13][14] Lan consolidated and developed a small, defined circulation with satellite imagery revealed a 30 nautical miles (56\u00a0km; 35\u00a0mi) ragged eye.[15] Lan developed a clear eye and continued strengthening on satellite imagery, surrounded by a warming eye of 10\u201317\u00a0\u00b0C (50\u201363\u00a0\u00b0F).[16] The JTWC upgraded it to Category 4-equivalent typhoon on August 11 after Dvorak estimates indicated winds of 215\u00a0km/h (130\u00a0mph).[17] The JMA also assessed Lan to have winds of 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph), and a minimum pressure of 940\u00a0hPa (27.76\u00a0inHg).[18] The typhoon sustained a symmetric ring around deep convection.[19] Shortly after that however, Lan's slow motion began to upwell colder waters below the storm and the typhoon began to weaken.[20] Further degradation continued through August 12 with the cloud tops warming and the eyewall detoriating.[21] Lan re-strengthened again to 155\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph) as it strengthened. The storm maintained its overall convective structure, but the waters beneath the cyclone cooled, prompting a quick weakening trend.[22][23] The JMA downgraded Lan to a severe tropical storm, with estimated winds of 110\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph).[24] Around 19:00 UTC on August 14, Lan made landfall near Cape Shionomisaki in Japan. Once inland, Lan rapidly weakened and degenerated into a tropical storm over the region's rough terrain.[25] Lan emerged back over the southern Sea of Japan.[26] as it had an exposed low-level circulation center with banding structure. Lan began to accelerate to the northeast while weakening, the JTWC discontinued warnings on the system.[27][28] The JMA issued its last advisory on Lan, and declared it an extratropical low on August 17.[29] Lan tracked east-northeast until it was last noted on the next day.[30]"

Prefectures from Tottori to Fukui may experience amounts of 4\u20138\u00a0in (100\u2013200\u00a0mm). [34] A level 3 evacuation was ordered for 26,000 senior residents of a town in Wakayama Prefecture on Tuesday morning due to concerns that heavy rains will cause landslides.[35] Typhoon Lan caused widespread damage. In addition to causing landslides and flooding, the typhoon also uprooted trees and damaged electrical lines. More than 100,000 homes are without power, and more than 237,000 individuals have been forced from their homes. The Japanese government has dispatched rescue teams to assist with the cleanup. The government has dispatched food and water to the affected districts, and the military has been deployed to assist with rescue and relief efforts.[36] According to officials, more than 590 residences in Tottori City are now cut off as access roads have been damaged.[37] The western prefecture of Wakayama has experienced strong gusts and torrential rainfall.[38]  At least 50,000 households in western and central Japan lost electricity.[39] More than 800 flights were cancelled.[40] An amount of rain similar to three times the usual August rainfall was recorded in Tottori Prefecture in a single day, totaling 470\u00a0mm (19\u00a0in) in 24 hours.[41] In Okayama and Tottori prefectures, 500\u00a0mm (20\u00a0in) of rain dropped during a period of 24 hours, while 100\u00a0mm (3.9\u00a0in) of rain fell every hour in Kyoto, Nara, and Tottori prefectures.[42] Economic losses from the storm totaled $500 million according to AON.[43] Representatives from several of Japanese prefectures announced that they would postpone commemorating the surrender of Japan in World War II. The Japanese High School Baseball Championship held in Hy\u014dgo Prefecture was postponed in August 16.[44] An 80-year-old female who was stuck in Saji Town was taken to the hospital for emergency care due to cardiac arrest, but she perished, another 64 remain injured.[45][46] According to the Japan Airlines, 240 domestic flights have been canceled as a result of Typhoon Lan.[47] Lan prompted the closure of Ghibli Park, Universal Studios Japan, and Nintendo.[48] Retailers and logistics firms would cease operations in western and center regions in Japan.[49]"

It was the sixth named storm and fourth typhoon of the 2023 Pacific typhoon season. Khanun started as a low-pressure area in the Pacific Ocean. It rapidly intensified into a Category 4-equivalent typhoon on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale over the Philippine Sea on August 1, before undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle. Khanun weakened slightly as it moved closer to the Ryukyu Islands, battering them with heavy rain and strong winds. Khanun began to degrade its eye on satellite imagery due to quasi-stationary and warming cloud tops. Steady weakening continued as Khanun approached the Korean Peninsula and it eventually made landfall on Geojedo in South Korea. The storm dissipated shortly thereafter. Khanun became the first to pass through the Korean Peninsula from south to north since recordkeeping began in 1951. In South Korea, approximately 40,350 people lost power. At least 159 different facilities were reportedly damaged. More than 1.019\u00a0ha (2.52 acres) of farmland in South Gyeongsang Province suffered damage. State media in North Korea reported that Khanun also caused minor damage. In Russia, Khanun brought heavy rains to parts of the Primorsky Krai in the Russian Far East, Russia dispatched a task team to observe the cleanup of areas of the country. A state of emergency was declared in 21 municipalities.13 people have been reported dead and 16 have been reported to have gone missing following the typhoon, another 115 remain injured, and damage totaled at US$98.1\u00a0million."

        "content": " Typhoon Mireille, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Rosing, was the costliest typhoon on record, until it was surpassed by Typhoon Doksuri in 2023.[1] Striking Japan in September 1991, it became the 20th named storm of the 1991 Pacific typhoon season, Mireille formed on September\u00a013 from the monsoon trough near the Marshall Islands. It moved westward for several days as a small system, steered by the subtropical ridge to the north. The storm rapidly intensified to typhoon status on September\u00a016, and several days later passed north of Saipan in the Northern Marianas Islands. Mireille intensified further after deleterious effects from a nearby tropical storm subsided. On September\u00a022, the American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) estimated maximum 1-minute sustained winds of 240\u00a0km/h (150\u00a0mph), and on the next day, the official Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) estimated 10\u2011minute sustained winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph). The typhoon weakened slightly while turning northward, passing just east of Miyako-jima and later to the west of Okinawa. On September\u00a027, Mireille made landfall near Nagasaki in southwestern Japan with winds of 175\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph), the strongest since Typhoon Nancy in 1961. The storm accelerated to the northeast through the Sea of Japan, moving over Hokkaido before becoming extratropical on September\u00a028. The remnants of Mireille continued to the east, passing through the Aleutian Islands of Alaska on October\u00a01. The typhoon first threatened Guam, although it passed well to the north of the island, bringing damaging winds to northern Saipan. The first part of Japan affected was Miyako-jima, where heavy rainfall and high winds damaged crops. Mireille lashed Okinawa with strong waves, while strong winds up to 189\u00a0km/h (117\u00a0mph) damaged power lines and trees. The typhoon ultimately caused damage in 41 of 47 prefectures of Japan, with overall damage estimated at $10\u00a0billion (1991 USD, $22.5 billion in 2023), making it the costliest typhoon on record as of 2017.[nb 1] Mireille produced record wind gusts at 26\u00a0locations, with a peak gust of 218\u00a0km/h (135\u00a0mph) in western Honshu. The winds caused record power outages across Japan that affected 7.36\u00a0million people, or about 13% of total customers. Mireille also left extensive crop damage totaling $3\u00a0billion, mostly to the apple industry, after 345,000\u00a0tons of apples fell to the ground and another 43,000 were damaged on the trees. The storm damaged over 670,000\u00a0houses, of which 1,058 were destroyed, and another 22,965 were flooded. Throughout Japan, Mireille killed 66\u00a0people and injured another 2,862\u00a0people, including ten deaths on a capsized freighter. Elsewhere, the typhoon killed two people in South Korea, and its remnants brought strong winds to Alaska."

        "header": "Meteorological history",
        "content": "The origins of Mireille were from a poorly-organized area of convection, or thunderstorms, associated with the monsoon trough near the Marshall Islands on September\u00a013.[2] That day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA)[nb 2] began tracking the system as a tropical depression.[4] The system moved westward, developing a large increase in thunderstorms over the center on September\u00a015. That day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)[nb 3] issued a tropical cyclone formation alert, and issued their first advisory on Tropical Depression 21W at 00:00\u00a0UTC, estimating 1-minute sustained winds of 55\u00a0km/h (34\u00a0mph). About six hours later, the agency upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Mireille, after satellite imagery indicated the storm was very compact and intensifying quickly.[2] The JTWC later determined in a post-storm analysis that Mireille had attained tropical storm status 12\u00a0hours earlier on the previous day.[6] Also at the time of it attaining tropical storm status, Mireille was one of three storms in the basin, along with Tropical Storm Luke to the northwest and Typhoon Nat to the west in the South China Sea.[2] Only 12\u00a0hours after the JTWC issued the first warning, Mireille attained typhoon status at 12:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a016, and several hours later reached an initial peak intensity of 135\u00a0km/h (84\u00a0mph).[2][6] The small storm moved west-northwestward due to the influence of the subtropical ridge to the north. On September\u00a017, the track shifted to the west-southwest, threatening Guam. The small typhoon turned more to the west, passing about 20\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi) north of Saipan on September\u00a019, part of the Northern Marianas Islands north of Guam. For several days, Mireille failed to intensify due to wind shear from the larger Tropical Storm Luke to the north. After Luke weakened and progressed northward, Mireille was able to strengthen more gradually, as well as increase in size.[2] On September\u00a022, the typhoon strengthened into a super typhoon, which is an unofficial category used by the JTWC for storms reaching 1\u2011minute winds of at least 240\u00a0km/h (150\u00a0mph), equivalent to a strong Category 4 hurricane on the SSHWS.[6] According to the JMA, Mireille attained 10\u2011minute winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph) on September\u00a023.[4] Around the time of reaching peak intensity, Mireille turned more to the northwest along the southwestern periphery of the subtropical ridge. The increasing size began to impart wind shear in Typhoon Nat to the west, and the two storms underwent the Fujiwhara effect, in which Nat turned sharply southward while Mireille progressed toward the Ryukyu Islands of Japan.[2] After maintaining peak winds for about 30\u00a0hours, Mireille began weakening, passing just east of Miyako-jima on September\u00a026 with 10\u2011minute winds of 165\u00a0km/h (103\u00a0mph), according to the JMA.[4] That day, the typhoon accelerated to the northeast due to increasing mid-level winds from the southwest, passing west of Okinawa.[2] According to the JMA, Mireille re-intensified slightly on September\u00a027 to a secondary peak of 175\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph),[4] aided by unusually warm water temperatures in the East China Sea.[7] The typhoon made landfall at that strength at 07:00\u00a0UTC between Saikai and Nagasaki along southwest Kyushu.[4] The pressure at landfall was 940\u00a0mbar (28\u00a0inHg), the lowest in the country since Typhoon Trix in 1971.[7] The typhoon quickly weakened while continuing northeastward through Kyushu and western Honshu,[4] and started to become an extratropical cyclone; during the process, the wind field expanded, aided by moist air from the southwest and cold air from the northwest.[8] It accelerated further over the Sea of Japan, and late on September\u00a027, Mireille made a second landfall in Japan along southwestern Hokkaido at 22:00\u00a0UTC, with 10\u2011minute winds of 150\u00a0km/h (93\u00a0mph) still at typhoon status. Crossing the island, the typhoon weakened to tropical storm status early on September\u00a028, and shortly thereafter became fully extratropical in the Sea of Okhotsk. The powerful remnants of Mireille continued eastward, crossing the Aleutian Islands on September\u00a029 and crossed the International Date Line shortly thereafter.[4] That day, a pressure of 954\u00a0mbar (954\u00a0hPa; 28.2\u00a0inHg) was observed in the Pribilof Islands of Alaska. Powerful winds battered vessels in the region, with the Merchant Pride reporting peak sustained winds of 110\u00a0km/h (68\u00a0mph).[9] After crossing the dateline, Mireille's remnants turned northeast and struck the Seward Peninsula on October\u00a03 before moving over Arctic Alaska. The system then moved over the Arctic Ocean where it was last noted on October\u00a04.[10]"

        "content": "Early tropical cyclone computer models anticipated Mireille would pass close to Guam, prompting officials to undergo preparations for the storm. The storm ultimately passed north of Saipan, causing damage along the island's northern portion. Mireille knocked over trees and damaged over 70% of Saipan's crops while also eroding coastal roads.[2] In South Korea, two people were killed with two others reported missing.[11] A South Korean freighter rode out the storm at the port in Hakata Bay.[12] It breached along the breakwater, causing it to sink,[13] killing all 10\u00a0crew members.[2] The Japan Coast Guard launched a search and rescue mission for two days.[12] Later, the remnants of Mireille moved through the Aleutian Islands toward the end of September,[4] bringing strong winds to the islands, including gusts over 112\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph) at Amchitka.[14]"

        "header": "Japan",
        "content": "Ahead of the storm, the JMA issued 99\u00a0typhoon bulletins, warning residents about Mireille. There were 236\u00a0warnings related to storm surge, high winds, waves, and flooding. In Hiroshima, most residents were aware of the approaching storm, about 70% of residents did not expect significant effects. In general, residents were unprepared for the storm, partly due to the lack of recent storms.[7] Transportation in Japan was disrupted after 480\u00a0domestic flights cancelled, stranding 58,000\u00a0individuals,[15] and road, rail, and ferry traffic was halted.[16] In Hokkaido, 207\u00a0schools were closed due to the storm.[17] Mireille was the strongest typhoon to hit Japan since Typhoon Nancy in 1961, causing heavy damage in 41 of 47 prefectures.[18] It was the third storm to strike Japan in two weeks.[8] Damage was heaviest on Kyushu where the storm made landfall.[12] Because the storm moved northeastward through the Sea of Japan, the eastern quadrant of the storm crossed over much of the country, which is where the strongest winds in tropical cyclones are located.[19] The high winds downed trees, damaged roofs,[12] and left record power outages,[18] affecting 7.36\u00a0million people, or about 13% of total customers.[7] In some areas, the power outages lasted as little as three minutes.[20] The storm damaged over 670,000\u00a0houses, of which 1,058\u00a0were destroyed,[7] and another 22,965\u00a0were flooded.[21] Power outages caused at least five factories to shut down production.[22] Along the coast, the typhoon damaged 930\u00a0ships,[21] with dozens sunk or blown ashore.[18] Most of the damage was related to agriculture or forests.[7] Sea spray heavily damaged fruit trees and rice paddies.[7] Crop damage amounted to $3\u00a0billion, mostly to the apple industry,[2] after 345,000\u00a0tons of apples fell to the ground and another 43,000 were damaged on the trees. Most farms lost 80% of their crop, potentially taking 10\u00a0years to regrow.[23] Persistent cloudiness and rainfall following the storm diminished sunlight by 50%, furthering crop damage.[24] There were 62\u00a0deaths in Japan and 2,862\u00a0injuries,[7] including the deaths on the South Korean freighter,[2] making it the deadliest typhoon there in 10\u00a0years.[7] About 80% of the deaths were male, and 70% were over 60\u00a0years old. Most of the deaths were related to wind-blown debris, falling due to the wind, or being trapped or struck by fallen objects.[25] The $6\u00a0billion in insured losses and $10\u00a0billion in overall damage made Mireille the costliest typhoon on record as of January 2015, according to Munich Re.[26] When Mireille moved through western Japan, it brought strong winds and heavy rainfall. The highest sustained wind was 162\u00a0km/h (101\u00a0mph) at Nomozaki, Nagasaki,[21] and gusts nearby peaked at 218\u00a0km/h (135\u00a0mph). Misawa Air Base along northern Honshu reported winds of at least 93\u00a0km/h (58\u00a0mph) for five hours, with a peak gust of 152\u00a0km/h (94\u00a0mph). This was the highest wind report at the station since records began in 1946.[2] The strongest wind gusts occurred concurrently with a sudden drop in atmospheric pressure, primarily from Kyushu and extending east-northeastward into the Ch\u016bgoku region of Honshu.[27] Mireille produced record wind gusts at 26\u00a0locations and record sustained winds at 12\u00a0locations.[19] At landfall, Mireille produced winds of at least 54\u00a0km/h (34\u00a0mph) across a diameter of 600\u00a0km (370\u00a0mi).[7] About two-thirds of the wind stations reported the strongest winds from the west after Mireille passed the area. Winds were lightest in eastern Honshu,[8] Mireille also dropped heavy rainfall, mostly on Shikoku, peaking at 406\u00a0mm (16.0\u00a0in) at Kito, Tokushima. In nearby K\u014dchi Prefecture, the heaviest hourly rainfall total was 72\u00a0mm (2.8\u00a0in), the highest in the nation for the storm.[21] The rains caused at least 13\u00a0landslides and flooded rivers in four locations.[15] However, effects from rainfall were limited due to the storm's fast forward motion.[7] Mireille also struck around the time of high tide, causing extensive storm surge along the coast.[28] Mireille first passed near Miyako-jima, dropping 273\u00a0mm (10.7\u00a0in) of rainfall there.[21] Wind gusts on the island reached 176\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph), which caused some crop damage to sugar cane and vegetables. All flights were canceled as Mireille passed the island.[29] Later, the typhoon bypassed Okinawa to the west. The island experienced winds of at least 93\u00a0km/h (58\u00a0mph) for 27\u00a0hours, with gusts of 152\u00a0km/h (94\u00a0mph) at Kadena Air Base.[2] The capital city, Naha, reported gusts of 180\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph), while the highest gust in the region was 189\u00a0km/h (117\u00a0mph) on Kume Island.[30] Mireille produced heavy rainfall on Okinawa, totaling 258\u00a0mm (10.2\u00a0in), which allowed water restrictions there to be lifted for the rest of the year.[2] The precipitation fell in a short amount of time; 11\u00a0mm (0.43\u00a0in) dropped in just 10\u00a0minutes, and 34\u00a0mm (1.3\u00a0in) dropped in an hour, both at Naha. Waves reached 13.7\u00a0m (45\u00a0ft) along the coast of Okinawa. On Kume Island, the combination of high waves and tides produced damaging storm surge. The storm flooded 74\u00a0houses and damaged another 37. Mireille damaged roads in two locations, while winds damaged 157\u00a0power lines,[30] which cut communications to 3,123\u00a0people.[31] The storm also left heavy damage to the agriculture and forest industries.[30] In the region, Mireille caused 44\u00a0flights to be canceled. Two people were injured on Okinawa, and overall damage in the prefecture totaled \u00a51.5\u00a0billion (US$11.4\u00a0million).[nb 4][30] In Kyushu, the heavy rainfall caused flooding and landslides,[33] which buried several houses in Miyazaki Prefecture and forced 75\u00a0people to evacuate.[34] The high wind knocked over many cypress or cedar trees, totaling 22,529 hectares (55,670 acres) and accounting for \u00a564\u00a0billion (US$530\u00a0million) in damage in \u014cita Prefecture alone.[35][nb 4] Damage was heaviest near Nagasaki, where 16\u00a0people were killed,[12] including five after a warehouse collapsed during the storm.[36] A construction worker in nearby Isahaya was killed when the winds struck him with a prebuilt hut,[37] and airborne debris killed five people in Kumamoto Prefecture and seven in Fukuoka Prefecture.[13][38] Throughout Kyushu, about 2\u00a0million people lost power.[12] High winds and waves in Kagoshima Prefecture overturned several cars, killing one person in \u014cshima.[39] Throughout Kyushu, about 2\u00a0million people lost power.[12] On nearby Shikoku island, high winds and rains caused \u00a54.7\u00a0billion (US$35.7\u00a0million) in damage in Tokushima,[nb 4] mostly related to fisheries, crops, and houses.[40] A record storm surge, in conjunction with high winds, damaged a school in Sakaide,[41] as well as a floating pier and coastal road in nearby Ehime Prefecture. Rough surf swept away a woman in Matsuyama.[42] The storm track brought Mireille west of the most populated island of Honshu, limiting damage there compared to Kyushu.[12] At Misawa Air Base, the strong winds knocked over trees and blew off the roofs of several warehouses, and also knocked off storage sheds off their foundation. Ahead of the storm, advance warning allowed the American military to shelter aircraft and warn the population. Damage was estimated between $500,000\u2013$1.5\u00a0million.[2] Two of Mazda's loading docks in Hiroshima were completely destroyed, affecting American inventories of 1992 Mazda 929's until the end of November 1991.[43] Also in the city, 1.1\u00a0million residents, or 80% of households, lost power due to winds and storm surge.[28] In Yamaguchi Prefecture, the Takeda Pharmaceutical Company was flooded with 0.6\u00a0m (2.0\u00a0ft) of waters, forcing workers to move to another plant in the United States.[44] The strong winds and waves damaged the Itsukushima Shrine near Hiroshima and Kenroku-en northwest of Tokyo.[45] In Okayama Prefecture, salt spray damaged railways and shut down lines for three days.[46] High winds in Naka-ku collapsed scaffolding from a parking garage, and another damaged scaffolding nearby forced a road to shut down.[47] There were extensive crop losses in northern Honshu.[7] In Toyama Prefecture, the winds destroyed 192\u00a0greenhouses and exasperated a fire that caused further crop damage.[48] Striking Hokkaido with much of its former intensity, Mireille produced strong winds across the island. Hakodate Airport reported a peak gust of 124\u00a0km/h (77\u00a0mph),[17] and the highest sustained wind was 79\u00a0km/h (49\u00a0mph) in Urakawa.[49] Along the coast, waves reached 7.7\u00a0m (25\u00a0ft) high at Matsumae,[17] killing one person in Kushiro who was mooring his boat.[50] Light rains occurred on the island, reaching 75\u00a0mm (3.0\u00a0in) in Hidaka.[49] In Hakodate, the storm damaged five buildings, and about 3,000\u00a0houses lost power.[17] There was scattered roof damage across Hokkaido, and flying glass injured one person.[51]"

Following the storm, insurance companies paid $6\u00a0billion to policy holders in Japan, which was a world record related to wind damage; this was surpassed less than a year later by Hurricane Andrew striking Florida.[19] The typhoon was the costliest non-Atlantic hurricane until Storm Daniel in 2023; it remained the costliest non-Atlantic tropical cyclone, adjusted for infaltion, until Typhoon Doksuri in 2023.[53] Due to the severity of damage and loss of life caused by the storm, the name Mireille was retired and replaced with Melissa.[54]"

        "content": " Typhoon Yunya, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Diding, was a strong tropical cyclone whose landfall in the Philippines coincided with the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo. A small tropical cyclone, Yunya rapidly developed from a tropical disturbance near East Samar on June\u00a011. By June\u00a013 the storm had reached typhoon status as it moved west-northwest near the Philippines. Yunya attained its peak intensity the following day with estimated winds of 145\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph);[nb 1] however, strong wind shear soon impacted the typhoon and caused it to rapidly decay. The storm struck southern Luzon early on June\u00a015 as a minimal typhoon before moving over the South China Sea later that day. After turning north and weakening to a tropical depression, the system brushed the southern tip of Taiwan on June\u00a016 before dissipating the following day. Across the Philippines, Yunya produced heavy rains that triggered significant flooding. Hundreds of homes and several bridges were washed away by swollen rivers. Six people were killed as a direct result of the storm, 2,013\u00a0homes were destroyed, and 24 others were damaged. Although the storm itself caused significant damage, the worst effects were related to the system's heavy rains mixing with volcanic ash from Mount Pinatubo, creating massive lahars that killed 320\u00a0people."

        "content": "On June\u00a011, 1991, a tropical disturbance developed east of East Samar. Situated to the southwest of a tropical upper tropospheric trough, the system experienced low wind shear and gradually intensified as it moved northwestward.[1] The following day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began monitoring the system as a tropical depression.[2][nb 2] At 15:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a012, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the depression.[nb 3] Around this time, the storm began a period rapid development and a tiny central dense overcast formed. At 18:15\u00a0UTC, the USNS Spica sailed directly through the storm, measuring a barometric pressure of 989.5\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.22\u00a0inHg) and peak winds of 110\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph). Although Yunya was already a tropical storm, the JTWC did not issue their first advisory on the system until early on June\u00a013, at which time they assigned it the name Yunya.[1] Based on the measurements provided by the USNS Spica, the storm was analyzed as a midget cyclone with a gale diameter of 150\u00a0km (93\u00a0mi).[1] Initially, the storm tracked northwestward at 20\u00a0km/h (10\u00a0mph).[5] Throughout June 13, subsidence around the periphery of Yunya allowed the system to develop good outflow. As a result, the storm attained typhoon status later that day before strengthening slowed. By June 14, Yunya turned towards the west-northwest in response to a subtropical ridge to the north. Following this turn, the typhoon attained its peak intensity as a Category\u00a03-equivalent typhoon on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale with winds estimated at 195\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph).[1] Around the same time, the JMA assessed Yunya to have been slightly weaker, with peak winds estimated at 150\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph) along with a pressure of 950\u00a0mbar (950\u00a0hPa; 28\u00a0inHg).[6][nb 4] Within hours of reaching its peak strength on June\u00a014, strong wind shear associated with a second subtropical ridge over Asia impacted the typhoon. Due to the system's small size, the shear was able to disrupt the cyclone's core and cause rapid weakening as it approached southern Luzon. Around 00:00\u00a0UTC on June 15, Yunya made landfall just north of Dingalan Bay as a minimal typhoon and weakened to a tropical storm shortly thereafter. As the storm moved across Luzon, Mount Pinatubo, a volcano in the Zambales Mountains on the island's western side, was experiencing a major eruption\u2014the second-largest to occur during the 20th century. Due to Yunya's circulation, the massive cloud of ash produced by the eruption was moistened and redistributed over the Philippines instead of blowing out to sea, greatly exacerbating the impact of the event.[1] Later on June\u00a015, Yunya emerged into the South China Sea as a minimal tropical storm. Persistent wind shear prevented the system from strengthening and the storm ultimately degraded into a tropical depression by June 16. Having turned north within a break in the subtropical ridge, Yunya brushed the southern tip of Taiwan late on June\u00a016 before dissipating the following day within the westerlies.[1]"

        "content": "On June\u00a014, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration raised storm warnings in advance of Typhoon Yunya for much of Luzon and areas south of Manila. With Mount Pinatubo having already erupted once by this time, there were fears that the storm's heavy rains, combined with ash from the volcano, would create massive lahars capable of burying towns 40\u00a0km (25\u00a0mi) away from Pinatubo.[8] As a result, 60,000\u00a0individuals were evacuated.[9] Landslides on June\u00a014 destroyed bridges in Santa Fe and homes in nearby Castillejos were washed away.[8] By June\u00a015, air-borne ash combined with the typhoon's rainfall, resulting in widespread travel disruptions and structural collapses. The mixture also made it appear as through it was nighttime during the middle of the day, prompting concern from residents.[8] The wind from the typhoon carried ash within 160\u00a0km (100\u00a0mi) from Pinatubo, including to Manila,[10] which prompted most of the airports in the country to close and Philippine Airlines to cancel all domestic and international flights through June\u00a019.[11] Low to mid-level winds and heavy rains from the storm contributed to widespread tephra falling over an area of 7,500\u00a0km2 (2,895\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of central and western Luzon. Heavy rains also resulted in lahars along mountains between the Gumain River to the Sacobia River and between Sacobia River to the O'Donnell River. These lahars inundated crops and homes, especially along the Abacan River. As a result of the lahars, some buildings and all bridges in Angeles City were destroyed.[9] Moreover, 320\u00a0people were killed and 279 others were injured.[12] The United States Geological Survey believes that the death toll from the lahars would have been far lower if not for Yunya.[9] In addition to the lahars, widespread flooding also took place in Luzon as rivers overtopped their banks. Elsewhere, a person was killed by debris in Manila.[13] Across Olongapo City, power was knocked out,[14] and one person was killed after the roof of a bus terminal collapsed under the weight of ash and rain. Two people died and three others were injured in an accident near Clark Air Base,[13] where power was also knocked out.[15] Along the Sacobia River in Pampanga, at least 170\u00a0homes were washed away due to the storm. The Abacan bridge spanning the Abacan River collapsed with a truck carrying three people, and an empty car. It is unknown whether the three people survived.[13] Two people were killed and at least 12 warranted evacuation in Angeles City when the roof of a Philippine Rabbit Bus Lines-operated bus terminal collapsed, when 100 people were sheltering there to ride out the storm.[16] Civil defense officials confirmed that five other bridges collapsed in Pampanga and Zambales provinces. All crops were destroyed throughout Iriga.[13] Overall, 2,013\u00a0homes were destroyed and 24 others were damaged during the passage of the typhoon.[17] A total of 2,035\u00a0families or 10,185\u00a0people were evacuated to shelters.[18] Excluding from lahars, six people were killed by Yunya.[13][8][16]"

An area of disturbed weather formed within the Western Pacific monsoon trough during early September\u00a01991. The disturbance was upgraded into a tropical depression on September\u00a010 after an increase in organization. Tracking northwest due to a weak subtropical ridge to its north, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm at 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a011. Later that day, Kinna was upgraded into a severe tropical storm. Following the development of a poorly defined eye, Kinna was upgraded into a typhoon on September\u00a012. The cyclone turned north in response to a trough and passed through Okinawa as a minimal typhoon. Typhoon Kinna obtained peak intensity on September\u00a013, but thereafter, Kinna accelerated north-northeastward toward Kyushu, passing over the island that day at peak intensity. Typhoon Kinna rapidly transitioned into an extratropical low as it tracked along the northern coast of Honshu. Its extratropical remnants were last noted on the evening of September\u00a016. Even though most of the damage occurred on Kyushu and on western Honshu, the typhoon was the most destructive tropical cyclone to strike Okinawa since 1987, and was also the first of typhoon intensity to pass directly over the island since Typhoon Vera in 1986. Nationwide, 11\u00a0people were killed and 94\u00a0others suffered injuries. Nearly 50,000\u00a0customers lost power. Close to 150\u00a0domestic flights were cancelled, which left 26,000\u00a0travelers stranded. A total of 382\u00a0houses were destroyed while 2,586\u00a0others were flooded.

On September\u00a08, synoptic data revealed that an area of low pressure was developing southwest of Guam. When satellite imagery showed an increase in convection near the low's circulation center, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started tracking the system on September\u00a09. An increase in organization prompted the JTWC to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the morning of September\u00a010.[1] At noon, both the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and the JTWC upgraded the system into a tropical depression.[2][nb 1] At the time, the depression was located approximately 460\u00a0km (285\u00a0mi) west-northwest of Guam.[4] The depression initially tracked northwest due to a weak subtropical ridge to its north.[1] At 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a011, the JTWC upgraded the depression into Tropical Storm Kinna,[5] with the JMA doing the same later that morning.[6][nb 2] At 18:00\u00a0UTC, the JMA classified Kinna as a severe tropical storm.[2] The development of a poorly defined eye within a central dense overcast prompted the JTWC to upgrade Kinna into a typhoon on the morning of September\u00a012,[1] although the JMA did not follow suit until 18:00\u00a0UTC.[6] Also on September\u00a012, a mid-tropospheric trough deepened over the East China Sea, which split the ridge near 125th meridian east. In response, Typhoon Kinna turned northward toward the break in the ridge and tracked across Okinawa. Shortly after becoming a typhoon, the eye crossed densely populated southern Okinawa.[1] At 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a013, the JTWC and JMA estimated that Kinna attained peak winds of 170 and 145\u00a0km/h (105 and 90\u00a0mph), with the latter estimating a minimum barometric pressure of 955\u00a0mbar (28.2\u00a0inHg).[2] After recurvature, Kinna accelerated north-northeastward toward Kyushu as it maintained its intensity. Later on September\u00a013, the typhoon's eyewall passed over the cities of Nagasaki and Sasebo on Kyushu. Kinna rapidly lost tropical characteristics as it tracked along the northern coast of Honshu.[1] The JMA declared Kinna an extratropical cyclone early on September\u00a014,[6] with the JTWC doing the same several hours later.[1] Its extratropical remnants were last witnessed on the evening of September\u00a016 by the JMA.[6]"

When the storm passed through southern Okinawa, a minimum surface pressure of 958\u00a0mbar (28.3\u00a0inHg) was measured at Kadena Air Base, where sustained winds of 152\u00a0km/h (94\u00a0mph) and gusts of 177\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph) were also recorded. Nearby, winds gusting up to 175\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph) occurred in Naha. Near where the storm made landfall, winds of 151\u00a0km/h (94\u00a0mph) were measured in Maebaru.[1] As a result of the JTWC's accurate long-range forecasts, preparations to limit the amount of damage on Okinawa were made well in advance of Kinna's approach. Despite\nthe strong winds, damage to United States military installations on Okinawa was minimal. Nevertheless, Kinna was the most destructive tropical cyclone to strike Okinawa since 1987, and the first of typhoon intensity to pass directly across the island since Typhoon Vera in 1986.[1] A 14-year-old middle school student was slightly injured due to broken glass.[12] All morning flights from Naha were canceled and afternoon flights were delayed.[13] \nOffshore, a boat capsized, which left one fisherman dead and two others initially missing.[14] Prefecture-wide, two people were hurt and power lines were downed in 571\u00a0places.

An area of convection was first observed on July\u00a013 within the vicinity of Yap. A tropical depression developed the next day. While initially tracking westward, the system slowly deepened, becoming Tropical Storm Amy on July\u00a016. After briefly turning northwestward, Amy intensified into a typhoon on July\u00a017. Continuing to intensify as it tracked through the Luzon Strait, Amy reached its peak intensity of 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph) on July\u00a018.[nb 1] That evening, the typhoon began to show signs of weakening, although it was still believed to have been a typhoon when it made landfall in the province of Guangdong on July\u00a019, becoming the strongest tropical cyclone to hit the province in 22\u00a0years. Once inland, the storm rapidly weakened, and by late on July\u00a020, had dissipated completely. The storm's large size resulted in flooding, and high winds blew ash from erupting Mount Pinatubo across the Philippines. Around 7,000\u00a0people were forced to evacuate from their homes due to the threat of mudflows and approximately 500\u00a0homes were destroyed. One person in the country was killed.

        "content": "Typhoon Amy originated from an area of persistent convection that was first noted by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) on the morning of July\u00a013, 1991. Increased convection, slight pressure falls within a 24-hour period at Yap, and the lack of vertical wind shear led to the issuance of a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert during the late morning hours of July\u00a014 by the JTWC.[1] Two hours later, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the system into a tropical depression.[2][nb 3] Although the overall cloud organization remained poor, deep convection persisted and a second alert was issued at 10:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a015.[1] The JTWC classified the system as a tropical depression eight hours later.[4] At the time of the upgrade, the depression was located about 670\u00a0km (415\u00a0mi) north-northwest of Yap.[5] Despite the JTWC suggesting that significant deepening was unlikely,[1] the depression steadily intensified as it tracked westward. The JTWC upgraded the depression into Tropical Storm Amy at 00:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a016, with the JMA following suit six hours later.[4][7][nb 4] That evening, the JMA reported that Amy had strengthened into a severe tropical storm.[2] Meanwhile, Amy turned northwestward for about 18\u00a0hours on July\u00a016 as a mid-tropsheric shortwave trough passed to its north that temporarily eroded a subtropical ridge to its north. Following the passing of the trough, strong subsidence allowed for the ridge to re-strengthen,[1] resulting in a more westerly track by July\u00a017.[5] The JTWC upgraded Amy into a typhoon at 06:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a017; the JMA did the same at noon.[4] At the time, the typhoon was located roughly 1,000\u00a0km (620\u00a0mi) east-southeast of Kaohsiung.[5] Amy began to intensify at a faster rate on July\u00a017 as it traversed the Luzon Strait.[1] At 00:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a018, the JTWC increased the intensity of Amy to 195\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph), equivalent to a Category\u00a03 hurricane on the United States-based Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (SSHWS). Later that day, both the JTWC and JMA agreed that Amy attained its peak intensity, with the JTWC estimating winds of 235\u00a0km/h (145\u00a0mph), equal to Category 4 status on the SSHWS, and the JMA estimating winds of 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph).[4] The typhoon also began to unexpectedly accelerate as it crossed the Bashi Channel.[1][5] By the evening of July\u00a018, upper-level outflow became more restricted, signifying a weakening trend.[1] On July\u00a019, Amy made landfall near Shantou;[5] the JTWC and JMA estimated winds of 195\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph) and 145\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph) respectively at the time of landfall.[4] Upon making landfall, the system dissipated rapidly over the mountains in southeastern China. The JTWC ceased tracking the system at 00:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a020,[1] with the JMA following suit 18\u00a0hours later.[2]"

        "content": "Due to the large size of the circulation of Amy, volcanic ash from erupting Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines was blown towards Manila, prompting the closure of Manila International Airport. Volcanic debris from Mount Pinatubo's slopes loosened by heavy rain destroyed approximately 500\u00a0houses throughout the country,[5] including 300 in Floridablanca, 50 in Santa Rita, and 130 in Concepcion.[9] About 7,000\u00a0people were forced to flee their homes in eight towns across the Pampanga and Tarlac provinces due to the threat of mudflows,[10] including at least 1,200 in Tarlac.[11] Seven people there were rescued from floodwaters near a river.[9] Floodwaters from the Abacan River resulted in the destruction of three bridges.[12] A 43-year-old man died when his jeep fell into an embankment on Mindoro Island.[10] Offshore, a 460 tonnes (505 short tons) ship Emerald capsized, resulting in the rescue of 83\u00a0passengers and 21\u00a0crewmen in addition to two deaths and two others missing.[13] In the Taiwan Strait, a Cypriot ship Blue River with 31 crew members on board vanished on high seas. None of the crew survived.[1] The outer fringes of the typhoon lashed Taiwan, resulting in high winds and triggering landslides that blocked roads. The Kaohsiung International Airport was closed due to the storm. Strong winds snapped power lines, leaving 460,000\u00a0households without electricity.[14] A man was killed when his car rammed a truck in heavy rain while two fisherman caught in high waves were presumed to have drowned.[15] Typhoon Amy became the strongest typhoon to hit Guandong in 22\u00a0years.[16] Heavy rains spread across eastern Guangdong, peaking at 228\u00a0mm (9.0\u00a0in) in Fengshun County,[17] while also providing drought relief to the area.[18] The typhoon also inflicted heavy damage across the province, with the hardest hit areas located near Shantou, where the storm made landfall. According to media reports, 99\u00a0people were killed and 5,239 others were injured. About 400,000\u00a0homes were damaged or destroyed,[5] and over 200,000\u00a0ha (494,210 acres) of farmland was flooded.[19] A total of 214\u00a0bridges, 408\u00a0boats, 792\u00a0km (492\u00a0mi) of roads, and many irrigation facilities were damaged by the storm. Monetary damage was estimated at \u00a523.6\u00a0billion (US$4.42\u00a0billion). The airports of Shantou and Xiamen were forced to close.[5] Following the storm, insurance companies provided \u00a5100\u00a0million (US$18.7\u00a0million) in compensation.[20] Across southern Fujian, at least 30\u00a0people were injured and 1,300\u00a0homes were demolished. More than 6.9\u00a0million trees, including 6.2\u00a0million banana trees, were damaged, while over 10,000\u00a0ha (25,000 acres) of paddy fields and 13,000\u00a0ha (32,000 acres) of sugar-cane were flooded. A 20 tonnes (22 short tons) fishing vessel sank. Losses in Zhangzhou, the region of Fujian worst affected by Amy, were estimated at \u00a52.4\u00a0billion (US$450\u00a0million).[5] Nationwide, the typhoon destroyed 38,000\u00a0homes.[21] Typhoon Amy was the second typhoon to strike the country in a week, following Typhoon Zeke; later that month, Tropical Storm Brenda would also hit the country, resulting in further destruction across southeastern China.[22] In Hong Kong, a Hurricane No. 1 signal was issued on the afternoon of July\u00a018 when Typhoon Amy was about 780\u00a0km (485\u00a0mi) to the east. Early the next day, it was raised to a No. 3 signal. The lowest sea-level pressure of 994\u00a0mbar (29.4\u00a0inHg) was recorded at the Hong Kong Royal Observatory shortly before landfall in mainland China. Sha Tin recorded a peak rainfall storm total of 103.5\u00a0mm (4.07\u00a0in), of which 60.5\u00a0mm (2.38\u00a0in) fell within a 24-hour period. Tai Mo Shan recorded a peak wind gust of 104\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph). Scaffoldings at North Point collapsed due to strong winds, and a man in Sai Kung was injured after he was blown off a ladder. Two small crafts were damaged at Chai Wan and Stanley. Ferry service from Hong Kong to Shantou was cancelled.[5]"

Increased convection associated with the disturbance was first monitored by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) at 06:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a06, 1991. Following evidence that the disturbance had developed a low pressure center, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert early on July\u00a09.[2] Two hours later, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the system into a tropical depression.[3] After a steady increase in deep convection near the center of the system, the JTWC declared it a tropical depression at noon on July\u00a09.[2] Tracking west-northwest at 13\u00a0km/h (8.1\u00a0mph) under the influence of a subtropical ridge to the north,[2][4] the depression made landfall 50\u00a0km (30\u00a0mi) south-southwest of Manila.[5] The depression tracked across the Luzon as it accelerated to the northwest in response to a surge in the southwesterly monsoonal flow over the South China Sea and emerged into the South China Sea on July\u00a010,[2][4] when it was upgraded into a tropical storm by the JTWC and JMA, with the former naming it Zeke.[5][7][nb 3][nb 4] Reports from ships in the South China Sea indicated a highly asymmetric wind profile, with the radius of 55\u00a0km/h (35\u00a0mph) winds extending over 290\u00a0mi (465\u00a0km) southeast of the center, but less than 115\u00a0mi (185\u00a0km) to the northwest, making its structure akin to a large monsoon depression. Despite the Navy Global Environmental Model and in turn the JTWC calling for recurvature,[2] Zeke reverted to a largely westward track.[4] On the morning of July\u00a011, Zeke was upgraded into a severe tropical storm by the JMA.[3] Twenty-four hours later, the JTWC declared the cyclone a typhoon.[5] Shortly before Zeke struck Hainan, the JTWC estimated that Zeke attained its peak intensity of 145\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph).[2] Meanwhile, the JMA estimated that Zeke obtained its peak wind speed of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 970\u00a0mbar (29\u00a0inHg).[3] Zeke weakened slightly after crossing the island,[2] with the JMA downgrading the system into a severe tropical storm on the morning of July\u00a013.[3] Later that day, Zeke moved onshore about 50\u00a0km (30\u00a0mi) northeast of Haiphong in Vietnam.[4] Weakening accelerated as it moved inland, and by midday on July\u00a014, the JTWC had ceased tracking the storm.[2] The JMA followed suit early the next day.[3]"

        "content": " Typhoon Jelawat, known in the Philippines as Tropical Storm Caloy, was a powerful typhoon that affected the Caroline Islands in March 2018. The third tropical storm and the first typhoon of the 2018 Pacific typhoon season, Jelawat originated as a tropical disturbance that struck the Federated States of Micronesia before organizing into a tropical depression on March 24. It further intensified into a tropical storm on the following day, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency, receiving the name Jelawat. Drifting northward, the storm remained unorganized while staying east of the Philippines, though environmental conditions became more favorable along its path. On March 29, Jelawat took an unexpected sharp turn east as it intensified into a typhoon. Upon shifting northeast, Jelawat rapidly intensified on March 30 due to low vertical wind shear and substantial outflow, peaking as a Category 4-equivalent super typhoon. Shortly afterward, the storm began to weaken as wind shear sharply increased, falling below typhoon strength on March 31. The storm transitioned into a subtropical cyclone on April 1, before dissipating on that same day. The tropical disturbance that later became Typhoon Jelawat flooded parts of the Federated States of Micronesia. Most of the impact occurred in Pohnpei, where a person died and another was injured from a landslide. Infrastructure was critically damaged and many homes were flooded throughout the island. After Jelawat had dissipated, its remnants produced rip currents that claimed the life of a woman in Guam. These remnants flowed into an atmospheric river that extended to California, flooding areas of the U.S. state. Traffic was disrupted among the San Francisco Bay Area and other areas, resulting in four injuries and one death. In response to the disaster in the Federated States of Micronesia, the country received assistance from the United States."

        "content": "During a strengthening phase of the Madden\u2013Julian oscillation,[1] a broad tropical disturbance centered at Pohnpei was observed on March 16, 2018, with widespread thunderstorm activity\u2014or convection\u2014across the island, Kosrae, and nearby islands and atolls of the Federated States of Micronesia.[2] Nascent rainbands were later revealed wrapping around the system's defined low-level circulation. By situating over low vertical wind shear and very warm sea surface temperatures, the tropical disturbance underwent further development, with diverging winds aloft and poleward outflow also aiding the system.[3] Moreover, an equatorial Rossby wave reinforced humidity in the atmosphere, facilitating the process.[4] For the following days, thunderstorms continued to burst over the system's partially-exposed center, though the bulk of it was displaced to the north.[5] By March 24, the system was marked as a tropical depression by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA).[6][nb 1] The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)[nb 2] followed suit shortly afterward, giving it the numeral identifier 03W, citing the persistent deep convection to the northeast of the storm's center and strong outflow amplified by the mid-latitude westerlies.[8] The following day, the JMA designated the system a tropical storm, and assigned the newly-formed cyclone the name Jelawat.[6] The JTWC however, still retained the storm's status as a tropical depression at the time.[9] Throughout March 26, moderate wind shear displaced disorganized and fragmented convection to the north of the circulation, hindering the storm's ability to organize.[10] At 00:00\u00a0UTC of March 27, the system crossed the eastern boundary of the area of warning responsibility of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration, prompting the agency to assign the local name Caloy.[11]\nConvection strengthened over the northwest quadrant of the fully-exposed center; vertical wind shear was subdued by outflow, allowing for additional intensification. Initially moving west-northwestward, the storm decelerated significantly after a subtropical ridge extended to the north of the system.[12] With time, convection bloomed over the system, obscuring the circulation.[13] Tracking towards a region of favorable wind shear,[14] Jelawat moved north along the 135\u00b0E boundary of the Philippine Area of Responsibility, before exiting early March 28.[11] Following further consolidation of convection with banding features over all quadrants, the JTWC upgraded Jelawat to a tropical storm.[15] At 06:00\u00a0UTC, Jelawat acquired severe tropical storm status, with 10-minute sustained winds of 95\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph) assessed by the JMA.[6] With the storm being by the western side of a weakening ridge, a broadening central dense overcast emerged.[16] An eye was indicated through microwave imaging shortly thereafter;[17] the irregular eye was detected on satellite imagery by early March 29.[18]  Also around that time, the JMA estimated that Jelawat had intensified into a typhoon.[6] Contrary to forecasts, the storm made a sharp turn east;[4] Jelawat had entered a saddle point between subtropical ridges to the east and west.[19] Jelawat continued to stockpile convection within the formative eye while also maintaining substantial poleward outflow boosted by a subtropical westerly jet; accordingly, the JTWC classified the storm as a typhoon.[20] Drifting northeastward in favorable conditions on March 30, the storm underwent explosive intensification, and exhibited a sharp 19-kilometer-wide (12\u00a0mi) eye surrounded by symmetric deep convection.[21] By 12:00\u00a0UTC, Jelawat attained its peak intensity, with 10-minute maximum sustained winds of 195\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph) and the lowest barometric pressure of 915\u00a0hPa (27.02\u00a0inHg) assessed by the JMA.[6] The JTWC estimated 1-minute sustained winds of 240\u00a0km/h (150\u00a0mph), re-classifying Jelawat as a super typhoon.[22][nb 3] The eye had shrunk by almost half its initial size, and despite the conducive conditions, Jelawat was approaching an area of high vertical wind shear associated with the subtropical jet.[24] Furthermore, sea surface temperature reduction and dry air began to impact the system as well.[25] By March 31, Jelawat's structure rapidly deteriorated from the unfavorable conditions.[26] Convection later became very disorganized, with the deepest of it constricted to the northeast of the center.[27] By 18:00\u00a0UTC, the JMA declared that Jelawat had weakened into a tropical storm.[6] While passing north of Pagan on April 1, the ragged circulation interacted with the baroclinic zone and began possessing frontal characteristics. As such, the JTWC assessed the cyclone as a subtropical storm, and ceased issuing advisories on the system.[28] The JMA continued to monitor the system until it had dissipated by 12:00 UTC.[6]"

The downpour along with high waves inundated and damaged roads,[29][30] likewise to overflowing rivers. Eleven bridges and culverts were damaged, and throughout the events, a landslide warning and six flood statements were announced by the island's local Weather Service Office.[30] A number of homes were flooded in every municipality on the island.[31] Nearly 250 houses were either damaged or destroyed, and critical damage was done to infrastructure as a result of the heavy rainfall.[32] The NWS instated a tropical storm warning for Kayangel and Koror of Palau and Ngulu of Yap State on March 25;[33] the warning for Koror was soon canceled the next day by the National Emergency Management Office of Palau, as Jelawat's winds were toned down to 25 to 40\u00a0km/h (15 to 25\u00a0mph), with gusts of 50\u00a0km/h (30\u00a0mph). In addition, 25 to 51\u00a0mm (1 to 2\u00a0in) of rain fell over Palau. Dangerous levels of sea and surf conditions were reported, though storm surge was not a threat to the island nation.[34] Jelawat poured 149\u00a0mm (5.87\u00a0in) of rain over Yap as the system passed to the south throughout March 24\u201329, keeping the island chain under the influence of its outer rainbands. Chuuk State also received heavy showers, causing minor flooding of roadways.[29]"

The high surf advisories across the archipelago were lifted, when Jelawat was rapidly weakening from vertical wind shear, and no longer posed a threat towards the islands.[36] The remnants of Jelawat produced surfs of 7.3\u00a0m (24\u00a0ft) off Saipan and 5.5\u00a0m (18\u00a0ft) off Ritidian Point.[37] Nevertheless, no damage from the effects of Jelawat was reported in the Northern Mariana Islands.[38] On April 3, a woman in Guam drowned after strong surfs combined with rip currents stranded her in water.[31][39] She was rescued along with two other swimmers who were also stranded, but was later pronounced dead.[39] Additionally, Jelawat induced a surge of Indo-Pacific man-of-war sightings across the east and west coasts of Guam, though no one was reported to have been stung by them.[40]"

The opener between the San Francisco Giants and Los Angeles Dodgers was rained out.[43] The Department of Water Resources monitored the Oroville Dam, though by the end of the heavy rain, the department did not need to utilize a partially rebuilt spillway, which was destroyed back in February last year and led to a crisis.[44] The Merced River rose 1.2\u00a0m (4\u00a0ft) above flood stage, flooding campgrounds and also meadows and roadways. Flooding also occurred along the Truckee River near Lake Tahoe.[45]  In Loleta, heavy rain produced a sinkhole that swallowed a car, injuring a woman.[44][46] Towns nearby the Russian River experienced nearly 130\u00a0mm (5\u00a0in) of rain. A traffic accident in Highway 4 in Pittsburg injured two people. Inundation, landslides, and erosions caused roads at Sonoma County to be closed, which had downed trees and power lines.[43] Two people along with a dog were rescued from a car that was washed out on a flooded road.[42] About 30 traffic accidents took place through Highway 101 in the county, although no one was seriously injured. At Sonoma Valley, a power outage affected customers of the Pacific Gas and Electric Company, though the utility stated that it had extra crews in seven Bay Area counties to respond to the power disruption.[47] At Bodega Bay, 150\u00a0mm (6\u00a0in) of rainfall was recorded in a day, more than the total rainfall of last month.[42] A power outage was reported in Walnut Creek. In Highway 17 between Los Gatos and Altamont, about ten traffic accidents were reported, causing one minor injury. Another incident in Highway 4 was reported when a truck spun out on eastbound at Port Chicago, closing three lanes of traffic and entangling the East Bay freeway. In Grizzly Peak Boulevard, an emergency crew was called when a car fell 30\u00a0m (100\u00a0ft) off an embankment; their efforts were hindered by fog alongside rain and wind.[48] A woman, who was previously reported missing, was found dead near the vehicle about 120\u00a0m (400\u00a0ft) down a hill.[49]"

A car in this area was picked up, thrown 300\u00a0yd (270\u00a0m), and totaled. The occupants in the car, a police chief and his son, escaped without any injuries.[20] The tornado then moved directly through Hutchinson at around 5:30\u00a0pm CT. An icehouse, warehouse, houses, barns and outbuildings were obliterated, and about 50\u00a0city dwellings, buildings, and street carnival concessions were damaged. Additionally, many windows were blown in or broken; chimneys, billboards, signs, and power and communication lines were blown down; cars and growing crops were damaged or destroyed; and hundreds of trees were uprooted.[11] Two homes sustained low-end F3 damage and debris from the town was strewn along MN 7.[14][20][21] Most of the town was left without power after the storm as well. The tornado then moved northeastward, heavily damaging several farms north of Silver Lake, possibly lifting before reaching Wright County.[20] Heavy rain and hail continued with the storm before the tornado touched down again in Hennepin County at around 6:30 pm CT. It intensified as it approached MN 55 and became a violent F4 tornado as it passed near Hamel, about 6\u00a0mi (9.7\u00a0km) west of Robbinsdale. As it reached the highway, it threw a home 200\u00a0yd (180\u00a0m) before leveling it, severely injuring the elderly woman in the house. She would later die at the hospital; her nephew and foster daughter were also injured.[22][23][24] The tornado also heavily damaged or destroyed other homes, a garage, and several other structures.[21] The tornado then weakened, doing less severe damage, before restrengthening to an intense F3 tornado as it struck Brooklyn Center at around 7 pm CT. A trailer house was picked and thrown three blocks before being destroyed. Seven homes were also destroyed and clocks were stopped at 7:01 pm as the power went out. A boy was injured in the town as well.[23] The tornado then crossed over into Anoka County northwest of Spring Lake Park, where more damage and destruction occurred and clocks were stopped at 7:03 pm CT. After either briefly weakening or possibly lifting, the tornado demolished several homes near the intersection of Foley Boulevard and US 10 (now County Road 10). Nine people, including seven children, were injured in one of the homes. The tornado then finally weakened before dissipating shortly thereafter.[11][15] Across this portion of the path, the tornado damaged or destroyed 50 homes as well as many other buildings.[14] The tornado family caused $5\u00a0million in damage killed one person and injured 20\u00a0others. The same storm also produced a tornado report east of St. Paul at around 7:45\u00a0pm CT, but that turned out to be a just a well-developed funnel cloud that never touched the ground.[11][15]"

A small tornado was also reported in Brown's Lake, but it was not confirmed.[25] A line of storms also brought wind and hail from Elliott to Morton Mills, severely damaging a barn and a house with minor damage to numerous other buildings, including extensive breakage of glass by hail. Electric service was also disrupted, and one person was injured. Another tornado was also reported near Elliott, but the event was not deemed to have not been the cause of the damage in the town.[26] The strongest and most destructive line of storms produced hail ranging from .5\u20131.75 inches (1.3\u20134.4\u00a0cm) in diameter and moved from McCallsburg to Cedar Rapids, Iowa. In McCallsburg, golf ball-size hail inflicted severe damage throughout the town. 387 window panes of glass were shattered at the McCallsburg consolidated school, and all the businesses south of Main Street had shattered windows. The Bethany Lutheran church, which was still under construction at the time, had 41 window panes shattered. Many roofs had holes in them, which allowed heavy rain to go through them and cause more damage.[26] The hail became even larger as the storm moved eastward away from McCallsburg and struck St. Anthony and Clemons. Described as being the size of oranges, the hail left baseball-size holes in numerous roofs in both towns. Considerable damage was also reported at Garwin, Toledo, Tama, Vining, Elberon, and Keystone. An 82-year-old man died due to overexertion in the storm.[26] Three more injuries also occurred: a man was severely burned by an electric line, and a woman and her child were hospitalized after being braised by hail. There was considerable damage to farm buildings, while minor damage was caused by falling trees all along the track of the storm. Hail damage was mainly to growing crops, but broken glass was also an issue in several towns. There was also mainly public utility line damage in Belle Plaine and Cedar Rapids.[11] There was also sporadic hail and wind damage in parts of Oklahoma and Kansas, as well as Bloomfield, Montana. This included Ellis County, Oklahoma, where hail was reportedly as much as a foot deep, while winds damaged a church in Arnett, Oklahoma. A lightning strike in southern Barber County, Kansas, about 6 miles (9.7\u00a0km) west of Hardtner, also caused a fire which destroyed a portion of a shed, along with the hay inside.[11]"

        "content": " Typhoon Vera, also known as the Isewan Typhoon (\u4f0a\u52e2\u6e7e\u53f0\u98a8, Ise-wan Taif\u016b), was an exceptionally intense tropical cyclone that struck Japan in September\u00a01959, becoming the strongest and deadliest typhoon on record to make landfall on the country, as well as the only one to do so as a Category 5 equivalent storm. The storm's intensity resulted in catastrophic damage of unparalleled severity and extent, and was a major setback to the Japanese economy, which was still recovering from World War II. In the aftermath of Vera, Japan's disaster management and relief systems were significantly reformed, and the typhoon's effects would set a benchmark for future storms striking the country. Vera developed on September\u00a020 between Guam and Chuuk State, and initially tracked westward before taking a more northerly course, reaching tropical storm strength the following day. By this point Vera had assumed a more westerly direction of movement and had begun to rapidly intensify, and reached its peak intensity on September\u00a023 with maximum sustained winds equivalent to that of a modern-day Category\u00a05 hurricane. With little change in strength, Vera curved and accelerated northward, resulting in a landfall on September\u00a026 near Shionomisaki on Honshu. Atmospheric wind patterns caused the typhoon to briefly emerge into the Sea of Japan before recurving eastward and moving ashore Honshu for a second time. Movement over land greatly weakened Vera, and after reentering the North Pacific Ocean later that day, Vera transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September\u00a027; these remnants continued to persist for an additional two days. Though Vera was accurately forecast and its track into Japan was well anticipated, limited coverage of telecommunications, combined with lack of urgency from Japanese media and the storm's intensity, greatly inhibited potential evacuation and disaster mitigation processes. Rainfall from the storm's outer rainbands began to cause flooding in river basins well in advance of the storm's landfall. Upon moving ashore Honshu, the typhoon brought a strong storm surge that destroyed numerous flood defense systems, inundating coastal regions and sinking ships. Damage totals from Vera reached US$600\u00a0million (equivalent to US$6.27 billion in 2023). The number of fatalities caused by Vera remain discrepant, though current estimates indicate that the typhoon caused more than 5,000\u00a0deaths, making it one of the deadliest typhoons in Japanese history. It also injured almost 39,000 people and displaced about 1.6 million.[2] Relief efforts were initiated by Japanese and American governments immediately following Typhoon Vera. Due to the inundation caused by the typhoon, localized epidemics were reported, including those of dysentery and tetanus. The spread of disease and blocking debris slowed the ongoing relief efforts. Due to the unprecedented damage and loss of life following Vera, the National Diet passed legislation in order to more efficiently assist affected regions and mitigate future disasters. This included the passage of the Disaster Countermeasures Basic Act in 1961, which set standards for Japanese disaster relief, including the establishment of the Central Disaster Prevention Council."

        "content": "The origin of Typhoon Vera can be traced back to a diffuse area of low pressure first incorporated into surface weather analysis early on September\u00a020. At the time, the disturbance was situated between Guam and Chuuk State.[3] Though the Joint Typhoon Warning Center\u00a0(JTWC) did not classify the incipient system as a tropical cyclone,[4] the Japan Meteorological Agency\u00a0(JMA) analyzed the disturbance to be a tropical depression as early as 0000\u00a0UTC that day.[5] Initially, the depression tracked westward,[3] but transiently shifted to a more northerly course on September\u00a021.[4] Late that day, a reconnaissance airplane dispatched by the JTWC to analyze the disturbance failed to reach its center due to engine failure. However, the data collected from the storm's periphery was sufficient for the warning center to classify the depression as a tropical storm at 1800\u00a0UTC that day.[3] Despite the flight data, the JMA had already determined the system to have been of at least tropical storm intensity six hours earlier.[5] As a result of the reclassification, the tropical storm was designated the name Vera by the JTWC.[6] At this point the tropical cyclone began to take a more westerly course.[4] Early on September\u00a022, an aircraft fix located Vera 175\u00a0km (110\u00a0mi) north-northeast of Saipan. Throughout the course of the day, periodic reconnaissance flights into the storm indicated that Vera had begun to rapidly intensify. By 1800\u00a0UTC later that day, data analysis concluded that the tropical cyclone had reached typhoon intensity.[3] Rapid intensification continued into the following day, as the typhoon's maximum sustained winds and barometric pressure quickly rose and fell, respectively.[4] Concurrently, Vera's size grew to a point at which it spanned 250\u00a0km (155\u00a0mi) across.[6] At 0600\u00a0UTC the following day, Vera achieved its minimum estimated barometric pressure at 895\u00a0mbar (hPa; 26.43\u00a0inHg). This indicated a 75\u00a0mbar (hPa; 2.22\u00a0inHg) pressure drop in the preceding 24\u00a0hours.[4] Upon reaching its minimum pressure, Vera was estimated to have attained winds equivalent to a Category\u00a05\u00a0\u2013 the highest classification possible on the modern-day Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale.[4][7] The typhoon's winds continued to increase before peaking at 1200\u00a0UTC on September\u00a023, when reconnaissance aircraft reported maximum sustained winds of 305\u00a0km/h (190\u00a0mph).[3][6] Upon peaking in wind speed, Vera was located 645\u00a0km (400\u00a0mi) northeast of Guam.[3] The tropical cyclone's ability to quickly intensify was attributed to conducive atmospheric divergence and highly sustainable sea surface temperatures.[6] Vera only maintained peak intensity for roughly twelve hours, but still remained a powerful tropical cyclone.[4] With very little change in strength, the typhoon tracked northwestward throughout September\u00a024. Due to the influence of a nearby high-pressure area, Vera began to gradually curve and rapidly accelerate northward towards Japan. At 0900\u00a0UTC on September\u00a026, Vera made its first landfall on Honshu, just west of Shionomisaki.[3] At the time, the typhoon had maximum sustained winds of 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph), equivalent to a Category 5 super typhoon, and a barometric pressure of 920\u00a0mbar (hPa; 27.17\u00a0inHg).[4] Vera traversed the Japanese island rather quickly at a speed 61\u00a0km/h (38\u00a0mph), and emerged into the Sea of Japan at 1530\u00a0UTC that day.[3] Despite its short stint over land, the terrain greatly weakened the tropical cyclone.[4] Tracking into a westerly wind flow, Vera was forced eastward, resulting in a second landfall near Sakata, Honshu,[3] with an intensity equivalent to that of a Category\u00a01 hurricane.[4][7] Vera re-emerged into the North Pacific Ocean late on September\u00a026, having weakened due to advection of cold air in addition to continued land interaction. At 0600\u00a0UTC on September\u00a027, the JTWC analyzed the typhoon to have weakened to tropical storm intensity. The warning center discontinued its periodic monitoring of the system, as Vera had begun to transition into an extratropical cyclone.[3] Consequently, the JMA officially reclassified the system as an extratropical storm at 1200\u00a0UTC that day. Vera's extratropical remnants continued to persist and track eastward for the next two days before the JMA last noted the storm at 1200\u00a0UTC on September\u00a029.[5]"

        "content": "Despite being well forecast and tracked throughout its duration,[3] Typhoon Vera's effects were highly disastrous and long-lasting.[6] In addition to the storm's intensity, the severe damage and large death tolls were partially attributed to a lack of urgency from Japanese media in advance of Vera's landfall.[11] Though estimates for damage costs indicated totals in excess of US$261\u00a0million (equivalent to US$2.73 billion in 2023),[3] other damage estimates suggested that damage costs were as high as US$600\u00a0million (equivalent to US$6.27 billion in 2023).[12] Death tolls also remain unclear, but reports generally indicated that around 5,000\u00a0people were killed,[3][6][13] with hundreds of other persons missing.[3][13] In addition to the dead nearly 40,000\u00a0people were injured,[13] and an additional 1.6\u00a0million people were rendered homeless.[3] Countrywide approximately 834,000\u00a0homes were destroyed and roughly 210,000\u00a0ha (520,000\u00a0ac) of agricultural fields were damaged.[13] The damage wrought by Vera made it the deadliest typhoon in Japanese history, succeeding the 1934 Muroto typhoon.[14][15] Vera was also the third deadliest natural disaster in Japan during the 20th century,[6][15] only behind the Great Hanshin earthquake in 1995 and the Great Kant\u014d earthquake in 1923.[6] Well in advance of Vera's landfall, heavy rainfall ahead of the typhoon occurred across the T\u014dkai region of Japan starting on September\u00a023,[6] when the storm reached peak intensity over open waters.[5] In Nagoya, rainfall totals reached 10\u00a0cm (4\u00a0in). In other parts of the T\u014dkai region, nearly 20\u00a0cm (8\u00a0in) of rain was reported. The precipitation caused flooding along several river basins in the swath of rain. Steady rainfall occurred throughout Vera's passage of Honshu, though the worst of the rain-induced flooding occurred well after the typhoon's initial landfall.[6] In Kawakami, Nara, a landslide killed 60\u00a0people after crushing 12\u00a0homes.[3] Most of the damage associated with Vera was a result of highly destructive storm surge. At the coast, the typhoon's intensity resulted in a strong storm surge that inundated low-lying coastal regions. In Ise Bay, storm surge heights were greatly enhanced due to the curvature of the land and the bay's shallow depth, which allowed water to be easily driven the length of the bay towards the coast.[6][11] In addition, the storm passed the area at high tide.[16] Water levels began to rise prior to Vera's landfall and peaked during the typhoon's first traversal of Honshu. The highest storm surge measurement was observed in the Port of Nagoya, where water levels peaked 3.9\u00a0m (13\u00a0ft) above normal. The intense storm surge easily engulfed or breached earthen levees and other flood prevention mechanisms around Ise Bay.[6] However, these coastal dykes still remained partially unfinished and were seriously impacted by Vera's storm surge.[11] Only newly installed flood mitigation systems along the southern portion of the bay were able to withstand the wave action.[6] Offshore, the waves sunk 25\u00a0fishing boats, with thousands of other ships grounded or missing.[17] In total, damage was reported to 7,576\u00a0vessels.[13] In addition to the damaged craft, numerous oyster rafts were also lost, with losses totaling US$6\u00a0million.[17] Also, 75\u00a0million individual pearl oysters were lost to the waves, resulting in US$10\u00a0million in additional losses.[18] Bloated bodies\u2014human and cattle\u2014float in muddy, brown floodwaters that enveloped 95\u00a0percent of Nagashima when Typhoon Vera turned the rivers into raging killers. \"Japan Counts 1,710 Dead in Wake of Typhoon Vera\". The Ludington Daily News. Vol.\u00a069, no.\u00a0276. Associated Press. September 29, 1959. The resulting inundation caused by Vera's storm surge submerged areas around the periphery of the bay for extended periods of time, with some low-lying areas remaining underwater in excess of four months.[6] Due to the failure of multiple flood mitigation systems in quick succession, coupled with the narrow coverage of telecommunications exacerbated by Vera's strong winds, many persons in affected regions had very little time to evacuate.[11] Nagoya was one of the worst impacted cities by Vera, and as a result of the storm surge and wind, its harbor was put out of service in under three hours.[3] The effects of the typhoon's storm surge there were further worsened by the destruction of lumber yards in Nagoya Harbor, which set loose large quantities of logs that caused considerable damage to structures.[11] The release of logs also hampered relief efforts following the typhoon's passage. Citywide, 50,000\u00a0homes were severely damaged by flood waters, and 1,800\u00a0other residences were washed away off of their foundations.[6] Total damage to crops was estimated at US$30\u00a0million.[17] Rice crops sustained heavy impacts, with 150,000\u00a0tons (135,000\u00a0tonnes) of rice lost. In addition to the crop damage, US$2.5\u00a0million worth of fruits and US$4\u00a0million worth of vegetables were lost.[19] The collapse of a single apartment home in the city buried 84\u00a0people under debris; a similar incident in Naka, Ibaraki buried roughly 300\u00a0people.[20] Beach houses were destroyed, and large swaths of nearby cropland were heavily damaged.[14] In addition to the storm surge, Nagoya experienced sustained winds of about 145\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph), with gusts reaching as high as 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph), downing power lines and causing power outage.[6] Southeast of Nagoya, in Handa, Aichi, around 300\u00a0people were killed after Vera's waves engulfed more than 250\u00a0homes.[3] Casualties throughout Aichi totaled 3,168 and roughly 59,000\u00a0people were injured, based on an enumeration conducted in March\u00a01960.[11] On the western side of Ise Bay, in Mie Prefecture, 1,233\u00a0people were killed, with approximately 5,500\u00a0others sustaining injuries.[6] Approximately 95%\u00a0of Nagashima was submerged underwater.[21] Nearby Kuwuna suffered a similar fate as 80%\u00a0of the city proper was flooded. There, 58\u00a0people were killed and 800\u00a0others were displaced. The towns of Kamezaki and Kamiyoshi were also wiped out by the flood inundation.[22] Further inland, in Nagano Prefecture, strong winds unroofed numerous homes.[3] The United States Air Force's Tachikawa Airfield near Tokyo sustained significant damage from the typhoon, with damage costs totaling in excess of US$1\u00a0million.[23]"

        "content": "In the immediate aftermath following Typhoon Vera, the Japanese government established a disaster headquarters in Tokyo and allocated resources to aid impacted areas. The government also set up the Central Japan Disaster Relief Department in Nagoya.[6] Due to the large estimated damage cost of Vera's impacts, Japanese parliament was forced to introduce a supplementary national budget to cover the losses.[23] Beginning on September\u00a027, refuge shelters were opened and local government agencies assisted in rescuing stranded civilians. On September\u00a029, the Japan Self-Defense Forces began to take part in the relief effort.[6] United States lieutenant general Robert Whitney Burns ordered all available servicemen stationed in Japan to take part in typhoon relief efforts. The USS\u00a0Kearsarge was dispatched to Nagoya to assist in relief efforts there.[14] In Nagoya, the flood waters contaminated drinking water, greatly reducing clean water supplies. Despite rapid sanitation and disinfection work, disease epidemic broke out in parts of the city. Over 170\u00a0cases of dysentery were reported, along with other cases of gangrene and tetanus. In addition to water shortage, food rationing, which had been prompted due to food shortages caused by Vera, resulted in hunger issues for impacted populations.[3] As a result of breaches in flood defenses around Ise Bay, seawater continued to pour into inundated areas after Vera's passage, slowing down repair efforts. One breach spanning 150\u00a0km (93\u00a0mi) across required 5,000\u00a0personnel, 32,000\u00a0sandbags, and bulldozers dispatched by the Japanese Ministry of Defense to relieve water flow. In Aichi's Ama District, reconstruction efforts for levees, roadways, and infrastructure lasted until the end of December\u00a01959.[6] Due to losses sustained by the pearl industry as a result of the typhoon, Japanese pearl production in 1959 was expected to decrease by 30% in 1959, with production losses of 40% expected in 1960. Monetary losses to the industry were expected to eclipse US$15\u00a0million, causing Japanese pearl costs to hike up by 20%. Furthermore, the effects of Vera on the country's pearl industry were expected to persist for two to three years.[18]"

        "content": "The unprecedented destruction caused by Vera prompted Japanese parliament to pass legislation in order to more efficiently assist affected regions and mitigate future disasters. In October\u00a01959, a special parliamentary session enacted several measures coordinated by various government ministries and provided subsidiaries to persons effected by Vera and other natural disasters in Japan from August and September of that year. A long lasting legislation prompted by Vera's effects was the 1961\u00a0passage of the Disaster Countermeasures Basic Act, widely regarded as the \"cornerstone of legislation on disaster risk reduction in Japan.\" The act established the Central Disaster Prevention Council, which was set to coordinate disaster risk reduction. The legislation also mandated an annual disaster prevention plan, to be submitted to the Japanese parliament yearly. Finally, the act established September\u00a01 as a National Disaster Prevention Day.[6] In addition to legislative reform, the breaching of coastal flood defense systems during Vera prompted a redesign of such mechanisms. In Nagoya, regulation was created for coastal construction and their heights. Development of flood defenses in Ise, Osaka, and Tokyo bays was also set into motion. The heights of such defense systems were based on worst-case scenarios and maximum storm surge heights caused by the typhoon.[6]"

        "content": "  Typhoon Jebi, known in the Philippines as Super Typhoon Maymay, was the costliest typhoon in Japan's history in terms of insured losses. Jebi formed from a tropical disturbance south-southwest of Wake Island on August\u00a026 and became the twenty-first named storm of the 2018 Pacific typhoon season on August\u00a027. Amid favorable environmental conditions, Jebi quickly strengthened into a typhoon on August\u00a029 as it headed west and rapidly intensified as it passed the Northern Mariana Islands on August\u00a030. Jebi reached its peak intensity as a Category\u00a05-equivalent typhoon on August\u00a031, with 10-minute sustained winds of 195\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph), 1-minute sustained winds of 285\u00a0km/h (180\u00a0mph), and a minimum pressure of 915\u00a0hPa (mbar; 27.02\u00a0inHg). Afterwards, Jebi began a slow weakening trend as it turned northwest, briefly passing through the Philippine Area of Responsibility on September\u00a02. Jebi accelerated north-northeast towards Japan on September\u00a03 as it interacted with the westerlies, and made landfalls over Shikoku and near Kobe early on September\u00a04. Jebi quickly weakened over land and became an extratropical cyclone later that day over the Sea of Japan. Its remnants moved over the Russian Far East before dissipating on September\u00a09. Jebi was the strongest typhoon to make landfall in Japan since Yancy in 1993 and left significant effects across the Kansai region. The typhoon's powerful winds, which broke wind records at 100 Japanese weather stations, damaged nearly 98,000 houses and left nearly 3\u00a0million customers without electricity after blowing down power lines. Heavy rains combined with wind and storm surge to flood over 700 houses and cause widespread damage to infrastructure, including several shrines and historical buildings. Agricultural damage from the adverse weather conditions was significant, with losses from the agricultural, forestry, and fishing industries valued at almost JP\u00a547\u00a0billion (US$430\u00a0million).[nb 1] Fruits were blown off trees, crops were lodged, and power outages affected the storage of livestock and produce. Storm surge inundated part of Kansai International Airport, which, combined with wind and rain damage to the terminals, forced the airport to close from September\u00a04 to 13.[2] Furthermore, access to the airport was cut off when the typhoon blew a tanker into the bridge connecting the airport to the mainland; repairs to the bridge were completed seven months later. Fourteen people were killed in Japan\u2014mostly from falls and flying debris\u2014and 980 were injured. Insured losses were estimated at US$13\u201314\u00a0billion, of which more than a third was from Osaka Prefecture. Elsewhere, Jebi brought minor flooding to the Northern Mariana Islands as it passed to the north on August\u00a031. Heavy swells produced by Jebi caused large waves along the coast of Taiwan that resulted in seven fatalities (including a suspected suicide) from September\u00a02 to 3. As an extratropical cyclone on September\u00a05, Jebi produced gusty winds across the Russian Far East, causing power outages and injuring three."

        "content": "A tropical disturbance was first noted by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) on August\u00a026 about 1,020\u00a0km (635\u00a0mi) south-southwest of Wake Island.[3] The disturbance increased in organization over the next few hours, with rainbands wrapping into a developing low-level circulation center.[4] The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a tropical depression at 18:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a026,[5][nb 2] with the JTWC following suit at 06:00\u00a0UTC the next day.[7] Further development was expected as the depression tracked northwest around a subtropical ridge, with high sea surface temperatures and low wind shear ahead in the system's anticipated path.[8] The JMA deemed the cyclone to have attained tropical storm status at 18:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a027 and assigned it the name Jebi;[5][nb 3] with this, Jebi became the twenty-first named storm of the 2018 Pacific typhoon season.[10] The JTWC similarly upgraded the system six hours later.[7] With favorable winds aloft aiding the development of thunderstorm activity, Jebi continued to strengthen as it turned more westward under the influence of the subtropical ridge.[11] The JMA upgraded Jebi to a severe tropical storm at 12:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a028 as its maximum sustained winds increased to 95\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph).[5][nb 4] Amid the favorable environment, Jebi began to intensify more quickly on August\u00a029, reaching typhoon status at 06:00\u00a0UTC as it developed an eye feature visible on microwave satellite imagery.[13][5][7] Rapid intensification commenced later that day, as a central dense overcast blossomed over the system's center.[14] From August\u00a029 to 30, Jebi's satellite presentation swiftly improved as its eye cleared out and contracted to a diameter of 19\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi), while convection surrounding the eye deepened.[15][16] The JTWC analyzed that Jebi intensified into a super typhoon by 18:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a030 with winds of 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph),[nb 5] representing an increase of 95\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph) in the past 24\u00a0hours.[18] The JMA reported that Jebi reached its peak intensity at 00:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a031 with winds of 195\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph) and a central pressure of 915\u00a0hPa (mbar; 27.02\u00a0inHg);[5] the JTWC estimated that Jebi's winds continued to increase and peaked at 285\u00a0km/h (180\u00a0mph) at 06:00\u00a0UTC.[7] Jebi's intensity leveled off thereafter as an eyewall replacement cycle began, with the original eyewall encircled by a larger, secondary eyewall.[19] The cycle completed by 21:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a031 while Jebi began to curve northward through a weakness in the subtropical ridge.[20] Drier air then began to impinge on the southern portion on the circulation, resulting in continued weakening.[21] At the same time, upper-level winds pushed subsiding air over the western part of Jebi's circulation, causing its convection to warm.[22] As a result, the JTWC assessed that Jebi had weakened below super typhoon status by 18:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a01.[7] Travelling northwestwards, Jebi entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) at 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a02 and received the local name Maymay;[23] Jebi exited the  PAR roughly 12\u00a0hours later.[24] Slow weakening continued through September\u00a03 as dry air and subsidence continued to affect Jebi's circulation. Despite this, Jebi managed to maintain a ragged yet well-defined eye.[25] Later on September\u00a03, an extratropical cyclone approaching from the northwest began to accelerate Jebi north-northeast,[26] while interaction with the mid-latitude westerlies caused Jebi to begin extratropical transition.[27] Racing poleward, Jebi made landfall over southern Tokushima Prefecture at around 03:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a04,[28] possessing winds of around 155\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph).[5][7] In the next two hours, Jebi crossed Osaka Bay and made another landfall around 05:00\u00a0UTC near Kobe, Hy\u014dgo Prefecture.[29] Land interaction and increasing wind shear rapidly weakened the system as it crossed Japan,[30] with the JTWC declaring that Jebi was no longer a tropical cyclone at 12:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a04, just hours after it entered the Sea of Japan.[7] The JMA downgraded Jebi to a severe tropical storm at 18:00\u00a0UTC, before later declaring it post-tropical at 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a05 just offshore Terneysky District, Russia. Over the next two days, the remnants of Jebi headed generally north over the Russian Far East while gradually weakening, crossing the 60th parallel north before the JMA ceased tracking the system at 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a07.[5]"

The typhoon's strong winds damaged 97,910 houses, of which 68 collapsed and 833 suffered major damage, while heavy rains and storm surge flooded another 707 houses. Another 6,527 buildings were damaged.[39] The General Insurance Association of Japan reported that nearly JP\u00a51.07\u00a0trillion (US$9.69\u00a0billion) in payouts had been made by March 2019, of which JP\u00a5601\u00a0billion (US$5.44\u00a0billion) was in Osaka Prefecture alone.[40] Insured losses were estimated at US$13\u201314\u00a0billion in December 2019, placing Jebi as the costliest typhoon to hit Japan in terms of insured losses.[41] Ahead of the storm, emergency evacuation orders were issued for parts of Osaka, Hy\u014dgo, Nara, Wakayama, and Kagawa prefectures. Evacuation advisories were issued for Ishikawa, Fukui, Yamanashi, Nagano, Gifu, Aichi, Kyoto, Okayama, Tokushima, and K\u014dchi prefectures.[39] The Fire and Disaster Management Agency reported that in total, about 8,000 residents evacuated to 1,667 shelters in 24 prefectures.[42] In Osaka, department stores and other commercial facilities were closed.[43] Public schools were closed in the cities of Kobe,[44] Kyoto,[45] Nara,[46] and Osaka,[47] as well as in Wakayama Prefecture.[48] Several tourist attractions were closed to visitors, including Universal Studios Japan, the Kyoto City Zoo, the Kyoto Aquarium, Nij\u014d Castle, and the Kyoto Imperial Palace.[49] JR-West suspended operations in the Keihanshin region on September\u00a04.[50] Services along the T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen,[51] as well as the San'y\u014d Shinkansen between Shin-\u014csaka and Hiroshima stations, were halted on September\u00a04.[52] At least 912 flights in and out of Osaka were cancelled.[53] Factories across the Kansai and Ch\u016bbu regions were closed, with notable companies affected including Daikin, Panasonic, Daihatsu, and Toyota. Major department store operators, such as J. Front Retailing, H2O Retailing, and Takashimaya, closed their Kansai outlets.[54] Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe cancelled a trip to Kyushu to oversee state response efforts.[55] Jebi set new records for 10-minute maximum sustained winds at 53 weather stations and broke records for wind gusts at 100 weather stations in Japan, mostly on September\u00a04.[56] The highest sustained winds from Jebi were recorded at Cape Muroto, at 48.2\u00a0m/s (174\u00a0km/h; 108\u00a0mph). At Kansai International Airport, a gust of 58.1\u00a0m/s (209\u00a0km/h; 130\u00a0mph) was recorded, which was significantly higher than the previous record set by Typhoon Cimaron just 12 days earlier. Significant winds occurred even in urban areas, with downtown Wakayama experiencing maximum sustained winds of up to 39.7\u00a0m/s (143\u00a0km/h; 89\u00a0mph) and gusts reaching 57.4\u00a0m/s (207\u00a0km/h; 128\u00a0mph). Similarly, the financial center of Osaka, Ch\u016b\u014d-ku, recorded a maximum gust of 47.4\u00a0m/s (171\u00a0km/h; 106\u00a0mph).[57] The maximum storm surge produced by Jebi was 3.29\u00a0m (10.8\u00a0ft) in Osaka, surpassing the previous record of 2.93\u00a0m (9.6\u00a0ft) from the 2nd Muroto Typhoon (Typhoon Nancy) in 1961.[58] Across the Kansai Region, massive blackouts occurred as the typhoon blew down transmission lines, with over 2.2\u00a0million customers of Kansai Electric Power Company losing power. Restoration works were fully completed only on September\u00a020, having been hampered by fallen trees, collapsed houses, and landslides.[59][60][61] Other significant power outages were reported in the Ch\u016bbu region, with Chubu Electric Power reporting 695,320 blackouts. Elsewhere, 16,040 households in the Hokuriku region lost power, and another 14,000 households in the T\u014dhoku region were left without power.[62] Numerous incidents resulted from Jebi's high winds and heavy rain. In Shiga Prefecture, a man died after the warehouse he was working in collapsed. A man in Osaka was blown off the second floor of a house and fell to his death; at least five more people in the eponymous prefecture were killed by falls or flying debris. Another man died after he fell from a roof in Mie Prefecture. Part of the glass ceiling at Ky\u014dto Station collapsed, injuring multiple people.[63][64] In Hachi\u014dji, Tokyo, four people suffered cuts when a metal object fell from a building's roof. In neighboring Saitama Prefecture, an elderly man in Kawagoe was injured when he was blown over by a strong gust and a woman was hit by a flying object. Strong winds in Tochigi Prefecture caused a woman to fall and hurt her shoulder, while two others fell while attempting to repair a window on the second floor of their house.[65] Fallen trees trapped 160 elementary school students on a school trip in Kyoto.[66] At the Nintendo headquarters in Kyoto, the logo on the exterior of the building was damaged by strong winds.[67] The LED lighting on the Ts\u016btenkaku tower in Osaka was damaged by flying debris and made inoperable.[68] An oil refinery in Sakai operated by JXTG Nippon Oil & Energy was forced to partially shut after a cooling tower sustained damage.[69] Several shrines across Japan were damaged: the Kasuga Grand Shrine in Nara had its arrival hall damaged by fallen trees, the torii at the entrance of Oji Shrine in Tokyo collapsed,[70] while the torii on the east side of the Naganokengokoku Shrine\u00a0[ja] in Matsumoto, Nagano, was destroyed.[71] One of the three honden of Ono Shrine\u00a0[ja] in Shiojiri, Nagano, which were built in 1672, was severely damaged by a fallen tree.[72] The hall of worship at Hirano Shrine in Kyoto was destroyed and 400 cherry blossom trees on the shrine's grounds were felled. At the nearby Nishi Hongan-ji, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, a wall on the southern face of the compound collapsed and a segment of the roof of the worship hall was peeled off.[73] Part of the cliff on the south side of Ueda Castle collapsed, while an iron roof tile was blown off at the Katakurakan building in Suwa, Nagano.[74] The trunk of a 400-year-old beech tree in the Shirakami-Sanchi was snapped by Jebi's strong winds.[75] Along Osaka Bay, the typhoon's storm surge carried away several shipping containers. The Port of Kobe lost 42 containers, which were eventually recovered 10 days later. Some residential areas surrounding the bay were inundated after the storm surge overtopped coastal defenses.[76] In Nishinomiya, the rising waters caused 187 cars at an auctioneer's lot to catch fire by short-circuiting their electrical systems.[42][55] Kansai International Airport was forced to close on September\u00a04, as waves reaching 5\u00a0m (16\u00a0ft) in height overtopped coastal defenses and left a runway and cargo facilities inundated.[77][78] Access to the island was cut off on September\u00a04 when a 2,591-tonne tanker was unmoored by Jebi's strong winds and collided with the only bridge connecting the airport to the mainland.[79][52] As a result, 8,000 passengers and staff were stranded in the airport and were evacuated by ferries and speedboats on September\u00a05.[77] The 11 crewmembers on board the tanker were uninjured and were rescued by the coast guard.[78] The terminals experienced power outages, leaving passengers to wait without air conditioning.[79] A passenger sustained minor injuries from a window broken by the storm.[80] Partial operation of the airport resumed on September\u00a06,[81] with flights allowed to operate out of the undamaged Terminal\u00a02. Other flights were redirected to nearby Itami and Kobe Airports. Terminal\u00a01 began to resume operations on September\u00a013 and the previously flooded runway reopened on September\u00a014.[82][83] The airport reopened fully on September\u00a021, following repairs to an electric power facility and a baggage claim area at Terminal\u00a01.[84] Repairs to the access bridge continued and were completed in April 2019.[85] The temporary closure of the airport\u2014the country's third largest and a major export hub for manufacturers in the region\u2014sparked fears that Japan's industrial production would suffer.[86] The absence of international flights caused tourism in Osaka to decline sharply, with about a quarter of retailers reporting their sales had halved in a survey conducted by Nikkei.[87] The damage to transport infrastructure from a combination of Jebi and other natural disasters contributed to a larger-than-expected contraction in Japan's gross domestic product for the third quarter of 2018.[88] The agricultural, forestry, and fishing industries suffered significantly, with damage amounting to JP\u00a546.81\u00a0billion (US$42.39\u00a0million) across 33 prefectures. A total of 30,996 hectares (76,590 acres) of cropland was damaged by the typhoon's strong winds,[89] which blew down fruit trees and caused lodging of vegetable and feed crops.[90] About JP\u00a511.88\u00a0billion (US$107.6\u00a0million) worth of crops were lost. Across 31 prefectures, 42,918 incidents of damage to agricultural infrastructure were reported, resulting in JP\u00a520.10\u00a0billion (US$182.0\u00a0million) of damage. Another 131 fishing boats and 406 aquaculture facilities were damaged.[89] In the T\u014dkai region, some pigs suffocated after power outages stopped ventilation of the stalls they were kept in. In T\u014dhoku and Hokkaido, many apple farms suffered from apple scab after the typhoon, exacerbating losses.[90] At an aquaculture facility off Kushimoto, Wakayama, run by Kindai University, 600 bluefin tuna were lost after the cage containing them broke, resulting in losses of JP\u00a5100\u00a0million (US$906,000).[91] Extended power outages prevented farmers from shipping raw milk in at least five prefectures. Jebi served to worsen damage inflicted by Typhoon Cimaron, which passed over roughly the same areas two weeks earlier.[92] At the end of September, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries announced it would be providing subsidies and grants to help farmers offset repair and reconstruction costs.[93]"

One particular thunderstorm exploded into a supercell upon crossing the Hudson River Valley, due to the presence of higher dew points flowing up the valley from the south and locally enhanced low-level shear. A tornado touched down in Columbia County at 6:40\u00a0p.m., producing F2 damage.[1] The tornado lifted off the ground twenty minutes later and the storm moved over the mountains along the New York/Massachusetts border.

The seventeenth tropical depression, fourteenth named storm, ninth hurricane and seventh major hurricane[a] of the 2023 Pacific hurricane season, Norma developed from an area of low pressure that formed off the coast of southern Mexico on October 15, 2023. The disturbance gradually organized as it progressed westward parallel to the coast, and developed into Tropical Storm Norma on October 17. Turning northward, Norma rapidly intensified to a Category 4 hurricane as it continued to parallel the west coast of Mexico. Less favorable environmental conditions caused Norma to gradually weaken as it approached the Baja California peninsula. The cyclone made landfall on the Mexican state of Baja California Sur as a Category 1 hurricane. Norma continued to weaken as it crossed the state. The storm emerged over the Gulf of California on October 22, and made landfall as a tropical depression the following day on the state of Sinaloa. Norma quickly dissipated as it moved inland over Mexico. Norma resulted in extensive flooding across northwestern Mexico, peaking at nearly 480\u00a0mm (19\u00a0in) in parts of Baja California Sur. Numerous trees, homes and boats were damaged in the cities of Cabo San Lucas and La Paz. Damage across the state reached MXN$200 million (USD$11.1 million).[b] Norma resulted in three fatalities in Sinaloa, as well as severe damage to numerous houses and businesses. Infrastructural damage alone in Sinaloa cost MXN$220.5 million (USD$12.2 million)."

        "content": "A broad low-pressure area developed over the northeastern Pacific Ocean on October 15, 2023, producing a large area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms. With this convective activity gradually consolidating, the system organized into a tropical depression by 12:00 UTC on October 17[c] about 400 nautical miles southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico. Six hours later, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Norma. Situated within an environment of warm sea-surface temperatures (SSTs), low vertical wind shear, and plentiful moisture, Norma underwent an almost two-day long period of rapid intensification shortly after forming, as a ridge over Mexico steered the system to the north while gradually slowing it down. At 18:00 UTC on October 18, 24 hours after being named, Norma strengthened into a hurricane. Just twelve hours later the storm achieved major hurricane status. Norma featured a well-defined, clear eye at this time. The major hurricane continued to move slowly north, parallel to the west coast of Mexico, as it rounded the ridge. Norma reached its peak intensity as a Category 4 hurricane at 12:00 UTC on October 19, with maximum sustained winds of 210\u00a0km/h (130\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 939\u00a0mbar (27.7\u00a0inHg). The storm was centered 350 nautical miles south of Cabo San Lucas at the time.[1] After peaking in intensity, increased dry air and wind shear caused Norma's structure to degrade, and the storm weakened slightly as it turned northwestward and began to move more quickly. Norma fluctuated in intensity, achieving a secondary peak as a 195\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph) Category 3 hurricane on October 20. Despite this, increasingly cooler SSTs caused the hurricane to weaken rapidly as it turned north between the ridge over Mexico and a trough to its northwest. Norma made landfall on the Mexican state of Baja California Sur near 20:15 UTC on October 21 as a Category 1 hurricane, with maximum winds of 130\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph). Norma weakened to a tropical storm as it crossed the Baja California Peninsula, and emerged over the Gulf of California early the following day. Strong upper-level winds produced by the trough caused Norma's convective activity to be sheared away, and the storm weakened to a depression as it moved inland over the state of Sinaloa at 10:30 UTC on October 23. The cyclone dissipated over western Mexico by 18:00 UTC.[1]"

Schools remained closed in parts of the state into Monday as clean-up crews removed fallen trees and scattered debri across La Paz.[18] Some municipalities in the state were left without power a week after the storm, contradicting reports from the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE) that power had been fully restored by October 24.[19] Vandalism and looting also took place in various stores around Los Cabos.[20] A disaster declaration was issued by the governor of Baja California Sur, V\u00edctor Manuel Castro Cos\u00edo, due to the extensive damage Norma wrought to public infrastructure in southern regions of the state; despite this, most hotels in the area suffered minimal damage from the hurricane.[21]"

Tini's cyclone centre shifted over Scotland to the North Sea on 13 February, splitting into two as the main area continued to the Norwegian sea where it filled, a secondary low (named Tini II by the Free University of Berlin),[8] developed over northern France.[11] Tini II passed over Brandenburg and Poland into the Baltic Sea before being absorbed by the following area of low pressure (named Ulli) on 15 February before moving across Russia to the Ural Mountains.[8] The Tini II low reached a nadir of 992\u00a0hPa (29.3\u00a0inHg) 13 on February over Saxony Anhalt, with peak winds reported in southwest Germany in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg over exposed mountains and coasts, reaching gust speeds up to 137\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph) at Mindelheim Alpine Lodge.

The Tini storm was the strongest of those seen in February,[13] which generally peaked in the mid-Atlantic and brought wet conditions to NW Europe rather than high winds. This period is probably the stormiest in the region since the 1990 Atlantic winter storms in Europe. Met \u00c9ireann considered the Tini/Darwin storm exceptional though not without precedent in Ireland.[1] Met \u00c9ireann climate records point to the Tini/Darwin storm as being roughly a 1 in 20-year event although a label of 'worst in living memory' might be applicable in some badly affected areas.[14] Hurricane Debbie of 1961 was more violent in the country (with maximum gusts between 130 and 157\u00a0km/h\u00a0[81 and 98\u00a0mph; 70 and 85\u00a0kn] generally, with a maximum of 172\u00a0km/h\u00a0[107\u00a0mph; 93\u00a0kn] reported in northwest Ireland.)[1] Shannon Airport reported a 10-minute mean wind speed of 113\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph; 61\u00a0kn) during Tini, the highest value seen since recording at the site began in 1945.[1] More recently the Boxing Day Storm of 26 December 1998 and the Christmas Eve Storm (Yuma) on 24 December 1997 were also of greater intensity in Ireland,[1] with the Tini storm ranking behind these and the Night of the Big Wind of 6\u20137 January 1839 in Ireland.[1] Other high impact storms in Ireland include those such as that of the \"Ulysses Storm\" 26\u201327 February 1903 and 11\u201312 January 1974 (where the strongest ever sea level gust in Ireland, at exactly 200\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph), was recorded in Kilkeel, County Down).[15] The UK Met Office described the Tini storm as one of the most significant to affect North Wales and North West England in recent decades.[13] Tini was the first red \"danger to life warning\" for wind issued by the Met Office in the UK since January 2012 when Cyclone Ulli affected Scotland.[16]"

The tenth named storm of the season, Bilis originated from an area of disturbed weather that developed into a tropical depression southeast of Guam on August\u00a018. Situated within an environment highly conductive for continued tropical development, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm a day after formation; Bilis was upgraded to typhoon status on August\u00a020 as it maintained a northwest course. Without significant inhibiting factors, the typhoon reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 205\u00a0km/h (127\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 920\u00a0mbar (hPa; 27.17\u00a0inHg). At the same intensity, Bilis made landfall on Taiwan the following day. Despite its short stint over land, Bilis was greatly weakened, and made a brief track over the Taiwan Strait before its final landfall on China's Fujian Province early the next day. Moving inland into Mainland China, Bilis quickly weakened, and was only a tropical depression later that day; the depression diffused into a remnant low on August\u00a025. These remnants tracked northeast across the Yellow Sea before dissipating in the Korean Peninsula on August\u00a027."

        "content": "The predecessor to Typhoon Bilis began as a developing area of disturbed weather well south-southeast of Guam on August\u00a015. Satellite analysis revealed a broad low-pressure area associated with the developing convection. Within an area supportive of tropical cyclogenesis, the disturbance gradually organized and intensified.[1] At 0600\u00a0UTC on August\u00a017, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center\u00a0(JTWC) began classifying the system as a tropical depression.[2] The Japan Meteorological Agency\u00a0(JMA) followed suit the following day at 1200\u00a0UTC.[3] Tracking northwestward, the favorable conditions allowed the depression to quickly strengthen and attain tightly wrapped rainbands,[1] prompting the JMA to upgrade the system to tropical storm status at 0600\u00a0UTC on August\u00a019,[3] thus designating the storm with the name Bilis.[4] This period of rapid strengthening continued throughout the day's course, with the system reaching severe tropical storm intensity twelve hours after naming and then typhoon intensity at 1200\u00a0UTC on August\u00a020.[3] Water vapor satellite imagery at the time indicated that Bilis maintained a well-organized outflow pattern. As a result of its rapid intensification, Bilis grew in size, exhibiting a behavior typical of tropical cyclones originating from the northwest Pacific monsoon trough. In addition, the typhoon developed an eye early on August\u00a020, though in its initial stages the eye was irregular in shape.[1] At 1200\u00a0UTC on August\u00a021, the JTWC determined Bilis to have reached super typhoon intensity.[nb 1].[1] Six hours later, the JMA indicated that the typhoon had reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 205\u00a0km/h (127\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 920\u00a0mbar (hPa; 27.17\u00a0inHg).[3] By this point Bilis' eye had become cloud-free and well defined. The typhoon maintained this intensity with little fluctuation for roughly the ensuing eighteen hours as it tracked northwest.[3] Early on August\u00a022, microwave imagery indicated concentric eyewalls, a sign of a possible eyewall replacement cycle.[1] Still at peak intensity,[3] Bilis made landfall on the coast of southern Taiwan at 1400\u00a0UTC on August\u00a022.[4] Concurrently, the storm's internal structure began to show signs of disruption, and its eye began to shrink. The typhoon accelerated over the island, and as such emerged into the Taiwan Strait no longer than five or six hours after landfall.[1] Despite the short stint over land, Bilis had greatly weakened, and was only a minimal typhoon upon its reentry over water.[3] However, there was a large discrepancy between JMA and JTWC intensity estimates, with the latter suggesting that Bilis had only weakened slightly.[1] Nonetheless, the typhoon made its final landfall Jinjiang, Fujian at 0300\u00a0UTC on August\u00a024. This greatly weakened Bilis, and three hours later the JMA downgraded it as a tropical storm.[3] Shortly after landfall, the weakening tropical cyclone became quasi-stationary just inland of Mainland China. By this point convection was intermittent and short-lived,[1] and at 1200\u00a0UTC the JMA classified the system as a tropical depression.[3] Though the JTWC discontinued its monitoring activities,[2] the depression began to assume a northerly course on August\u00a024. At 1200\u00a0UTC the next day, the depression was determined to have diffused into a remnant low while still inland. Bilis' remnants continued to track northeast, across the Yellow Sea, and dissipated on August\u00a027 shortly after entering the Korean Peninsula.[3]"

Meanwhile, hospitals extended service times in anticipation for patient admittance. Taiwanese coast guard members regulated fishing activity due to the threat of deadly wave action.[7] The Port of Kaohsiung was closed throughout the duration of the storm.[8] Due to the heightened demand for vegetables in the lead-up to the storm, the cost of such foods increased by 20\u00a0to 30\u00a0percent.[9] Bilis was a highly destructive tropical cyclone for Taiwan. Damage to the island's agricultural, fishing, and forestry industries amounted to US$133.5\u00a0million. The typhoon caused 14\u00a0fatalities and injured an additional 80\u00a0people. Power outages adversely impacted approximately 600,000\u00a0households, and 400\u00a0homes across Taiwan were destroyed.[4] Several hundred thousand families experienced water shortage following the storm.[10] In Cheng-Kung, a weather station recorded a 281\u00a0km/h (175\u00a0mph) wind gust, which broke the station's anemometer.[1] A single landslide in the town of Jenai buried nine farmers. Tens of thousands of people were displaced during the storm, and moved into evacuation shelters set up by the government.[8] Eight people shooting a film on the outskirts of Kaohsiung became stranded and thus improvised a shelter to ride out the storm.[11] In eastern Hualien County, 250\u00a0houses succumbed to strong winds.[1] The winds also felled trees and blew light vehicles around, blocking roads.[12] Heavy rainfall associated with Bilis flooded roughly 40,000\u00a0ha (100,000\u00a0ac) of orchards and rice paddies.

Economic losses in China totaled US$534\u00a0million, with most of the losses occurring in Fujian Province. A total of 57\u00a0people were killed, though an additional 1,077\u00a0people were either wounded or went missing.[4] Due to felled trees, a railway line from Fuzhou to Mawei blocked rail service.[15] Bilis spawned several tornadoes in the area of Yueqing, ravaging four villages and destroying 20\u00a0buildings.[4]"

Prapiroon developed as a tropical depression on August\u00a024, 2000, and took a primarily northerly course for much of its duration. However, steering currents caused it to track westward for extended periods of time on two occasions. Intensification was gradual, and on August\u00a026 the system reached tropical storm status, though the system's organization remained rather loose for much of its early developmental history. On August\u00a029, Prapiroon swung near Taiwan and East China as it tracked about the western periphery of a nearby high-pressure area. A day later, the storm reached typhoon intensity within the East China Sea, later attaining peak intensity as a typhoon of moderate strength within the Yellow Sea.

Positioned in an area with low wind shear, atmospheric conditions around the system were supportive of tropical cyclone development. After some organization,[1] the Japan Meteorological Agency\u00a0(JMA) declared the area of disturbed weather to have assumed the characteristics of a tropical depression at 1800\u00a0UTC on August\u00a024.[2] Initially tracking westward,[2] the diffuse depression reached a temporary halt and later began to accelerate towards the north on August\u00a025. Strengthening continued at a steady pace thereafter, and at 1800\u00a0UTC the following day, the JMA upgraded the depression to tropical storm status, based on corresponding ship reports and satellite intensity estimates, and named the system Prapiroon accordingly. Despite its classification, Prapiroon was loosely defined, as it lacked a primary circulation center and instead was centered around multiple vortices.[1] In response to steering wind currents induced by a nearby, strengthening high-pressure area, Prapiroon began to take a more westerly course beginning late on August\u00a027.[1]  Around the same time, the JMA upgraded the cyclone further to severe tropical status, a classification Prapiroon would maintain for much of its existence.[2] Despite consolidation of the previously distinct low-level circulation vortices, moderate wind shear displaced the newly merged center from much of its associated convection. However, the storm's overall structure would improve over the following days as Prapiroon began to curve northward around the western periphery of the nearby high pressure region. Late on August\u00a029, Prapiroon made its closest approach to Taipei, Taiwan, at a distance of 260\u00a0km (160\u00a0mi). At around the same time, satellite imagery indicated the development of a large, albeit ragged eye.[1] Having resumed a northerly course, the recent strengthening trend prompted the JMA to classify Prapiroon as a typhoon at 0600\u00a0UTC on August\u00a030. Roughly six hours later, the typhoon peaked in strength, with maximum sustained winds reaching 130\u00a0km/h (81\u00a0mph) and a barometric pressure bottoming out at 965\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.50\u00a0inHg). This intensity was held for at least the following 18\u00a0hours before Prapiroon's cloud structure began to elongate as the storm accelerated into more northerly latitudes,[1][2] where wind shear was increased.[1]  Prapiroon was downgraded back to severe tropical storm intensity shortly before it made landfall on the western coast of North Korea at 1300\u00a0UTC on August\u00a031.[2][3] Although Prapiroon crossed the Korean Peninsula at a rapid pace, upon emerging into the Sea of Japan early on September\u00a01, its interaction of land had caused the majority of its convection to deteriorate.[1]  At 1200\u00a0UTC that day, the JMA analyzed Prapiroon to have transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. These remnants tracked quickly eastward, crossing Japan on September\u00a02 before dissipating in the open Pacific east of Hokkaido on September\u00a04.[2]"

The same region experienced severe flooding, resulting in the submerging of 364,000 hectares (900,000 acres) of farmland and the destruction of over 7,500\u00a0homes. In Xiangshui County, 821\u00a0mm (32.3\u00a0in) of rain was reported, setting a county record for the most observed precipitation from a single rain event.[1] The floods there prompted the evacuation of 13,800\u00a0people. The prefecture government in Yancheng allocated 400\u00a0soldiers and militiamen, along with 30,000\u00a0life jackets and various supplies, in order to combat the flood. Flood-relief channels in Shiliang Reservoir were opened in order to relieve the high water levels.[13] In total, Prapiroon was responsible for the deaths of 10\u00a0people across China.[3]"

However, daily rainfall totals peaked at 94\u00a0mm (3.7\u00a0in) on Ishigaki Island. Due to the effects of the nearby tropical cyclone, several warnings were issued for the prefecture, and sea and air transportation was suspended. On Ishigaki, Prapiroon was particularly damaging to crops, including sugarcane, papaya, and banana. Around 12.3\u00a0km2 (4.7\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of farmland was reportedly damaged, and total costs of agricultural damage reached JP\u00a525.8\u00a0million (US$239\u00a0thousand). In addition to crops, Prapiroon also caused adverse effects to several schools, including the shattering of several windows at a junior high school.[14] More widespread and severe damage occurred in Okinawa's Miyako District, where damage to agriculture amounted to JP\u00a5105\u00a0million (US$974\u00a0thousand). Power outages were also widespread, impacting 400\u00a0households. Telecommunications were also disrupted as a result.[15] Outside of its claims in the Ryukyu Islands, Japan remained largely unaffected by Prapiroon until the system passed over Honshu as an extratropical cyclone. Similar to its affects in the Ryukyu Islands, the storm mainly caused heavy rain, with rainfall totals peaking nationally in Nakagoya, Miyazaki Prefecture, where a station measured 253\u00a0mm (10.0\u00a0in) of precipitation.[16] In Kyoto Prefecture, the rainfall resulted in the inundation of 39\u00a0buildings and the flooding of roads.[17] K\u014dchi Prefecture, located further northeast, experienced similar impacts, in addition to the occurrence of six landslides. Accrued damage amounted to JP\u00a5419\u00a0million (US$3.89\u00a0million).[18] Strong waves off of Niigata Prefecture damaged 22\u00a0vessels and submerged coastal regions.[19] Particularly impacted was Hokkaido, which was affected by high surf and heavy rains, delaying domestic flights and causing complications for rail service.[20] Automobile transportation was also impacted as heavy rains rendered roads impassable.[21] Flooding occurred after rivers began to overflow their banks, including in Horokanai.[22] Damage to agriculture in Hokkaido reached JP\u00a535.7\u00a0million (US$331\u00a0thousand).[22][23][24]"

The typhoon originated from an area of convection and was first classified as a tropical cyclone on October\u00a010. The system attained gale-force winds the next day, and slowly deepened thereafter. Although Nancy initially moved west, the system maintained a general westward course for much of its duration, striking Luzon on October\u00a014 at peak intensity of 215\u00a0km/h (130\u00a0mph). It weakened to tropical storm strength overland, but re-intensified to typhoon intensity over the South China Sea.

        "content": "Typhoon Nancy originated from a large area of convection situated in the middle of the Pacific Ocean,[1] which, while drifting westward,[2] began to consolidate on October 8 within a favorable environment aloft. The convection separated from an upper-level low embedded within a tropical upper-tropospheric trough (TUTT). Later that day, the area of convection degenerated into a \"random area of cloudiness.\" The TUTT drifted west while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) reported that a tropical depression formed within the area of convection that was now located south of the TUTT.[1] Early on October\u00a010, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started watching the system.[3][nb 2] At 07:30\u00a0UTC, a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert was issued by the JTWC while located 370\u00a0km (230\u00a0mi) north of Guam.[1] Following an increase in reorganization, a Hurricane Hunter flight indicated winds of 50\u00a0km/h (30\u00a0mph) early on October\u00a011.[1] Later that morning, the JMA upgraded the cyclone into a tropical storm. Following Hurricane Hunter reports, which indicated winds of 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph) and a barometric pressure of 999\u00a0mbar (29.5\u00a0inHg).[5][nb 3] Based on this, the JTWC upgraded the depression into a tropical storm and named it Nancy. Initially, the JTWC expected the system to track northwards and eventually re-curve, but this did not occur. Nancy maintained its intensity for 24\u00a0hours while tracking westward before rapidly turning west due to a change in steering patterns.[1] Meanwhile, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Weling.[7][8] Midday on October 12, the JMA upgraded Nancy into a severe tropical storm. At 00:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a013, the same agency classified Nancy into a typhoon,[3] and subsequently, the storm developed a well-defined eye. Later that day, the JTWC followed suit. By midday on October\u00a014, the JTWC predicted Nancy to turn northwest into China due to the anticipation of a mid-latitude trough south of South Korea deepening.[1] At 0600\u00a0UTC, the JMA reported that Nancy reached its peak intensity of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph) and a minimum pressure of 935\u00a0mbar (27.6\u00a0inHg).[3] Meanwhile, the JTWC reported peak intensity of 215\u00a0km/h (130\u00a0mph), a Category\u00a04 hurricane equivalent on the United States-based Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (SSHWS). Six hours later, Typhoon Nancy moved ashore in northern Luzon[1] while still at peak intensity.[3] The storm rapidly weakened over land,[1] with satellite images showing that the eye had quickly disappeared.[2] Although the JTWC downgraded Nancy to a tropical storm,[1] the JMA kept the storm at typhoon intensity throughout landfall.[3] After entering the South China Sea,[1] the storm initially tracked west-northwest before slowing down and turning west.[2] Meanwhile, JTWC upped Nancy to typhoon status as it entered an area with favorable mid- to upper-level winds.[1] Continuing to gain strength, the JMA raised the intensity of Nancy to 130\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph) on October 16.[3] Shortly thereafter, Nancy crossed Hainan Island.[1] After weakening slightly overland, the storm resumed strengthening once offshore. According to the JMA, Nancy attained a secondary peak, with winds of 135\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph) at 06:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a017.[3] The tropical cyclone moved on a slow northwesterly track along the southern periphery of the ridge. While passing slightly north of the Paracel Islands,[1] the JTWC estimated winds of 145\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph), equivalent to a high-end Category\u00a01 hurricane on the SSHWS.[9] Late on October 18, Nancy made landfall along the coast of Vietnam, just north of Vinh.[1] At the time of landfall, both agencies estimated that Nancy was a typhoon.[1][3] Within hours, the convection ceased,[1] though the JMA kept monitoring the system until October 20, when it finally dissipated.[3]"

At the same time, sea surface temperatures near the equator were anomalously warm, and wind shear values were low.[1] At the end of January, a large area of convection persisted for several days near the north side of the equator. By January 23, several ships reported squalls and strong southwesterly winds in the region.[2] The Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) began monitoring the system on January 26,[3] while it was located about 950 miles (1,530\u00a0km) south of Ka Lae, the southernmost point in Hawaii.[4] The disturbance organized further as it tracked westward, and on January 28 it developed into Tropical Depression One-C, located a short distance north of Kiritimati and east of Tabuaeran.[2] With favorable conditions, the depression quickly intensified into a tropical storm; upon doing so, it was named Ekeka by the CPHC, which is Hawaiian for Edgar. Ekeka continued gradually intensifying while moving slowly west-northwestward, and it attain hurricane status on January 30 about 100 miles (160\u00a0km) northwest of Palmyra Atoll. On February 2, the hurricane attained peak winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h), making Ekeka a major hurricane, or Category\u00a03 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale.[2] Subsequently, it began to weaken due to increased wind shear, and concurrently its forward motion increased as the subtropical ridge strengthened to the north of the hurricane.[3] A large trough in the Westerlies increased the wind shear, which weakened Ekeka to a tropical storm early on February 3. Later that day, it crossed the International Date Line into the western Pacific Ocean;[2] both of the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) and the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) assessed the storm's winds at 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h).[3][5] Shortly before that, the JMA assessed the pressure as 985\u00a0mbar, which is the lowest known minimum central pressure associated with the storm;[5] the CPHC did not include pressure in their year-end report.[2] Tropical Storm Ekeka continued weakening, degrading to tropical depression status by February 4. The depression moved quickly through the Marshall Islands, and on February 6 turned to the west-southwest.[3] On February 8, the JMA declared Ekeka dissipated;[5] however, the JTWC continued monitoring the system, with Ekeka passing over Chuuk as a weak depression.[3] Early on February 9, the JTWC declared Ekeka dissipated about 800 miles (1,300\u00a0km) east-southeast of Palau, or about 310 miles (500\u00a0km) off the north coast of Papua New Guinea.[4]"

When Ekeka hit the island of Chuuk, winds of 20\u00a0mph (32\u00a0km/h) were reported.[3]\nWhile in the central Pacific Ocean, Ekeka became one of only three tropical cyclones on record to be located within the Palmyra Atoll Exclusive Economic Zone; Ekeka was the only hurricane within the area.[6] Ekeka is most unusual for its formation in January.[2] Tropical cyclones rarely form east of the International Date Line outside of the tropical cyclone season,[4] which starts May 15 in the eastern Pacific and June 1 in the central Pacific, and ends on November 30 in both regions.[7] In the official Pacific hurricane database, Ekeka was the second tropical cyclone on record to occur in January or February within the Pacific Ocean east of the International Date Line, after Tropical Storm Winona[4][8] of 1989. It is third earliest cyclone on record within the basin, behind Hurricane Pali of 2016, and the aforementioned Winona."

The eleventh tropical storm, sixth typhoon, and first super typhoon of the 1982 Pacific typhoon season, the system first developed on July\u00a021. Two days later, it was upgraded into a tropical storm, and subsequently began to intensify while tracking northwest. Bess attained typhoon intensity on July\u00a024, before it briefly turned southwest. After turning north-northwest, the typhoon entered a period of rapid intensification and late on July\u00a028 reached peak winds of 230\u00a0km/h (145\u00a0mph). After turning north, Bess began to weaken as it encountered less favorable conditions. On August\u00a01, Bess was downgraded into a tropical storm. Shortly after that, the storm struck southeastern Japan, and on August\u00a02 merged with a low pressure area atop of the Sea of Japan. Typhoon Bess cut through a 400\u00a0km (250\u00a0mi) swath that included the most populated portion of Japan. Bess caused \u00a5591.6\u00a0billion (US$2.38\u00a0billion) in damage and 95\u00a0casualties. Furthermore, 119\u00a0others were hurt. Four people were killed due to landslides, while two other individuals were buried alive. A series of landslides stranded about 2,000\u00a0people, including 1,500 children. In all, 43\u00a0dwellings were destroyed and 17,000\u00a0homes were flooded. A total of 59\u00a0roads were impassable, 42\u00a0bridges were destroyed and 785\u00a0landslides occurred. Fifteen railway lines were disrupted due to torrential rainfall. In addition, 2,857\u00a0acres of farmland were flooded, 101\u00a0bridges were washed out and roads were damaged at more than 1,000\u00a0locations. Two boats sunk. Roughly 25,000\u00a0people were displaced. Following the storm, 2,100\u00a0policeman and firefighters dug through debris to rescue people. Following the season, the name Bess was retired from the list of names."

        "content": "A large monsoon trough was anchored south of Guam towards the end of July. By July\u00a021, three areas of disturbed weather had formed. Although the westernmost disturbance dissipated, the easternmost two continued to develop, one of which would later become Typhoon Andy. A Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) was issued for the easternmost system at 1900\u00a0UTC on July\u00a021 as sea level pressures fell and convection increased within the vicinity of the disturbance. After becoming better organized,[1][nb 1] the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started monitoring the system.[3][nb 2] Later on July\u00a022, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started monitoring the same system as it developed rainbands and a further increase in thunderstorm activity. Initially, the JTWC correctly predicted the low to move northwest. Hurricane Hunters indicated that the low and mid-level centers were not vertically aligned.[1] On July\u00a023, both the JMA and JTWC upped the depression into a tropical storm.[2][5] Bess then began to intensify.[1][3] At 0600\u00a0UTC on July\u00a024, Bess was upgraded to a severe tropical storm by the JMA.[3] After the formation of an eye, both agencies classified Bess as a typhoon.[1][3] By July\u00a024, Typhoon Bess began to move north-northwest and slow down due to the westward building of the subtropical ridge to the north. The JTWC expected Bess to turn west; however, Bess instead turned southwest on July\u00a025 due to interactions with a trough.[1] By this time, the JMA estimated winds of 130\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph).[3] Shortly thereafter, the JTWC increased the intensity of the typhoon to 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph), equivalent to a Category\u00a02 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (SSHWS). After performing a small loop,[1] the storm maintained its intensity until July\u00a027, when the JMA raised the wind speed of Bess to 180\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph).[3] The typhoon then turned north-northwest[1] while slowly intensifying.[5] On July\u00a028, the system turned northwest along the southwestern edge of the ridge.[1] That afternoon, the JMA estimated winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph).[3] Subsequently, Typhoon Bess entered an episode of rapid deepening.[1] Only a few hours later, the JMA reported that Bess had attained its peak intensity of 230\u00a0km/h (145\u00a0mph), which it would maintain for 12\u00a0hours. At 0000\u00a0UTC on July\u00a029, according to the JMA, the typhoon attained a minimum barometric pressure of 900\u00a0mbar (27\u00a0inHg).[3] Later that morning, the JTWC estimated that Bess attained its peak intensity of 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph), a Category\u00a05 hurricane-equivalent on the SSHWS,[1] though JMA data suggests that Bess was weakening by this time.[3] At this time, Typhoon Bess was located 460\u00a0km (285\u00a0mi) to the southeast of Iwo Jima.[1] After slowing down further, Bess curved north along the southern periphery of a weakness in the subtropical ridge. Even though the JTWC expected Bess to recurve well east of Japan within 36\u00a0hours, this did not materialize.[1] On July\u00a030, the JMA lowered the intensity of the typhoon to 190\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph). During the evening hours of July\u00a031, the JMA further the intensity of the storm to 170\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph). Bess continued to weaken[3] while accelerating.[1] The next day, August\u00a01, the JMA downgraded Bess into a severe tropical storm. Later that morning, the JMA downgraded Bess into a tropical storm.[3] Around this time, the tropical storm made landfall along central Honshu. Shortly thereafter, the JTWC reported that Bess was no longer a typhoon. On August\u00a02, Bess merged with a low pressure area over the Sea of Japan.[1] The JMA ceased monitoring the typhoon midday on August\u00a03.[3]"

A peak hourly total of 103\u00a0mm (4.1\u00a0in) was recorded in Toba in Mie. A maximum wind of 104\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph) was recorded at Tsukubasan in Ibaraki.[10] Overall, Super Typhoon Bess was responsible for \u00a5591.6\u00a0billion (US$2.38\u00a0billion) in damage and 95\u00a0fatalities.[11][nb 3] According to police reports, 26\u00a0people were initially missing.[12] A total of 119\u00a0were hurt.[13] Four people were killed in Osaka due to landslides,[6] while two people were buried alive in Yokohama via mudslides.[14] At the foot of Mount Fuji, a series of mudslides buried 36\u00a0vehicles, killed one person and injured five policemen.[15] The landslides stranded approximately 2,000\u00a0persons, including 1,500\u00a0primary school children on a camping trip.[7] In Mie, Bess was considered the worst storm to affect the city in 23\u00a0years, where 17\u00a0fatalities occurred and seven were initially listed missing. Elsewhere, in Nara, a couple was killed and a boy was hurt.[6] Throughout western Japan, five people were rendered missing in heavy rains that caused at least five landslides and damaged 15\u00a0automobiles.[8] Along Tokyo Bay, high waves from Typhoon Bess left windows 11\u00a0stories high coated with salt.[6] Although Tokyo was on the eastern edge of the storm, large trees were uprooted nevertheless due to high winds. Five people were wounded in the city.[16] Many cars and trucks were stranded due to mudslides;[17] air traffic was also paralyzed.[18] In all, 43\u00a0dwellings were destroyed and 17,000\u00a0homes were flooded. Due to the storm, 59\u00a0roads were impassable. In addition, 42 bridges were destroyed and 785\u00a0landslides occurred.[6] According to railroad authorities, 15\u00a0railroad lines were either totally or partially disrupted due to torrential rains, forcing the cancellation of 27\u00a0scheduled trains and delaying 211\u00a0others. Police reports suggest that 2,857 acres (1,155\u00a0ha) of farmland were flooded, 101\u00a0bridges were washed out, and roads were damaged at 1,094\u00a0places. Additionally, 25\u00a0ships ran aground or were washed away[19] and two boats sunk.[6] A total of 25,000\u00a0individuals were left homeless,[7] including 24,702\u00a0people that were evacuated from their homes.[6] Following the storm, 2,100\u00a0police and firemen dug furiously through mud and debris in search of the missing.[19] The name Bess was previously retired in 1974 and replaced with Bonnie. However, when the list of typhoon names was changed to incorporate male names in 1979, the name was re-introduced to the roster. After this usage of the name Bess, it was retired for the second time and was replaced with Brenda.[20][21]"

As a compact system, rapid intensification continued, with Ken becoming a typhoon on the evening of September\u00a017 and a major typhoon on September\u00a018. The cyclone up to this point had a history of progressing slowly west-northwest, but Ken eventually stalled on September\u00a020 and became a larger cyclone.

        "content": "During mid-September, a monsoon trough was present in the Philippine Sea. On September\u00a014, a\npersistent area disturbance weather was first visible on satellite imagery.[1] On September\u00a015, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started to monitor the system.[2][nb 1] The next day, a Hurricane Hunter aircraft reported a closed atmospheric circulation. Based on this, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) upgraded the storm into a tropical depression, without issuing a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA). Six hours later, the storm was upgraded into a tropical storm.[1] Around this time, the JMA followed suit and upgraded the system into a tropical storm.[2] Initially, Ken was expected by the JTWC to move west and pass near Luzon, but this did not occur. At 0600\u00a0UTC on September\u00a017, Ken was upgraded into a severe tropical storm by the JTWC[1] and the JMA.[2] That evening, Ken was upgraded to typhoon status by both the JTWC[1] and the JMA[2] when the hunters recorded a pressure of 976\u00a0mbar (28.8\u00a0inHg).[1] Ken continued to gain strength; at 1800 UTC on September 18, the Hurricane Hunter aircraft reported winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph). This wind speed is equivalent to a low-end Category 3 typhoon on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS). Several hours later, the JTWC reported that Ken attained peak intensity of 200\u00a0km/h (125\u00a0mph) while centered about 800\u00a0km (495\u00a0mi) east-southeast of Taiwan.[1] The typhoon moved west-northwest at a slower rate than expected, but on September\u00a019, Typhoon Ken, a subtropical ridge moved west-southwest, moving into south China and the South China Sea. As such, many tropical cyclone forecast models showed Ken turning north-northeast, but Ken began to stall on September\u00a020 instead.[1] Around this time, the JMA estimated peak wind speeds of 110\u00a0mph (175\u00a0km/h) and a peak pressure of 940\u00a0mbar (28\u00a0inHg).[2] Initially, Ken was small, but around this time the storm began to grow in size. The cause of the structural change is unknown, but it is possible that some dry air got induced into the storm's circulation, which also caused the eye to collapse[1] and the storm to weaken.[2] By September\u00a021, Ken began to move erratically due to a deepening trough that was centered north of Typhoon Ken before taking off in the general direction of Japan. Weakening ensued thereafter due to increased wind shear. By September\u00a023, the JWC reported that winds had diminished below Category 2-equaivlent strength on the SSHWS[1] while the JMA reported winds of 130\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph).[2] At this time, Ken was located around 650\u00a0km (405\u00a0mi) south of Tokyo. By the next day, however, this weakening trend had leveled off;[1] data from the JMA suggests that the storm did not weaken further until September\u00a025.[1] After according to the JTWC, maintain winds of 135\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph) during September\u00a024, the typhoon weakened slightly. Ken made landfall near Shikoku early on September\u00a025 with winds of 130\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph), and after weakening a little according to the JTWC, Ken passed over Honshu. That day, the system moved into the Sea of Japan, where it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while producing winds just below typhoon-force.[1] Despite this, the JMA kept an eye on the system for two more days.[2]"

On September\u00a09, Judy attained its peak intensity, with winds of 150\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph).

        "content": "The origins of Typhoon Judy can be traced back from a highly active monsoon trough along the low-latitudes of the Western Pacific basin in the first week of September. Two tropical disturbances soon developed, the first of which later spawned Typhoon Irving. By September\u00a04, the systems developed a surface circulation. Later that day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on the second system.[2][nb 1] This system rapidly became better organized, and on September\u00a05, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) starting watching the second system.[4][nb 2] Following an increase in organized thunderstorm activity near the center, the JTWC started issuing warnings on Tropical Depression\u00a019 at 1600\u00a0UTC that day. At 2200\u00a0UTC on September\u00a06, Hurricane Hunters reported winds of 80\u00a0km/h (50\u00a0mph) and a pressure of 994\u00a0mbar (30\u00a0inHg). Based on this, both the JTWC and the JMA upgraded the depression into Tropical Storm Judy early the next day.[2][4] Tropical Storm Judy was initially expected by the JTWC to move west-northwest because a subtropical ridge was expected to build north of the system. However, the ridge did not build, which enabled Judy to track northeastward under the influence of a tropical upper-tropospheric trough (TUTT) located to north of the cyclone.[2] Meanwhile, the storm held its intensity of about 36\u00a0hours, but on September\u00a07, the JMA upgraded the low into a severe tropical storm.[4] Due to the lack of wind shear, Judy continued to intensify.[2] Meanwhile, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration also briefly monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Susang.[1] At 0600\u00a0UTC on September\u00a08, the JMA upgraded the system to typhoon status. The storm intensified slightly thereafter, and early the next day, the JMA estimated that Judy attained peak intensity of 150\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph) and a pressure of 950\u00a0mbar (28\u00a0inHg).[4] Later on September\u00a09, the JTWC reported that Judy reached peak intensity of 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph), equivalent to a mid-level Category\u00a02 hurricane on the United States-based Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.[2] Shortly after its peak, cool air began to take a toll on the system as it ingested the remnants of the TUTT. By late on September\u00a09, virtually all deep convection associated with Judy was removed from the center.[2] Based on this, the JMA lowered the intensity of the system to 130\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph). Moving slower than expected due to the strong northwesterly flow over the Sea of Japan, the system became better organized due to a brief decrease in wind shear.[2] However, Typhoon Judy failed to intensify further.[4] On September\u00a011, Judy began to accelerate in the general direction of Japan as interaction with the TUTT ceased. The next day, wind shear once again increased significantly; consequently, thunderstorm activity decreased along the southwest portion of Judy.[2] Despite this, no change in intensity occurred.[4] At 0800\u00a0UTC on September\u00a012, Judy moved onshore at Omezaki Point on Honshu,[2] while still producing hurricane-force winds.[4] Four hours later, however, the JMA demoted Judy to a severe tropical storm.[4] Midday on September\u00a012, the JTWC downgraded Judy to a tropical storm.[6] Several hours later, the agency noted that Judy had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone,[2] with the JMA following suit the next day. On September\u00a015, the JMA ceased monitoring the system.[4]"

It was a near normal Atlantic hurricane season, although it was the least active since 1946.[1] The season officially started on June\u00a015;[2] however, a pre-season unnamed storm formed on Groundhog Day, becoming the only storm on record in the month of February. The other six tropical cyclones were named using the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet, the first of which formed on August\u00a018. The final storm of the season dissipated on October\u00a028, two and a half weeks before the season officially ended on November\u00a015.[3] Four of the tropical cyclones made landfall during the season, the first being the February tropical storm that crossed southern Florida. The first hurricane, named Able, struck South Carolina with winds of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h), causing heavy damage near the coast and widespread power outages. It moved up most of the East Coast of the United States, leaving 3\u00a0deaths and widespread damage. As a developing tropical cyclone, Hurricane Charlie caused damaging flooding and landslides in southwest Puerto Rico. The final and strongest of the season, Hurricane Fox, struck Cuba with winds of 145\u00a0mph (233\u00a0km/h); it killed 600\u00a0people and left heavy damage, particularly to the sugar crop, reaching $10\u00a0million (1952\u00a0USD, $115\u00a0million 2024\u00a0USD)."

Early on February\u00a03, the storm struck Cape Sable, Florida and quickly crossed the state.[4] The Miami National Weather Service office recorded a wind gust of 68\u00a0mph (109\u00a0km/h) during its passage.[5] The winds damaged windows and power lines,[6] catching residents and tourists off-guard.[7] The cyclone also dropped 2\u20134 inches (51\u2013102 millimetres) of precipitation along its path, causing crop damage in Miami-Dade County.[5] After leaving Florida, the storm briefly transitioned into a tropical storm on February\u00a03, the only tropical or subtropical storm on record in the month. The storm continued rapidly northeastward, reaching peak winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h). On February\u00a04 it evolved into an extratropical cyclone off the coast of North Carolina. Later that day, it passed over Cape Cod, and early on February\u00a05 dissipated after crossing into Maine.[4] The storm caused scattered power outages and gusty winds across New England.[8]"

It moved generally west- to west-northwestward for much of its duration, intensifying into a tropical storm on August\u00a024 east of the Lesser Antilles.[4] The next day, Hurricane Hunters confirmed the presence of Tropical Storm Able. Passing north of the islands, the storm attained hurricane status on August\u00a027. On August\u00a030, Able turned to the north-northwest due to an approaching cold front, and the next day made landfall near Beaufort, South Carolina as a Category 2 hurricane with peak winds of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h).[1][4] The town was heavily damaged,[9] and was briefly isolated after winds downed power and telephone lines.[10] Across South Carolina, the hurricane caused two indirect deaths, as well as moderate damage totaling $2.2\u00a0million (1952\u00a0USD, $25.2\u00a0million 2024\u00a0USD).[1] As Able turned north and northeastward over land, the winds quickly weakened to tropical storm force, although it retained gale-force winds through North Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland; this was due to remaining over the flat terrain east of the Appalachian Mountains, as well as retaining a plume of tropical moisture from its south. It left light damage in North Carolina, some of it due to a tornado.[1] In Maryland, heavy rainfall caused widespread flooding, which washed out the tracks of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad near Baltimore. In Ellicott City, Maryland, the rains flooded several houses, forcing families to evacuate.[11] Two tornadoes were also reported in the region, and damage in the Washington, D.C. area reached $500,000 (1952\u00a0USD, $5.74\u00a0million 2024\u00a0USD). Further northeast, the storm continued to produce heavy rainfall, causing flooding, as well as one indirect death in Pennsylvania.

Based on the structure, it is estimated that the frontal low developed into a tropical storm by 18:00\u00a0UTC that day. Ship reports in the region suggested peak winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h). There was very dry air on the west side of the system, unusual for August, and the radius of maximum winds was around 115\u00a0mi (185\u00a0km), suggesting that the structure could have been akin to a subtropical cyclone. The storm continued to the northwest, making landfall very near Myrtle Beach, South Carolina at 02:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a028. It spread rainfall across the Carolinas, later enhanced by Hurricane Able just days later, while cities reported winds of around 35\u00a0mph (56\u00a0km/h). The storm weakened over land and dissipated late on August\u00a028 over eastern Kentucky.[12]"

Forming at a latitude of 42.0\u00b0N, this system is notable for being the northernmost forming tropical cyclone in the Atlantic hurricane database, dating back to 1851.[4] The system moved west-southwestward, atypical for cyclones in that region during September. On September\u00a09, the storm turned to the southeast, reaching estimated peak winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h), based on ship observations. Moving slowly through the northern Azores, the storm produced winds of 35\u00a0mph (56\u00a0km/h) along Terceira Island. It slowly weakened, and by late on September\u00a010 the system degraded into a tropical depression. By the next day, the system was interacting with an approaching cold front, indicating that the depression had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. Around 20:00\u00a0UTC, the storm moved ashore the southwestern tip of Portugal with gale-force winds.

The circulation became disrupted while crossing Hispaniola, although it reorganized near the Turks and Caicos Islands and became Tropical Storm Charlie before reaching those islands.[1] On September\u00a025, Charlie attained hurricane status,[4] and due to its continued northwest motion, the Weather Bureau advised small craft to remain at port in the southeastern United States coast.[18] However, the hurricane turned to the north and northeast on September\u00a026, during which the Hurricane Hunters recorded peak winds of 120\u00a0mph (195\u00a0km/h).[4] It briefly threatened Bermuda, prompting the United States Air Force to evacuate its fleet of airplanes from Kindley Air Force Base.[19] Charlie ultimately northwest of Bermuda, and later began weakening.

Fox subsequently turned to the north, intensifying to a major hurricane as it passed west of the Cayman Islands. Late on October 24, the cyclone struck the small island of Cayo Guano del Estes in the Archipelago de los Canarreos, south of Cienfuegos, Cuba. It struck the island with peak winds of 145\u00a0mph (233\u00a0km/h), and the island reported a minimum pressure of 934 millibars (27.6\u00a0inHg). Shortly thereafter, Fox crossed the mainland coast of Cuba west of Cienfuegos, and it weakened while crossing the island.[4][1] Hurricane Fox crossed Cuba in a rural area dominated by sugar plantations, with heavy damage reported to 36\u00a0mills. In one town, the hurricane destroyed about 600\u00a0homes and damaged over 1,000\u00a0more.[1] Across the island, the strongest winds downed large trees and washed a large freighter ashore.[20] Heavy rainfall affected all but the extreme eastern and western end of the island, with a peak of 6.84\u00a0in (174\u00a0mm) near Havana.[21] The rains flooded low-lying areas and caused rivers to exceed their banks.[20] Throughout Cuba, Hurricane Fox killed 600 people,[22] and left behind heavy damage totaling $10\u00a0million (1952\u00a0USD, $115\u00a0million 2024\u00a0USD).[20] Fox was among the strongest hurricanes to strike the country.[23] After crossing Cuba, Fox emerged into the Atlantic Ocean with winds of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h), crossing central Andros and turning eastward though the Bahamas.[4] On New Providence, the hurricane dropped 13.27\u00a0in (337\u00a0mm) of rainfall,[21] Strong winds caused severe crop damage, leaving 30% of the tomato crop destroyed.[1] After briefly restrengthening to a major hurricane, Fox began a steady weakening trend.

The severity of lightning during the storm caused many women to faint according to The New York Times.[4] The five homes destroyed were wood-frame, two-and-a-half-story buildings, one of which was lifted off its foundation and flipped over before falling to the ground, being demolished on impact.[4] One of the home's occupants was killed after the chimney fell on her.[6] Another person died from shock after seeing her home destroyed.[7] The other four homes were all located within 0.5 miles (0.80\u00a0km) of each other. One of the destroyed homes belonged to Walter Sarles; he saw the tornado approaching his home and saved his life by jumping out a window before the home was rolled over by the tornado. Another home belonged to Mrs. Hester Cox; she sustained minor bruises after her home was also rolled over. Nearby, the home of Mr. Marrow was also destroyed; at the time of the tornado, he, his daughter and his niece were inside. The home was turned over on its side; debris injured the two girls, knocking the niece unconscious.[4] A barn belonging to Charles Dodge was destroyed, while the Kensico Cemetery sustained significant hail damage. All the glass on one of the conservatories was shattered. Within hours after the tornado, nearby firefighters rushed to the hamlet to assist victims of the storm. During the nighttime hours, they patrolled the streets and watched over destroyed homes to prevent looters from stealing any valuable items left in the debris.[4] Property damage from the tornado was estimated at $100,000 (1904 USD) and five families were left homeless. Following an assessment of the damage, debris from destroyed homes was found upwards of 3 miles (4.8\u00a0km) from Chappaqua, including a marriage certificate.

Deep convection was mainly confined to the northern portion of the system; however, a band of cloud cover had begun to wrap around the center of circulation during the afternoon.[1] Later that day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began monitoring the developing low as a tropical depression.[2] Hours later, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the system as convection consolidated around the center of circulation. Further development was anticipated as the storm slowly moved through an area of warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear, conditions favoring tropical cyclone formation.[3] Early on May\u00a03, the JTWC classified the system as Tropical Depression 02W.[4] Following the formation of a central dense overcast,[5] both the JTWC and JMA upgraded the depression to a tropical storm, at which time it received the name Chan-hom.[2][4] Situated to the north of a weak subtropical ridge, little movement was expected over the next two days.[5] Modest strengthening took place as Chan-hom drifted slowly towards the north before taking a more northeasterly path.[2][4] By the morning of May\u00a05, the storm developed a symmetrical cloud cover with notable banding features.[5] According to the JMA, maximum sustained winds within the cyclone had reached 95\u00a0km/h (59\u00a0mph), prompting the agency to upgrade Chan-hom to a severe tropical storm.[2] On May\u00a06, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) began issuing advisories on Chan-hom as it moved into their area of responsibility and assigned it the local Philippine name Emong.[6] Within hours of PAGASA's first advisory, the JTWC assessed Chan-hom to have attained winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0km/h), equivalent to a Category\u00a01 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale.[4] The JMA followed suit six hours later, classifying the system as a minimal typhoon.[2] Further intensification took place as the typhoon's outflow improved in response to a mid-latitude trough over central China.[5] Several hours before making landfall along the western coast of Luzon on May\u00a07, an eye-feature began to develop. Satellite imagery depicted a depression in the cloud cover over the center of circulation as well as a broken ring of deep convection.[5] In light of this information, the JTWC assessed Chan-hom to have reached its peak intensity at this time, packing sustained winds of 160\u00a0km/h (99\u00a0mph) and an estimated barometric pressure of 956 mbar (hPa; 28.23\u00a0inHg).[4] However, the JMA stated that the typhoon was slightly weaker, having maximum winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0km/h) and a pressure of 975 mbar (hPa; 28.79\u00a0inHg).[2] Just prior to crossing the coastline, the storm began to weaken as wind shear increased. Within hours of moving over the mountainous terrain of northern Luzon, the cyclone quickly diminished. The low-level circulation became detached from convection and pressure readings over land indicated a minimum pressure around 1004 mbar (hPa; 29.65\u00a0inHg). Although wind shear remained at unfavorably high levels,[5] Chan-hom maintained tropical storm intensity through its crossing of Luzon through the end of May\u00a08.[2][4] By May\u00a09, all that remained of Chan-hom was an exposed low-level circulation with convection displaced over 185\u00a0km (115\u00a0mi) to the east. With the addition of dry air entering the system, the storm was not expected to regain strength as it began to take a northward turn.[5] Around this time, PAGASA issued their final advisory on the system as they assessed it to have degenerated into a non-convective remnant low-pressure system.[7] The JTWC issued their initial final advisory on Chan-hom during that morning;[5] however, later analysis determined that the system remained a tropical depression until the morning of May\u00a011.[4] The JMA and JTWC continued to monitor the remnants of Chan-hom through May\u00a013, at which time its low-level circulation collapsed to the southeast of Okinawa, Japan.[2][4] However, the remnant low of Chan-hom briefly regenerated into a tropical depression on May 14, before finally dissipating on the next day."

Typhoon Parma was named by PAGASA as Pepeng when it entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility days after Typhoon Ketsana wreaked havoc on the country; Parma spared the capital and instead lashed the northern part of Luzon island. Parma added to the damage brought about by the earlier Typhoon Ketsana, affecting thousands of families on the north, especially in the province of Pangasinan where the San Roque Dam inadvertently released water to prevent its breach. However, in the first week of October, Parma interacted with the incoming Typhoon Melor on the Pacific (via a Fujiwhara interaction), rendering it stationary as it made landfall on Southern Taiwan. Days later, the greatly weakened Parma retreated back to Luzon, making further landfalls on Ilocos Norte and Cagayan. The now Severe Tropical Storm Parma then began to wane its strength, as it crossed Luzon island for the second time. It then emerged on the South China Sea as a tropical depression, before restrengthening into a tropical storm and striking Hainan and Vietnam before finally dissipating in October 14. Parma's bizarre, long-lived, and erratic track over northern Luzon led to near-record levels of rainfall,[1] causing devastating flooding that led to Parma becoming one of the deadliest typhoons to hit the Philippines in a decade. Due to the high death toll and damages, both the JMA and PAGASA retired Parma and Pepeng from their respective naming lists. Both storm names will never be used for another typhoon again."

After being classified, the depression remained weak and poorly organized, as it lay close to Tropical Storm 18W. During September 28, as the depression moved away from 18W, the JTWC reported that the depression had intensified into a tropical storm despite it remaining poorly organized, and acquired the name Parma. Parma started to intensify to a typhoon as it moved closer to the Philippines. On October 1, Parma reached its peak intensity with winds of 250\u00a0km/h (155\u00a0mph). Afterwards, Parma started a weakening trend as it moved closer to the Philippines, and on October 3 made landfall northern luzon, Philippines.[3][4] During its landfall in the Philippines, Parma began to travel northwest towards China. It slowed down and weakened (due to interactions with Typhoon Melor), then turned back south towards the Philippines. Parma made a second landfall on October 6 with sustained winds of 105 kilometres per hour (65\u00a0mph).[3] It weakened to a tropical depression before emerging off the east coast of Luzon on October 7, remaining stationary for a day. On October 8 it made a third landfall the eastern coast of Cagayan, then moved slowly across Luzon, eventually emerging in the South China Sea.[3] After regaining some strength, it travelled westward and hit the island of Hainan, China, with winds of 39 miles per hour (63\u00a0km/h).[5] It then made a final landfall in Vietnam on October 13, and dissipated over the country on October 14.[5]"

The Maharlika Highway in Ilagan, Isabela to Cagayan became hardly passable due to the trees and electric posts that fell when Pepeng battered the area. Total power interruption also crippled the provinces of Kalinga, Apayao, and the northern towns of Isabela. In Kalinga, landslides were reported on roads linking the provincial capital, Tabuk, to upland towns. In Zambales, at least 2,100 families were evacuated as Pepeng brought heavy rains causing the Bucao River to swell. The Carael section of the Zambales highway became impassable due to rising floodwaters.[46] Due to heavy downpour, the San Roque Dam in Eastern Pangasinan and Pantabangan Dam in Nueva Ecija was forced to release huge amount of water. It caused major flooding in Tarlac which is their neighbouring province and also caused flooding Eastern and Central Pangasinan as well as Nueva Ecija.

        "content": "Typhoon Morakot, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Kiko, was the deadliest typhoon to impact Taiwan in recorded history. The eighth named storm and fourth typhoon of the 2009 Pacific typhoon season, Morakot wrought catastrophic damage in Taiwan, killing 673 people and leaving 26 people missing, and causing roughly NT$110 billion (US$3.3\u00a0billion) in damages. Morakot originated as a tropical depression in the West Pacific on August 2. The system initially moved northeastward, before taking a westward track, developing into a tropical storm on August 3, with the JMA giving it the name Morakot. The storm gradually strengthened as it moved towards Taiwan, intensifying into a Category 1-equivalent typhoon on August 5. Morakot reached its peak intensity on August 7, with a minimum central pressure of 945 millibars (27.9\u00a0inHg), maximum 10-minute sustained winds of 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph), and maximum 1-minute sustained winds of 150\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph). Afterward, Morakot's forward motion slowed and the system gradually weakened, making landfall on central Taiwan later that day as a severe tropical storm. Over the next day, Morakot slowly meandered over Taiwan, before emerging into the Taiwan Strait and turning northward, making landfall on Mainland China on August 9. Afterward, Morakot accelerated northward while gradually weakening, before later turning northeastward. On August 11, Morakot degenerated into a remnant low in the East China Sea, before dissipating on August 13, over northern Japan. The storm produced copious amounts of rainfall, peaking at 2,777\u00a0mm (109.3\u00a0in), far surpassing the previous record of 1,736\u00a0mm (68.35\u00a0in) set by Typhoon Herb in 1996. The extreme amount of rain triggered enormous mudflows and severe flooding throughout southern Taiwan. One landslide (and subsequent flood) destroyed the entire town of Siaolin, killing over 400 people. The slow-moving storm also caused widespread damage in China, leaving eight people dead and causing $1.4\u00a0billion (2009 USD) in damages. Nearly 2,000 homes were destroyed in the country and 136,000 more were reported to have sustained damage. In the wake of the storm, Taiwan's government faced extreme criticism for the slow response to the disaster and for initially deploying only roughly 2,100 soldiers to the affected regions. Later, the number of soldiers working to recover trapped residents increased to 46,000. Rescue crews were able to retrieve thousands of trapped residents from buried villages and isolated towns across the island. Days later, Taiwan's president Ma Ying-jeou apologized for the government's slow response publicly. On August\u00a019, the Taiwan government announced that they would start a NT$100\u00a0billion (US$3\u00a0billion) reconstruction plan that would take place over a three-year span in the devastated regions of southern Taiwan.[1] Days after the storm, international aid began to be sent to the island. The storm also caused severe flooding in the northern Philippines that killed 26 people due to the enhancement of the southwest monsoon."

The JTWC further designated the system as Tropical Depression 09W, as deep convection had increased over the low-level circulation center, and the agency reported that the storm was moving around a low-level ridge of high pressure, which was located to the east of the Morakot's low-level circulation center. On the morning of August 4, the JTWC reported that the Morakot had steadily intensified into a tropical storm, as 1-minute sustained wind speeds were estimated to be near 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph), with deep convective banding building toward the low-level circulation center, under the influence of a subtropical ridge located to the east of the system. Later that day, the JMA reported that Morakot had intensified into a severe tropical storm, before it was upgraded to a typhoon by both the JMA and the JTWC early the next day. Initially, the JTWC anticipated that Morakot would intensify into a powerful typhoon while approaching China, peaking as a Category\u00a04-equivalent typhoon on the Saffir\u2013Simpson Hurricane Scale (SSHWS). However, due to the size of the typhoon, while the barometric pressure steadily decreased, the maximum winds only increased slightly. Early on August\u00a07, the storm attained its peak intensity, with a central minimum pressure of 945 millibars (27.9\u00a0inHg) and maximum 10-minute sustained winds of 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph), according to the JMA. The JTWC reported the storm to be slightly stronger, with maximum 1-minute winds peaking at 150\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph), the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson Hurricane Scale. Morakot's forward motion slowed, and the storm weakened slightly before making landfall in central Taiwan later that day, as a severe tropical storm. Roughly 24\u00a0hours later, the storm emerged back over water into the Taiwan Strait and turned northward, before making landfall in Mainland China on August\u00a09, as a severe tropical storm. The storm gradually weakened as it continued to slowly track inland, with the storm's forward motion gradually increasing, with the system eventually turning northeastward on August\u00a011. Later that day, Morakot degenerated into a remnant low in the East China Sea, before making landfall on South Korea early on the next day, and then making another landfall on northern Japan on August\u00a013. The remnants of the typhoon dissipated shortly afterward."

They then placed Northern Cagayan, Apayao, Ilocos, and Norte under PSWS 1 later that day, as it moved toward Taiwan. They kept these warnings in place until early on August 8, when they revised the warnings downgrading the signal for Northern Cagayan, Apayao, Ilocos and Norte, while putting Babuyan and Calayan Islands under PSWS 1 and then early the next day PAGASA released their final warning and downgrade all signals for the Philippines.[14]"

The rainfall in Pingtung County exceeded 2,600 millimetres (100\u00a0in), breaking all rainfall records of any single place in Taiwan induced by a single typhoon.[25] Airlines in Taiwan did hold some flights in and out of airports, but seaports were closed. Electricity supplies were cut to approximately 25,000 homes.[26] Siaolin Village, a mountain village with 1,300 residents in Jiasian Township, was buried by a massive landslide (and subsequent flood) that destroyed the town, and  resulted in 465 deaths.[27] It was reported that all roads toward Namasia Township were either blocked or washed away by severe mudflows. Hundreds of residents were trapped for four days, and were running out of food and water. In addition, water and electricity had been cut.[28] Other affected areas included the Taimali River mouth, the Zhiben River catchment, the Gaoping River bridge linking Linyuan and Xinyuan townships at the boundary between Kaohsiung and Pingtung counties, and several catchments in Pingtung County where the rivers flow into the Taiwan Strait.[29] A rescue helicopter, working to retrieve survivors of the mudflow crashed into a mountain side early on August\u00a011, killing the three occupants. Crews were unable to reach the wreckage due to the steep terrain.[30] A swollen river in Taitung County undermined 51 homes and swept them away into the Pacific, leaving numerous residents homeless. No people were in the homes when they collapsed into the river.[31] In the famous Zhiben Hot Springs area, the six-story Jinshuai Hotel was destroyed when it collapsed into the Zhiben River after being undermined by flood waters. Several stores in front of the hotel were washed away days earlier as the river continued to overflow its banks and inundate nearby towns and cities. Running water in Tainan County to 280,000 was shut down as flood waters contaminated the local reservoir.[32] Twenty bridges were destroyed due to the typhoon, with eight being on a Provincial Highway. Seven of those on a highway were in Kaohsiung or Pingtung.[33][34][35] Additionally, at least 16 landslide dams were formed during the typhoon.[36][37][38] Most of the damage done to railways are located in the south on the Pingtung, Taitung, and South Link lines. Also, the Alishan Forest Railway saw some serious damage.[39] According to the Ministry of Education, 1,273 schools were affected by the typhoon, accumulating a loss of $1.87 billion NTD. The National Museum of Prehistory, National Science and Technology Museum, and Fonghuanggu Bird and Ecology Park were all damaged by the typhoon.[40][41] According to statistics of the Morakot Post\u2010Disaster Reconstruction Council up to February 4, 2010, the disaster resulted in 677 deaths, 4 severely injured, and 22 missing persons, as well as an additional 25 bodies that were not identified: a total of 728 persons (cases).[42] The record-breaking rains also caused catastrophic agricultural losses, with estimates reaching NT$9\u00a0billion (US$274\u00a0million). At its peak, roughly 1.58\u00a0million were without power across the island and over 710,000 were without water pressure.[43] Tourism losses due to the typhoon were estimated to be at least NT$800\u00a0million (US$24.4\u00a0million).[44] The Council of Agriculture estimates that a total of NT$19.217 billion (US$605\u00a0million) was lost due to the typhoon, making it the second-costliest typhoon behind Typhoon Herb in 1996. Out of this, farms lost NT$12.9 billion, fisheries lost NT$4.7 billion, and livestock lost NT$1.6 billion.[45] However, Morakot also ended a month-long drought and replenished reservoirs enough to warrant an end to water rationing.[46] Typhoon Morakot caused Zengwen Reservoir, which was originally short on water, to suddenly exceed capacity.[47][48] In response to the excess water, the reservoir released over 100,000,000 liters of water, which is about 80% of the dam's total capacity.[49][50] The release of water caused severe flooding along the Zengwen River; in Xiaobei Village in Madou Township, the water level reached a story high.[51] The \"Little Three Links\" between Kinmen of the Republic of China and Xiamen of the People's Republic of China was suspended. Almost all reservoirs in Kinmen County were full. Winds at Force 13 on the Beaufort scale were recorded in the Matsu Islands.

Helicopters were rushed to Siaolin to retrieve as many residents as possible and transport them to shelters. By August\u00a011, nearly 300 residents were confirmed to have been moved to safety. During the afternoon, one helicopter crashed into a mountainside while carrying three crew members. All three crew members died. Continuing standards set up after the 1999 Jiji earthquake, the Government of Taiwan provided NT$1\u00a0million for each family member killed or missing and NT$250,000 for the critically injured.[82] The military was dispatched with responding to the disasters all around the country with transporting food and aid around.[83] After the typhoon, soldiers were also used in cleanup and rebuilding.[84] An estimated 15,815 soldiers were used in total. With the assistance of firefighters and policemen, an estimated 41,752 people were rescued.[85] Due to the severity of the damage in Siaolin access to the area was restricted to military personnel only.[86] Major-General Richard Hu said it is still too early to state how many villagers had been buried, military rescuers just know that 90% of the homes of the three villages were buried by the landslide.[87]\n[88] On August 15, the Executive Yuan formed the \"Typhoon Morakot Rebuilding Committee\". The 37 person committee was given a budget of $116.5 million NTD to rebuild infrastructure and economic losses. The committee has built 3,481 permanent housing units in 40 locations and repaired most damaged roads.[89] However, there was controversy surrounding the relocation of people to these new housing units.[90] The Executive Yuan announced that all flags be placed at half-mast in mourning between August 22 and 24.[91] After the flooding, many organizations began raising money for rebuilding in areas affected by the typhoon. Special programs were aired on national TV to fundraise. Additionally, a fundraising festival named \"Spread the Love\" was held, featuring prominent TV personalities Matilda Tao, Chang Hsiao-yen, and Shen Chun-hua. The event lasted for 7 hours and was aired on national TV and raised $500 million NTD. Many large corporations also donated money to the cause, including Chi Mei, Evergreen, Delta Electronics, Foxconn, Formosa Plastics, TSMC, Cathay United Bank, and Asus. The Chunghua Post released a special edition stamp, with all proceeds going to helping rebuild. President Ma Ying-jeou and his administration have been criticised because of the slow response to Typhoon Morakot. The government was initially found to have rejected foreign aid, then to have quickly reversed that decision in response to criticism, citing that the rejection was only temporary. Vice Foreign Minister Andrew Hsia has tendered his resignation for authorizing Taiwan's diplomats to turn down foreign aid, a decision done without the consent of more senior officials.[92][93][94] Immediately after the typhoon, large civilian and military search-and-rescue operations were deployed.  Helicopters were sent to numerous mountain villages, including Siaolin, in an attempt to rescue locals who were unable to escape by foot.[citation needed] It was discovered that almost 400 people had vanished, and are presumed to have been buried alive when a massive mudflow wiped out 90 per cent of the village's homes.[citation needed]  Similar stories have been reported from other small villages in the vicinity of this region.[citation needed] The record-breaking rains also caused catastrophic agricultural losses, with estimates reaching NT$14.59 billion (US$443 million).[95] Fund raising shows such as Artistes 88 Fund Raising Campaign were held in Taiwan and Hong Kong.[96] Taiwanese aborigines protested against the 14th Dalai Lama during his visit to Taiwan after Typhoon Morakot and denounced it as politically motivated.[97][98][99][100] The government relocated several Rukai villages following the damage to southern Taiwan.[101]:\u200a123\u200a This mandated move threatened Rukai culture and prompted Rukai groups to begin community-based conservation programs to help local Rukai communities assert sovereignty over traditional lands.[101]:\u200a123 The Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits donated a total of $450 million Renminbi ($2 billion RMB) to rebuild. They specified that $150 million TWD be used on building 500 units of recovery housing and $1.7 billion TWD be used on rebuilding infrastructure.[102] The Mainland Affairs Council estimated that around $4 billion NTD was donated by China. Also, around $130 million NTD was donated by Taiwanese companies in China.[103][104][105] The Xiaolin Village Memorial Park was opened in January 2012 to commemorate the village victims from the typhoon."

The JTWC then reported later that day that the depression had intensified into a Tropical Storm, however the JMA did not follow suit until early the next day when they assigned the international name of Mirinae to the storm as it passed over the island of Rota in the Northern Mariana Islands. As Mirinae entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility on October 28, the PAGASA assigned Mirinae the local name \"Santi\", the nineteenth named storm of the Philippines. Mirinae intensified steadily, eventually becoming a Category 2 typhoon, with peak winds of 105\u00a0mph (165\u00a0km/h). Due to increasing wind shear and its fast movement, Mirinae didn't intensify further. At this time Mirinae turned to the south-west, which it tracked for several days until its landfall along the province of Quezon at the night of October 30, with Mirinae as a Category 2 typhoon. As it left the Philippines, Mirinae has weakened to a tropical storm, with winds of 65\u00a0mph. It trekked the South China Sea, with Mirinae not intensifying beyond tropical storm force due to increasing wind shear and decreasing sea surface temperatures, as well as cooler and more stable air along the area. It ultimately made landfall on Vietnam on November 2, as a Category 1 typhoon. Mirinae quickly dissipated inland the same day.[citation needed]"

The storm had weakened into a Category 1 typhoon as it made its first landfall in the southern portion of Tokushima Prefecture, Japan, at 12:00 UTC then a second landfall in Himeji, Hyogo Prefecture around 14:30 UTC on August 23.[6] Cimaron continued weakening as it turned north-northeastward, transitioning into an extratropical cyclone over the Sea of Japan at 12:00 UTC on August 24. Just 6 hours later, the extratropical remnants dissipated.[1]"

        "content": " Typhoon Maria, known in the Philippines as Super Typhoon Gardo, was a powerful tropical cyclone that affected Guam, the Ryukyu Islands, Taiwan, and East China in early July 2018. Developing into the eighth named tropical storm of the 2018 Pacific typhoon season and passing the Mariana Islands on July\u00a04, Maria strengthened into the fourth typhoon of the season and underwent rapid intensification the next day amid favorable environmental conditions. The typhoon reached its first peak intensity on July\u00a06; subsequently, Maria weakened due to an eyewall replacement cycle, but it reintensified and reached a second, stronger peak intensity on July\u00a09 with 10-minute sustained winds of 195\u00a0km/h (121\u00a0mph) and a minimum pressure of 915\u00a0hPa (mbar; 27.02\u00a0inHg). Over the next three days, it started to gradually weaken due to another eyewall replacement cycle and decreasing sea surface temperatures. After crossing the Yaeyama Islands and passing north of Taiwan on July\u00a010, Maria ultimately made landfall over Fujian, China, early on July\u00a011, before dissipating the next day. Early in its lifetime, Maria brought winds of tropical storm force to Guam, damaging aircraft at Anderson Air Force Base and knocking out power across the island. Damage in Guam was valued at US$150,000.[nb 1] On July\u00a010, Maria brought strong winds to Okinawa Prefecture, inflicting significant crop damage. Losses in the prefecture reached JP\u00a5853.7\u00a0million (US$7.730\u00a0million).[nb 2] Simultaneously, Maria produced heavy rains and strong winds across Taiwan, killing one and injuring eight. Power to nearly 60,000 households was cut and agricultural damage was around NT$1.3\u00a0million (US$43,000). From landfall to dissipation, Maria impacted the Chinese provinces of Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Hunan with flooding rain and gusty winds. At least 510,000 people in coastal regions evacuated and one person was killed in Jiangxi. Around 9,300 houses and over 37,000 hectares (91,000 acres) of cropland were damaged. Schools and workplaces were closed in parts of Fujian and more than 200 flights were cancelled. Train and ferry services were also disrupted. Power outages were widespread in Fujian, where more than 320,000 customers lost power. Economic losses across China were about CN\u00a54.16\u00a0billion (US$629\u00a0million)."

        "content": "On July\u00a03, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) declared that a tropical depression had formed at 00:00\u00a0UTC about 500\u00a0km (310\u00a0mi) southeast of Guam.[2][nb 3] The broad system tracked northwest around a region of high atmospheric pressure to its north as it began to consolidate,[4] with the United States-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) determining that the system had become a tropical depression at 12:00\u00a0UTC.[5] Amid rather favorable environmental conditions encompassing high sea surface temperatures of 30\u201331\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u201388\u00a0\u00b0F), low-to-moderate wind shear, and wind patterns in the upper troposphere aiding the development of thunderstorm activity,[6] the system intensified modestly, with the JTWC assessing that it became a tropical storm at 00:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a04.[5] Twelve hours later, the JMA stated that the depression had become a tropical storm and named the system Maria.[2] On July\u00a05, Maria began to rapidly intensify as it developed an eye feature.[7] The satellite presentation of the cyclone improved drastically over the next 24\u00a0hours, with the eye contracting to a diameter of 20\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi). The JTWC assessed that Maria became a super typhoon at 00:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a06,[nb 4][9] possessing maximum sustained winds of 250\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph).[5][nb 5] Immediately after, Maria began to undergo an eyewall replacement cycle, with microwave satellite imagery revealing that a new eyewall had developed and encircled the original eyewall.[11] The JMA, however, assessed that Maria continued to strengthen to reach an initial peak intensity at 12:00\u00a0UTC with winds of 195\u00a0km/h (121\u00a0mph) and a central pressure of 925\u00a0hPa (mbar; 27.32\u00a0inHg).[2] Some weakening took place on July\u00a07 as Maria went through the eyewall replacement cycle, with the JTWC assessing that Maria had dropped below super typhoon strength.[5] A developing high-pressure area to Maria's northwest caused the system's forward motion to decrease while the inner eyewall dissipated and the outer eyewall began to contract.[12] However, Maria did not immediately restrengthen as upper-level wind patterns temporarily became unfavorable.[13] More substantial reintensification occurred on July\u00a08 as Maria began to accelerate northwest once again and the system regained super typhoon strength at 00:00\u00a0UTC.[14] The JTWC judged Maria to have reached its peak intensity at 12:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a08 with winds of 270\u00a0km/h (170\u00a0mph), equivalent to Category\u00a05 status on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale.[5] Displaying a well-defined eye 37\u00a0km (23\u00a0mi) wide, the system maintained an impressive satellite presentation into July\u00a09,[15] when the JMA estimated Maria reached peak intensity with winds of 195\u00a0km/h (121\u00a0mph) and a minimum pressure of 915\u00a0hPa (mbar; 27.02\u00a0inHg).[2] Late on July\u00a09, Maria developed concentric eyewalls once again, indicating another eyewall replacement cycle was underway. Combined with decreasing upper oceanic heat content along the cyclone's path, Maria began to weaken steadily as it turned to the west-northwest.[16] At 21:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a09, Maria entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility and received the local name Gardo.[17] As the system passed north of Taiwan on July\u00a010, frictional effects with the island's mountains as well as increasing northerly wind shear further weakened the cyclone.[18] At 01:10\u00a0UTC on July\u00a011, Maria made landfall over the Huangqi Peninsula\u00a0[zh] of Lianjiang County, Fuzhou in Fujian, China.[19] At the time, the system possessed 10-minute sustained winds of 155\u00a0km/h (96\u00a0mph) and 1-minute sustained winds of 175\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph). Rapid weakening took place once Maria moved inland, with the storm degrading to a tropical depression by 18:00\u00a0UTC. The remnant system continued inland and dissipated over Hubei before 00:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a013.[5][2]"

Storm surge from Maria combined with the astronomical high tide to create tides exceeding warning levels by up to 0.93\u00a0m (3.1\u00a0ft). A tide gauge at Shacheng in Fuding, Fujian observed a record high tide of 4.4\u00a0m (14\u00a0ft) above mean sea level.[40] Across Fujian and Zhejiang, about 37,300 hectares (92,000 acres) of cropland suffered damage, of which 2,500 hectares (6,200 acres) was completely destroyed. About 800 people in Zhejiang were rescued by emergency services, and 200 houses were damaged to varying degrees. In Fujian, 8,800 houses were damaged and another 300 were destroyed.[19] Widespread power outages occurred in Fujian: over 86,000 customers in Lianjiang County and another 240,000 customers in Fuzhou lost power. Knee-deep flooding occurred in some residential areas in Fuzhou, where the police deployed 1,623 personnel to assist in flood control efforts. Fujian's water infrastructure suffered CN\u00a576\u00a0million (US$11\u00a0million) worth of damage.[35] Communications in Fujian were severely disrupted, with 2,901 base stations taken offline and 315\u00a0km (196\u00a0mi) of networking cables damaged according to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.

The aurora could be seen as far south as Texas and Florida.[6] As this occurred during the Cold War, some people worried that a nuclear first strike might be in progress.[6] Others incorrectly considered the intense auroras to be associated with the Space Shuttle mission STS-29, which had been launched on March 13 at 9:57:00\u00a0a.m.[7] The storm caused significant interference to the United States power grid.[8] Substantial communications blackouts occurred. The burst caused shortwave radio interference, including the disruption of radio signals from Radio Free Europe into Russia. It was initially believed that the signals had been jammed by the Soviet government.[citation needed] As midnight came and went, a mass of charged particles and electrons in the ionosphere flowed from west to east, inducing powerful electrical currents in the ground.[6] Some satellites in polar orbits lost control for several hours. GOES weather satellite communications were interrupted, causing weather images to be lost. NASA's TDRS-1 communication satellite recorded over 250 anomalies caused by the increased particles flowing into its sensitive electronics.[6] The Space Shuttle Discovery was aloft at the time and suffered a sensor malfunction: a sensor on one of the tanks supplying hydrogen to a fuel cell showed unusually high-pressure readings on March 13.

Extreme geomagnetic storms were registered in 2003 and 2024, both sparking northern lights as for south as Florida. Because of serious concerns that utilities have failed to set protection standards and are unprepared for a severe solar storm such as the Carrington Event, in 2013, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) ordered the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) to create standards that would require power grids to be somewhat protected from solar storms and equipment to be continuously tested for possible effects of solar storms.[18][19] After a technical conference and public comment, the final rule utilities must use for testing equipment and directing future research was published in September, 2016.[20] The 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident prompted the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to examine the sufficiency of cooling systems of stored spent fuel rods of nuclear power plants now considered vulnerable to long-term power outages, which could also be caused by space weather, high-altitude nuclear burst electromagnetic pulses (EMPs), or cyber attacks.[21][needs update]"

Deep convection was located southeast of a broad and elongated low-level circulation.[6] Conditions remained favorable for further development[7] as the depression began consolidating despite an exposed low-level circulation,[8] and on August 16 at 00:00 UTC, the JMA upgraded the depression to a tropical storm, giving it the name Soulik.[9] Convective banding began to wrap into the still-exposed low-level circulation, and at 03:00 UTC, the JTWC also upgraded Soulik to a tropical storm.[10] Soulik then organized rapidly as its low-level circulation became more defined,[11] and at 18:00 UTC, the JMA further upgraded Soulik to a severe tropical storm.[12] By 21:00 UTC, a low-level eye feature appeared as its structure began to rapidly improve,[13] and on August 17 at 03:00 UTC, the JTWC upgraded Soulik to a typhoon.[14] At 12:00 UTC, the JMA also upgraded Soulik to a typhoon as it was steered by a mid-level subtropical high-pressure area.[15] Soulik then rapidly intensified into a severe typhoon, and on the next day, Soulik reached its peak intensity, with winds of 165\u00a0km/h (103\u00a0mph), and remained that intensity for several days. It also began to display some annular characteristics. After passing the Ryukyu Islands early on 22\u00a0August, the storm gradually weakened due to low sea-surface temperatures.

The twenty-fifth tropical storm, eleventh typhoon and 6th super typhoon of the 2018 Pacific typhoon season, Kong-rey originated from a tropical disturbance in the open Pacific. For a couple days, it went westward, organizing into a tropical depression on September 27. Then it intensified into a powerful Category 5 super typhoon early on October 2. Kong-rey underwent an eyewall replacement cycle after its peak intensity, causing it to weaken into a Category 3 typhoon under unfavorable conditions. Kong-rey then struck South Korea on October 6 as a tropical storm. Kong-rey transitioned into an extratropical cyclone later that day while impacting Japan. A total of 3 people were killed by the storm, including 2 people from South Korea. In South Korea, damage nationwide totaled at \u20a954.9 billion (US$48.5 million). Although Kong-rey did not make a direct landfall on Kyushu or Shikoku, its outer rainbands affected the two islands. At an area in Shikoku, rain accumulated to 300\u00a0mm. In Nagasaki, more than 12,000 families lost power; in Fukuoka Prefecture, a person died because of the rain, mostly due to drowning. Agricultural damage in Okinawa and Miyazaki Prefecture were about JP\u00a513.99 billion (US$123 million)."

Unrelated to Kong-rey, Hurricane Walaka was a Category 5 hurricane and Kong-rey had Category 5-equivalent intensity at the same time, marking the first time since 2005 when two tropical cyclones of Category 5 strength existed simultaneously in the Northern Hemisphere.[14] Kong-rey underwent an eyewall replacement cycle the following day and weakened due to it,[15] and cause the deep convection to diminish. However, the storm had excellent equatorward outflow, with a tropical upper tropospheric trough cell contributing by enhancing it.[16] On October 3, Kong-rey entered a pool of cooler sea surface temperatures caused by upwelling generated by Typhoon Trami, weakening the system.[17] Furthermore, the eye had become less-defined.[18] Kong-rey continued to deteriorate, with initially cold convective cloud tops warming up along with the banding features unraveling, and the eye becoming covered by clouds.[19] The banding became fragmented by October 4, and the rate of disintegration increased after tracking over an area of low ocean heat content and cold dry air, despite being in an area of low wind shear.[20] After passing the Ryukyu Islands, Kong-rey weakened into a tropical storm while steering northward, after convection over the center had greatly reduced.[21] On October 5, Kong-rey steered north-northeastward as a cyclone developed over the storm, which along with a mid-latitude trough, offsets the outflow with high vertical wind shear.[22] Kong-rey accelerated northeastward under the influence of the westerlies on October 6 and began transitioning into an extratropical cyclone,[23] making landfall in Tongyeong, South Gyeongsang Province in South Korea as a high-end tropical storm.[24] The JMA would keep monitoring the cyclone until it had dissipated on October 7.[13]"

The season produced fifteen named storms and a total of eight hurricanes, which was near normal. However, the total of one major hurricane was below the average of three. The strongest tropical cyclone of the season was Hurricane Norma, which was a powerful Category\u00a03 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson Hurricane Scale. The storm caused six deaths \u2013 five in Texas, and one in Mexico, due to severe flooding. Additionally, the storm caused $74\u00a0million (equivalent to $248\u00a0million in 2023) in damage, which is credited to significant crop damage and many tornadoes. However, the deadliest tropical cyclone of the season was Tropical Storm Lidia, which made two landfalls \u2013 one on the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula and the other along the shores of Sinaloa in early October.

The season's one major hurricane, a storm with winds of at least 111\u00a0mph (179\u00a0km/h), was below the average of three.[5] There are also at least two tropical depressions that did not strengthen into tropical storms.[6]\nSix tropical cyclones made landfall in Mexico. First, Tropical Storm Adrian made landfall 240\u00a0mi (390\u00a0km) east-southeast of Acapulco, but did not cause any damage. Afterwards, Tropical Storm Irwin made landfall in Baja California Sur, but similarly to Adrian, did not cause any damage. Tropical Storm Knut later made landfall near Mazatl\u00e1n with winds equivalent to a minimal tropical storm, but no deaths or damage was reported. Tropical Storm Lidia struck about 23\u00a0mi (37\u00a0km) south of Los Mochis on October\u00a08, with winds of 45\u00a0mph (75\u00a0km/h). Heavy rainfall associated with the cyclone caused moderate damage in northwestern Mexico, and at least seventy-three deaths can be attributed to the storm. On May 30, an area of intense shower and thunderstorm activity located 270\u00a0mi (430\u00a0km) south of the Mexican coastline.[4] The second to strike the area in 10\u00a0days, Norma was absorbed by a frontal system on October 14.[7] The combined entity produced heavy rainfall and severe weather across Texas, which subsequently led to severe crop damage. The final storm to make landfall on Mexico during the 1981\u00a0season was Hurricane Otis. Intensifying into a hurricane by October 26, the hurricane brushed the coast of Jalisco before making landfall near Mazatl\u00e1n at hurricane intensity on October 30.

The eleventh tropical cyclone and ninth named storm of the 2019 Atlantic hurricane season, Imelda formed out of an upper-level low that developed in the Gulf of Mexico and moved westward. Little development occurred until the system was near the Texas coastline, where it rapidly developed into a tropical storm before moving ashore shortly afterward on September 17. Imelda weakened after landfall, but continued bringing large amounts of flooding rain to Texas and Louisiana, before dissipating on September 21. Impacts began when Imelda made landfall as a weak tropical storm. The system brought heavy rain and dangerous flooding to parts of southeastern Texas (especially the cities of Galveston and Beaumont) as its motion gradually slowed over land. Dozens of water rescues were needed by September 19 as areas became overwhelmed by the rainfall, with some areas experiencing over 43 inches (1,100\u00a0mm) of rain. Total damage is estimated in excess of $5\u00a0billion (2019 USD).[1] Despite the storm causing substantial damage, the name Imelda was not retired following the season, making Imelda the second-costliest Atlantic tropical cyclone name on record to not be retired, with the costliest being Hurricane Sally the following year.[2][3][4]"

Once over the Gulf, associated convection began to increase, as a weak surface trough formed within the upper\u2014level low on September 14, traversing to the west\u2014northwest.[5] That same day, the National Hurricane Center began to monitor the low for possible tropical cyclogenesis.[6] Although, the NHC only gave the disturbance a low chance of formation. By September 17, the system had reached the east coast of Texas.[7] Soon afterward, organization in the system rapidly increased, and at 17:00 UTC that day, the system organized into Tropical Depression Eleven, just off the coast of Texas.[8] At 17:45 UTC, an observation deck at Freeport, Texas recorded sustained winds of 40\u00a0mph (65\u00a0km/h) with gusts of 47\u00a0mph (76\u00a0km/h), indicating that the depression had strengthened to Tropical Storm Imelda.[9] Shortly thereafter, at 18:30 UTC, Imelda made landfall near Freeport, Texas at peak intensity, with maximum 1-minute sustained winds of 45\u00a0mph (75km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 1,003 millibars (29.6\u00a0inHg).[10] Imelda weakened after landfall, becoming a tropical depression at 03:00 UTC on the next day. At that time, the NHC passed on the responsibility for issuing advisories to the Weather Prediction Center (WPC).[11] Imelda retained status as a tropical depression over land for the next 2 days, gradually weakening and slowing its motion, before degenerating into a trough on September 19, as it began passing over Louisiana; Imelda's remnants continued producing heavy rain and a few isolated tornadoes.[12] Imelda's remnants persisted for another couple of days, before dissipating early on September 21.[13][14]"

Over one thousand vehicles were caught in flood waters. Many homes and businesses were also flooded, resulting in numerous high-water rescues. Approximately 8,200\u00a0homes were flooded in Harris, Jefferson, Liberty, and Montgomery counties in Texas.[5] Five deaths were directly attributed to the floods, of which three occurred in Jefferson, while two occurred in Harris County.[5][23][24][25] The National Centers for Environmental Information estimated Imelda inflicted $5\u00a0billion in damage.[5] Jefferson County, Texas, was the county most heavily impacted by Imelda.[5] An estimated 5,100\u00a0homes were flooded in the county, suffering $14\u00a0million in damage.[5][20] Major street flooding occurred in Beaumont where the Jefferson County flooding first began.[22] Over 38 inches (97\u00a0cm) of rain fell in the city.[26] Encroaching floodwaters prompted the evacuation of Riceland Medical Center in Chambers County, Texas.[5][27] Stream flooding persisted for days in Hardin County, Texas, where 10\u201340\u00a0in (250\u20131,020\u00a0mm) of rain was measured. Many buildings and roads were rendered impassable.[28][5] Sixty homes were flooded in the county, resulting in $2.3\u00a0million in damage. In Orange County, Texas, Imelda flooded 2,679\u00a0homes, resulting in $12\u00a0million in damage. Near Mauriceville, Cow Bayou reached its second-highest crest on record. In Jasper and Newton counties in Texas, an estimated $2.4\u00a0million in damage was incurred following the flooding of 15\u00a0homes.[20] In Houston, Imelda's rainfall caused many of the local bayous to overtop their banks and flood residential areas. More than 1,000\u00a0people were rescued from floodwaters. All bus and rail services were temporarily shut down in the city. A roof of a United States Postal Service building collapsed, leaving three people with minor injuries. George Bush Intercontinental Airport closed for about 90\u00a0minutes due to flooding on the runways, canceling 655\u00a0flights.[29] Throughout Houston, hundreds of homes were affected by flooding and more than 1,600\u00a0vehicles were towed. In Harris County alone, 422\u00a0people required high-water rescue; the Texas National Guard rescued 130\u00a0people.[30] During the flood, nine barges escaped a shipyard, and at least two struck the Interstate\u00a010 bridge over the San Jacinto River, causing visible damage to some of the columns supporting the highway.[31][32] The bridge was subsequently closed to traffic in both directions.[33] Significant flooding occurred in Splendora, inundating parts of FM 2090 and U.S. 59, as well as gas pumps at a filling station.[34] Within the weeks following Imelda, aid from FEMA was not received.

At Baton Rouge Metropolitan Airport, an embedded thunderstorm within one of Imelda's rainbands produced a microburst that flipped four airplanes and damaged hangar doors on September\u00a017; the airport registered a peak gust of 66\u00a0mph (106\u00a0km/h).[5][38] Storm surge also resulted in minor coastal flooding along the upper Texas and Louisiana coasts, inundating areas with 1\u20132\u00a0ft (0.30\u20130.61\u00a0m) of water. A National Ocean Service gauge at Eagle Point, Texas, measured a peak surge height of 2.35\u00a0ft (0.72\u00a0m) above normal tide levels.

The sixteenth depression and fourteenth named storm of the erratic 2019 Atlantic hurricane season, Nestor originated from a broad area of low pressure over the Western Caribbean. It emerged in the Gulf of Mexico and began to organize slightly, becoming Potential Tropical Cyclone Sixteen due to its threat to the Southeastern United States.

Later that evening on October 18, the circulation improved and became more defined, while the system was finally designated Tropical Storm Nestor.[7] Nestor began to then accelerate to the northeast aided by a ridge to its northeast, although wind shear generated by a nearby trough almost embedded within the northern side of the cyclone began to give Nestor a lopsided appearance on satellite imagery shortly after its designation.[8][9] Due to Nestor's broad nature, gale-force winds were already beginning to be observed near the coast of Florida Panhandle.[10] The system began to slow down as wind shear generated by the trough caused the storm to weaken as it neared the Florida Panhandle coast. Nestor rapidly lost its tropical characteristics due to interaction with this trough, and was declared to have become an extratropical cyclone early on October 19, however still bringing storm surge and heavy rains to the coast anyway.[11] Nestor's post-tropical remnant then made landfall in St. Vincent Island, Florida with winds up to 45\u00a0mph,[12] becoming further disorganized across the Southeastern United States for the next couple of days.

Heavy rain and the surging waves generated by the storm system also caused flash flooding in parts of the region, with some areas topping with 4 inches of rain.[16] These rains, however, proved to be somewhat beneficial. A drought in the Southeastern United States was relieved as Nestor and its post-tropical remnant brought rain to the areas, with a meteorologist stating \"The rain on the whole was a positive for the entire region \u2013 unless you had outdoor plans.\".[17] Perhaps the legacy of Nestor, however, was the small tornado outbreak it caused across the Southeastern United States. Although Nestor was not classified as a tropical cyclone anymore at the time of its landfall, it spawned numerous supercells, which ultimately led to the spawning of several tornadoes. The National Weather Service (NWS) confirmed six tornadoes, one reaching EF2 status.[16] One of the tornadoes, only reaching EF0 status, was recorded in Seminole, Florida and damaged a mobile home park.[18] An EF2 tornado which tracked 9 miles also touched down in western Polk County, damaging over 50 homes and other buildings, including a middle school. The tornado also overturned an 18-wheeled vehicle which fell on top of a SUV, but no injuries were reported.[19] The next day, an EF1 tornado formed near Cape Coral in Lee County damaging several homes. No injuries or deaths were reported from any of the tornadoes.[20][21] An EF0 landspout tornado was sighted in Micco, but it caused no damage.[22] One other EF0\u00a0tornado was confirmed in Cordele, Georgia, downing trees, shifting a barn off it foundation, and ripping part of a metal roof off an industrial building.[23] Another EF0\u00a0tornado was confirmed on October 20 on the west side of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, snapping and uprooting numerous trees, including fallen pine trees that damaged to two mobile homes.[24] 3 indirect deaths occurred when heavy rains generated by Nestor's extratropical remnant caused a car crash in South Carolina.[25]"

        "content": "Tropical Depression Fourteen was the last tropical depression of the 1987 Atlantic hurricane season and was the third most destructive storm of the year. The depression formed on October 31, 1987, in the Caribbean Sea, heading along a northward path into the southern Gulf of Mexico and into Florida until the system was absorbed on November 4. The path and damage from the depression followed a similar path to Hurricane Floyd earlier in October. The depression peaked in intensity with wind speeds of 35\u00a0mph (56\u00a0km/h) on November 1 with a minimal barometric pressure reading of 1,004 millibars (29.6\u00a0inHg). However, certain barometric readings have considered that the depression may have become a tropical storm. The depression in the time affected several cities and parishes in Jamaica and Cuba, along with causing significant rainfall in southern Florida. Jamaica was the area hardest hit by the depression, claiming the lives of six people and causing about $1.802 million (1987 USD, $3 million in 2009 USD) in damage. The depression caused floods that washed out villages, roads and bridges and caused dozens of landslides on the island. The island also had several rivers overflow including the Rio Minho and Rio Dogna.[1] The damage caused by the tropical depression was comparable to previous flood in June 1986.[2]"

        "content": "Prior to the formation of Tropical Depression Fourteen, the southern Caribbean Sea was under a large area of low pressure. On October 30, satellite imagery showed that the area of pressure was beginning to form into a tropical disturbance. A reconnaissance aircraft was scheduled for the next morning to investigate the forming system, but by 1400 UTC on October 31, the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida had upgraded the system to a tropical depression based on the imagery and surface data. At this time, the specialists at the Hurricane Center believed that this was its most developed stage of its lifetime.[3] The depression began a movement to the northwest upon formation and on the night of October 31, the depression ran into a newly forming upper-level low near the Yucatan Peninsula. The interaction with the upper-level low caused shearing in the depression, and broke apart the previous low-level circulation that was developing. By the morning of November 1, the depression was nothing more than a swirl of low-level clouds near the center of circulation. After this, the depression could no longer attain the circulation it had previously developed. During the period of November 2 and 3, the depression moved to the northeast, crossing over the islands of Jamaica, Cayman and Cuba and then entering the southern parts of the Gulf of Mexico.[3] On occasion, the convection of the system would flare up, and in the early morning hours of November 3, the Naval Air Station at Boca Chica, Florida reported winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h), which would mean the depression may have attained tropical storm status. A similar report was filed at the Air Force Station at Cudjoe Key. After another reconnaissance flight was sent out to study the system, and recorded that surface area temperatures had dropped, the flight-level winds had reached 92\u00a0mph (148\u00a0km/h) and the surface area pressure had reached 998 millibars (29.5\u00a0inHg).[3] In the evening and overnight hours of November 3, the tropical depression continued to the northeast, making landfall in Florida at a location near Tampa Bay. The depression crossed Florida, weakening significantly, and becoming extratropical. After emerging from land in the Atlantic Ocean on November 5, the depression had become a low pressure area once again and was last spotted that day near the Carolina Capes.[4]"

        "content": "The flash flood warnings released in relation to Tropical Depression Fourteen were centered in the area of Jamaica, which would later receive rainfall in excess of 9 inches (230\u00a0mm) as the center of the depression moved across the island.[5] In the United States, the National Hurricane Center issued two tropical storm warnings in Florida. The first was from the middle and lower islands of the Florida Keys to the area of Dry Tortugas on November 1. The warning lasted only 24 hours, with the warning ending on November 2. The second issued tropical storm warning was from the area of Fort Myers Beach to Cedar Key on November 3. This also lasted only 24 hours and was discontinued on November 3.[6]  Forecasters also suggested on November 2 that boaters should avoid the area in or around Key Largo.[7] Wind gusts from Tropical Depression Fourteen exceeded 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) near the Cudjoe Key Air Force Base on November 3. The Naval Air Station at Boca Chica reported gusts around 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) and sustained winds of about 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) on November 2. The highest recorded winds over Cuba reached 25\u00a0mph (40\u00a0km/h) in the capital city of Havana. There were no gusts reported in Cuba however. In Jamaica, gusts to 58\u00a0mph (93\u00a0km/h) were reported in the city of Kingston and sustained winds of about 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h).[8] Ships also reported tropical storm force winds, reaching as high as 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) with seas of 32.5 feet (9.9\u00a0m).[9] As the depression was moving to the west of the island of Jamaica, it caused significant rainfall on several parts of the island. Over a three-day period from October 31 to November 2, the rainfall reached as high as 10.21 inches (259\u00a0mm) at the capital city of Kingston, with a daily high of 6.38 inches (162\u00a0mm) on November 1.[10]  The significant rainfall caused major damage and issues on the island, with an estimated 1,000+ people being displaced from their homes and being placed into government shelters. Several residential communities were totally underwater from the rainfall, with local roads being washed away from landslides and floodwater, but these were restored quickly. The government of Jamaica also reported that three bridges were washed away from the heavy rain and resulting floods.[5][11] According to the government, the country received $587,500 (1987 USD) of damage to the highways and streets, $11,000 (1987 USD) to the utilities around the island, $836,000 (1987 USD) to the agriculture system and about $372,000 to the health system. The total damage reached $1.802 million (1987 USD, $3 million in 2009 USD) on the island of Jamaica alone.[1] There were also six recorded fatalities from the system.[3] In Cuba, the reported rainfall amounts reached about 4.75 inches (121\u00a0mm) in the community of Bahia Honda, along with 2.03 inches (52\u00a0mm) in the capital of Havana, and 2.75 inches (70\u00a0mm) in the community of Saua La Grande.[12] Although by the time the depression had reached the United States was undeveloped, the remains caused significant rainfall in several states in southeastern United States, with a peak of 10.23 inches (260\u00a0mm) at the Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge in Florida. The city of Miami reported rainfall totals of 4.42 and 5.90 inches (112 and 150\u00a0mm) in the community of Tavarnier. Rainfalls above 1 inch (25\u00a0mm) were reported in eastern Georgia, southern South Carolina, eastern Mississippi and eastern Alabama. Rainfalls in other areas went unrecorded.[10] Outside the damage in Jamaica, the damage to Cuba and the United States were minimal, with no other reported casualties.[3]"

Herb made its first landfall on the island of Taketomi, in the Ry\u016bky\u016b Islands, before its second landfall in northern Taiwan as a Category\u00a04 on July 31. The eye of the storm passed directly over the capital, Taipei. Herb weakened as it crossed Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait, to make landfall in China as a strong Category\u00a02. Herb rapidly weakened over the country and dissipated on August 3."

On 2\u00a0September, an area of deep atmospheric convection within this zone began to consolidate into a tropical disturbance near Guam. At this time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center\u00a0(JTWC) began to monitor the system. Tracking northwestward, the disturbance steadily organized. Early on 4\u00a0September, analysis showed that the system had developed a well-defined low-level circulation center. At 0000\u00a0UTC the following day, the JTWC upgraded the low-pressure area to tropical depression intensity,[1] while the storm system was situated roughly 1,300\u00a0km (810\u00a0mi) east of Manila in the Philippines.[2] The rate of intensification quickened during the day, and at 1800\u00a0UTC the depression intensified into tropical storm strength, earning it the name Sally.[1] Tracking north-northwestward, Sally attained typhoon intensity by 0600\u00a0UTC on 6\u00a0September.[1] At the time, the typhoon had a minimum barometric pressure of 990\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.24\u00a0inHg) according to the Japan Meteorological Agency\u00a0(JMA). Rapid intensification followed shortly afterwards, with the typhoon reaching the equivalent of Category\u00a03 intensity by 0600\u00a0UTC on 7\u00a0September.[3] Ten hours later, the JTWC upgraded Sally to super typhoon status.[nb 1] At 1800\u00a0UTC, the JTWC assessed Sally to have peaked in strength with maximum sustained winds of 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph), equivalent to that of a Category\u00a05 tropical cyclone on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale.[1] The JMA estimated the storm's minimum pressure at the time to be at 950\u00a0mbar (950\u00a0hPa; 28\u00a0inHg).[3] The following morning,[2] Sally accelerated into the South China Sea under the influence of a strong subtropical ridge to the north. Despite its movement over waters, the typhoon steadily weakened as it tracked westward.[1] On 9\u00a0September,[2] Sally made landfall on China's Leizhou Peninsula with winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph). The typhoon briefly tracked over the Gulf of Tonkin before making a second and final landfall just north of the border between China and Vietnam. Upon moving inland, Sally quickly weakened before dissipating over southwestern China on 9\u00a0September.[1]"

As the typhoon strengthened and rapidly approached the Chinese coast, the HKO issued the Strong Wind Signal No.\u00a03 that evening. In the early morning hours of 9\u00a0September, Sally made its closest pass to Hong Kong as it moved 180\u00a0km (110\u00a0mi) off to the south. As such, warnings were raised to the Southeast Gale or Storm Signal No.\u00a08. The signal warning was raised a few hours late and continued to be held for just over 3\u00a0hours, the shortest period of time for which that warning was held since Tropical Storm Wynne in 1984. As effects from Sally subsided, the warning signals were downgraded until all warnings were discontinued shortly before noon on 9\u00a0September.[2] Though the warnings for Hong Kong were lifted early, schools in the colony were suspended throughout 9\u00a0September.[7] As the typhoon approached the Chinese coast, two men became stranded on a cliff in Sok Kwu Wan as a result of the storm. Though they required aerial rescue via helicopter, both men only sustained minor injuries.[8] Passing south of Hong Kong throughout 8\u20139\u00a0September, Sally remained sufficiently south of the province to not cause considerable damage. However, trees, scaffolding, and signboards were toppled by strong winds. A peak gust of 158\u00a0km/h (98\u00a0mph) was measured at a station in Tai Mo Shan. Precipitation remained light, though some localized flooding events were reported. The highest measured rainfall total in Hong Kong was 59\u00a0mm (2.3\u00a0in), though amounts greater than 60\u00a0mm (2.4\u00a0in) were estimated in some areas of the province. Two people were killed\u00a0\u2013 one in Luk Chau village and another in Ma On Shan. In nearby Macau, trees were also uprooted, and low-lying areas were inundated by flooding conditions exacerbated by the high tides caused by Sally.[2] Overall in China, the effects of Sally were catastrophic, particularly in the provinces of Hainan, Guangdong and Guangxi. There, at least 140\u00a0people were known to have been killed by the typhoon, with an addition 130\u00a0unaccounted for and another 2,000\u00a0injured. An estimated 300,000\u00a0homes collapsed and 500,000\u00a0hectares (1.24\u00a0million acres) of farmland were damaged. Offshore, 60\u00a0vessels capsized in high winds. Overall economic losses from Sally were estimated at over \u00a512\u00a0billion (US$1.5\u00a0billion),[2] the largest loss for the region since 1954.[1]"

        "content": "The exact path and strength of the tornado are uncertain, since it occurred prior to modern records which began in 1950. The first tornadoes to directly receive damage ratings on the Fujita scale occurred in 1971.[2]\nThe 1925 tornado was first reported in its formative stage over the Everglades near Hialeah, where several golfers noted a funnel cloud around 1:00\u00a0p.m. Hail was reported with the parent thunderstorm prior to the sighting of the funnel cloud.[1] The slow movement of the storm was accompanied by a large number of people outside during the Sunday afternoon, which led to a considerable number of reports; several reports originated from passing motorists. The vortex touched down around 1:15\u00a0p.m., and the tornado was described as a \"very slender\" funnel that frequently lifted from the ground for brief periods.[1] The debris swirling around the rotation was compared to smoke from \"burning oil.\" Later, as it passed west of Miami, the slow-moving tornado passed over and destroyed the state's largest dairy farm, killing one person and injuring 20\u00a0people. Losses from the farm reached $100,000.[1][8] The tornado eventually intensified and destroyed numerous properties northwest and north of the city of Miami, causing at least three deaths. Some residents successfully attempted to flee in automobiles, though the cars were wrecked and some were thrown for distances.[1] The tornado became obscured by rain, weakened, and dissipated over the northern portion of Biscayne Bay, though it destroyed some power poles along the eastern half of its damage path.[1] Hail associated with the storm was measured to 3 inches (7.6\u00a0cm) in diameter, damaging automobiles and residences' roofs. The damage path was less than 100 yards (91\u00a0m) in width,[1] and the funnel was visible for nearly one\u00a0hour.[9] The thunderstorm that spawned the tornado also affected the communities of Ojus, Little River, Biscayne Park, and Lemon City, having traversed the region from Homestead to Fort Lauderdale.[8] In total, the tornado demolished nearly 50\u00a0residences.[9] Five fatalities were related directly to the tornado or injuries from flying debris. One\u00a0of the deaths occurred inside a restaurant; the building was demolished and a cookstove thrown 100\u00a0yd (91\u00a0m).[9] Hundreds of people were homeless after the storm, and several residences were destroyed at Biscayne Park.[10]"

DNMI estimated the strongest sustained winds (10 min. average) and the strongest gusts to have reached 103\u00a0mph (166\u00a0km/h; 46\u00a0m/s) and 138\u00a0mph (222\u00a0km/h; 62\u00a0m/s), respectively.[1] Unofficial records of gusts in excess of 170 knots (87\u00a0m/s) were recorded in Shetland, while Statfjord-B in the North Sea recorded wind gusts in excess of 145 knots (75\u00a0m/s). There were very few fatalities, mainly due to the rather low population of the islands, the fact that the islanders are used to powerful winds, and because it struck in the morning on a public holiday when people were indoors. In Norway there was one fatality, in Frei, M\u00f8re og Romsdal county. There were also two fatalities on Unst in the Shetland Isles. Despite being referred to by some as a 'Hurricane', the storm was Extratropical in origin and is classified as an Extratropical Cyclone."

        "content": "The New Year's Day Storm was classified as an Extratropical Cyclone, also known as a Mid-latitude cyclone, which are common in this part of the world, especially during the winter and autumn months.[2] In Europe, these are habitually referred to as European Windstorms. By 1200 UTC on 31 December 1991 an Atlantic low pressure centre of 985 mb had developed at the left exit of a strong WSW jet stream and was at 57\u00b0N 27\u00b0W. At this time a very sharp thermal trough (cold air) extended from south-west Iceland to the Hebrides with a thermal ridge building (warm air) behind it in the Atlantic.[3] A satellite image at 1600 UTC on 31 December showed a \u2018clear eye\u2019 in the cloud comma which indicates the dry air from the stratosphere descending into the developing low pressure as is a signature of explosive cyclogenesis. By 1800 UTC the low had deepened to 966mb.[3] At midnight (0000 UTC 1 January) the left exit of the jet stream was just behind the top of a sharp thermal ridge just west of Faroe, rapidly deepening the low centre to 957mb. Travelling at a speed of around 55 knots (63\u00a0mph; 102\u00a0km/h; 28\u00a0m/s), the low continued to deepen as it passed over Faroe and to the north of Shetland. Pressure falls were 5mb/hr across Shetland and 7mb/hr across Faroe.[3] The strongest winds arrived over the Shetland islands between 0100 UTC and dawn.[4] The system is described as a 'Weather Bomb' due to its explosive cyclogenesis, exceeding the criteria of deepening by 24 mb in 24 hours greatly.[5] Explosive cyclogenesis usually occurs where dry air from the stratosphere flows down into a developing low pressure area and causes air within the depression to rise very quickly. This will increase its rotation, which in turn deepens the low pressure centre and creates a more vigorous storm.[3] The New Year's Day \u2018Weather Bomb\u2019 may have experienced double explosive cyclogenesis: firstly from the draw-down of cold dry air from the stratosphere and secondly the intercept of this already rapid development in the left exit of the jet stream with the warm air of a marked thermal ridge.[3]"

Norwegian mass media wrote afterwards that it was a once-in-300-years hurricane. Meteorologists suggested rather that it had a wind speed with a repeat period of about 50\u2013200 years varying from region to region.[8] It had the highest wind speed measured in Norway until then, and has not repeated at least for the first 30 years after it. Despite the extremely strong winds, only 1 death was reported in Norway. The maximum gusts recorded in Norway during the storm was 139\u00a0mph (224\u00a0km/h; 62\u00a0m/s),[8] which was recorded at 2 lighthouses; Svin\u00f8y and Skalmen in M\u00f8re og Romsdal county. Furthermore, the strongest 1-minute sustained winds in Norway of 117\u00a0mph (188\u00a0km/h; 52\u00a0m/s), also were registered at these 2 lighthouses which is equivalent to a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale.[9][10][8] The Norwegian Meteorological Institute (MET Norway) (Norwegian: Meteorologisk Institutt) estimated that the wind gusts rose as high as 135\u00a0mph (217\u00a0km/h; 60\u00a0m/s).[11] At \u00c5lesund Airport in Vigra for example, wind gusts of 123\u00a0mph (198\u00a0km/h; 55\u00a0m/s) were recorded.[12] Reliable wind data for the West coast of Norway is difficult to source due to the remoteness of the region. After the storm, a relief action called Aksjon Orkan was set up, based in Oslo, a city which was not affected by the windstorm. Reactions among the populace in the affected areas were mixed. The action was supported by the County Governor of M\u00f8re og Romsdal, but the mayor of Vanylven scorned the perceived intent to collect \"food and clothes for the windstorm victims\", stating the lack of need for such aid.[13] The people behind the action later claimed that this was never the purpose.[14] By the middle of January Aksjon Orkan had collected NOK 600\u2013800,000.[14][15]"

The wind was most severe in the Northern Isles, especially in Shetland. In Shetland, widespread structural damage was reported, and 2 people were killed - after their bird watching hut on Hermaness was destroyed during the violent gales.[16] The depression travelled towards the UK from off the coast of Canada on the 30\u201331 December 1991, travelling at 63\u00a0mph (101\u00a0km/h; 28\u00a0m/s).[3][4] The Met Office recognised the systems progression and subsequently issued warnings for parts of Scotland on the evening of the 31st December.[4]\nThe strongest winds hit the Shetland Isles and Orkney Isles, beginning during the late evening hours of the 31st December 1991, with the strongest winds being from 01:00 to dawn on the 1st January 1992, local time.[4] The strongest winds were recorded at RAF Saxa Vord, located on Unst at the northern tip of the Shetland Islands, which recorded winds gusting to over 197\u00a0mph (317\u00a0km/h; 88\u00a0m/s)[4][3] however, as the station and recording instruments were destroyed, this has not been verified as an official record for the United Kingdom, and peak wind data is unobtainable.[4] Nevertheless, given damage and remoteness of the islands, it is expected that winds in some parts will have most certainly been higher at >200\u00a0mph (320\u00a0km/h; 89\u00a0m/s).[4] *It is important to recognise that due to the strength of winds, many stations failed at reporting values higher than they were programmed to, such as Muckle Flugga. This station was incapable of reporting a value above 150\u00a0kn (170\u00a0mph; 280\u00a0km/h; 77\u00a0m/s), therefore, it reached 150 kn and couldn't go any higher despite winds being stronger. Some stations too were destroyed at a certain threshold, and therefore did not provide data for what the peak winds are estimated to be. The strongest sustained winds were reported at Sullom Voe Harbour on Shetland, with a steady 150\u00a0mph wind reported by ships sheltering in the harbour.[4] These winds are equivalent to those that are found in Category 4 hurricanes on the Saffir-Simpson Scale.[10] Likewise, the strongest gusts were experienced over the northern section of the Shetland Islands, with gusts of over 200\u00a0mph (320\u00a0km/h; 89\u00a0m/s) being reported."

The exterior walls of the lodge were collapsed in on themselves, and the site was deemed unusable, with new lodges arriving from Derbyshire and a complete rebranding off the site.[39] Two wings of the hotel had been 'disintegrated' and blew into the sea 0.5 miles (0.80\u00a0km) away, and the remaining had been punctured by flying wood and glass which embedded the standing walls.[19] In Sundraquoy, a woman narrowly escaped being crushed by a collapsing chimney which landed on her bed whilst she was away from home.[19] A home on West Yell had its roof removed and blown 50 yards across the A968 before dropping back into the earth. In a caravan park in Lerwick, 22 caravans were destroyed, 8 of which had been \"thrown through the air\", seriously injuring 2 people, and an uninsured caravan was toppled after being struck by a neighbouring caravan.[19][4] The museum at Swedish Kirk, constructed as a memorial to Swedish fishermen had been ruined, with the building being launched 20\u00a0ft into the air.[19]"

On November 12, Emma caused significant damage in Okinawa, compounding the effects of Typhoon Charlotte in October. Heavy rainfall and strong winds were reported on the islands, flooding the city of Naha and blocking access off to it due to landslides. Shops in the city lost thousands of dollars in merchandise, while crops in the territory were damaged. Minor damage was reported at American military installations, such as Kadena Air Base, where the total damage was worth US$219,586.50.

Nikkai Maru, a tanker carrying timber from the Philippines, was sunk by the storm on November 12, 800 kilometers (500\u00a0mi) east of Formosa. The tanker had sprung a leak,[13] and 35 of the 38 members of its crew were rescued by Ryuho Maru, which arrived at Naha on November 15.[14] One member of the Nikkai Maru crew drowned, and two were reported as missing.[15] Another tanker, Yoneyama Maru, had its rudder damaged by driftwood near Ishigaki, causing it to drift. The tanker was rescued by a United States Navy ship.[14] In total, officials reported eight vessels were sunk and eight more were missing,[1] with others reporting 47 vessels that were damaged or sunk.[15] Itoman City Disaster Prevention Council recorded 13 vessels sunk in the city's disaster plan in 2006.[16] Several preparations were made before Emma struck Okinawa. American servicemen across the territory received warnings and emergency food and water, while remaining in their homes.[17] American military aircraft stationed in the area were evacuated to other areas in East Asia.[17] Nike Hercules missile testing was cancelled for November 14\u201316 and was rescheduled for the week after. Construction of bleachers for the event was also disrupted.[14] Due to concerns after the landslides caused by Typhoon Charlotte one month earlier,[17] 2,400 residents were evacuated from dangerous areas. There were concerns about food shortages for January 1960, as Charlotte destroyed much of the crops earlier that year.[18] Emma passed Okinawa to the south by 65 kilometers; 40 miles (35\u00a0nmi) late on November 12. At Kadena Air Base, sustained winds of 102\u00a0km/h; 63\u00a0mph (55\u00a0kn) and gusts of 157\u00a0km/h; 98\u00a0mph (85\u00a0kn) were reported.[1] A rainfall total of 129.2 centimeters (50.87\u00a0in) was recorded at the air base.[19] A weather station on a hill near Naha reported a gust of 196\u00a0km/h; 122\u00a0mph (106\u00a0kn).[1] Landslides blocked off roads leading to Naha and many trees were uprooted.[15][18] Power lines were downed and communications were disrupted,[17][18] preventing an early assessment of damage.[17] The storm caused severe flooding in downtown Naha, with low-lying areas submerged under 2.4 meters (8\u00a0ft) of water, forcing residents to move to higher ground.[18] Many shops in the area were damaged by the debris in the flooding, destroying thousands of dollars of merchandise.[15] Crops, which were already damaged by Charlotte, were damaged again by heavy winds and rains. On Amami \u014cshima, one-fourth of Nago was flooded by heavy rains.[18] In \u014cgimi, nine houses were completely or partially destroyed, and 110 houses were flooded or partially flooded.[20] American military installations in the territory were slightly damaged, with several Marine units reporting flooding and damaged buildings and supplies.[18] At Camp Butler, floodwaters rose up to one meter (40\u00a0in), washing debris into one hut Marines resided in.[21] The damage at Kadena Air Base amounted to $219,586.50 (equivalent to $2,295,130 in 2023).[19] At least two people were killed in Okinawa and one fisherman away from the islands during the storm.[14] There were no fatalities or injuries within the number of American servicemen and their dependents.[18] One fisherman previously listed as missing and presumed dead on November 13, Kentoku Kayoda, was found washed ashore after ten days at sea. He survived on rainwater and raw fish, and when he returned home he was able to join a meal of rice cakes which his wife had prepared for his funeral.[22] Cleanup began soon after Emma passed Okinawa, and electricity was restored to the islands late on November 13. Telephone service returned on the next day.[14] Repairs for roads, culverts, and drainage ditches began in February 1960, using $100,000 (equivalent to $1,029,921 in 2023) of funding requested after the storm hit Okinawa.[23]"

The storm continued to intensify as it traveled toward the Japanese archipelago, becoming a typhoon a day after formation. The typhoon peaked with winds of 140 kilometres per hour (85\u00a0mph) while located south of Japan. Wendy made landfalls in Shikoku and Honshu on August 12, and became extratropical on August 13. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) stopped tracking the cyclone on August 15. Wendy caused a large amount of damage in central Japan. The storm flooded thousands of homes and damaged significant tracts of land. Some rivers overflowed and hundreds of bridges were destroyed. Overall, 28 people were killed, and 19 were missing."

The storm was not given the name Wendy until six hours later, when it was operationally upgraded to a tropical storm.[2] The JMA also upgraded Wendy to a tropical storm at 12:00 UTC.[3] Wendy strengthened to 100\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph),[5] with a pressure of 996\u00a0hPa (29.4\u00a0inHg) by August 11 at 00:00 UTC.[3] Operationally, the JTWC upgraded Wendy to a typhoon at 06:00 UTC south of Shikoku, with a reconnaissance flight reporting winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph),[2] but it was revised to 12:00 UTC after analysis. According to the JTWC, Wendy reached peak strength offshore Shikoku, with winds of 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph) on August 12 at 00:00 UTC,[5] but the lowest pressure, 990\u00a0hPa (29\u00a0inHg), was recorded six hours later by the JMA.[3] The typhoon officially made landfall on Shikoku at 08:00 UTC, 39 hours after Virginia made landfall 32\u00a0km (20\u00a0mi) west of the landfall location. Wendy soon made another landfall over southern Honshu later that day, remaining on land for ten hours, and weakening to 75\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph).[2] After reemerging over the Sea of Japan at 18:00 UTC, the winds strengthened slightly to 80\u00a0km/h (50\u00a0mph),[5] and pressure went up to 1,002\u00a0hPa (29.6\u00a0inHg).[3] The storm sped up and made its final landfall over northern Honshu on August 13 at 03:00 UTC, with winds of 80\u00a0km/h (50\u00a0mph) and pressure of 1,004\u00a0hPa (29.6\u00a0inHg).[2] At 06:00 UTC, the JTWC issued its last advisory on Wendy, as it was no longer a hazard.[2] The JMA declared the storm extratropical at the same time, and the agency continued to track the cyclone until it reached near the International Date Line at 18:00 UTC on August 15.[3][6] The development of the storm was considered unusual by the JTWC and the United States Weather Bureau (USWB).[1][2] During most of its duration, Wendy did not sustain a circulation at 200\u2013300\u00a0hPa (5.9\u20138.9\u00a0inHg) levels, and formed over an area of upper level convergence.[1] Wendy also developed within the circulation of Virginia, which lead the JTWC to possibly consider Wendy as Virginia's \"offspring\".[2]"

The twenty-fifth named storm and fourteenth typhoon of the 1981 Pacific typhoon season, Irma originated from an active monsoon trough to the east of the Philippines. Following an increase in organization, the system was first classified on November\u00a018 and was subsequently upgraded into a tropical storm on the next day as it moved westward. After passing near Guam, Irma continued to deepen, and was estimated to have attained typhoon intensity early on November\u00a021. The intensification rate accelerated thereafter, and on the afternoon of November\u00a022, Irma reached its peak wind speed of 205\u00a0km/h (125\u00a0mph). After maintaining this intensity for 16\u00a0hours, Irma weakened considerably due to interaction with the mountainous terrain of the Philippines. On the morning of November\u00a024, Irma moved ashore northeast of Manila, with winds of 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph). The storm rapidly deteriorated overland, but was still believed to have been a typhoon when it emerged into the South China Sea. Irma then began to re-curve towards the northwest while weakening; the cyclone was estimated to have obtained extratropical characteristics on November\u00a026. Affecting an area already severely impacted by Typhoon Hazen, Irma brought significant damage and flooding to the Philippines, especially in the province of Camarines Norte. Additionally, a 15\u00a0m (50\u00a0ft) tidal wave was noted in four towns in the Camarines Sur province, resulting in the deaths of 137\u00a0people. The nearby village of Benagaspasan was nearly demolished, where 47\u00a0fatalities occurred. In all, 595\u00a0were killed due to Irma. A total of 482,678 persons were directly affected by Irma. Irma destroyed or damaged 119,233\u00a0dwellings, which left nearly 40,000\u00a0homeless. A total of 24,137\u00a0families or 141,974\u00a0individuals left their homes, including 57,198 that sought emergency shelter. Overall, damage totaled to $63.3\u00a0million (1981\u00a0USD).[nb 1]"

        "content": "Typhoon Irma originated from an active monsoon within the vicinity of Micronesia. The second of three storms to form within this region in mid-November\u00a01981, the cyclone was first noted on November\u00a010 as a \"zone of strong convection activity\". Although the zone was well-organized, there was initially little to no evidence of a low-level circulation. However, a weak circulation was detected on a few days later, and on November\u00a015, the system was situated to the east of Ponape as satellite imagery indicated that convection was developing. During the next three days, thunderstorm activity waxed and waned as the disturbance moved north and then west. During this time, the disturbance was located 1,100\u00a0km (685\u00a0mi) east of Typhoon Hazen. By November\u00a018, shower activity had improved in both coverage and organization. That afternoon, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) for the disturbance.[1] Within two hours, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began to track the system.[2][nb 2] On the morning of November\u00a019, a Hurricane Hunter aircraft reported winds of 55\u00a0km/h (35\u00a0mph), prompting the JTWC to classify the system as a tropical depression.[1] After passing north of Guam, Irma was upgraded into a tropical storm by both agencies.[4][nb 3] Around this time, the JTWC expected that Irma would pass south of a front and then turn southwest.[1] Tropical Storm Irma began to deepen more rapidly, and on November\u00a020, the JMA upgraded Irma into a severe tropical storm.[2] Thereafter, Irma turned west as a subtropical ridge built north and northwest of the storm, which protected Irma from feeling the effects of strong wind shear.[1] At 1800 UTC on November\u00a020, the JTWC upgraded Irma into a typhoon.[4] Later that evening, a Hurricane Hunter aircraft reported winds of 160\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph) and a pressure of 968\u00a0mbar (28.6\u00a0inHg).[1] Following the formation of a 74\u00a0km (46\u00a0mi) eye,[1] the JMA declared that Irma attained typhoon status at 0000\u00a0UTC on November\u00a021;[2] subsequently, the system passed south of a second cold front. By 0900\u00a0UTC that day, rapid deepening to pressures below 925\u00a0mbar (27.3\u00a0inHg) was anticipated by the JTWC.[1] At 1800 UTC\u00a0on November\u00a021, the JMA raised the intensity of the typhoon to 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph)[2] while the JTWC reported that Irma reached winds of 200\u00a0km/h (125\u00a0mph), equivalent to a Category\u00a03 hurricane on the United States-based Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (SSHWS). Midday on November\u00a022, a Hurricane Hunter airplane reported a pressure of 905\u00a0mbar (25\u00a0inHg). Based on this the JTWC upgraded Irma into a super typhoon.[1] Meanwhile, data from both the JTWC and JMA suggested that Irma reached its peak intensity, with the former reporting winds of 250\u00a0km/h (155\u00a0mph) and the latter reporting winds of 200\u00a0km/h (125\u00a0mph).[4] On that day, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also started to monitor the storm and assigned it with the local name Anding.[6][7] Irma maintained super typhoon intensity for 16\u00a0hours before gradually weakening due to the storm's close proximity to the mountainous terrain of the Philippines. After turning northwest towards a break within the subtropical ridge, Irma moved ashore around 0900\u00a0UTC on November\u00a024, roughly 100\u00a0km (60\u00a0mi) northeast of Manila.[1] At the time of landfall, both agencies estimated winds of 160\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph), equal to Category\u00a02 intensity on the SSHWS.[4] Although the JTWC downgraded Irma to a tropical storm that afternoon just before entering Lingayen Gulf and the South China Sea,[1] the JMA maintained Irma at typhoon intensity throughout the storm's passage of the Philippines.[2] Ten hours later, a Hurricane Hunter aircraft investigated Irma and noted that Irma was poorly organized, with most of the convection sheared off to the north of the center. Influenced by a trough east of Asia, Irma began to re-curve into the Luzon Straits on November\u00a025.[1] Around this time, the JMA downgraded Irma into a severe tropical storm. Early on November\u00a026, the JMA reported that Irma had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone.[2] About 24\u00a0hours later, Irma merged with a cold front in the Ryukyu Islands.[1] On the evening of November\u00a027, both PAGASA and the JMA ceased monitoring Irma.[2][7]"

Relief agencies were placed on standby. Schools were closed.[9] Much of the Philippines, including the capital city of Manila, was placed on typhoon alert.[10] After striking the Philippines, the storm caused widespread damage[1] while becoming the strongest storm to affect the archipelago since 1970.[9] The hardest hit was the province of Camarines Norte along the eastern portion of the island of Luzon.[11] A 15\u00a0m (50\u00a0ft) tidal wave swamped the towns of Garchitorena, Serona, Lagonoy and Caramoan in the Camarines Sur province, situated roughly 230\u00a0km (145\u00a0mi) southeast of Manila. Throughout the aforementioned four towns, 137\u00a0people were killed.[12] Virtually every house was demolished due to storm surge in Benagaspasan,[13] a small town with a population 1,000.[14] A total of 47\u00a0killed in the village. Thirty-seven were injured in Bengaspasan as well.[13] Fourteen survivors sought refuge in a health center 46\u00a0m (150\u00a0ft) from the shore.[15] In Caramoan, only one of 2,000\u00a0homes remained standing;[14] 38 persons were killed. Elsewhere, in Garchitorena, a town with 20,000\u00a0residents,[16] 117\u00a0people perished[17] and only the mayor's house was left standing.[16] The communities of Serona and Lagonoy also suffered heavy damage.[18] Across much of Luzon, Irma flattened houses and flooding streets, resulting in considerable damage. Irma brought down power lines, which led to blackouts along the suburbs of Manila.[19] One army officer died via electrocution while trying to fix the roof of his dwelling[19] in Makati.[20] Many other deaths occurred when they were crushed to death under collapsed houses or killed by flying debris.[20] For instance, two people died when their house on Mindoro Island collapsed and a farmer in Quezon died after being hit by a falling coconut.[19] Elsewhere on Midoro Island, 60 homes were destroyed. Offshore, eighteen fisherman were listed as missing.[20] Twenty-six of the casualties happened in Manila[11] while 12\u00a0others died in the rural town of Daet along the southern part of Luzon due to flooding and falling debris.[21] Due to the storm, iron sheets were littered across the slums of Manila.[20] Communication lines between Daet and Manila were disconnected; many villages between the two location were destroyed. In Lucena, two people were killed and many coconuts were tossed from trees.[22] In Bulacan, civil defense officials advised thousands of inhabitants on the banks of the Angat River to flee as water along the river threatened to overflow their banks. In the Rizal province, one agency reported that it dispatched several army trucks to fetch roughly 2,000\u00a0stranded 12- to 15-year-old boy scouts.[19] In a nearby park, the typhoon blew down houses, power poles, billboards and trees.[20] Even though the Clark Air Base and Subic Bay, both United States-run, sustained little damage, six C-130 transports had to be evacuated to the Kadena Air Base in Okinawa and ships, including the aircraft carrier Constellation.[23] Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos ordered the closure of all government offices in affected areas, which included the capital city of Manila. Additionally, many private offices sent their employees home.[19] A total of 482,678\u00a0individuals were directly affected by the storm.[17] According to press reports, 12,076\u00a0families in six provinces lost their homes.[19] Nearly 40,000\u00a0persons were rendered as homeless.[24] In all, Typhoon Irma destroyed or damaged 119,233\u00a0houses.[25] A total of 24,137\u00a0families or 141,974\u00a0persons left their homes,[20] 57,198 of which fled to evacuation centers because of flash flooding.[26] The aforementioned evacuation camps included schools, town halls, and churches.[27] Overall, damage totaled to $63.3\u00a0million,[7] including $41.8\u00a0million from infrastructure.[6][nb 4] Crop damage was minimal,[20] estimated at $10\u00a0million.[28] Furthermore, 595\u00a0people were killed because of Irma.[29] Seventy-two others were wounded.[25]"

Typhoon Irma originated from a monsoon trough situated near Guam in the Western Pacific Ocean. It slowly developed, with insufficient organization delaying classification as a tropical cyclone. By June\u00a024, organization improved as the system encountered favorable conditions aloft and the disturbance attained tropical storm intensity the next day. Moving west, Irma gradually deepened, and on June\u00a028, it was believed to have attained typhoon intensity. On the morning of June\u00a027, Irma was upgraded into a typhoon. After passing northeast of the Philippines, Typhoon Irma attained its peak intensity on June\u00a029. Accelerating to the north and then the northeast, Irma steadily weakened as it encountered significantly less favorable conditions. The typhoon made landfall in central Japan on June\u00a030. Irma weakened below typhoon intensity the next day, and later on July\u00a01, Irma transition into an extratropical cyclone. The remnants of the cyclone were tracked until July\u00a07, when it merged with an extratropical low south of the Kamchatka Peninsula. Although Irma stayed offshore the Philippines, moisture associated with the storm inundated areas already affected by Typhoon Hal earlier in the week. The capital city of Manila was 60% flooded, resulting in the evacuation of 40,000. Six drownings were reported in the nearby suburb of Quezon City, where 1,000\u00a0families were evacuated. Citywide, eight people were killed. In Olongapo City, seven people were buried because of a landslide. Overall, more than 500,000\u00a0people were directly affected by the typhoon throughout the country. A total of 253\u00a0homes were destroyed, with 1,854\u00a0others partially damaged. Nationwide, 65\u00a0people were killed due to the typhoon and damage totaled $16\u00a0million (1985\u00a0USD). Across Japan, Irma brought widespread flooded that resulted in 1,475\u00a0mudslides, which damaged 625\u00a0residencies. The storm left 650,000\u00a0customers without power. In the Chiba Prefecture, seven people were injured. In the capital city of Tokyo, 119\u00a0trees were toppled, 40\u00a0homes were flooded, 20\u00a0flights were cancelled, 26\u00a0railway lines were suspended, and 25\u00a0roads were flooded, all combining to leave more than 240,000\u00a0stranded. In Izu \u014cshima, 17 boats were swept away and 20\u00a0houses were damaged. Nationwide, 19\u00a0people were killed and 49\u00a0others were injured. A total of 811\u00a0dwellings were destroyed and 10,000\u00a0others were damage. Throughout the country, the storm inflicted $545\u00a0million in damage."

        "content": "During mid-June\u00a01985, the monsoon trough in the Western Pacific retreated eastward to near Guam, spawning several areas of low pressure. At 00:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a017, a tropical disturbance embedded within the monsoon trough was detected by meteorologists on weather satellite imagery about 400\u00a0km (250\u00a0mi) southwest of the island of Ponape. Although the disturbance's surface circulation was initially ill-defined, interaction with an upper-level low (ULL) to the southeast of Guam associated with a broader tropical upper-tropospheric trough (TUTT) enhanced development and thus the low was slow to develop. Moving west-northwest south of a ridge, the disturbance passed 180\u00a0km (110\u00a0mi) south-southeast of the Truk Atoll early on June\u00a018. Following an increase of thunderstorm activity associated with the disturbance in both coverage and organization, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) for the system at noon the same day.[1] During the next three days, the disturbance maintained vigorous, but poorly organized convection. Data from a Hurricane Hunter aircraft on June\u00a019 failed to locate a surface circulation. That afternoon, the TCFA was re-issued. On the afternoon of June\u00a020, the Hurricane Hunters finally founded a closed circulation, but outflow from nearby Typhoon Hal inhibited further development. Early on June\u00a022, the TCFA was cancelled because of a decrease in thunderstorm activity. By June\u00a024, however, vertical wind shear had begun to relax, coinciding with an expansion of the storm's southwesterly outflow channel.[1] Several hours later, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started tracking the cyclone.[2][nb 1] After an increase in thunderstorm activity, the TCFA was re-issued for the fifth and final time on the evening of June\u00a024. Based on a rapid improvement in the system's convective structure and Dvorak classifications of tropical storm intensity, the JTWC upgraded the system to Tropical storm Irma early on June\u00a025.[1] Shortly thereafter, a Hurricane Hunter aircraft measured winds of 80\u00a0km/h (50\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 994\u00a0mbar (29.4\u00a0inHg), though these winds were displaced roughly 150\u00a0km (95\u00a0mi) to the west of the center.[1] Based on this, the JMA followed suit and declared the system a tropical cyclone at 06:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a025.[2] At around the same time, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) started to follow the storm and assigned it with the local name Daling.[4] At midday on June\u00a025, the JMA upgraded Irma to severe tropical storm intensity[2] Initially, the JTWC predicted Irma to follow Hal along the monsoon trough into the South China Sea before curving around a subtropical ridge.[1] Irma slowly deepened, and according to the JMA, the system attained a secondary peak intensity of 115\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph) late on June 25.[2][nb 2] However, by June\u00a026, the JTWC revised its forecast and instead expected the storm to take a more northerly trek. On June\u00a027, Irma's forward speed slowed as it approached the edge of the subtropical ridge situated along the 130th meridian east[1] while intensifying.[2] That morning, both the JTWC and the JMA estimated that Irma attained typhoon intensity;[6] this upgraded was primarily based on data from ship reports.[1] Continuing to intensify, Irma moved northward.[6] However, by June\u00a028, the JMA indicated that Irma leveled off in intensity.[2] At 00:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a029, the JTWC estimated a peak intensity of 170\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph).[7] Six hours later, the JMA increased the intensity of the typhoon to 145\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph), its maximum intensity. At this time, the agency also assessed the pressure of the storm at 960\u00a0mbar (28\u00a0inHg).[2] Shortly after its peak, Typhoon Irma began to accelerate towards the northeast in the direction of central Japan in response to westerlies.[1] Irma quickly weakened, and on the evening of June\u00a029, the JMA decreased the intensity of Irma to 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph).[2] Tracking just east of the Ryukyu Islands,[8] Irma began to acquire extratropical characteristics[1] A Hurricane Hunter flight on June\u00a030 suggested that that typhoon was encountering cooler and drier air, although the storm maintained a 55\u00a0km (35\u00a0mi) eye. That evening, the typhoon made landfall on Honshu.[1] At 00:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a01, the JMA downgraded Irma into a severe tropical storm.[2] Six hours later, the cyclone completed its extratropical transition[1] near Tokyo;[8] the JTWC issued its final warning on the system.[1] The JMA continued the monitor the system as it passed northeast of the Kuril Islands. On July\u00a07, the JMA ceased tracking the system as it had merged with an extratropical low south of the Kamchatka Peninsula.[2]"

These rains resulted in major flooding; Irma was also the second storm to directly affect the nation within a week, following Typhoon Hal.[1] The capital city of Manila sustained flooding along low-lying areas, which stranded motorists.[11] A total of 60% of the city was flooded, forcing the evacuation of 40,000\u00a0persons.[12] Six drownings occurred in the suburb of Quezon City, where 1,000\u00a0families were evacuated, 700\u00a0to\u00a0churches and 300\u00a0to\u00a0schools. Within the Manila metropolitan area, a man and a woman were also electrocuted. All classes in Manila were suspended, and many stores and offices shut down for a day. Furthermore, domestic flights in and out of Manila were canceled since the runway was flooded with water 600\u00a0mm (25\u00a0in) deep. Citywide, eight people were killed. According to press reports, Irma was to worst tropical cyclone to directly impact Manila in over 10\u00a0years.[13] Offshore Bataan, eight fishermen were initially rendered missing after a boat capsized.[13] In Olongapo City, seven people were buried due to a landslide.[12] In the downtown Santa Cruz area, all forms of transportation except for the railroad were immobile.[13] The Makati area sustained waist-deep flooding. Due to both Irma and Hal, 14\u00a0communities in Tarlac were flooded, leaving 375,000\u00a0people displaced,[14] 116,963\u00a0of whom were evacuated to 46 evacuation centers. Seven bridges were also damaged.[15] Overall, 511,067\u00a0people, or 94,661\u00a0families were directly affected by the typhoon. A total of 253\u00a0homes were destroyed, with 1,854\u00a0others partially damaged.[16] Nationwide, 65\u00a0people were killed due to the typhoon. The storm inflicted $13.7\u00a0million in damage to infrastructure and $2.3\u00a0million in damage to agriculture, totaling to approximately $16\u00a0million.[17][nb 3] Upon making landfall on Honshu,[1] Irma became the first tropical system to strike the nation that season. Impacting an area already devastated by prior flooding,[18] Irma deluged the archipelago with additional precipitation.[19] Mount Ontake received 718\u00a0mm (30\u00a0in) of rain throughout the duration of the storm.[20] Additionally, Mount Amagi recorded 18.0\u00a0in (457\u00a0mm) in a day, including 64\u00a0mm (2.5\u00a0in) in an hour,[21] both storm highs in those respective categories.[19] A total of 1,475\u00a0mudslides occurred in Japan, resulting in 625\u00a0damaged homes.[15] Approximately 650,000\u00a0customers were left without power at the height of the storm[22] while 160\u00a0trains were delayed or cancelled, which left 50,000\u00a0people stranded. In Chiba Prefecture, one person was listed missing due to a drowning,[18] where seven persons were also hurt and over 200\u00a0houses were flooded.[23] There, 400,000\u00a0individuals were also stranded due to lack of train service.[22][24] In Tokyo, 119\u00a0trees were toppled and 25\u00a0roads were flooded.[18] Twenty domestic airline flights were cancelled and 26\u00a0railway lines within Tokyo were suspended,[23] leaving 240,000\u00a0people stranded.[22] Throughout the city, at least 40\u00a0dwellings sustained flooding.[23] In Izu \u014cshima, 17\u00a0boats were swept away and 20\u00a0houses were damaged. Offshore, 26\u00a0individuals were rescued from a 5,100 tonnes (5,100,000\u00a0kg) freighter Gloria Fortuna.[18] Throughout the country, 493\u00a0people sought refuge in shelters.[25] In all, 19\u00a0people were killed[26] and 49\u00a0others were injured. A total of 811\u00a0dwellings were destroyed[19] and 10,000\u00a0homes were damaged,[26] with 12,691\u00a0houses flooded. Nationwide, a total of 31,617\u00a0ha (78,125 acres) of crops were damaged.[19] Across Japan, damage amounted to $545\u00a0million,[19][nb 4] including at least $61\u00a0million in property damage.[8]"

It was a Boeing RB-50 hurricane hunter plane, which was sent up to study wind velocities in the storm's right front quadrant. The plane went down in the storm, taking all 16 crew members with it. Although no direct cause was stated, it was speculated that the winds of the typhoon caused the airplane to go into a tailspin. Another theory was that the low pressures caused the plane's altimeters to give a false reading, and that caused the pilots to assume that they were flying much higher than they actually were, causing them to continue flying on their assumed altitude until they crashed. The theory was also applied to what happened to a hurricane hunter which crashed during Hurricane Janet in 1955.[3]"

This particular tornado reached F4 intensity.[1] Tornadoes are amongst the most costly natural hazards in Poland. On 15 August 2008, a tornado resulted in damage to 1624 buildings in the provinces of Opole, Katowice and \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. In the aftermath of this disaster, a damage survey was performed which is presented in this paper. While the tornado was passing, the peak gust wind velocities were estimated to be from 52 m/s (187 km/h) to 72 m/s (259 km/h) in the studied area. For low-rise brick buildings, which are common in Poland, some design details for the current building standards are suggested. They can lead to the improvement of building technology used in this type of buildings in order to mitigate the effects of extreme winds, which occur in tornadoes.[citation needed]"

The storm rapidly strengthened immediately after hitting Pont-sur-Sambre, reaching F2-F3 strength just about 2\u00a0km from the point of touchdown, and a few homes and structures sustained significant damage in this area. At the 20:31 UTC the tornado intensified further and caused major damage to some rural brick homes, one of which was completely leveled to the ground at F4 (T8) strength, and the other sustaining F2 (T4-T5) damage. With winds in excess of 300\u00a0km / h (F4), the tornado reached a forested area, debarking or uprooting all the trees within a radius of 150 m. Maintaining its strength, the violent tornado struck Hautmont, flattening multiple brick homes and structures, killing 3 people, and injuring 18 others. Numerous other homes and some apartment buildings had major structural damage, and a sports complex was also severely damaged. Multiple cars were picked up and thrown hundreds of meters, some of which were hurled into buildings, and large trees were denuded and debarked. Small objects from town were also found tens of kilometers away.

The storm formed from an area of low pressure near the Philippines and strengthened to a typhoon before entering the Sea of Japan. The seventh named storm and the first typhoon of the annual annual typhoon season. Prapiroon originated from a low-pressure area far off the coast of Northern Luzon on June 28. Tracking westwards, it rapidly upgraded into a tropical storm, receiving the name Prapiroon due to favorable conditions in the Philippine Sea on the next day. Prapiroon had a good upper-level flow despite the presence of dry air, which typically hindered its development. The tropical storm shifted more northwestward heading towards the Ryukyu Islands. JMA upgraded into a severe tropical storm on July 1 and left PAR on that day also. As it moves towards Japan, Prapiroon crosses through the island of Kume in the Ryukyu Islands. Prapiroon later further intensified as a category-1 typhoon. Shortly after reaching peak intensity, Prapiroon weakened into a tropical storm after passing closely between Japan and the Korean Peninsula.

Prapiroon had good upper-level outflow, though dry air present in the area negatively affected its development.[6] At 03:00 UTC the same day, the JTWC upgraded Prapiroon to a tropical storm as it was located approximately 440 nautical miles (815\u00a0km; 505\u00a0mi) south-southeast of Kadena Air Base.[7] Prapiroon then turned to the northwest,[8] and on July 1 at 00:00 UTC, the JMA upgraded Prapiroon to a severe tropical storm.[9] On the same day at 06:00 UTC, the PAGASA issued its final warning on Prapiroon as it exited the Philippine Area of Responsibility.[10] Later that day, a ragged eye became apparent,[11] and at 21:00 UTC, the JTWC upgraded Prapiroon to a typhoon.[12] Prapiroon continued developing aided by favorable conditions, and on July 2 at 00:00 UTC, the JMA upgraded Prapiroon to a typhoon.[13] At 18:00 UTC the same day, both the JMA and the JTWC assessed that Prapiroon had peaked in intensity, with 10-min winds of 65 knots (120\u00a0km/h; 75\u00a0mph), 1-min winds of 80 knots (150\u00a0km/h; 90\u00a0mph), and a minimum central pressure of 960 hectopascals (28\u00a0inHg).[14][15] After peaking, Prapiroon began to weaken and turn to the northeast, with the JMA downgrading it to a severe tropical storm on July 3 at 06:00 UTC as conditions for development became unfavorable.[16] The JTWC downgraded Prapiroon to a tropical storm at 15:00 UTC as its low-level circulation became exposed, with central convection becoming elongated.[17] Prapiroon's western semicircle became completely devoid of deep convection,[18] and by July 4 at 00:00 UTC, the JMA further downgraded it to a tropical storm.[19] The JMA later issued its final advisory on Prapiroon at 06:00 UTC as it became extratropical,[20][14] with the JTWC doing so later at 15:00 UTC.[21] Prapiroon's extratropical remnants dissipated just south of Hokkaido the next day.[14]"

As a result, early the next day the JTWC issued a tropical cyclone formation alert on the depression, however they thought that further development might be hindered as it was located close to land.[4] Whilst it moved along the southern edge of the subtropical ridge, the Depression made landfall in Aurora province at 0600\u00a0UTC,[5] before the JTWC initiated advisories later that morning, as the low-level circulation center had consolidated and poleward outflow into the tropical upper tropospheric trough had improved.[6][7] As the storm moved to the Philippine Area of Responsibility, the storm was named Caloy by PAGASA. Then. on July 19, PAGASA issued their last advisory on Tropical Storm Caloy as it had moved out of their Area of Responsibility.[8] Then, the storm was officially named Chanthu by the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre.[9] Later, Chanthu began to head to China, where it peaked as a Category 1 typhoon.[10] It made landfall in China and soon dissipated hours later.[11][7]"

The Storm Prediction Center maintained an enhanced risk for severe weather, including a 10% hatched risk area for tornadoes.

Later that day, the deepening area of low pressure\u2014initially over Kansas\u2014shifted into Iowa as it occluded. The aforementioned shortwave progressed into the Mississippi River Valley, supporting the formation of a secondary surface low pressure over Missouri that moved toward the Great Lakes. A mid-level area of low pressure was centered farther west near the surface low, and was a cold-core low, within a longwave trough extending over the outbreak area and which provided cold air aloft, steeper lapse rates, and thus higher convective instability. Low level instability as measured by surface to 3\u00a0km (10,000\u00a0ft) CAPE was also significant, especially for a cold-core setup, reaching values of 200 J/kg. Within the warm sector of this feature, a pronounced dry slot allowed for relatively substantial destabilization, with mixed-layer CAPE increasing to 500\u20131,200\u00a0J/kg. Strong deep-layer shear and pronounced low-level directional shear as a result of backed surface winds contributed to enlarged bell-shaped hodographs, with dew points upwards of 60\u00a0\u00b0F (16\u00a0\u00b0C), resulting in an outbreak of tornadic supercells across western and central Illinois throughout the afternoon hours and extending into the evening,[9] even though the SPC had only issued a slight risk and 5% tornado forecast for the region.[10] Numerous tornadoes were reported in Illinois, most of which occurred as a result two long-tracked, cyclic supercell thunderstorms. This included an EF3 wedge tornado that caused major damage throughout portions of Taylorville, Illinois, injuring 22 people. At 5:15 PM, a tornado emergency was issued for Central Christian County. A total of 406 homes in Taylorville sustained some form of damage; 66 homes suffered major damage; and 34 homes experienced severe damage or total destruction. An EF1 tornado caused moderate damage in Beardstown, while EF2 tornadoes ripped roofs off of homes near Litchfield and Le Roy. Another EF2 touched down in Stoningon, snapping trees and power poles, and destroying garages before leveling several barns outside of town. Producing 29 tornadoes in the state, this was the largest December tornado outbreak in Illinois history.[11][9] Further south, a secondary area of severe weather produced two EF0 tornadoes in Alabama.[12]"

On September\u00a013, a United States Air Force reconnaissance plane flew into the system and found that it had intensified into a tropical storm. At this time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began monitoring the newly named Tropical Storm Helen.[1][nb 2] Additionally, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration began warning on the system, assigning it the local name Paring.[5] The following day, Helen attained typhoon status as it turned northward. Subsequently, a deepening trough over the East China Sea caused the typhoon to turn north-northeastward and accelerate.[1] During the afternoon of September\u00a016, a reconnaissance plane recorded flight-level winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph). Around this time, surface winds were estimated to be the same, making Helen a Category\u00a03 equivalent on the Saffir\u2013Simpson Hurricane Scale. Later that day, the storm made landfall near Cape Kushimoto. In Shionomisaki Lighthouse, just west of where the center of Helen passed, a barometric pressure of 955\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.26\u00a0inHg) was recorded, the lowest in relation to the storm. As the system neared Hokkaido, it slowed down and began a multi-day anticyclonic loop. During this period, it merged with an upper-level low and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September\u00a019.[1] The remnants of Helen then tracked across southern Hokkaido before dissipating just east of the island on September\u00a021.[2]"

The highest gust was measured at 181\u00a0km/h (112\u00a0mph) in Sumoto.[1] These winds caused a citywide power outage in Tsu, Mie and scattered outages in Nagoya.[6] Over a substantial portion of the country, the storm produced torrential rains that triggered deadly flash floods. Peak rainfall in Honshu and Hokkaido reached 580 and 790\u00a0mm (23 and 31\u00a0in), respectively.[1][8] In Shikoku, ten people died after a landslide destroyed nine homes in K\u014dchi City.[6] Across Japan, a total of 4,213 homes were destroyed and another 146,547 were damaged,[9] leaving at least 3,000 people homeless.[10] Roads and bridges sustained extensive damage, with large stretches being washed out.[6] According to police in Tokyo, 140 bridges sustained damage.[7] In Higashimatsuyama, a tornado spawned by Helen destroyed eight homes.[1] Large swells from the storm caused large vessels to wash ashore, including a 9,000\u00a0ton freighter in Ise Bay. Twenty-four fishermen drowned off the coast of Hachij\u014d-jima after two vessels sank.[1] Throughout Japan, 322 ships were either damaged or ran aground due to the storm.[9] Including offshore, Helen killed 85 people in Japan.[9] Along the east coast of South Korea, these swells resulted in two fatalities.[1] On September\u00a017, the Japanese military was mobilized to assist in relief efforts.[11] In all, 87 fatalities, 158 injuries and $102\u00a0million in damage was attributed to Typhoon Helen, making it the most destructive tropical cyclone to strike Japan in 1972.[1][9]"

        "content": "An upper trough moved from the Four Corners region into the southern Great Plains and lower Missouri Valley during the day on March 23. During this, a surface low in western portions of Nebraska pushed into eastern South Dakota. A cold front combined with the low moved across the central and southern Great Plains and was the main area where thunderstorm development would occur. Although moisture was limited, strong wind shear created favorable conditions for supercells to develop and rotate. As a result, the supercells had the potential to produce tornadoes.[1] A moderate risk of severe weather was issued for portions of central and eastern Kansas and northern Oklahoma.[2] During the day, a fast-moving supercell produced several tornadoes in eastern Nebraska and across the state line into the west central portion of Iowa. Five tornadoes occurred in eastern Nebraska, with eight people injured in Eagle. In Iowa, an EF2 tornado destroyed one home, damaged another home, a barn and seven outbuildings and derailed 54 empty grain rail cars in Harrison County. The supercell then moved into Montgomery County, where it produced two EF0 tornadoes.[3] Several days of severe weather began with an EF1 tornado near Meridian, Mississippi on March 25. During the early morning hours of March 26, severe thunderstorms produced six tornadoes in central sections of Mississippi. The most powerful tornado spawned was an EF3 that struck Magee. Sixty homes were either damaged or destroyed with 25 people injured from the tornado. A church was destroyed and a warehouse was severely damaged. An EF2 tornado, three EF1, and an EF0 also occurred as the severe weather moved through the area.[4] A state of emergency was declared for 12 counties by the Governor of Mississippi Haley Barbour.[5] The thunderstorms also produced three tornadoes, one rated EF1 and the other two rated EF0, in southeastern Louisiana and coastal regions of Mississippi. The EF1 tornado damaged seven homes, extensively damaged one trailer and injured one person in Tangipahoa Parish.[6] Another round of severe weather developed late that evening, producing another intense squall line with embedded tornadoes across the northern Gulf Coast region early on March 27, where several tornadoes were reported.[7] Later during the afternoon, various tornadoes developed in North Carolina, causing structural damage in eastern North Carolina.[8][9][10] The tornadoes formed after a disturbance moved into the area from Alabama.[11] One of the tornadoes near Parkton was rated as an EF2 and injured one person.[12] On March\u00a028, a strong 997\u00a0millibar upper-level low pressure area located over Oklahoma was forecast to produce widespread thunderstorms, with a moderate risk of severe weather in most of northern Louisiana, much of Mississippi, and southern Arkansas. A warm front was likely to develop along the leading edge of the system, allowing for atmospheric instability, a necessary component of severe thunderstorms. In areas farther north, relatively cool temperatures were anticipated to limit convective activity but very strong dynamics in the area would allow storms to develop. This would allow a thunderstorm which became separated from the main squall line to become severe and possibly tornadic.[13] Later in the day, the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) issued a slight risk for a large area which encompassed much of the Southeast United States. Tornadic activity was less imminent due to lower dew points but strong wind shear was able to provide fuel for severe storms.[14] More tornadoes occurred on March 28, as they affected Tennessee and Kentucky during the afternoon. A supercell that tracked through three different counties in western areas of Kentucky produced two tornadoes. One of them was an EF3 tornado that destroyed six homes, caused major damage to 10\u00a0homes and minor damage to 60\u00a0homes and businesses in Corydon.[15] In Tennessee, an EF1 tornado caused damage to several businesses in Murfreesboro, including the local Boys and Girls Club and a shopping plaza, which was heavily damaged. Another EF1 tornado destroyed a modular home and damaged three other homes in Ashland City.[16] Severe thunderstorms caused widespread damage throughout Pennsylvania on March 29.[17] An EF1 tornado was produced in Lancaster County, damaging 238\u00a0structures across a path of 10 miles (16\u00a0km) from Lititz to Denver, most of which were 200\u00a0homes that were damaged by hail. Thirty barns suffered moderate damage, one barn sustained major damage, six trailer homes were destroyed with two others suffering major damage. Three people were injured by the tornado, which altogether cost an estimated $3 million in damage.[18]"

At 2:20\u00a0pm CST, the Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma issued a tornado watch for western Kentucky, central Tennessee, and northern Alabama. Not long after, supercell thunderstorms began to develop over southern Illinois,[24] producing hail up to 1\u00a0inch in diameter.[25] By 4:00 pm CST, a supercell thunderstorm developed in western Kentucky, near the border with Illinois, and a severe thunderstorm warning was issued for the storm. Shortly after, a tornado warning was issued around 4:30 pm CST for Union County, Kentucky as doppler radar images depicted rotation in the thunderstorm. Around 4:43 pm CST, a tornado touched down about 5 miles south-southwest of Waverly, Kentucky and tracked towards the northeast along Kentucky Route 141. Not long after the tornado touched down, it crossed into Henderson County. At 4:48 pm CST, the tornado intensified into an EF3 and passed directly over the town of Corydon. After causing severe damage in Corydon, the tornado continued towards the northeast before dissipating south of the Henderson County Airport around 5:00 pm. The tornado was on the ground for roughly 12 miles over a 17-minute span.[26] Although four tornado sirens failed to sound when the tornado warning was issued for Corydon, no fatalities were reported as a result of the tornado.[26] About 70 structures were damaged[27] and six were destroyed[28] by the tornado and two people were injured.[26][29] One of the injuries was caused after a man was struck by a television which was thrown by the tornado.[30] Numerous residents were caught off guard by the tornado, with some people remaining outside after the warning was issued.[29] Concrete and brick structures collapsed, mobile homes were destroyed with debris wrapped around trees, and power lines were downed throughout the area.[31] One truck was picked up by the tornado and thrown about 0.25\u00a0miles.[26] An oil well also leaked into a creek as a result of the tornado.[27] Most homes in the town of 780 people were left without power.[32] Damages from the tornado amounted to $540,000.[33][34]"

The town of Magee was originally named Mangum, after Arthur Mangum; it kept this name until 1859.[3] In 1840, Willis Magee built a grist mill on Little Goodwater Creek, inside the present city limits. He started the first and only postal service in the area in 1855.[4] Robert Solomon Magee was the first post master in Magee and the city of Magee was named after him. Richard Farthing came to Magee in 1859 when he was in the leather tanning business. He bought 80 acres of land and also built a tanyard and used water from the mill pond to tan his leather.[5] The population of Magee in 1919 was 786. There were approximately 23 businesses in the area at the time.[5] Magee is approximately 42 miles south of Jackson, 45 miles north of Hattiesburg,[5] and 12 miles south of Mendenhall, the county seat of Simpson County.[6] Magee's first mayor was R.P. Vinson, who served from 1900 to 1907.[5] In 2013, First Baptist Church in downtown Magee was seriously damaged by a fire but has been restored.[7] Windham's Restaurant is located in Magee, and was established in 1963, locally known as \"Zip's\". In 2015, the Zip Burger was voted the best hamburger in Mississippi.[8][9] In 2017, the Magee Sportsplex was renamed the Jimmy Clyde Sportsplex in honor of former Magee mayor Jimmy Clyde.[10] As of 2017, the mayor of Magee is Dale Berry.[11] The city of Magee was featured in the Discovery Channel reality TV series Dirty Jobs.[12]"

It became a tropical storm on the next day, and received the name Mary. It slowly moved across the sea, strengthening to a typhoon. Mary made landfall in Hong Kong on June 8, and moved through Guangdong and Fujian. It reemerged back to the Pacific Ocean, and restrengthened into a typhoon temporarily.  It then traveled east, weakening and becoming extratropical on June 12. Mary caused a significant amount of damage in Hong Kong and China. It was considered the worst storm to hit Hong Kong since the typhoon in 1937. The storm destroyed weak shacks made by refugees from the mainland, leaving thousands homeless. There were multiple landslides, and most of the infrastructure were damaged. More than 400 small watercraft were either damaged or destroyed.

The system was upgraded to a tropical storm at 1800 UTC, with winds of 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph),[4] and was given the name Mary by the warning center.[1] By 1800 UTC of June 4, Mary slowly began turning northward near the Paracel Islands, and had intensified slightly to 75\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph).[1][4] On June 5, JMA recorded Mary's lowest pressure reading at 980\u00a0hPa (29\u00a0inHg).[2] Two days later, the storm had intensified to 110\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph), and was traveling faster towards Hong Kong.[1] On June 7, at 0600 UTC, Mary quickly strengthened to a typhoon, with winds up to 130\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph). Mary peaked at 0600 UTC on June 8, just offshore of Hong Kong, with winds of 150\u00a0km/h\u00a0(90\u00a0mph),[4] and JTWC estimated the pressure was 975\u00a0hPa (28.8\u00a0inHg). Twelve hours later, the storm made landfall on Hong Kong northwest of Kowloon.[1] Inland, the typhoon slowly weakened to 90\u00a0km/h (55\u00a0mph) by June 10, back to a tropical storm. The system gained speed as it traveled through Guangdong and Fujian provinces.[1][4] Mary soon reemerged back to the ocean later than day, began restrengthening,[1] and was found to have 110\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph) winds, recorded by the U.S. Navy. The storm briefly became a typhoon at 1800 UTC,[4] and reconnaissance aircraft recorded winds just above typhoon strength, although the circulation did not have eyewalls.[1] It was downgraded to a tropical storm on June 11 at 1200 UTC.[4] Another reconnaissance aircraft flew into Mary again at 2330 UTC, reporting that there was no eyewall in the storm and recorded winds up to 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph).[1] Mary continued to weaken until June 12, when JTWC and JMA declared the storm had become extratropical southeast of Tokyo.[1][2][5] JMA continued to track the extratropical cyclone until it reached the International Date Line on June 18.[2]"

At the Royal Observatory, the storm dropped 42.7\u00a0cm (16.83\u00a0in) of rain. The mean winds blew southwesterly at 87\u00a0km/h (47\u00a0kn), exposing many small boats and villages.[9] The No. 10 warning signal was issued by the Royal Observatory. However, according to the report written by the Observatory, the use of No. 10 warning signal was not strictly justified according to international procedures, since sustained surface winds of 119\u00a0km/h (64\u00a0kn) were not observed.[9] Across the colony, damage to roads, buildings, and communication were significant. Landslides, and other fallen debris blocked roads,[1] and weak refugee shacks in the hills, made out of tin and tar paper, quickly collapsed.[6] All stores and public transportation were shut down inside the city. The Customs reported that more than 50 fishing vessels capsized and sank in the anchorages during the typhoon.[1] Two ocean freighters, the Malaya Fir and the Wan Fu,[10] ran aground onto the Kai Tak Airstrip.

The total number of casualties was reportedly 1,600; and 180,000 cattle were reported killed.[12] Macau received a similar amount of rain as Hong Kong, which caused local flooding.[6] The winds uprooted trees, blocking local streets.[13] About 260 kilometres (160\u00a0mi) southeast of Hong Kong,[6] the cargo ship Sheng Lee sank during the typhoon. Fifty-four survivors were rescued and safely transported to the British colony by the Royal Navy frigate HMS Torquay,[7] with help from Dutch ships, and the Republic of China Navy and Air Force.[6] Off the coast of Mainland China, in the Matsu Islands, many fishing boats were damaged by the heavy seas and the torrential rainfall. Three people were injured in the islands.[7] In Taiwan, downtown Taipei received significant flooding, and some rice crops on the south part of the island were damaged. Although there were no reported deaths on the island, four fisherman offshore died.[1] The nearby Okinawa Islands received winds around 105 kilometres per hour (65\u00a0mph).[7]"

A total of five\u00a0tornadoes occurred, a few of which produced F3-level damage; one\u00a0of these, in Polk County, Florida, was officially assigned an F4 rating, becoming one of only two\u00a0violent tornadoes recorded in the U.S. state of Florida, but this was disputed and retroactively revised by tornado researcher Thomas P. Grazulis. The only undisputed F4 tornado on record in Florida occurred on April\u00a04, 1966, also in Polk County, near Gibsonia and Galloway. In total, 36\u00a0people were injured during the 1958\u00a0outbreak, but no deaths were directly related to the tornadoes. However, four airmen flying through a severe thunderstorm in the Tampa Bay area went missing following the crash of their jet and were presumed dead.[nb 1]"

Winds of 83\u00a0mph (134\u00a0km/h) attended the tornado on Mullet Key, extensively damaging bathhouses and outbuildings. Half of one bathhouse was torn off, an airplane's wing was bent out of shape, a shed was wrecked, and the metal roof of a museum was blown away. At Piney Point nine\u00a0pumphouses were pulled out of their concrete foundations and blown away. In and near this area, along the Manatee\u2013Hillsborough county line, fragments of a shed were carried 1\u20442\u00a0mi (0.80\u00a0km), bits of tin were twisted around utility poles and lofted into treetops, and six\u00a0mature oak trees were prostrated, a few of which fell onto a house, penetrating the roof and ceiling above the living room, and caused glass to shatter. Metal roofing slats were torn off a tractor shed as well. A newly-built barn in Ruskin was shifted 6\u00a0ft (2.0\u00a0yd) off its foundation, and a 14-year-old girl was injured while reacting to the approach of the tornado. Fencing, signage, and trees were felled. A 1\u20442-mile-long (0.80\u00a0km) swath of debris was noted just south of Sun City. One\u00a0B-47 bomber, departing from MacDill Air Force Base at around 9:30\u00a0a.m. local time, was destroyed when it encountered the parent thunderstorm. The plane unsuccessfully attempted to fly at lower altitudes and avoid it, but instead caught fire 800\u00a0ft (240\u00a0m) above the Sunshine Skyway Bridge and disintegrated. Its four\u00a0crew members were not found and presumed dead; two\u00a0of them had been ranked highly in examinations by the Strategic Air Command for navigation and bombing. Parts of the aircraft were found on the Sunshine Skyway Bridge; other parts, including most of the aircraft, landed in Tampa Bay.

Hester quickly became a typhoon and rapidly intensified. Near the end of the year, Hester became a Category 5 typhoon on the modern-day Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale south of Guam. The typhoon soon weakened quickly as it curved eastward and sped up. It weakened into a tropical storm on January 4, and JTWC ceased tracking it hours later. In preparations for the storm, shelters were opened in Guam, and all government buildings and businesses were closed. In Marshall Islands, Enewetak experienced significant flooding, and buildings were damaged by the wind. Eighteen people were injured on the island.

The storm had winds at 185\u00a0mph\u00a0(295\u00a0km/h) and began to turn northwest.[2][1] On New Year's Day, the JMA recorded Hester's lowest pressure of 950\u00a0hPa (28\u00a0inHg).[3] Hester began to weaken later that day, with winds down to 170\u00a0mph (275\u00a0km/h). By 0600 UTC of January 2, the winds lowered down to 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h), equivalent of a Category 4 typhoon.[1] Hester began to curve eastward and weaken rapidly.[2] On January 3, Hester continued to weaken to 110\u00a0mph (175\u00a0km/h), and eighteen hours later, it was down to 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h). It soon became a tropical storm on January 4, and soon dropped to a tropical depression later that day.[1] JTWC ceased tracking the storm near Minami-Tori-shima.[2] JMA downgraded the system to a tropical depression at 1200 UTC of January 5, and declared it extratropical twelve hours later.

A gale alert was issued for the Mariana Islands.[4] Due to the storm, a Pan American flight flew directly from Wake Island to Manila instead of stopping at Guam.[5] Four days later, shipping was warned for the area southeast of Formosa, as Hester approached the area.[6] The northwest quadrant of Hester passed over Enewetak at 5:13 p.m in Marshall Islands Time (5:13 a.m UTC) on December 28, 1952. The United States Navy estimated that Hester generated winds around 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h), and generated waves up to 30 feet (9.1\u00a0m) high on Enewetak. There were no direct reports on the island, where it was mostly underwater when the storm passed it. The hospital, mess halls, and clubs were damaged by the winds. Tents on the island were also destroyed.[7] A Coast Guard LORAN station on the island suffered extensive damage.[8] Overall, eighteen people were injured on Enewetak, and there were no fatalities.[9] The nearby atoll of Ujelang, received stronger winds than Enewetak, as it was closer to the center of Hester.[7] Hester passed south of Guam by 130 miles (210\u00a0km), and no damage to military facilities were reported.[8] Storm surge reached 200 feet (61\u00a0m) inland, to about 10 feet (3.0\u00a0m) above sea level.[10] The only damage reported were crops being lashed by the waves on the south side of the island,[8] and a new section of highway near Ylig River was washed away. Two shore wave recorders installed by the University of California, Berkeley, located in Tarague Beach and Ylig River, were destroyed.[10] There were no casualties on the island.[8]"

However both JMA and JTWC reported that the depression did not make landfall but only crossed the Luzon strait. Early of the next day, JTWC upgraded the system into a tropical depression. Early of September 13, both JMA and JTWC upgraded the system as a tropical storm and assigned its international name, Koppu. Koppu is a Japanese name, and it means Crater (\u30b3\u30c3\u30d7\u5ea7) .

It moved west-northwestward over the next few days, slowly gaining organisation. According to the Japan Meteorological Agency's best-track, it became a tropical depression on March 30.[1] The next day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert due to an increased consolidation of the low-level circulation of the system.[2] The intensity was increased to 30 knots at the same time by the JMA, as the depression moved westward.[3] The JTWC issued its first warning on Tropical Depression 01W late that evening local time.[2] As it continued to strengthen, the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical storm, the first of the season. The JMA followed suit, and named the system Kong-rey.[4] The name was submitted by Cambodia, and refers to a character in a Khmer legend, which is also the name of a mountain.[5] Kong-rey continued to track towards the Mariana Islands, all the while continuing to organise, causing the JMA upgraded it to a severe tropical storm on the morning of April 2 local time,[6] with the JTWC declaring it a typhoon later that evening. It then turned poleward, and starting moving towards the Northern Mariana Islands, passing through the islands on April 3. The JMA then upgraded it to a typhoon as it headed away from the islands.[7] As Kong-rey began to take a turn to the north and east, it developed a ragged 16-nautical-mile-wide (30\u00a0km; 18\u00a0mi) eye.[8] Operationally, its peak was estimated at 165\u00a0km/h (103\u00a0mph), though in post-season analysis, it was considered to have reached peak winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph).[9] It strengthened slightly further before encountering strong wind shear and colder sea surface temperatures, causing core convection to rapidly weaken, and was downgraded back to a severe tropical storm on April 4.[10] As Kong-rey accelerated towards the northeast, it encountered a hostile environment related to a midlatitude trough. It began undergoing extratropical transition early on April 5 and the JTWC issued its final warning.[11] The JMA issued its final warning on the morning of April 6 after it had completed extratropical transition.[12]"

Condition of Readiness 2 was declared across all four islands, and the Port Authority of Guam opened its Harbor of Refuge to house stranded boats.[14] The typhoon warnings for Guam were cancelled on April 2 after the National Weather Service office in Guam noted that damaging winds were now not expected on the island. The typhoon warning for Rota was downgraded to a tropical storm warning at the same time, and a typhoon warning was newly issued for Agrihan. Residents on Agrihan, Pagan and Alamagan were advised to take precautionary measures.[15] In Saipan, Northern Mariana Islands Governor Benigno R.

Furthermore, scoping meetings for an Environmental Impact Statement regarding military relocation were postponed by a fortnight. Several flights were also cancelled across the islands.[16] The tropical storm warning for Rota and typhoon warning for Tinian and Saipan were discontinued on the morning of April 3 as the storm no longer posed a wind threat,[17] and Fitial declared an all-clear for the islands.[18] Condition of Readiness 1 was maintained in Agrihan, Pagan and Alamagan until late on April 3 local time, but as the storm passed, all warnings and watches were discontinued by the morning of April 4.[9]\nThe highest gust recorded on Guam was 28 knots (32\u00a0mph; 52\u00a0km/h) at Andersen Air Force Base, while in the Northern Mariana Islands Agrihan reported the highest gust, of 67\u00a0kn (77\u00a0mph; 124\u00a0km/h).[9] The lowest pressure recorded in the island chain was 995.3 hPa on Saipan, although a few readings taken on other islands may not have been the lowest recorded pressure.[9] Only minimal rainfall fell on Guam from Kong-rey. The maximum 24-hour rainfall total on the islands was measured at 2.7 inches (69\u00a0mm) at Saipan, although the total rainfall throughout the storm was heaviest on Agrihan, which recorded 3.58 inches (91\u00a0mm) over thirty hours from April 3 to April 4 local time.[9] The storm delayed a congressional delegation to Guam, which was to be led by Texan congressman Solomon P. Ortiz.[19]  The effect of strong winds on agriculture was minimal. Several minor power outages occurred, mostly in Saipan.[20] The cost of the power outages totaled to $10,000 (2007\u00a0USD).[21]"

        "content": "Typhoon Toraji, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Isang, was one of the deadliest tropical cyclones to hit the island country of Taiwan, since 1961. The eight named storm and the third typhoon of the 2001 Pacific typhoon season, Toraji's origins were from an area of convection that persisted to the west of Guam. Moving north-northwest over favorable conditions, the disturbance intensified to a tropical depression, while the JTWC issued a TCFA on the newly developed system. On July 26, the depression entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility, with the PAGASA naming it Isang. Strong easterly wind shear inhibited further development; however, as the shear relaxed, both the JTWC and PAGASA upgraded the system to a tropical storm with also the JMA following suit hours later. Now named Toraji, the storm slowly intensified, reaching typhoon status on the next day. Toraji continued to gain strength until it made landfall as a Category 2 typhoon near Taipei on July 29. Despite the rugged terrains of the country, the JTWC upgraded the system further to a Category 3, shortly before weakening as it moved offshore on Taiwan Strait. The JMA and PAGASA downgraded the typhoon to a tropical storm, with the latter issuing their final advisory as it moved out of their AOR. It continued to weaken, with the JTWC also downgrading the system to a tropical storm, before making landfall near Fuzhou on July 31 before it was last noted by the next day. As Toraji hit southern Taiwan, it triggered landslides that destroyed houses. There were reports of flooding throughout the country and the nearby areas of Fuzhou City. Damages attributed from Toraji were estimated at $245 million (2001 USD) and there were over 200 individuals killed."

On 18:00 UTC on July 26, the JMA upgraded the depression to a tropical storm, naming the system Toraji.[3] On July 27, the JMA, JTWC, and the PAGASA all upgraded Toraji to a typhoon.[1] It continued moving northwestward as it continued to approach Taiwan. On 18:00 UTC of July 29, the center of the typhoon made landfall, just south of Taipei as a Category 2 typhoon.[4] By 0600 UTC on July 30, Typhoon Toraji had tracked through Taiwan and had passed out into the Formosa Strait. The storm was still classified as a typhoon by JTWC, but Toraji had been downgraded to a tropical storm by the other warning centers.[5] Around 19:30 UTC on the next day, the weakening Toraji made landfall near Lianjiang[6] and was subject to weakening.[7][failed verification] The last warning was given by JTWC on August 1, as it transitioned to an extratropical storm near Shanghai.[2]"

Steadily intensifying, Gilda reached typhoon strength the next day and proceeded in a general westward track towards the Philippines. On December\u00a018, the typhoon peaked with maximum sustained winds of 280\u00a0km/h (175\u00a0mph) shortly before the storm made landfall on Samar with a slightly weakened intensity.[nb 1] After passing into the South China Sea, Gilda steadily weakened and made a final landfall in southern Vietnam before dissipating on December\u00a022 over Cambodia. Damage in the Philippines was extensive, and in some locations telecommunications were cut. Impacts in Samar were particularly severe, and in some areas the damage was the worst in 30\u00a0years.

As a result, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center\u00a0(JTWC) requested aircraft reconnaissance on the system, which located a defined but weak circulation center 640\u00a0km (400\u00a0mi) southeast of Guam associated with the disturbance.[1] Over the next few days, the system slowly intensified, with the Japan Meteorological Agency\u00a0(JMA) determining the storm to have reached tropical depression strength at 1800\u00a0UTC on December\u00a011 and the JTWC indicating tropical storm intensity by December\u00a013.[2] That day, reconnaissance indicated that the storm had two distinct circulation centers, both weak in intensity. However, these vortices later consolidated, allowing for Gilda to quickly intensify to typhoon status at 0000\u00a0UTC on December\u00a014;[2] by this time a small eye had been identified within the cyclone.[1] After reaching typhoon status, Gilda assumed a west-northwesterly course at a steady pace while gradually intensifying. The development of a trough in the Luzon Strait caused the forward motion of the typhoon to slow on December\u00a016, prompting the JTWC to forecast a recurvature to the north and northeast at the time. However, the trough remained weak, allowing for Gilda to accelerate westward towards the Philippines.[1] At 1800\u00a0UTC, the JMA indicated that Gilda had peaked with a minimum barometric pressure of 925\u00a0mbar (hPa; 27.32\u00a0inHg). Twelve hours later, the storm attained its peak maximum sustained winds of 280\u00a0km/h (175\u00a0mph), which Gilda maintained for another twelve hours. Shortly after 0000\u00a0UTC on December\u00a018, Gilda made landfall on Samar Island in the Philippines with a slightly weakened intensity. By the day's end, the typhoon emerged into the South China Sea, where it began to steadily weaken. At roughly 1200\u00a0UTC on December\u00a021, the system was downgraded to tropical storm status, at which time it made a final landfall near Phan Rang\u2013Th\u00e1p Ch\u00e0m in Vietnam.

Across nine provinces in the central Philippines, at least 23\u00a0people were killed and another 60,000\u00a0were displaced,[1][3] and Gilda was considered one of the country's worst tropical cyclones in recent memory.[3] The sinking of the motorship Rizal in the waters off of southern Luzon resulted in the deaths of 14\u00a0people, though 64\u00a0others survived the capsizing.[4] Homes and public work projects sustained heavy damage from the storm. On Samar, damage to crops, homes, and communication lines totaled US$500,000.[1] Some of the damage on the island was considered the worst in 30\u00a0years.[5] About 2,500\u00a0homes were swept away by storm surge and flood in 27\u00a0towns.[6] The coconut industry suffered a major blow from the typhoon, and local authorities indicated that coconut production would take roughly four years to recovery to pre-typhoon levels.[3] The fallen lines disrupted telecommunications during the storm's passage.[7] A group of 100\u00a0teachers attending a convention were feared to have been killed in Zumarraga, Samar but were later found.[8] Overall, damage from Gilda in the Philippines amounted to US$1.5\u00a0million.[1] Following the storm, Philippine government welfare agencies quickened recovery efforts due to the approach of Christmas.[3] Damage from Gilda in Vietnam, if any, remains unknown.[1]"

A large scale trough was predicted to move across the northern United States, with associated moisture return from the Gulf of Mexico and ample instability forming a classic plains severe weather setup.[1] By May 21, models showcased an increasingly strong and robust negatively-titled trough rapidly moving across the United States before slowly stalling through the central plains. A large ridge present was set to breakdown, allowing a strong surface front to move across the area as well. Moderate instability was already forming due to a deep forming moist-layer and warm air advection from the south. The National Weather Service indicated that the \"Combination should be sufficient for a multiple-day threat for relatively widespread severe storms.\"[1] On May 25, notices for a moderate risk of severe weather were issued for northern Kansas, southern Nebraska, eastern Minnesota, northeastern Iowa, and western Wisconsin with a slight risk from Texas to northwestern Ontario. Watches extended along all the corridor and storms developed in four different areas including northern Texas, northern Kansas, central Minnesota and Iowa and southern Manitoba. As forecast, the strong trough would dig into northern areas of the CONUS. A stronger than forecast low-level jet began to transport ample moisture northward towards the interest area for severe storms, and as early as 12:30 pm CDT strong instability began to climb, as well as dew-points in the upper 70s. Models began to showcase a broken line of discrete supercells moving east to northeast, and with very little interference and a broad warm sector, the supercells would be able to take full advantage of the environment and become extremely strong.[1][2] At 12:43 pm CDT, the Storm Prediction Center identified through water vapor imagery that a rapidly moving and strong jet streak was approaching from Minnesota to Iowa. Supercells began to rapidly intensify by 3:50 pm CDT, prompting upgrades in watches. A cluster of strong supercells in northern Iowa began to both interact and intensify, merging into each other and forming a descending-reflectivity core over the southern cell's developing mesocyclone, a micro-scale interaction indicative of aiding in tornadogenesis.[3] Simultaneously, low-level rotation on the southern supercell rapidly increased. Strong gravity waves may have also assisted in tornadogenesis amongst the supercell cluster.[2][note 1]"

The first tornado warning of the cell was issued at 4:22 pm CDT (21:22 UTC), encompassing the Parkersburg area. As a tornado-cyclone materialized, a funnel cloud developed, and a tornado touched down two miles south of Aplington near the Butler and Grundy County line at 4:48 pm CDT. East of Aplington, the tornado traveled through a series of farm fields, leaving distinct cycloidal marks in the corn stubble.[2] The tornado rapidly grew in size right after touchdown, and wind-rowing of grass and farm debris indicated a violent vortex. It then tracked into Parkersburg, becoming extremely violent, intensifying to EF5 strength, and growing into a large wedge-shaped tornado as it tore through the southern part of the community just before 5:00 pm CDT. Numerous homes and businesses, two banks, and a high school were destroyed as the south side of Parkersburg was essentially flattened.[2] As the tornado entered town, a large and well-constructed metal frame industrial building that was being converted into a church was obliterated at EF5 intensity, with the structure's metal beam frame mangled into a pile and pushed off of the foundation. Beams were twisted and sheared off at their bases at this location.[4][5][6] Residential areas in Parkersburg were devastated by the tornado, as whole neighborhoods were leveled and entire rows of homes were swept away, leaving only basements behind in some cases. Some of the homes swept away in town were bolted to their foundations.[2] A rebar support set into the foundation of one home was found snapped in half, hardwood trees throughout southern Parkersburg were completely debarked and denuded, and shrubs were uprooted and stripped in some areas as well.[5][4] Aplington-Parkersburg High School sustained EF4 structural damage, and reinforced concrete light poles near the school were snapped and dragged along the ground by the tornado, indicative of extremely intense low-level inflow winds.[2] As the tornado exited at the east side of town, the tornado struck a golf course and a newly built subdivision. Multiple large and well-built homes with anchor bolts were swept completely away at that location. Two of these homes had no visible debris left anywhere near the foundations, one of which was built \"with above standard construction methods.\" At one home that was swept away in this subdivision, a concrete walk-out basement wall was partially pushed over, and the concrete basement floor sustained cracking. Structural debris from the town was wind-rowed in long streaks through fields in this area, with much of the debris finely granulated into small fragments, some no larger than coins. The tornado was estimated to have been about 7\u204410 of a mile (1.1 of a km) wide as it struck Parkersburg. Seven people died in town, several of which were taking shelter in basements.[5]"

Intense cycloidal marks were again noted in farm fields in this area.[2][3] As the tornado approached Dunkerton, it turned to the east-northeast, missing the town and growing up to 1.2 miles (1.9\u00a0km) wide. Some re-intensification occurred in this area, as consistent high-end EF2 damage was noted at multiple farms. Numerous hog containment buildings were destroyed, and a few homes that were impacted sustained some collapse of exterior walls. Mud and corn stubble was picked up from farm fields near Dunkerton and plastered thickly against fences, power poles, and houses.

It was determined that 17 homes and an industrial building sustained EF5 damage along the path.[7] According to FEMA and the Iowa Homeland Security and Emergency Management, damage was preliminary estimated at $6 million in northern Iowa including more than $3 million in Butler County alone.[8] While the tornado was caught on tape and photographed by spotters, a surveillance camera inside a bank in Parkersburg also caught the tornado on tape as the storm passed over the building.[9] Another surveillance camera showed the tornado ripping the roof off a house across a street before the video feed was lost.[10] After the tornado, Governor Chet Culver declared Butler and Black Hawk counties disaster areas due to the extensive storm damage.[11] The tornado was the first F5 or EF5 tornado in Iowa since one hit Jordan on June 13, 1976, and the second deadliest in Iowa since official record-keeping began in 1950. The deadliest tornado affected the Charles City area on May 15, 1968, and killed 13 while producing F5 damage.[12] On May 29, The Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier reported that lightweight debris from the Waterloo area, including photographs, check stubs, and \"greeting cards and business records\" from a Waterloo Walgreens, had been found in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, over 100 miles (160\u00a0km) away.[13]"

        "content": " The 1940 Pacific typhoon season marked an interruption in meteorological records in both the Philippines and Hong Kong due to the start of World War II. There were 43\u00a0reported tropical cyclones, including 27 that attained typhoon status. The first storm was observed in February, and the first typhoon formed two months later, killing three people along Mindanao. Several storms formed in June and July, including reports of a typhoon in the newspapers that killed 52 in South Korea, and another typhoon reported in newspapers that killed one person on Samar after dropping heavy rainfall. The strongest typhoon of the season originated in July and attained a minimum pressure of 927\u00a0mbar (27.4\u00a0inHg), as reported by a ship northeast of the Philippines. On August\u00a018, a typhoon moved near or over northeastern Luzon, killing nine people. In early September, a typhoon passed through the Bonin Islands south of Japan and later moved near Kyushu; heavy rainfall caused a reservoir to collapse in \u014cita Prefecture, killing 50\u00a0people. On September\u00a018, a typhoon caused a tram collision in Tokyo due to poor visibility, killing 20. Another typhoon struck southern Taiwan on September\u00a029, causing 50\u00a0fatalities. On October\u00a019, Wake Island recorded typhoon-force winds for the first time since observations began five years prior. A strong typhoon passed near Guam on November\u00a03 with winds of 200\u00a0km/h (125\u00a0mph), damaging most of the buildings on the island and killing five. Three storms affected the Philippines in December, the second of which was the most notable; it killed 63\u00a0people and left 75,000\u00a0homeless on Catanduanes. The third of the Philippine storms dissipated on December\u00a024, ending activity for the season. There was another December typhoon that killed two people on a ship to the northeast of Guam."

The document utilized several sources to indicate where storms were located, and as a result there were duplications.[1] During the season, the Philippine Weather Bureau issued monthly bulletins, which later provided info for tropical cyclone tracks. The agency used weather stations that were established by Spain and the United States after each country ruled over the archipelago. The weather data ceased in August 1940, which were later rebuilt in 1945.[2] Also in 1940, meteorology records were disrupted in Hong Kong, which were later restored in 1947,[3] due to World War II.[4]"

        "content": "On February\u00a01, a tropical cyclone formed over western Mindanao in the Philippines. It moved northwestward across Palawan island and was last noted later on February\u00a01.[5] Historical weather maps show only a circulation near 9 N 121 E.  This was a weak system, likely a depression but may have been a weak Tropical Storm.[6] Two months later, a tropical depression developed on April\u00a09 to the east of Yap in the western Caroline Islands. It moved west-northwestward, passing south of the island without gaining much intensity. The depression later bypassed Palau to the north, dissipating on April\u00a013 about 400\u00a0km (250\u00a0mi) west-northwest of the island.[7][8] On April\u00a023, a tropical cyclone was observed east of Palau, moving to the west-southwest. It curved south of the island before turning to the west-northwest. While the storm was approaching Mindanao, a ship reported a minimum pressure of 985\u00a0mbar (29.09\u00a0inHg) and force\u00a012 on the Beaufort scale, indicating that the system was a typhoon. Early on April\u00a026, the typhoon made landfall just south of Port Lamon on eastern Mindanao, where a pressure of 980\u00a0mbar (29\u00a0inHg) was reported. Along the coast, the storm produced strong winds and heavy rainfall, and killed three people after capsizing a boat. The storm later crossed over Negros island and near Cebu, where winds of 70\u00a0km/h (43\u00a0mph) were reported. The storm later entered the South China Sea,[8] dissipating near Palawan on April\u00a028.[9]"

        "content": "A preexisting low pressure area organized into a tropical cyclone on June\u00a09 near Chuuk State. It moved to the northwest as a tropical depression, influencing the trade winds on Yap. On June\u00a013, the storm executed a small loop to the southwest, later turning back to the northwest. It eventually intensified into a typhoon, producing a pressure of 999\u00a0mbar (29.5\u00a0inHg) in the Ryukyu Islands while passing to the east. The system was no a longer a tropical cyclone by June\u00a016, either due to dissipation or becoming an extratropical cyclone that continued to the northeast toward Alaska.[10][11] Toward the end of June, a tropical depression moved across the Philippines through the Visayas, first observed on June\u00a026. After moving westward into the South China Sea, the depression turned to the northeast, reaching the Luzon Strait. Later, the depression recurved back to the west, dissipating over China on July\u00a03.[12] On June\u00a029, a tropical cyclone developed southeast of Palau. It moved to the northwest, remaining east of Palau and the Philippines. Later classified as a typhoon, the system turned to the west and struck Taiwan, then known as Formosa, on July\u00a07. It moved across the island, crossed the Taiwan Strait, and dissipated over China on July\u00a09.[12][13] Another tropical depression formed on July\u00a04 near Chuuk. It moved generally to the west-northwest, although it curved southwestward on July\u00a06. The next day, the system passed about 480\u00a0km (300\u00a0mi) south of Guam, by which time it attained typhoon status. It resumed its movement to the northwest, remaining east of the Philippines. On July\u00a011, a nearby ship reported a pressure of 959\u00a0mbar (28.3\u00a0inHg) and winds of Force\u00a012 on the Beaufort scale. Two days later, the typhoon passed about 95\u00a0km (60\u00a0mi) west of Naha, Okinawa into the East China Sea, after turning more to the north. On July\u00a014, the typhoon turned to the northeast into the Sea of Japan, moving between Japan and South Korea. It later crossed Hokkaido, dissipating on July\u00a017 in the Sea of Okhotsk.[12][14] On July\u00a08, the Australian Associated Press reported that there was a typhoon about 195\u00a0km (120\u00a0mi) east of Samar. The storm dropped heavy rainfall over a period of a week, the most since 1919 in one area, which caused river flooding and one death.[15] On July\u00a012, local newspapers also reported a typhoon striking Seoul, South Korea, killing 52\u00a0people and leaving thousands homeless.[16] However, neither of the two storms were mentioned in the Monthly Weather Review summary for the month.[12] A short-lived tropical cyclone appeared on July\u00a011 in the South China Sea, but dissipated the next day.[17] Another short-lived system developed on July\u00a013 near Yap, dissipating on the next day.[18] A few days later on July\u00a018, a tropical cyclone formed west of Guam; the system moved westward and was no longer observed by July\u00a023.[19] On July\u00a012, a tropical depression formed to the east-southeast of Guam. It moved westward, passing through the Marianas Islands on July\u00a014. Around July\u00a018, the storm turned toward the north, passing east of Taiwan. Three days later, the storm approached the Japanese island of Ishigaki 100\u00a0km (60\u00a0mi) to the west, where a pressure of 985.3\u00a0mbar (29.10\u00a0inHg) confirmed the system attained typhoon status. On July\u00a023, the typhoon turned to the northeast and moved across the Korean Peninsula. The storm turned to the east, later moving across northern Honshu on July\u00a024, and dissipating two days later.[12][20] Another tropical depression formed east of Guam on July\u00a021. It tracked westward, passing near the island on July\u00a023, and later shifted more to the west-northwest. On July\u00a026, a ship reported a low pressure of 927\u00a0mbar (27.4\u00a0inHg), indicating that the system was a typhoon. The system later passed between the Philippines and Taiwan as it entered the South China Sea, but no land areas reported strong winds, suggesting the typhoon was either very small or had weakened from its peak. On July\u00a029, the typhoon made landfall between Hong Kong and Shantou in southeastern China, quickly dissipating.[12][21] On July\u00a024, a tropical depression appeared east of Guam, and soon after passed near the island while tracking northwestward. The system eventually passed between Okinawa and Taiwan, reaching a position 100\u00a0km (60\u00a0mi) southwest of Naha, Okinawa on July\u00a030; a station  on the island reported a pressure of 990\u00a0mbar (29\u00a0inHg), suggesting the storm attained typhoon status. By the next day, the storm was no longer being tracked in the East China Sea, although the Monthly Weather Review summary indicated that the typhoon continued to the northwest, attaining a pressure of 973\u00a0mbar (28.7\u00a0inHg). The storm reached a position northeast of Shanghai and dissipated on August\u00a04 after crossing the Shandong Peninsula.[22]"

It exhibited a parabolic track, moving west-northwestward before turning to the south, ultimately dissipating on August\u00a04; it never intensified beyond tropical depression status.[23][24] Another short-lived tropical depression formed on August\u00a01 near Guam, dissipating on August\u00a03 after having moved to the north and west.[25] On August\u00a011, a tropical cyclone appeared east of Luzon. Over the next few days, it moved across the Philippines, passing near the island of Mindoro on August\u00a013. The system moved across the South China Sea, intensifying into a typhoon as it approached Vietnam. Although it paralleled the coast, the system dissipated over the Gulf of Tonkin on August\u00a017.[24][26] A tropical depression formed on August\u00a013 to the southwest of Guam. It gradually strengthened while tracking west-northwestward, becoming a typhoon on August\u00a016. Two days later, the storm passed near or over northeastern Luzon and moved into the South China Sea. After approaching Hong Kong, the typhoon turned to the west-southwest, paralleling the southern China coast. Although the track for the storm ended on August\u00a022, the Monthly Weather Review summary indicated that the typhoon crossed Hainan. The storm then moved across the Gulf of Tonkin and dissipated on August\u00a025 over Vietnam.[24][27] In Luzon, stations reported a minimum pressure of 975\u00a0mbar (28.8\u00a0inHg) in Palanan, Isabela. The storm produced widespread flooding in Luzon,[24] which damaged crops and cut communications,[28] and killed nine people. In Ilocos Norte, the typhoon caused a shipwreck, although the passengers and crew were rescued. Later, the typhoon brought gusts of 134\u00a0km/h (83\u00a0mph) to Hong Kong.[24] A short-lived tropical depression formed east of Guam on August\u00a014, dissipating a day later.[29] The next tropical system developed about 565\u00a0km (350\u00a0mi) north of Yap on August\u00a019. It moved generally to the northwest, interrupted a brief turn to the northeast before resuming its trajectory. It quickly intensified into a typhoon, and Naha, Okinawa reported a pressure of 987\u00a0mbar (29.1\u00a0inHg) on August\u00a023. After passing near the island, the typhoon turned sharply to the northeast. It moved along the southern coast of Japan before coming ashore west of Tokyo on August\u00a026. Soon after, the storm reached open waters and later passed over eastern Hokkaido, dissipating on August\u00a028.[24][30] On August\u00a021, a tropical depression formed near Yap. After moving erratically to the south and northwest, the system dissipated on August\u00a025 to the east of the Philippines.[31] There was another short-lived depression on August\u00a028 to the east of Guam, dissipating a day later.[32] Another tropical depression formed on August\u00a024 to the east-southeast of Guam. After passing south of the island, the system maintained a steady west-northwest trajectory and quickly intensified into a typhoon. On August\u00a029, the storm passed east of the Batanes islands that are between Taiwan and Luzon; a station there recorded a pressure of 987\u00a0mbar (29.1\u00a0inHg). A day later, the typhoon made landfall in northern Taiwan, and after crossing the island, moved ashore in southeastern China near Fuzhou with a pressure of 979\u00a0mbar (28.9\u00a0inHg). The storm remained distinct over land, turning to the northeast and passing west of Shanghai. On September\u00a03, the system dissipated off the south coast of South Korea.[24][33] The last storm to form in August developed on August\u00a030 to the northwest of Guam. It briefly moved to the north-northeast before maintaining a steady northwest track. The system attained typhoon status, later dissipating on September\u00a04 near Okinawa.[34][35]"

Around September\u00a06, the system passed through the Bonin Islands to the south of Japan, where a station recorded a pressure of 964\u00a0mbar (28.5\u00a0inHg); this indicated that the storm attained typhoon status. The storm turned to the west, influenced by a high pressure area over Japan. It is possible the storm executed a loop, or it traversed to the north, before resuming a westerly track on September\u00a09. The typhoon later passed over southern Kyushu, later turning abruptly to the northeast and east. On September\u00a012, the system dissipated over central Honshu.[34][36] While moving through the Bonin Islands, the typhoon destroyed schools, government offices, and power plants. Several people were killed, and 500 were left homeless.[37] Later, the storm disrupted shipping in and around Kyushu, damaging the port at Nagasaki.[38] In \u014cita Prefecture, rains from the typhoon caused a reservoir on Kyushu to collapse, killing 50\u00a0people.[39] Also on September\u00a02, a tropical depression formed between Guam and Luzon. It moved to the northwest, then turned to the northeast, intensifying into a typhoon; this was based on a pressure reading of 993\u00a0mbar (29.3\u00a0inHg) from a nearby ship. On September\u00a06, the system dissipated.[34][40] A short-lived tropical depression formed on September\u00a03 in the South China Sea, dissipating the next day while moving eastward.[41] There was another short-lived tropical depression that developed on September\u00a04 near the Marianas Islands, but dissipated within one day.[42] Another tropical depression formed on September\u00a04 to the west of the Marianas Islands, which moved to the south and later northeast, dissipating on September\u00a06.[43] On September\u00a010, a tropical depression formed northeast of Luzon, lasting only two days while moving in a circular track.[44] On September\u00a09, a tropical depression formed near Chuuk. Two days later, the system passed south of Guam while maintaining a general west trajectory, although it later turned to the north-northwest. By September\u00a013, the system attained typhoon status. Three days later, the storm's track shifted to the north-northeast, bringing it near Hachij\u014d-jima on September\u00a018 which recorded a pressure of 983\u00a0mbar (29.0\u00a0inHg). That day, it approached southeastern Honshu but remained offshore. After accelerating to the northeast, the system was no longer observed on September\u00a020 to the southeast of the Kamchatka Peninsula.[34][45] While passing east of Japan, the typhoon caused a tram collision due to poor visibility, killing 20\u00a0people.[46] On September\u00a022, a well-developed typhoon was first observed east-southeast of Guam. The storm moved to the west and later west-northwest, bypassing the island to the south. On September\u00a029, the system entered the Balintang Channel between Taiwan and Luzon, where a station recorded a pressure of 965\u00a0mbar (28.5\u00a0inHg) at Basco, Batanes. That day, the typhoon passed over or very near southern Taiwan as it continued to the northwest. On September\u00a030, it made landfall about 160\u00a0km (100\u00a0mi) northeast of Xiamen, weakening over land. The storm turned to the north and northeast, reaching the East China Sea and dissipating on October\u00a02.[34][47] In Taiwan, the typhoon killed 50\u00a0people and wrecked 5,000\u00a0houses.[48] The final September storm originated east of Guam on September\u00a029. It moved westward, intensifying into a typhoon and passing north of Guam. After varying its track toward the north or south, the typhoon dissipated on October\u00a05.[49][50]"

On October\u00a012, the system passed through the Paracel Islands, where a pressure of 996\u00a0mbar (29.4\u00a0inHg) was recorded. The storm attained typhoon status, moving ashore in Vietnam on October\u00a015.[49][51] The tropical cyclone database listed a separate tropical cyclone that lasted from October\u00a011 to 15 in the South China Sea that also struck Vietnam.[51] A typhoon was observed on October\u00a013 to the northeast of Guam, with nearby ships reporting a pressure of 985\u00a0mbar (29.1\u00a0inHg). After moving to the northwest, the system turned to the northeast and was no longer observed after October\u00a017.[49] On October\u00a019, a typhoon passed near Wake Island, where a pressure of 968\u00a0mbar (28.6\u00a0inHg) was recorded.[49] Winds reached 220\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph), which was the first instance of typhoon-force winds on the island since observations began in 1935.[52] The winds were strong enough to cut radio communications and damage the Pan American World Airways base.[53][54] The only people on the island were two dozen Pan American workers, who survived by staying in a storm shelter that previously never experienced gale-force winds.[55] After striking the island, the typhoon turned to the northeast, crossing the International Date Line on October\u00a021.[49] A tropical depression formed on October\u00a029 near Pohnpei. It moved to the northeast initially, but on October\u00a031 began tracking to the west. On November\u00a03, the system passed just south of Guam as a typhoon, where a pressure of 956\u00a0mbar (28.2\u00a0inHg) was recorded. Winds reached over 200\u00a0km/h (125\u00a0mph), and there was a slight decrease during the passage of the eyewall. The typhoon turned to the northwest, passing near the Bonin Islands. On November\u00a08, the typhoon accelerated to the northeast, crossing the International Date Line on November\u00a010.[56][57] When the storm struck Guam, it damaged nearly every building on the island. Most of the damage occurred after the center of the storm passed and the onslaught of easterly winds began.[56] The Navy Yard at Piti was heavily damaged. At Sumay, the storm damaged Marine Barracks Guam, the Pan American Airways hotel used for China Clipper service passengers, and a hangar.[58][59] The storm also sank a U.S. Navy yard patrol boat and blew ashore the dredge YM-13.[59] Downed trees killed two or three people, and five people in total died on the island, the others likely due to drowning.[56] After the storm, Naval Governor George McMillin sought aid from the American Red Cross to assist residents in rebuilding.[58] It was considered among the worst typhoons on record in Guam.[60]"

On Panay island, Capiz recorded typhoon-force winds,[62][63] and throughout the Visayas, the storm damaged roads and bridges, but caused no deaths.[64] The system dissipated on December\u00a06.[62] On December\u00a03, a tropical depression formed about 485\u00a0km (300\u00a0mi) east of Yap. Tracking westward, it intensified into a typhoon on December\u00a05 while approaching the Philippines. The system turned to the northwest, moving over eastern Samar and crossing Catanduanes island with a recorded pressure of 992\u00a0mbar (29.3\u00a0inHg). Subsequently, there is contradictory information on the path; the storm either continued to the northwest, dissipating over northeastern Luzon on December\u00a08, or it turned to the southwest. Capalonga in eastern Luzon reported a pressure of 989\u00a0mbar (29.2\u00a0inHg) on December\u00a08, and later, a station on Marinduque island reported a pressure of 987\u00a0mbar (29.1\u00a0inHg). The Monthly Weather Report tracked the storm over the Philippines into the South China Sea, reporting its dissipation on December\u00a013 to the east of Vietnam.[62][65] Across its path through the Philippines, the typhoon brought heavy rains and strong winds, which downed trees and power lines.[62] On Catanduanes, the storm left about 75,000\u00a0people homeless,[66] and killed 60. At Labo, Camarines Norte, ten people died when a tree fell onto a house. Another three people drowned between Polillo Island and Camarines Norte.[62] A tropical cyclone was observed on December\u00a08 southeast of Guam. It moved northwestward and passed about 160\u00a0km (100\u00a0mi) north of the island on December\u00a010, where a pressure of 999\u00a0mbar (29.5\u00a0inHg) was recorded. The typhoon turned to the west and later to the southwest. Around December\u00a014, the system stalled to the east of the Philippines, later drifting to the east. On December\u00a019, the system weakened, although it remained a distinct entity as it recurved back to the south and west. On December\u00a024, the storm dissipated after striking Mindanao.[62][67] The final storm of the season was observed on December\u00a018 to the northeast of Guam. It affected a nearby ship on December\u00a020, causing the deaths of two members of the crew in the subsequent day. The typhoon tracked to the northeast, crossing the International Date Line on December\u00a021.[62]"

The map was discovered when the contents of the cargo were examined while the ship was being repaired. This discovery led to the Siebold incident (Japanese: \u30b7\u30fc\u30dc\u30eb\u30c8\u4e8b\u4ef6).[3] Therefore, this typhoon was named the \"Siebold typhoon\".[4][5]"

        "content": "As Typhoon Janis, the previous storm, intensified south of Guam, the tropical disturbance that later became Typhoon Kent developed\neast of the International Date Line. Its persistent convection prompted the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to start following the system at 06:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a03.[1] Forty-eight hours later, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a tropical depression.[2][nb 3][nb 4] An increase in the amount and organization of the disturbance's deep convection prompted the JTWC to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert at 15:00 UTC on August\u00a05. The system began to a mature at a faster clip[1] as it tracked west-northwest.[5] The JTWC started issuing warnings three hours later, and at 00:00 UTC on August\u00a06, the JTWC upgraded the depression into a tropical storm,[1] with the JMA doing the same at 06:00 UTC.[6] Eighteen hours later, the JTWC upgraded Kent to a typhoon,[7] with the JMA declaring it a severe tropical storm.[2] After becoming a severe tropical storm, the rate of intensification slowed. On August\u00a08, increased vertical wind shear associated with the passage of a mid-level trough to the north resulted in a reduction in the thickness of Kent's central dense overcast. Even though intensification was arrested[1] (the JTWC and JMA estimated that the storm maintained winds of 160\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph) and 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph) for 30 and 42 hours respectively),[6] a small core of persistent central convection remained. As the trough passed by, the re-appearance of an eye indicated that steady intensification had resumed. At noon on August 11, Kent was upgraded into a super typhoon by the JTWC.[1] At the same time, the JTWC and JMA estimated that the typhoon attained its peak intensity of 240\u00a0km/h (150\u00a0mph) and 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph), with a minimum barometric pressure of 930\u00a0mbar (27\u00a0inHg).[6] Under the influence of a subtropical ridge located to its north, the typhoon maintained its intensity as it continued to move west-northwestward until a shortwave trough moved across Honshu on August\u00a013. Kent subsequently slowed down and turned towards the north in response to the weakness in the subtropical ridge. Then, the trough passed by and the typhoon, which was by this time weakening due to increased wind shear, veered towards Honshu. On August\u00a016, Kent began to interact with Tropical Storm Lois, which had formed two days earlier. As a consequence, Kent turned towards Kyushu.[1] Later on August\u00a016, the JMA and JTWC estimated that Kent lost typhoon intensity. At 00:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a018, Kent moved ashore over Kyushu, with the JTWC and JMA reporting winds of 115\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph) and 105\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph).[6] Shortly thereafter the interaction between the tropical cyclones had ceased, and Kent was approaching recurvature. After landfall, interaction with the mountainous terrain of Kyushu, along with increased wind shear aloft, quickly weakened Kent. At midday on August\u00a019, Kent was downgraded to a tropical depression by the JTWC after the center had become exposed from the deep convection.[1] Both the JTWC and JMA ceased tracking Kent on August\u00a020.[6]"

According to tornado researcher Thomas P. Grazulis, the Gainesville tornado was one of the shortest-tracked F4 tornadoes on record.[10] It skirted the south of the city, starting in the southwest and proceeding northeast, passing through a natural depression roughly 100\u00a0ft (30\u00a0m) lower than the city itself. The area, which included cotton mills, reported about 50\u00a0deaths and incurred the worst damage; in this area the intensity of the damage was equivalent to low-end F4 status.[4][11] Unlike a similar event in 1936, the 1903\u00a0tornado missed downtown Gainesville.[12] The tornado, initially appearing along the train track, was at first thought to be smoke from a train. It struck a cotton mill at 12:45\u00a0p.m. local standard time, ripping off the top floor where a number of children were working, many of them numbering among the fatalities. The power of the tornado ripped an iron cupola from an approximately 40-foot-wide (12\u00a0m) standpipe, crushing a number of people when it fell down.[11] The tornado also damaged the Gainesville Iron Works and track, signals and freight cars of the Southern Railway Company, before destroying approximately 70\u00a0of the 120\u00a0workers' cottages at the Pacolet Mills in New Holland, where young children and elderly were located at the time. In total, at least 98\u2014and possibly as many as 104\u2014people were killed and at least 180\u00a0injured, with some reports indicating up to 190\u00a0injuries. The number of people harmed was reduced due to many workers attending picnics away from the site when the tornado struck.[4][11] Almost 33\u00a0years later, on April\u00a06, 1936, another violent tornado struck Gainesville, claiming at least 203\u00a0lives. Gainesville is the only town of its size to be so devastated twice by tornadoes in its history.[13]"

Typhoon Nelson, which developed on August 16, 1985, originated from an area of thunderstorm activity well east of the Philippines. It gradually intensified over the next several days while moving northwest. Nelson reached typhoon intensity early on August\u00a020 and two days later, attained peak intensity before turning west. The cyclone brushed northern Taiwan early on August\u00a023 after weakening slightly. Nelson then briefly restrengthened to peak intensity. During the afternoon of August\u00a023, it made landfall in eastern China before dissipating on August\u00a025. Nelson brought heavy rains to Taiwan. Approximately 900,000\u00a0families were left without power and 100,000\u00a0telephone lines lost service. More than 20,000\u00a0trees were uprooted. Across the country, five people were killed. Affecting a country already inundated by summer rains, Typhoon Nelson brought additional flooding and significant damage to much of Southern China. There, the storm killed 48\u00a0individuals and hurt 329\u00a0others. More than 5,000\u00a0homes were destroyed while another 6,000\u00a0were damaged.

        "header": "Meteorological history",
        "content": "The origins of Nelson can be traced back to a small and disorganized, but persistent area of disturbed weather, which was first observed on August\u00a015. At this time, the convection was located 280\u00a0km (175\u00a0mi) northwest of Saipan. Initially, the system was located near the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), which enhanced the disturbance's convection. The disturbance was also located near a cold core upper-level low and a tropical upper-tropospheric trough (TUTT). By 0300\u00a0UTC on August\u00a015, the system had become slightly more organized. Three hours later, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started watching the system. Thereafter, a dramatic increase in convection occurred over the northeast quadrant of the system.[1] As such, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started watching the system early on August\u00a016.[2][nb 1] Several hours later, a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) was issued, even though a Hurricane Hunter aircraft did not locate a surface circulation. Early on August\u00a017, the TCFA was re-issued. That afternoon, the disturbance became more organized, with classifications via the Dvorak technique yielding winds of 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph). Based on this, both the JTWC and the JMA upgraded the disturbance into Tropical Storm Nelson.[4] During the evening, a Hurricane Hunter aircraft reported a barometric pressure of 989\u00a0mbar (30\u00a0inHg); however, they noted that the strongest winds were 170\u00a0km (105\u00a0mi) north-northwest from the center. Early on August\u00a018, data from another aircraft also noted that a subtropical ridge had extended west of Nelson; consequently, the JTWC correctly anticipated Nelson to move west-northwest.[1] At midday, the JMA upgraded Nelson to a severe tropical storm. Subsequently, data from the JMA indicated that Nelson began to level off in intensity as the stronger winds remained displaced form the center.[2][nb 2] However, the JTWC upgraded Nelson to typhoon intensity following Hurricane Hunter reports of a 10\u00a0km (6.2\u00a0mi) eye, winds of 75\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h), and a pressure of  979\u00a0mbar (28.9\u00a0inHg).[1] At 0000\u00a0UTC on August\u00a020, the JMA estimated that Nelson attained typhoon strength, with winds of 130\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph).[4] Nearing Taiwan,[2] Nelson once again held on to its intensity for 36 hours before strengthening slightly.[4] Late on August\u00a021, the JTWC announced that Nelson reached peak intensity, with 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph), equivalent to a Category 2 hurricane on the United States-based Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (SSHWS).[1] Early on August\u00a022, the JMA reported that Nelson attained peak winds of 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph).[4] Shortly after its peak, the storm weakened slightly thereafter as the typhoon passed between the Yaeyama Islands and the Miyako Islands.[1] According to the JMA, the storm re-attained peak intensity at 0000\u00a0UTC on August\u00a023. At this time, the agency assessed the pressure of the system at 955\u00a0mbar (28.2\u00a0inHg).[2] Shortly thereafter, Nelson skirted northern Taiwan, passing 45\u00a0km (30\u00a0mi) from Taipei. After entering the Formosa Strait, the storm moved ashore southwest of Fuzhou at 1400\u00a0UTC on August\u00a023.[1] At the time of landfall, the JMA estimated winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h).[2] By August\u00a025, both the JMA and JTWC had ceased tracking Nelson, as it had moved inland over China.[4][nb 3]"

        "content": "On April\u00a020, meteorologists at the Storm Prediction Center noted that a significant change in the large-scale synoptic pattern across the United States would allow for a trough to move inland over the Northwestern United States. They noted the possibility of isolated severe thunderstorms across the Rocky Mountain Foothills.[3] This system moved into the region two days later and prompted the issuance of a slight-risk around the Yellowstone National Park region in Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming. Ahead of the trough, upper-level cooling above modest surface heating enhanced low-level lapse rates and allowed for scattered severe storms. Due to a lack of significant moisture, with dew points in the area only at 30\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22121\u00a0\u00b0C), activity was constrained.[4] A severe thunderstorm watch was issued for the region by 2:30\u00a0p.m. MDT (2030\u00a0UTC) as a cold front associated with the trough moved through.[5] Straight-line winds up to 66\u00a0mph (106\u00a0km/h) occurred in the area. Further south, a gust of 72\u00a0mph (116\u00a0km/h) was measured in northwest of Wild Horse, Colorado during a downburst.[6] Across Idaho, approximately 1,600\u00a0Rocky Mountain Power customers lost electricity due to the storms. A two vehicle accident near Fredregill was also blamed on the system.[7] On April\u00a023, the system continued steadily eastward across the Central United States. Daytime heating ahead of the system fueled instability that later fed widespread severe activity that extended from Texas to Nebraska. Convective available potential energy (CAPE) values across the area averaged 1,000\u00a0J/kg in Kansas and peaked near 2,000\u00a0J/kg in Texas. In contrast to the risk of supercells capable of producing very large hail,[8] only two reports of 2\u00a0in (5.1\u00a0cm) diameter hail were received that day. In some places, hail from the storms lasted more than 10\u00a0minutes and accumulated on the ground. Hurricane-force winds were reported with a few of the cells, namely near Rocky, Oklahoma where gusts reached 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) in a downburst. In Ripley, Oklahoma, straight-line winds tore a metal roof off a home and damaged a few others.[9] By April\u00a024, the system had transformed into a shortwave trough over the Central Plains with a cold front extending southward to the Gulf of Mexico. Several area of low pressure were excepted to form along this front and propagate northward, congealing into a single system later that day. Ahead of the front, weak, elevated thunderstorms formed; however, a second line closer to the front became better defined during the day due to enhanced moisture. There was initially some question as to the intensity these storms would achieve due to the preceding line limiting daytime heating.[10]"

Though McCrory could have appealed to President Barack Obama, he opted not to and placed priority on providing affected residents with immediate aid.[32] On May\u00a014, local disaster aid in conjunction with the Small Business Administration was approved for residents in Beaufort, Pasquotank, and Perquimans Counties.[2][33]"

It touched down at 5:38 pm near the Wilbur Cross Parkway.[7][8] Industrial cranes and cars were tossed through the air, and rows of houses and an industrial park were flattened.[9] The tornado lifted just a few minutes later at 5:45.[7] The damage path was only five miles long, stopping just short of the city of New Haven, but it damaged or destroyed almost 400 structures.[4] The storm was so intense at this point that an 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) wind gust was measured in downtown New Haven after the tornado dissipated.[6] At about the same time, a tornado struck the area between Carmel and Brewster, New York, unroofing a condominium complex.

Typical tornadoes in this area are short-lived and not particularly damaging. This outbreak featured several long-lived tornadoes, produced by storms that produced destructive straight-line winds over a large area. Since 1950, only six violent tornadoes have occurred in the Northeastern US, two of which were part of this outbreak.[2] It was by far the worst tornado event in the area since May 2, 1983, when six significant tornadoes tore through New York.[4]"

Andy formed along the northern edge of the monsoon trough south of Guam on July\u00a022, 1982. It became a tropical storm the next day, although this system was initially poorly organized. Andy moved steadily west during the first few days of its life. After looping south of Guam, the cyclone moved northwest and strengthened. Andy turned westward near the 18th parallel on July\u00a025. The system became a strong typhoon for a prolonged period on July\u00a027 and July\u00a028 while attaining a peak intensity of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph). However, the typhoon struck Southern Taiwan on July\u00a029. Continuing westward through the Formosa Strait, the storm made its final landfall in southern China on July\u00a030 and dissipated inland two days later. During its formative stages, the typhoon brought high waves to Guam, resulting in one death. Twelve families were also left homeless. After passing near Taiwan, Andy brought strong winds, which resulted in thirteen deaths, and two others were rendered missing. Government offices, schools, and airports were closed. At least 60 fishing boats in harbors were damaged or wrecked due to strong winds. Three hundred power poles fell; consequently, nearly a quarter of Taiwan residents lost power at the height of the storm. After moving ashore in China, Andy brought heavy rains to nearby Hong Kong."

        "content": "Typhoon Andy originated from a monsoon trough south of Guam in tandem with Typhoon Bess. Despite strong wind shear, three areas of disturbed weather soon developed. The westernmost of the three drifted westward and remained poorly defined. Late on July\u00a021, a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) was issued for the middle system following a drop in barometric pressure and an increase in organization.[1][nb 1] Around this time, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started watching the cyclone. On July\u00a022, the JMA upgraded the system into a tropical storm.[3][nb 2] During the evening hours of July\u00a022, Hurricane Hunters found winds of 65 to 70\u00a0km/h (40 to 45\u00a0mph) and a minimum pressure of 995\u00a0mbar (29.4\u00a0inHg). Based on this, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified the system as a tropical storm and named it Andy. Despite the initial overall lack of organization,[1] Andy slowly gained strength[5] while tracking generally westward.[6] However, the low-level circulation was initially poorly defined and difficult to find via weather satellite imagery. While passing around 160\u00a0km (100\u00a0mi) south of Guam,[1] the JMA upped Andy into a severe tropical storm.[3] After performing a small loop,[1] Andy accelerated northwest south of a subtropical ridge.[1] According to the JMA, Andy attained typhoon intensity midday on July\u00a024.[3] For the ensuing 24 hours, intensification was slight.[5] Thereafter, Andy turned west and entered a more favorable environment for intensification.[1] On July\u00a025, the JMA  placed the intensity of the storm at 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph). After briefly leveling off in intensity, Andy continued to gain strength, and during the morning hours of July\u00a026, the JMA reported winds of 170\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph). The next day, after the storm became better organized and developed a well-defined eye,[6] the JMA estimated that Andy reached peak intensity, with winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph), and subsequently noted that Andy attained its minimum barometric pressure of 930\u00a0mbar (25\u00a0inHg).[3] Later that day, the JTWC estimated a peak intensity of 225\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph), equivalent to a Category\u00a04 hurricane on the United States-based Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (SSHWS).[1] Shortly after its peak, Andy began to slowly weaken.[5] At 1200\u00a0UTC on July\u00a028, the JTWC reduced the intensity of the typhoon to 210\u00a0km/h (130\u00a0mph).[1] However, on July\u00a029, the JMA lowered the intensity of the cyclone to 145\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph)[3] as the storm's eye disappeared on satellite imagery.[6] Nevertheless, the JTWC kept the intensity over 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph) until landfall, which occurred later that day along the southeastern quadrant of Taiwan. Despite briefly emerging into the Formosa Strait,[1] the JMA downgraded Andy into a severe tropical storm just before landfall in Southern China.[1] On July\u00a030, the JTWC stopped watching Andy inland over the mountains terrain of southeastern China.[5] Two days later, the JMA followed suit.[3]"

An 11-year-old boy died in Naval Station after the waves swept him off of rocks. Three \"huge\" waves struck the shoreline near Umatac, which destroyed several homes off of their foundation. Along many nearby villages, scattered damage was noted. At least nine villages were without power for varying amounts of time. In all, 12 people were left homeless.[7] While affecting Taiwan, Typhoon Andy snapped trees and toppled billboards,[8] in addition to generating high waves.[9] In some places, rainfall reached 300\u00a0mm (12\u00a0in).[10] Coastal areas were hardest hit. Along the southern portion of the island, 300 power poles were downed, making damage reports difficult for the United Press International to obtain. At the height of the storm, a quarter of the nation's 18\u00a0million residents were left without power.[11] Eight people were killed in storm-related accidents, including a man and a woman who died when a car flipped in the central portion of the country.[8] Furthermore, four members of a fishing party were swept out to sea and drowned and an elderly man was blown off a roof as he tried to fix leaks in it.[11] Another 11-year-old boy was swept into the sea and was presumed to have perished while watching waves near the southeastern city of Taitung, though his 16-year-old companion who was also watching the waves was swept away, but was later rescued.[7] In Taipei, broken trees and signboards fell on streets due to strong winds. Government offices, schools and airports were closed.[8] One quarter of the city lost power.[6] At least 60\u00a0fishing boats in harbors were badly damaged or wrecked in the wind.[11] Elsewhere, a 23-man crew was forced to abandon a 5,393 short tons (4,890\u00a0t) ship off the northern Philippines.[9] Overall, 13 people were killed, 2 were missing, and 25 others were wounded. A total of 300 homes were at least partially destroyed[6] but no major damage was observed[8] and no major flooding was reported.[11] While Andy was in Taiwan Straits, a No 1. hurricane signal was issued for Hong Kong on July 28. The next day, this was upgraded to a No. 3 hurricane signal. All signals were dropped after Andy weakened to a tropical storm. A minimum pressure of 990.5\u00a0mbar (29.25\u00a0inHg) was recorded at the Hong Kong Royal Observatory (HKO) on July\u00a029. Waglan Island recorded a peak wind speed of 46\u00a0km/h (29\u00a0mph). Meanwhile, Green Island observed a peak wind gust of 83\u00a0km/h (52\u00a0mph). Tate's Cairn observed 205.3\u00a0mm (8.08\u00a0in) of rain during the passage of the storm, the highest in the vicinity of Hong Kong. Overall, damage in Hong Kong was minor.[6]"

The twenty-seventh named storm and thirteenth typhoon of the season, Kyle formed from a monsoon depression near Palau, associated with bursts of scattered convection. It then drifted west-northwest, strengthening to a tropical storm the next day. Land interaction prevented further intensification, and it crossed through the central Philippines while maintaining its intensity on November 20. Upon entering the South China Sea, the system strengthened to a severe tropical storm before rapidly intensifying to a typhoon, three days later. It soon reached its peak intensity that day, with one-minute maximum sustained winds of 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph), equivalent to a mid-level Category 2 typhoon. It held its strength until landfall in Vietnam later that evening. Weakening through the mountainous terrain of the country, it dissipated near the Cambodia\u2013Thailand border on November 24. The typhoon caused over 106 confirmed deaths, mainly are from Vietnam. Landslides and large swaths of flash floods are also seen and reported, as far as Thailand. The typhoon, overall, caused over $1.5 million (1993 USD) in total, mainly are from washed-out crops and farmlands in the country. The Philippines also reported some power outages, flooding and a fatality, but due to the sparse coverage from the typhoon, the total damages and overall deaths were unknown."

Tapah intensified further as it passed the Ryukyu Islands, intensifying into a typhoon as per the JMA.

No further changes to the threat level were made, although the Enhanced risk was significantly expanded late on April\u00a08 to include portions of the southern Great Lakes, lower Ohio Valley, Ozark Plateau, and Arklatex region.[4] Around midday on April\u00a09, the SPC issued a 10% hatched tornado threat area across much of northern Illinois and small portions of nearby states, signifying the potential for several tornadoes, of which one or two had the potential to be strong (EF2 or stronger on the Enhanced Fujita scale).[5] The catalyst for the severe weather outbreak came as a positively-tilted shortwave trough progressed across the central High Plains into the Great Plains and eventually through the western Great Lakes region. A weaker disturbance pushed from the Ozarks into the Northeast United States, acting to strengthen southwesterly winds aloft across the risk area. At the surface, a weak area of low pressure initially centered over northeastern Kansas early on April\u00a09 progressed steadily northeast while intensifying, reaching the trisection of Iowa, Wisconsin, and Illinois by late that evening. A cold front stemming from the low progressed eastward across the Mid-South, whereas an arching warm front slowly pushed northward across eastern Iowa and northern Illinois. Modest surface heating ahead of the cold front allowed mid-level CAPE values to reach 1,000\u20131,500 J/kg, and a mass of rich moisture transported northward from the Gulf of Mexico pushed dewpoints into the lower 60s \u00b0F across the Enhanced risk area.[6] Winds at 850mb strengthened at or above 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h) atop winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) at 700mb, creating a favorable setup for sustained supercells. Although the overall directional component of low-level winds was expected to be less than ideal as a whole, a small area of southeasterly surface winds developed near the surface low in northern Illinois.[5] At 1:50\u00a0p.m. CDT (18:50\u00a0UTC), the SPC issued a tornado watch for northern and central Illinois, far northwestern Indiana, far southern Wisconsin, and portions of Lake Michigan. A 60% chance of two or more tornadoes was assessed across the watch box, with a 40% chance of at least one strong tornado.[7] Isolated shower activity had already begun forming across the region just prior to the issuance of watch,[8] eventually growing into a line of strong to severe thunderstorms, including supercells.[9]"

The tornado began as a small cone-shaped tornado, causing mostly minor damage near Franklin Grove and Ashton, though a Crest Foods plant sustained considerable damage.[43] The tornado became large and violent as it struck a semi-rural subdivision west of Rochelle, where some ground scouring occurred and large, anchor-bolted homes were swept away, though close inspection revealed that some of the washers were missing from the anchor bolts, and that low-lying shrubbery and vehicles near the homes was left mostly intact, preventing a higher rating. Winds in this area were estimated to have reached 200\u00a0mph, the very upper limit of the EF4 range.[44][45] The tornado briefly weakened to EF2 strength as it passed between Hillcrest and Kings, damaging several farmsteads before reaching high-end EF4 intensity once again as it crossed IL 64, where a row of five homes was obliterated, along with a nearby farmstead. Extensive wind-rowing of debris occurred in nearby fields, and vehicles were tossed. A large restaurant was destroyed by EF3 level winds in this area as well.[44][46] The tornado then weakened, causing EF1 to EF2 damage to a warehouse structure, outbuildings, and numerous trees as it passed south of Lindenwood. East of Lindenwood, further weakening occurred as the tornado damaged homes and outbuildings at EF1 strength, and a brief EF0 satellite tornado was observed. The tornado re-intensified to high-end EF3 strength as it devastated the small town of Fairdale, where the two fatalities occurred. Every structure in town sustained some type of damage, and multiple poorly anchored homes were leveled and swept away. Intense cycloidal marks were observed in farm fields outside of town.[45] Past Fairdale, the tornado produced EF2 and EF3 damage as large barns were destroyed, a house lost its second floor and sustained collapse of exterior walls on the first floor, and large hardwood trees were denuded and sustained some debarking before the tornado dissipated northwest of Kirkland. A 2-minute long video recording of the tornado in the Fairdale area exists which shows a near-death experience recorded by Clarence \u201cClem\u201d Schultz (85), a man who was a resident of the area when the tornado began to form. The two fatalities of the disaster were Clem's wife, Geraldine \u201cGeri\u201d Schultz (67), and their neighbor, Jacklyn Klosa (69).[47][48]"

        "content": "  On the afternoon of May\u00a04, 1922, two simultaneous tornadoes struck Austin, Texas, taking unusual southwesterly paths through the city and surrounding areas on both sides of the Colorado River. Meteorological details concerning the conditions that led to the event are sparse, though historical accounts described the morning and afternoon as sweltering; clouds began aggregating northeast of Austin by noon and had developed into thunderstorms over the city by around 4:00\u00a0p.m.[nb 2] The first tornado began in a rural area 6\u00a0mi (9.7\u00a0km) northwest of the Texas State Capitol and tracked across the Texas Deaf, Dumb, and Blind Institute for Colored Youth and Deep Eddy, injuring at least five people and causing around $25,000 in damage (equivalent to $455,000 in 2023). The tornado was widely photographed and was estimated to have been an F2\u00a0tornado on the Fujita scale. While the first tornado was inflicting damage, a second tornado touched down near the Texas State Cemetery and moved across the Travis Heights community and St. Edwards University. Its most destructive impacts occurred at the Woodward Manufacturing Company's automobile plant at Penn Field. It then curved west towards Manchaca and Oak Hill, leveling homes and uprooting numerous trees before dissipating. The second tornado was the more destructive of the two and killed at least 12\u00a0people, including six at a single home in Oak Hill. It was estimated to have been an F4\u00a0tornado on the Fujita scale. In aggregate, the two tornadoes injured 50\u201360\u00a0people and inflicted at least $300,000 (equivalent to $5,500,000 in 2023) in damage, with some estimates placing the damage toll above $700,000 (equivalent to $12,700,000 in 2023)."

        "content": "Two simultaneous tornadoes struck the Austin, Texas, area on the afternoon of May\u00a04, 1922, inflicting a combined 50\u201360\u00a0injuries. Estimates of the damage toll vary widely. According to one estimate published in the University of Texas Bulletin, the tornadoes caused $300,000\u2013$350,000 in property damage.[1] One estimate in the Weather Bureau's Climatological Data publication indicated a $500,000 damage toll.[2] The Austin American, a local newspaper, tallied a $584,000\u00a0toll,[3]:\u200a1\u200a while another newspaper, The Austin Statesman, tallied a $725,000\u00a0toll.[4]:\u200a1\u200a One tornado generally struck areas west of central Austin while the other struck areas east and south of the city; the latter caused all 12\u201313\u00a0fatalities documented on May\u00a04.[5][6][7] The tornadoes were 4\u00a0mi (6.4\u00a0km) apart while on the ground. Both tornadoes took atypical tracks towards the south-southwest.[5] The Austin/San Antonio office of the National Weather Service ranked the event as the second most significant weather event of the 20th century for the Austin area, behind the flooding in 1921.[8] The meteorological details concerning the development and progression of the two tornadoes were primarily documented in two published accounts of the storm, with one authored by Frederic W. Simonds, the chairman of the Department of Geology at the University of Texas, and Fred Morris, a weather observer and employee at the university's mechanical engineering department.[5][4]:\u200a1\u200a The two tornadoes were also widely photographed, though the second, eastern tornado was imaged less.[5] A brief hailstorm with hail \"of larger size than a pigeon egg\" according to Simonds occurred after the two tornadoes struck,[1] lasting for about 20\u00a0minutes before the storms abated prior to sunset.[3]:\u200a2\u200a To the north, the town of Taylor was buffeted by strong winds from a concurrent but separate storm. Round Rock and Hutto reported heavy rain during the afternoon but did not otherwise suffer any ill effects. Pflugerville reported small hailstones and rain.[3]:\u200a2 Simonds described May\u00a04, 1922, as an \"oppressively warm\" day.[1] J.D. Martin, the superintendent at the Texas Deaf, Dumb, and Blind Institute for Colored Youth, described it as the onset of a heatwave shortly before the first tornado struck.[1] Likewise, Morris described the morning as \"sultry\" with a \"very light southeast breeze\" in his report published in the May\u00a01922 edition of the Monthly Weather Review.[9] The air pressure on the University of Texas bottomed out at 986\u00a0mbar (986\u00a0hPa; 29.1\u00a0inHg) at 3:20 p.m.[1] Aside from the university barometer, there were no standard surface weather observations as climatological data was only recorded once per day at 7:00\u00a0a.m. Weather maps indicated the juxtaposition of drier air west of Austin and moist air from the Gulf of Mexico to the east.[5] Small and nearly stationary cumulus clouds began to form by 11:00\u00a0a.m. Some of these clouds to the northeast developed into cumulonimbus clouds by noon and remained stationary until around 2:30\u00a0p.m. when they began to move and spread south. After 3:00\u00a0p.m., low-level scud clouds began to converge over the Austin area, and at around 3:45\u00a0p.m. thunder was heard for the first time. Lightning became more frequent as the thunderstorm intensified.[9]"

        "content": "An account by Paul T. Seashore published in the Monthly Weather Review described the development of the conical funnel cloud that led to the first tornado on the afternoon of May\u00a04:[10] The approaching clouds were scarcely 5\u00a0miles away when I first became aware of the tornadic formative disturbance. In a position nearly due north a ragged edge, or that part which appears to an observer as being the bottom of the cloud had in one place dipped lower and had assumed the shape of a V with a slender thread-like appendage swinging from the bottom. Simonds notes that a clamor began on the campus of the University of Texas as the funnel cloud began to descend to the northwest.[1] The commotion also led to the mid-game cancelation of a baseball match between the University of Texas and Austin College at Clark Field as well as the suspension of a special meeting of the Austin City Council.[11][12] The funnel cloud was deflected 45\u00a0degrees away from the nadir below its connection with the parent cloud; Simonds believed this was a byproduct of wind currents passing through the rugged topography of the Balcones Escarpment west of Austin.[1] This first tornado touched down in a rural area 5\u20136\u00a0mi (8.0\u20139.7\u00a0km) northwest of the Texas State Capitol and moved south-southwest.[5] It destroyed several homes and caused heavy damage at the Texas Deaf, Dumb, and Blind Institute for Colored Youth, injuring five people.[1][6][4]:\u200a3\u200a Buildings at the institute were either unroofed or displaced from their foundations; an industrial building, dormitory, laundry building, and smaller sheds were destroyed on the institution grounds.[1] The tornado then blew down or unroofed cabins near Deep Eddy along the Colorado River and denuded or uprooted trees.[1] This included those on the nearby YMCA and Hardy Johnson campgrounds that were largely destroyed.[13][4]:\u200a3\u200a A segment of roofing ripped away from the institute landed at Deep Eddy after traveling airborne for 3\u00a0mi (4.8\u00a0km).[1] Two people were injured at Deep Eddy. The tornado then crossed the river and produced a narrow path of damage in unpopulated hills southwest of Austin before dissipating.[9][6] An analysis of the tornado's damage published by meteorologist Thomas P. Grazulis in 1990 estimated that it was an F2\u00a0tornado on the Fujita scale, with a damage toll amounting to around $25,000;[6] The Austin Statesman attributed at least $50,000\u00a0in property damage to the tornado, including $40,000 incurred by the Texas Deaf, Dumb, and Blind Institute for Colored Youth.[3]:\u200a1\u200a The tornado's path spanned 70\u00a0yd (64\u00a0m) at its widest and was 9\u00a0mi (14\u00a0km) long.[14]"

        "header": "Second tornado",
        "content": "Morris's account of the second tornado detailed the development of the preceding wall cloud, writing of its \"violent churning\" and lowering from the broader cloud.[5] This tornado touched down near the Texas State Cemetery on the east side of Austin while the first tornado was in progress and initially moved south-southwest. Trees nearby were uprooted and stripped of their branches while some buildings sustained serious damage:[5][1] one small home on Navasota Street was torn from its foundation and a Gulf Oil gas station on East Sixth Street was unroofed.[15] The tornado toppled a moonlight tower onto the Tenth Ward Fire Station, damaging the building.[1][9] Along the Colorado River, small homes, and outbuildings were damaged as the tornado began to cross the river,[1] pulling a column of water 50\u00a0ft (15\u00a0m) into the air.[16] Waste from a nearby city landfill was also pulled into the river.[16] The tornado then entered the newly built Travis Heights community, where it unroofed houses and uprooted large trees.[1] Three homes were \"wrecked\" according to The Austin Statesman and four others were damaged.[4]:\u200a3\u200a The tornado's impacts were not uniform; in some cases, badly damaged buildings were adjacent to those that showed little evidence of the tornado's passage.[1] At the time, the tornado spanned approximately 50\u00a0yd (46\u00a0m) across.[9] Additional homes were razed before the tornado moved across the campus of St. Edward's University. The third story of a brick dormitory was destroyed, in addition to the campus power plant and gymnasium. One university student was killed after being thrown 300\u00a0yd (270\u00a0m) by the tornado.[1][17][18] Another four students were injured.[4]:\u200a3\u200a Grazulis lists the damage at the university as totaling approximately $200,000.[6] Debris from the tornado's passage over the campus was recovered as far as 55\u00a0mi (89\u00a0km) away.[1] The greatest property toll occurred when the tornado tracked over Penn Field, where it destroyed the automobile plant of the Woodward Manufacturing Company; five large brick buildings were demolished and a steel water tower was toppled. Two people were killed there and twenty-eight others were injured.[1][19][20][4]:\u200a1\u200a Most of the casualties occurred at the facility's living quarters or planing mill; some were outside watching the tornado as it moved across Travis Heights when they were struck by debris. The Woodward Manufacturing Company assessed $300,000 in losses at the plant.[4]:\u200a3\u200a Another person at Penn Field outside of the factory was also killed.[4]:\u200a1\u200a Debris from the destruction at Penn Field was lofted over 100\u00a0ft (30\u00a0m) into the air and was blown onto the busy Post Road connecting Austin with San Antonio, Texas, but caused no loss of life.[1][9] Additional debris broke through the roof of the St. Elmo schoolhouse; the building itself also moved at least 20\u00a0ft (6.1\u00a0m) off its foundation.[1] One person was killed in the St. Elmo area,[4]:\u200a1\u200a which was reportedly \"wiped out\" by the tornado.[21] The tornado's path then curved towards the west, destroying a dairy and other buildings.[1] Two cows and a horse at the dairy were killed.[16] It was at this point that the tornado was at its widest, with a diameter of some 225\u00a0yd (206\u00a0m).[5] Two people were killed northwest of Manchaca.[6] Six people were killed in a single home 2\u00a0mi (3.2\u00a0km) southeast of Oak Hill; little remained of the home aside from the stones that once comprised its chimney.[1] Other small homes nearby were also leveled.[9] Tornadic damage after this point was largely inflicted upon farms and forests to the southwest, with swaths of fallen timber and debris resulting from the tornado's trek into more forested areas.[5][1] Grazulis's 1991 assessment of the second tornado's damage estimated that it was an F4\u00a0tornado on the Fujita scale.[6] Estimates of the tornado's death and damage toll vary. Press reports and documentation published in the Monthly Weather Review list either 12 or 13\u00a0deaths.[7][6] The May\u00a05, 1922 edition of The Austin Statesman enumerated 13\u00a0fatalities and 44\u00a0injuries;[4]:\u200a1\u200a the following day's edition enumerated 12\u00a0fatalities.[22]:\u200a2\u200a The injured were sent to three area hospitals.[23][24]"

Damaging winds, heavy downpours, and hail up to 1 inch (2.5\u00a0cm) wreaked havoc with the evening commute.[2] Hundreds of downed trees led to a temporary suspension of service on the Long Island Rail Road, Amtrak, and several New York City Subway services including the 7, L, and M, leaving tens of thousands of commuters stranded.[3] A woman was killed when a tree fell and crushed the vehicle she was driving. Another man in Flushing was killed by a tree crashing into his home by Kissena Park. Extensive and widespread wind damage led to over 30,000 downed trees, and power lines. During the storm, winds tore trees out of the ground before blowing them up to 30\u201340 feet (9.1\u201312.2\u00a0m) away. According to Con Edison, more than 25,000 customers lost power in Queens while 5,000 were without power in Staten Island. Four buildings across Brooklyn and Queens reported experiencing a partial collapse due to tornadic winds. The worst damage was concentrated in the neighborhoods of Middle Village, Forest Hills, and Bayside in Queens as well as Park Slope and Bed-Stuy in Brooklyn.[4] Scattered power outages were reported across parts of the city.[5] Two separate tornadoes were later confirmed in Park Slope and Flushing, two areas that suffered the worst damage from the storms. The stronger of the two tornadoes touched down over Flushing and was rated an EF1 with maximum winds of 100\u00a0mph. The tornado touched down in Flushing Meadows Corona Park and headed through Northeast Queens, dissipating over Little Neck Bay. The twister tore down the 150-year-old steeple of St. George's Church in downtown Flushing.[6] In addition to the tornadoes, the National Weather Service confirmed the occurrence of a macroburst bringing winds up to 125 miles per hour (201\u00a0km/h) to a wide swath of Middle Village and Forest Hills. In Forest Hills, a group of trees were knocked over in MacDonald park, destroying the park and surroundings.[7] Combined, the two tornadoes caused $25.7 million in damages.[8] These tornadoes were part of a small outbreak that produced several damaging tornadoes across the Midwest, especially in Ohio. An EF2 tornado caused severe damage, totaling $35 million, near Wooster, Ohio.[9] Another strong EF3 tornado that destroyed numerous homes near Reedsville, Ohio and Belleville, West Virginia killed one person and injured several more. This became the first fatal tornado in West Virginia in a decade.[10] The stadium at Athens High School was destroyed by a tornado.[11]"

Mindulle rapidly weakened, dissipating the next day. Mindulle primarily affected Japan, forcing nearly 900,000 to evacuate. The third storm to strike Japan in a week, Mindulle exacerbated flooding caused Chanthu and Kompasu, causing 3 fatalities to occur. In Chiba, over 100,000 people were without power.

On the islands, the storm produced gusty winds and showers.[14] Across the Kant\u014d Plain, about 850,000\u00a0people were ordered to evacuate.[14] In Kanagawa and Tokyo prefectures, officials issued landslide watches.[15] On Hokkaido, more than 2,700\u00a0people evacuated due to Mindulle.[16] Ahead of the storm, Narita International Airport \u2013 Tokyo's main airport \u2013 was closed, causing 425\u00a0flights to be canceled, affecting tens of thousands of travelers.[17][15] Hundreds of Japan Railway trains were also canceled.[15] American military bases in Japan were set at Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness (TCCOR) 1, and non-essential people were directed to stay in their lodgings after most services were shut down.[14] The third storm to strike Japan within a week, Mindulle dropped heavy rainfall on Honsh\u016b, where the soil was saturated due to rainfall dropped by the earlier tropical storms Chanthu and Kompasu.[17] \u014cme, Tokyo recorded nearly 268\u00a0mm (10.6\u00a0in) of rainfall.[14] The offshore islands of Hachij\u014d-jima and Izu \u014cshima both reported 86\u00a0mm (3.4\u00a0in) of precipitation in just one hour, which is about half the average August rainfall for both locations.[17] Shizuoka recorded nearly 360\u00a0mm (14\u00a0in) of rainfall. In the capital city Tokyo, Mindulle dropped 105\u00a0mm (4.1\u00a0in) of rainfall, which is 66% of the average August rainfall. Narita Airport recorded winds of 126\u00a0km/h (78\u00a0mph), which forced air traffic controllers to evacuate the control tower.[17] This was the first time the tower was evacuated due to a typhoon, and only the second time in its history after the 2011 Japan earthquake.[15] The island of Miyake-jima recorded winds of 150\u00a0km/h (93\u00a0mph), and Yokosuka Naval Base recorded winds of 58\u00a0mph (93\u00a0km/h), which restricted outdoor activity.[15] Floods from Mindulle's heavy rainfall submerged a tunnel along the Ch\u016b\u014d Expressway in Tokyo. Portions of Naval Air Facility Atsugi, Yokota Air Base, and Camp Zama were flooded, with runways submerged.[14][15] At Yokota Air Base, the floods cut off power to five housing towers, forcing the occupants to evacuate.[18] Floodwaters covered roads and damaged homes in Hokkaido,[16] and a man drowned in Kitami,[19] days after floods from Kompasu also killed a man on Hokkaido. A woman in Sagamihara outside Tokyo also drowned during the storm. Nationwide, Mindulle's effects injured 61\u00a0people.[16] Across southeastern Honshu, 15\u00a0rivers flooded, and a train line was washed out in western Tokyo, forcing a train of commuters to evacuate.[15] High winds knocked a tree onto a central Tokyo train station, which suspended service on the Tokyo Loop Line.[16] Fallen power lines left over 100,000\u00a0people without power, mostly in Chiba Prefecture.[15] Total financial loss in Japan, along with Tropical Storm Kompasu, were counted to be \u00a545 billion (US$448 million).[20]"

More tornadoes occurred on June 17 and 18, including another EF3 tornado near Louin, Mississippi that destroyed numerous homes and other buildings, killed one person, and injured twenty-five others.

        "content": "On June 12, the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) issued a level 3/enhanced risk of severe weather for June 14 across the Mid-South and eastern Gulf Coast states, and also highlighted the threat for significant severe weather across the risk area.[7] Mid-level atmospheric flow was beginning to become broadly confluent, while a low pressure system situated north of the Great Lakes began to weaken and move east. Higher moisture content was confined to the south of a remnant surface front, and convective instability increased in the risk area due to the eastward advection of warm elevated mixed-layer air across the Mississippi River Valley. A 5 percent tornado risk was introduced in the SPC's Day 2 outlook for June 14 across Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia, and also included a 30 percent risk for wind and hail, which the latter included a significant threat.[8] In the morning hours of June 14, the SPC upgraded the enhanced risk to a moderate risk, and included a significant 10 percent risk for tornadoes across southeastern Alabama and southwestern Georgia, as well as a significant 45 percent risk for wind and a significant 30 percent risk for hail across the southern United States.[9] A few hours later, tornado watches were issued for Alabama and Georgia,[10][11] and a Particularly dangerous situation severe thunderstorm watch was issued for northeastern Louisiana, southeastern Arkansas, and Mississippi.[12] On June 15, the SPC released an outlook with a moderate risk of severe weather for portions of the High Plains. This outlook included a 10 percent risk for tornadoes along the panhandles of both Texas and Oklahoma. A shortwave trough began to move into the central U.S. Concurrently, an associated 80 kt upper-level jet moved into the southern plains. At the surface, a low area also deepened across the southern High Plains, the same area a prominent cold front was headed. Ahead of the front, surface heating and increasing low-level convergence promoted significant convection. From June 16\u201319, the same mid-level trough associated with previous storms continued to rotate around the Mid-Atlantic. Short-wave perturbations related to convergent air movement between a 50kt jet and the strong trough displayed signs of strong storms across the deep south, from Arkansas to Alabama. 3000 J/kg of CAPE was also present, promoting rapid intensification of storms in evening hours.[13] Extreme instability led to unexpected and explosive storm development on almost all dates of the outbreak sequence, sometimes resulting in tornadoes, hail, and wind damage well outside of areas outlined by the Storm Prediction Center. This included 12 tornadoes that occurred in a 0% risk area in Ohio on June 15, three of which were strong.[14]"

On the evening of June 16, a storm cluster affected parts of Pickens, Greene, and Tuscaloosa counties, leaving a sizable damage swath. Winds were estimated at 50\u201375\u00a0mph (80\u2013121\u00a0km/h), with peak gusts of 90\u201395\u00a0mph (145\u2013153\u00a0km/h). This resulted in thousands of trees being downed from the town of Gordo to the Ralph community, where hundreds of trees were snapped or uprooted along a six-mile-wide path. Several homes in Ralph sustained roof damage, and several garages and outbuildings sustained heavy damage. Debris near Ralph led to the closure of all lanes, eastbound and westbound, on I-20/59. Power outages affected thousands of residents in Tuscaloosa County, which lasted for a few days, and disrupted cell service in many areas.[109][110][111] On June 18, flash flooding in the Saint Louis metropolitan area resulted in I-55 shutting down.[112] In addition, flooding in Pensacola resulting in Fort Pickens shutting down until June 22.[113] A powerful mesoscale convective system also affected a large swath of northern Oklahoma. Central Oklahoma saw scattered damaging winds and a large amount of power outages, while winds of up to 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) caused widespread damage across Northeastern Oklahoma, including the Tulsa metropolitan area, and 341,000 power outages occurred.[114][115]"

        "content": "The origins of Kai-tak can be tracked back to the broad area of disturbance embedded in a monsoonal trough that was first spotted, early on August 10.[1] By the next day, the convection deepened and a weak low-level circulation center was spotted with winds of up to 20 knots (37\u00a0km/h; 23\u00a0mph). A Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission pass revealed that the convection around the system was very loosely organised and the banding was relatively weak.[2] By midnight, that day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started tracking the system as a weak Tropical Depression with winds under 30 knots.[3] A couple of hours later, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical cyclone formation alert (TCFA) estimating winds of up to 22 knots (41\u00a0km/h; 25\u00a0mph).[4] As the storm was also in the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA)'s area of Responsibility, they started issuing advisories on the system, thus naming it Helen.[5] By noon, on August 12, the JMA confirmed that the depression has reached a windpseed of 30 knots (56\u00a0km/h; 35\u00a0mph).[6] As opposed to this, in their first advisory on the system, the JTWC said that the storm had winds of up to 25 knots only.[7] Only late that night, did the JTWC confirm winds of 30 knots, based on new microwave imagery and satellite data. The storm was moving to the west at 12 knots (22\u00a0km/h; 14\u00a0mph) at the moment.[8] At midnight, the JMA reported winds of 35 knots (65\u00a0km/h; 40\u00a0mph), stating that the depression had intensified into a tropical storm, thus officially naming it Kai-tak.[9] At 09:00\u00a0UTC, on August 13, the JTWC confirmed the same.[10] At that time, the system had a broad, partially exposed low-level circulation center (LLCC) with deep convection persisting along the western periphery.[11] Later the same day, according to JMA, the storm reached a maximum sustained wind speed of 50 knots (93\u00a0km/h; 58\u00a0mph), thus making it a Severe Tropical Storm.[12] The storm continued tracking northwestward and was located approximately 400 nautical miles (740\u00a0km; 460\u00a0mi) northeast of Manila, Philippines. Infrared imagery revealed that deep convection persisted along the southwestern periphery of the LLCC. Though the storm entered warm watered off the Philippine coast, it failed to intensify rapidly as it was located along the southern periphery of a deep-layered subtropical ridge and was experiencing moderate vertical wind shear. The JTWC did not expect the storm to strengthen any further since it would start interacting with the nearby landmass.[13] On August 14, the LLCC of the storm passed under the deepest convection, however, it failed to intensity because an anticyclone that was located to the northeast of Kai-tak. Albeit the ample outflow, no good convection developed to the northern half of the system due to the shear caused by the anticyclone. At this moment, Kai-tak was expected to rapidly drift eastward due to the persistent subtropical ridge. The JTWC expected Kai-tak to become a typhoon within 48 hours due to warm sea-surface temperatures, and then make landfall.[14] By the night of August 14, Kai-tak tracked westward at 06 knots (11\u00a0km/h; 6.9\u00a0mph) and the LLCC became embedded within central dense overcast convection. The storm became more consolidated as a result. Fragmented concentric deep convection surrounded the LLCC. Also, the anticyclone to the east of the system weakened thus reducing the wind shear affecting Kai-tak. The wind speed then rose to approximately 55 knots (102\u00a0km/h; 63\u00a0mph).[15] By the next day, the Kai-tak accelerated towards the Philippines. The LLCC started interacting with the northern coast of the island nation. The deep convection continued to build along with the strong equatorward outflow. The storm, however, produced no poleward outflow. Due to the sudden rise in trackspeed, the JTWC estimated a landfall within 12 hours.[16] On the night of August 15, the infrared satellite imagery showed that convective bands have deepened and wrapped tighter into the LLCC and an excellent equatoward outflow. The wind speed was estimated at 65 knots (120\u00a0km/h; 75\u00a0mph), which is equivalent to a minimal category 1 typhoon on the SSHS. Kai-tak was expected to continue intensifying before making landfall over China, and then decay rapidly due to land interaction.[17] According to reports the next morning, Kai-tak continued drifting westward at about 13 knots (24\u00a0km/h; 15\u00a0mph). Though the bulk on convection remained to the southern semi-circle, deep convective rainbands have developed over the northern periphery. Over the past 12 hours, the storm rapidly moved west, into china and was expected to make landfall soon. Kai-tak was located along the southern periphery of a deep subtropical ridge positioned over southeast China.[18] The storm continued speeding towards China and by the night of August 16, it was drifting west at nearly 14 knots (26\u00a0km/h; 16\u00a0mph). Infrared imagery showed that the cloud-top temperatures were starting to drop. The vertical wind shear near Kai-tak had weakened dramatically. However, the storm maintained the same wind speed. The JTWC announced that the storm would start weakening rapidly within 12 hours due to land interaction.[19] It was only at midnight, on August 16, when the JMA officially declared Kai-tak a typhoon.[20] By then, the system sped up towards landmass. It was drifting west at over 16 knots (30\u00a0km/h; 18\u00a0mph), poised to make landfall over the Leizhou Peninsula over the next 12 hours, cross the Gulf of Tonkin, before making a second and final landfall into northern Vietnam to the east of Hanoi.[21] At the same time, the PAGASA issued their last warning on Kai-tak, otherwise known as Helen, locally, as it left the Philippine area of Responsibility.[22] On the morning of August 17, Kai-tak made landfall over the Leizhou peninsula, as expected. It maintained the same intensity and was expected to track west-northwestward under the influence of the subtropical ridge.[23] Within 6 hours, Kai-tak made a second landfall over the northeast coast of Vietnam and has weakened slightly. The windpseed dropped to 60 knots (110\u00a0km/h; 69\u00a0mph) and was no longer a typhoon. Kai-tak was expected to weaken rapidly thereafter.[24] Later that night, the JTWC issued their final warning on the system as it weakened further and sped up inland. They expected the system to dissipate within 24 hours.[25] However, the JMA stopped tracking the storm early the next morning, no longer considering it a tropical cyclone.[26]"

        "content": "Early on August 16, Tropical Storm Kai-Tak slammed the northern Philippines triggering flash floods and landslides and killing at least three people, one week after deadly monsoon rains battered the country, disaster relief officials said. Twenty northern provinces had been placed under storm warnings before the storm hit. The Office of Civil Defence said one man drowned when he suffered a seizure and fell into a flooded rice field in the province of Pangasinan and another drowned while crossing a swollen river on Tuesday in Ilocos Norte province. Another man died from electrocution in Naguilian town in nearby La Union province, said Superintendent Jovencio Badua, a regional police spokesman. At least 3,555 people were evacuated from their homes in La Union and Pangasinan because of flash floods while several highways were cut off because of landslides, Badua said.[31] By that night, the storm left behind ten dead in the Philippines. Economic loss across the nation reached PHP125\u00a0million (US$2.96\u00a0million). The storm blew out of the Philippines offering some relief for millions of people struggling to recover from a few weeks of monsoon rains that earlier claimed 109 lives. But more than the death toll, a foreign organisation warned the floods posed a continuing and major problem to the three million people who were displaced from their homes, almost one million of whom had sought refuge in temporary evacuation centres. The NDRRMC said it was still providing relief aid to nearly a million people impacted by last week's floods, including more than 216,000 at evacuation centres. \u201cThe need is massive and urgent, millions of people are suffering the miserable consequence of these floods and we must try to reach them before the rains hit again,\u201d Anna Liendfors, the country representative of Save the Children appealed. At the same time, weathermen warned residents living in low-lying and mountainous areas against possible landslides and flash flood due rains ranging from heavy to intense. In Pampanga, the home province of former president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo in Central Luzon, officials ordered the pre-emptive evacuation of residents in villages along one of the major river systems.[32]"

        "content": "The 2011 Rainsville, Alabama tornado was a catastrophic EF5 tornado that struck parts of northeast Alabama on the late afternoon of April 27, 2011. It was the fourth and final EF5 of the historic 2011 Super Outbreak, the largest tornado outbreak ever recorded. The multi-vortex tornado remained on the ground for 36 minutes, carving a path of 36.63 miles (58.95\u00a0km) long through DeKalb County, causing 25 deaths, an unspecified yet sizable number of injuries, and an estimated $10+ million in damage.[1] According to storm chaser Maximilian Hagen, this tornado produced some of the most violent damage ever surveyed.[2][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] The supercell thunderstorm responsible for this tornado first developed at around 1:45\u00a0p.m. CDT near Harperville, Mississippi. It swiftly moved northeast, producing an EF5 tornado in Mississippi and an EF4 tornado in Central Alabama before entering DeKalb County by 5:45\u00a0p.m. CDT. The tornado touched down at 6:19\u00a0p.m. CDT near the Lakeview community and quickly escalated in intensity. EF5 damage was noted in several pockets near Shiloh, Rainsville, and Henagar, where severe ground scouring occurred and numerous homes were destroyed, resulting in the multiple fatalities and injuries. The damage path was characterized by extensive tree damage, the complete obliteration of structures, and extensive damage to property. The tornado eventually dissipated near Rising Fawn, Georgia.[3]"

        "content": "The meteorological conditions leading up to the tornado were among the most favorable for violent tornadoes ever documented.[4][5] On April 25, a potent upper-level shortwave trough advanced into the Southern Plains states.[6] The combination of abundant instability, low-level moisture, and wind shear generated a significant tornado outbreak spanning from Texas to Tennessee, with at least 42 tornadoes touching down on that day.[7] On April 26, an area of low pressure developed over Texas and moved eastward, while the previously mentioned shortwave trough progressed through the Mississippi River and Ohio River valleys. This resulted in an additional 55 tornadoes.[7] The multi-day outbreak reached its peak on April 27, witnessing the most violent single day of tornado activity since the 1974 Super Outbreak. The day featured multiple rounds of tornadic activity, with two waves of mesoscale convective systems in the morning, followed by an extensive outbreak of supercells from Mississippi to North Carolina during the afternoon and evening hours.[6] The tornado activity on April 27 was triggered by a 995 mbar (hPa; 29.39 inHg) surface low located over Kentucky and a deep, negatively tilted (aligned northwest to southeast) trough over Arkansas and Louisiana. A robust southwesterly surface jet intersected these systems at a 60\u00b0 angle, generating an ageostrophic flow that resulted in storm-relative helicity values exceeding 500 m2/s2. These values are indicative of extreme wind shear and a very high potential for rotating updrafts within supercells. Moisture from the Gulf of Mexico surged northward across the Deep South, causing daytime high temperatures to reach 77 to 81\u00a0\u00b0F (25 to 27\u00a0\u00b0C) and dewpoints to range between 66 and 72\u00a0\u00b0F (19 to 22\u00a0\u00b0C). Additionally, convective available potential energy (CAPE) values climbed to 2,500\u20133,000 J/kg.[8][9]"

        "content": "At around 5:45\u00a0p.m. CDT on the evening of April 27, the supercell thunderstorm began to re-intensify in northeastern Alabama. Initially, a severe thunderstorm warning was issued for the region, before a tornado warning was issued for the Lakeview community and surrounding areas at 6:10\u00a0p.m. CDT. At approximately 6:19\u00a0p.m. CDT (23:19 UTC), the tornado touched down in Lakeview, northeast of Geraldine.[10] The tornado began with relatively modest structural damage to smaller buildings trees in the Lakeview area. The tornado ran parallel to SR 75, moving toward Fyffe. As it approached Fyffe, the tornado displayed multiple vortices, wavering between thin horizontal sub-vortices and a solidified wedge appearance.[11] Swaths of trees around Beulah Baptist Cemetery, east of Lakeview, were snapped, and significant destruction of homes and trees was observed in Fyffe. Generally at EF3 intensity up to this point, the tornado moved toward Shiloh and intensified. Along Heaton Road, the tornado grew much wider, reaching EF5 intensity for the first time shortly thereafter. A metal farm building was completely destroyed, along with numerous homes, with some lower-bound homes being wiped off their foundations. The tornado maintained EF5 intensity, producing significant ground scouring, as it exited Shiloh.[12] Just east of Rainsville, the tornado grew to one-half-mile (0.80\u00a0km) wide and reached its peak intensity of EF5. Numerous homes, businesses, and public facilities were decimated, with little to no debris left behind. Vehicles were lofted hundreds of yards and mangled beyond recognition, including a school bus that was thrown across a highway, and stripped down to its chassis. A Huddle House was impacted with enough strength to distort its metal frame, and only one wall was left standing. Plainview High School sustained $10 to $15 million (2011 USD) in damage to the main school buildings, gymnasiums, sports fields, cafeteria, as well as the DeKalb County Schools Coliseum.[1] Many homes were swept clean from their foundations, their debris having been strewn up to a mile away.[3][13] Trees were debarked, mobile homes were obliterated, and homes anchored with bolts and foundation straps were destroyed. The devastation became especially extreme around a small corridor directly east of downtown Rainsville along Lingerfeldt Road, where one exceptionally well-built stone house was utterly obliterated at high-end EF5 strength, the debris widely scattered. A large supporting cement and stone pillar at this property was uprooted entirely, lifting a section of the concrete foundation with it. Multiple vehicles were deformed and destroyed as well, with one tossed into a nearby ravine.[14] Deep scouring of the ground and pock-marking were observed, and a considerable number of homes along Lingerfeldt Road were swept away. Several roads had their pavement stripped away, and at one residence, an 800-pound (360\u00a0kg) safe was thrown over 600 feet (180\u00a0m) into a wooded area. When found, the safe's door had been ripped open and completely torn off. A pick-up truck of considerable size at this location was discovered dispersed in fragments, at a distance of over 250 yards (230\u00a0m) within the same forest area. The house's occupants took refuge in a storm pit situated nearby, and while left unharmed, the tornado partially exposed the storm pit, causing soil to be drawn up and removed from around the entrance. The force of the tornado caused another underground storm shelter to heave upwards slightly.[15] Slightly northeast of Lingerfeldt Road, more extreme damage was discovered in another corridor from County Road 515 through a neighborhood along County Road 441. Multiple large, two-story homes were wiped completely off their foundations, and cars in this location were also lofted a considerable distance. Another section of pavement near this location was lifted up, and around the pavement significant ground scouring was present. While the damage was exceptional, almost all the homes in this location were identified to have poor anchoring, and this damage was rated EF4.[16] The tornado continued across the eastern fringes of Sylvania, obliterating the Mountain View Baptist Church, pulling up a section of sidewalk, and sweeping away more homes. One home was found obliterated, with a couple being thrown into an open field; their bodies were later found by the police.[17] Although some of these homes were inadequately anchored to their foundations, multiple residences were discovered to have been very well constructed, with adequate anchor bolting and foundation straps. Vehicles in the Sylvania area were mangled as well.[18] More homes were leveled as the tornado tracked further northeast. In the High Point area, metal transmission truss towers were crumpled on County Road 112. Most homes in this area were poorly constructed and completely destroyed; however, large pieces of debris were found close by, suggesting a decrease in intensity. As the tornado moved southeast of Henagar and Ider, many hardwood trees were stripped; some had no stubs of any branches remaining and were partially debarked. A very old, one-story section of a church was completely destroyed near the Blake community. The tornado began to shrink rapidly after this. Upon crossing into Georgia near Fox Mountain, the tornado continued to produce high-end EF1 damage. The tornado tracked another three miles (4.8\u00a0km), crossing I-59 and moving through Rising Fawn, before finally dissipating outside the community at 6:55\u00a0p.m. CDT/7:55\u00a0p.m. EDT (23:55 UTC).[3] The supercell responsible for this tornado would later go on to produce an EF4 tornado that hit the town of Ringgold, Georgia, about 30 minutes later, the fourth violent EF4+ tornado from the cell.[19]"

Congressman Robert Aderholt arrived in DeKalb County within days of the storms to survey the damage with FEMA Deputy Administrator Richard Serino.[22] In the towns of Fyffe and Rainsville, volunteer groups from local schools, churches, and community organizations joined forces to provide immediate assistance. The FTC issued their emergency plan to bring service back to areas, as other volunteers focused on removing debris, providing food and shelter, and offering emotional support to those affected. Similarly, in Georgia, community volunteers in Rising Fawn provided assistance to local residents with clean-up efforts and basic needs. The American Red Cross set up a disaster relief center in Rainsville at the local high school, offering shelter, food, and counseling to those affected.[23] The Salvation Army also worked diligently, setting up mobile feeding units in each of the heavily impacted areas.[24] The Southern Baptist Convention served food and aid for those affected in Rainsville as well.[25] Many funerals took place in Rainsville in the weeks following the event.[26] Months after April 27, many citizens affected in the area gathered with FEMA at the Tom Bevill Enrichment Center in Rainsville to discuss ways to rebuild the area.[20]"

        "content": "On March\u00a02, the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) highlighted the forecast evolution of an upper-level trough and the potential for severe thunderstorms across portions of the southern Plains and the lower Mississippi River Valley valid for day\u00a05/March\u00a06. However, limited moisture return and low forecaster confidence prevented the delineation of a severe weather threat area at that time.[2] The organization again omitted a threat area for the same period the next day, citing unpredictability in the duration and severity of strong thunderstorms.[3] On March\u00a04, the SPC outlined a Marginal risk of severe weather from northeastern Texas northward into extreme portions of southern Minnesota and southwestern Wisconsin.[4] The next morning, a Slight risk was introduced across portions of northeastern Oklahoma, southeastern Kansas, much of Missouri, and northwestern Arkansas.[5] Accounting for increased confidence in supercellular thunderstorm development ahead of a quasi-linear convective system (QLCS), a small Enhanced risk of severe weather was indicated across portions of northwestern Arkansas and southern Missouri during the afternoon hours of March\u00a05.[6] This risk area was expanded the day of the event, including a 10% hatched tornado probability area across southeastern Kansas and south-central Missouri where the SPC noted, \"large hail and tornadoes, some of which may be significant, will be the primary risks with any supercells that can maintain discrete mode immediately ahead of a probable QLCS.\"[7] On the heels of a significant tornado outbreak that affected much of the same areas the week before, this event came to fruition as a synoptic upper-level trough tilted northwest to southeast from the Alaska Panhandle into the Four Corners region. A strong shortwave trough on the base of the synoptic feature was expected to phase with a second shortwave over Utah, collectively progressing across the northern and central Plains throughout March\u00a06. The northern half of the trough, meanwhile, was expected to evolve into a closed low in the middle levels of the atmosphere as it lifted into The Dakotas and then on up to southern Canada. At the surface, a rapidly-deepening area of low pressure (expected to fall to near 978\u00a0mb (28.9\u00a0inHg) by 00:00\u00a0UTC on March\u00a07) was noted across South Dakota, with a cold front extending southward into New Mexico and a warm front extending eastward into the Great Lakes region. A dry line extended from central South Dakota down to northern Mexico. Both the cold front and the dry line were expected to track eastward throughout the day, with the former feature expected to overtake portions of the latter in eastern Kansas by the evening hours.[8] Despite widespread low-level clouds in the warm sector, limiting the amount of atmospheric instability,[9] mid-level Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) values were expected to rise to around 2000\u00a0J/kg across the western Ozarks and up to 500\u00a0J/kg as far north as north-central Minnesota. Partially modified Gulf moisture, with dewpoints in the 60s F across the Enhanced risk and 50s F farther north, was expected to combine with steep mid-level lapse rates of 7\u20137.5\u00a0C/km to destabilize the environment.[8] Although a capping inversion across the risk area limited convection throughout the day and despite the main forcing passing north of the highest risk area, two regimes were expected to evolve: a quasi-linear convective system along the cold front and the formation of discrete supercells ahead of said line. With strong effective bulk wind shear up to 65\u201375\u00a0mph (105\u2013121\u00a0km/h), effective storm relative helicity of 250\u2013400\u00a0m2/s2,[8] and even higher 0\u20131\u00a0km storm relative helicity values of 500\u2013600\u00a0m2/s2,[10] the environment became primed for a widespread severe weather and tornado outbreak. The first tornado watch of the day was issued at approximately 17:55\u00a0UTC across portions of Iowa,[11] and several other watches were also issued across the Midwest before the final watch issued for portions across the Mid-South expired at 16:00\u00a0UTC on March\u00a07.[12] In total, the SPC logged 35 filtered reports of tornadoes, 352 filtered reports of damaging winds, and 98 filtered reports of severe hail.[13] A vast majority of tornadoes that occurred during this outbreak were spawned by semi-discrete supercell structures and embedded mesovortices within a larger quasi-linear convective system, as development of true discrete supercell thunderstorms throughout the event was somewhat limited. However, a few isolated supercell thunderstorms did develop over northern Arkansas and southern Missouri during the late night hours of March 6 into the early morning hours of March 7. One of these isolated supercells produced a long-track EF2 tornado that struck Parthenon, Arkansas and caused heavy damage. The most significant event of the outbreak was an EF3 tornado that moved directly through Oak Grove, Missouri, damaging or destroying hundreds of structures and injuring 12 people. No fatalities occurred as a result of this outbreak, but 19 people were injured.[14]"

As the primary tornado continued eastward through the rest of Charles County, the secondary tornado dissipated after peaking at F2 intensity.[8] At approximately 7:30 pm, after striking Benedict, Maryland, the tornado began its path through Calvert County, causing widespread F1/F2 damage. After leaving Calvert and crossing through the Chesapeake Bay, the tornado entered Dorchester County and intensified back to F3 strength, leaving a path of destruction before dissipating west of Salisbury, Maryland. The La Plata tornado stayed on the ground & bay for 90 minutes, causing a 78-mile path of damage and destruction through southeast Maryland.[9] This makes it one of the longest lasting and farthest traveling tornadoes outside tornado alley. Per NOAA's assessment of this event, only six other F4 tornadoes have occurred farther north and east of the United States. None were as close to the coast.[9] It also had an incredibly fast average forward speed of 52\u00a0mph (84\u00a0km/h), making it one of the fastest violent tornadoes on record."

        "content": "The tornado took a path through Charles, Calvert, Dorchester and Wicomico Counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and leveling several structures, including catastrophic structural damage in downtown La Plata, where approximately 65 percent of the area was heavily damaged or destroyed.[10] 3 people were directly killed, while some 122 others were injured. In total the tornado inflicted $115 million in damage, making it the costliest Mid-Atlantic tornado.[8] After touching down, F1 damage was reported near Pisgah where a house was unroofed. Shortly afterwards, F3 damage was observed in two subdivisions west of La Plata. Unfortunately, as the tornado moved southeastward, it continued to strengthen while tearing through downtown La Plata, with swaths of F4 being observed. Along MD 6, cars were tossed & thrown over, with the 125-foot city water tower also being blown over. At the Posies Market, only a few walls were left standing. \"Heavy F4 damage\" was noted just east of the lumber yard.[7] While moving through La Plata, the tornado was likely moving at the unusually fast speed of 58\u00a0mph (93\u00a0km/h), nearly a mile a minute, with destruction occurring in near seconds.[1] After leaving downtown La Plata, a heavily wooded area sustained catastrophic levels of damage, with several anchored building being leveled or swept clean off their foundation. A 51-year-old man was killed with his wife being critically injured when their house, which was under construction, on Hawkins Gate Road collapsed. In one of the leveled homes near Normandie and MD 6, seven people were inside and all miraculously managed to survive. 3 were already in the basement, 2 others were on the first floor, with the last 2 still being on the second floor. In total across Charles County, 638 homes were damaged while 100 others were completely destroyed. 143 business (mainly in downtown La Plata) were damaged with 49 others being destroyed.[9] At approximately 7:30 pm, the tornado moved into Calvert County south of the Patuxent River Bridge (MD 231) and struck the Patuxent View development in which over half of the homes were damaged. A home with no anchoring or foundation east of this area was picked up and thrown 80 feet into a culvert, unfortunately killing an elderly couple who were in the house at the time. The tornado damage in Calvert was rated at F1 to F2 intensity, with 125 homes being damaged. Another 10 houses were completely destroyed. After the destruction in Calvert, the twister traveled into the Chesapeake Bay just north of the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant with damage occurring along the shoreline.[9] While crossing the Chesapeake Bay, a second satellite tornado tornado formed. The 2nd tornado didn't produce any damage and dissipated before making landfall. After crossing the Chesapeake Bay, the main tornado pushed into Dorchester County just south of Taylor's Island. F3 damage occurred to one house and several outbuildings near Hip Roof Road. Debris such as canceled checks, bank/tax documents, and teller receipts from La Plata were also found in southern Delaware, well over 60 miles away.[8] Despite the unusual circumstances, there were only five total fatalities attributed to the tornado; three as a direct result of the storm and two from indirect effects.[9]"

        "content": "The tornado was initially rated F5 but was downgraded in a secondary damage survey. For a small period of time, this made it the easternmost F5 tornado in the United States. This preliminary F5 rating, partly due to damage to a brick building in downtown La Plata, was lowered to F4 after the damage assessment team determined that some of the damage was due to flying debris from a lumber company nearby. Damage to houses initially rated F5 were lowered when engineer Timothy Marshall surveyed and determined these homes were not properly anchored, causing them to be swept off their foundations by lesser winds. While impressive, team members agreed that the tornado damage was not as intense as other F5 rated tornadoes such as the ones that struck Plainfield, Jarrell, Bridge Creek-Moore, or Andover.[11] Many of the destroyed buildings or \"slider homes\" were only rated F1 to F3, with surveyors having to depend some ratings solely on the severity of the surrounding damage.[9] This includes the toppled steel water tower in La Plata, which \"was impressive but occurred in an area of F1 damage\". This event showcased some of the prime issues with using the Fujita scale and is largely responsible for the how tornadoes are surveyed today.[8] Due to the extremely fast forward speed, the tornado also had less time to dwell over structures & buildings, with it moving nearly a mile a minute (96.5 km/h) in downtown La Plata. The damage likely would have been more intense with a more typical forward speed; an event again showcased during the 2021 Western Kentucky tornado. Although F4 tornadoes are already a rare event this far east, what was even more unusual was its duration and coverage for this area well outside of the climatologically favored area for violent tornadoes. Despite this, the tornado was not the deadliest one to strike La Plata. On November 9, 1926, another F4 tornado killed 13 school children and 4 townspeople, while injuring some 65 others.[12]"

The Red Cross helped place several families in nearby hotels.[8] Just two days later over 90% of the debris were cleared off the roads, opening traffic back up to the area. With media coverage of the deadly twister being nationwide, building damage surveys were being done by the Federal Emergency Management Agency's, Building Performance Assessment Team, and Wind Engineering Research Council during the same time the NWS was conducting their damage survey.[8] Due to this event, La Plata placed several tornado sirens all around and near the town for preparation on future storms. [13] A memorial garden has since been put up in La Plata, with several benches memorialize those who died from the 1926 and 2002 tornadoes.[14][15] This event is also largely responsible for the modern use of the Enhanced Fujita scale."

The storm was most felt at Northern Philadelphia, where the tornado struck. This tornado might have been part of a tornado family, as 30 minutes before the Philadelphia tornado struck, another tornado struck West Chester, killing one.[3] This tornado also may have been part of a Derecho event producing an outbreak, as another strong tornado struck Alliance, Ohio, and storm damage reported from Chicago to Cleveland down to New Jersey.[4][5]"

Several trains were knocked off of their rails; one loaded with 10 cars was moved 100 yards on the track, with 5 of the cars blown off.[9] Two large brick churches and three factories were unroofed in Kensington, with parts of the roof landing and demolishing a two-story frame building that had 6 children in the lower floor. Five houses were completely destroyed. The worst damage from this tornado was a large boiler house of the Franklin Iron Works that was completely demolished.[6] After the tornado dissipated, the storm itself would still cause damage, lifting a shed 150 yards in Tacony, stripping and damaging many buildings in Newark, blowing down a house near Elkton, killing two, blowing in a church in Bridgewater, ripping a roof off of a bridge in Beaver, and blowing down the York Furnace Bridge.[10][11][12] The tornado caused telegraph line outages lasting several days west of Philadelphia.[13]"

Both are estimated to have been equivalent to F3 in intensity on the modern Fujita scale of tornado intensity,[2] which was not devised until 1971.[3] The March 20 tornado was the costliest tornado in Oklahoma history at the time.[4] On March 25, meteorologists at the base noticed the extreme similarity between the weather conditions of that day and March 20, and later in the day issued a \"tornado forecast\", which was verified when a tornado struck the base that evening. This was the first official tornado forecast, as well as the first successful tornado forecast, in recorded history.[1]"

Illuminated by nearly constant lightning, the tornado was highly visible as it bisected the base, tossing around planes which were parked in the open. The control tower reported a 78-mile-per-hour (126\u00a0km/h) wind gust before the windows shattered, injuring several personnel with flying glass. The tornado dissipated at the northeast corner of the base.[5] The tornado missed most structures on the base, but the damage to expensive military aircraft was substantial. The total damage cost came to around $10 million, or $127 million in 2023 United States dollars.[1] This was the most damaging tornado in Oklahoma up to that date.[6]"

Air Force investigators came to the conclusion that \"due to the nature of the storm it was not forecastable given the present state of the art.\" They also made recommendations that the meteorological community determine a tornado warning system for the public, as well as a protocol for protecting life and property at military bases.[5] Both of these investigations began almost immediately. In the days following the tornado, Tinker's meteorologists Major Ernest J. Fawbush and Captain Robert C. Miller investigated surface and upper-air weather data from this and past tornado outbreaks, hoping to be able to identify conditions which were favorable for tornadoes. By March 24, they had compiled several possible tornado indicators, and decided it would be difficult, but possible, to identify large tornado threat areas in the future.[5] On the morning of March 25, base meteorologists noticed that weather charts for the day were strikingly similar to those before the March 20 tornado. Forecasts issued by the Weather Bureau indicated that almost the same conditions would be present in the evening of March 25 as were present on March 20. In the morning, they issued a forecast for \"heavy thunderstorms\" effective for 5\u20136\u00a0pm that evening. This would allow the base's commander to alert base personnel that they may institute their brand-new tornado precautions.[5] As the day wore on, conditions appeared more and more favorable for thunderstorms, and more and more similar to the events of March 20. Weather radar images showed a severe squall line had formed to the west, and weather stations to the west reported cumulonimbus clouds and thunderstorms. In an afternoon meeting, under some pressure from their commanding officer, base meteorologists composed and issued the first official tornado forecast. Although they were aware of the small chance of success, they felt they had no choice, since the conditions were so similar to March 20.[5] Equipment, which could be, was moved to bomb-proof shelters, and base personnel were moved to safer areas.[6]"

In the spring and summer of 1949, they issued eighteen forecasts for tornadoes within a 100-square-mile (260\u00a0km2) area, and all eighteen proved successful.[6] In the subsequent years, while not explicitly using the word \"tornado\", the Weather Bureau used the pair's forecasts to predict \"severe local storms\".[6] The synoptic pattern which occurred on March 25 later became known as the \"Miller type-B\" pattern and is recognized as one of the most potent severe weather setups.[8]"

Huntsville was founded within the Mississippi Territory in 1805 and became an incorporated town in 1811. When Alabama was admitted as a state in 1819, Huntsville was designated for a year as the first capital, before the state capitol was moved to more central settlements. The city developed across nearby hills north of the Tennessee River, adding textile mills in the late nineteenth century. Major growth in Huntsville took place in the decades following World War II. During the war, the U.S Army established Redstone Arsenal in the vicinity, with a chemical weapons plant and related facilities. After the war, additional research was conducted at Redstone Arsenal on rockets, followed by adaptations for space exploration. NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, the United States Army Aviation and Missile Command, and most recently the FBI's operational support headquarters, all were sited at Redstone Arsenal.[15] The National Trust for Historic Preservation included Huntsville in its \"America's Dozen Distinctive Destinations for 2010\" list.[16] The population was 215,006 at the 2020 census,[10][17] and was estimated to be 221,933 in 2022.[18] The Huntsville metropolitan area's population was 514,465 in 2022, making it the second most populous metropolitan area in the state after the Birmingham metropolitan area."

An Indian trader and boatman named Ditto established himself at a landing on the river prior to American settlement.[20] Revolutionary War veteran John Hunt was a pioneer in 1805 on land around the Big Spring. The US negotiated an 1805 treaty with the Chickasaw and an 1806 treaty with the Cherokee who ceded their claims to land to the federal government.[21] The area was subsequently purchased by LeRoy Pope, who named it Twickenham after the home village of his distant kinsman Alexander Pope.[22] Thomas Freeman and Pharoah Roach started government surveys in 1805.[23] Twickenham was carefully planned, with streets laid out in a northeast to southwest direction based on the flow of Big Spring. Given anti-British sentiment during this period after the Revolution and with tensions leading to the War of 1812, in 1811 the town name was changed to \"Huntsville\" to honor pioneer John Hunt.[24] Both John Hunt and LeRoy Pope were Freemasons and charter members of Helion Lodge #1, the oldest lodge in Alabama.[25] In 1811, Huntsville became the first incorporated town in what is now Alabama. However, the recognized \"founding\" year of the city is 1805, the year of John Hunt's arrival.[26] David Wade settled in Huntsville in 1817.

Many wealthy planters moved into the area from Virginia, Georgia, and the Carolinas to develop new cotton plantations.[28] The invention of the cotton gin in the late eighteenth century meant that uplands areas could be profitably cultivated with short-staple cotton, which could be grown in a much larger area than the long-staple cotton of the Sea Islands and Low Country. The increased use of cotton meant an increased use of slave labor throughout the South as well.[29] Like the rest of Alabama, Huntsville was involved in the slave trade.[30] Slaves worked in factories and on cotton plantations.[31] Many cotton mills in the area relied on slave labor, most notably the Bell Factory, where slaves ran textile machinery. The factory was known throughout Alabama for its high levels of production.[32][28] Cotton mills grew Huntsville and the South's economies greatly, becoming 60% of all U.S. exports and connecting Huntsville to major cotton markets in Nashville, Memphis, and New Orleans.[28][29] An 1822 census showed that out of the 1,300 inhabitants of Huntsville, 448 were slaves, making up 36% of the city's population.[30] In 1819, Huntsville hosted a constitutional convention in Walker Allen's large cabinet-making shop. The 44 delegates wrote a constitution for the new state of Alabama. In accordance with the new state constitution, Huntsville became Alabama's first capital when the state was admitted to the Union. This was a temporary designation for one legislative session only. The capital was moved to more central cities in the state; to Cahaba, then to Tuscaloosa, and finally to Montgomery.[33] In 1855, the Memphis and Charleston Railroad was constructed through Huntsville, becoming the first railway to link the Atlantic seacoast with the lower Mississippi River.[34]"

Jones of Huntsville, distinguished itself at the Battle of Manassas/Bull Run, the first major encounter of the American Civil War. The regiment, which contained two Huntsville companies, were the first Alabama troops to fight in the war. They were also present when General Robert E. Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox Court House in April 1865. Nine generals of the war were born in or near Huntsville; five fought for the Confederacy and four for the Union.[36] Other Huntsville residents joined the Union Army and helped establish the Union Army's 1st Alabama Cavalry Regiment.[37] On the morning of April 11, 1862, Union troops led by General Ormsby M. Mitchel seized Huntsville in order to sever the Confederacy's rail communications and gain access to the Memphis & Charleston Railroad. Huntsville was the headquarters for the Eastern Division of the Memphis & Charleston.[38] During the first occupation, Union officers took over many of the larger homes in the city while the enlisted soldiers camped in tents mainly on the outskirts. Union troops searched for Confederate troops hiding in the town and weapons. There was not much resistance, and they treated Huntsville residents in a relatively civil manner. However, residents of nearby towns reported harsher treatment.[39] Union troops were forced to retreat a few months later. In the fall of 1863, they returned to Huntsville, using it as a base of operations for the war in the South until the last months of 1864. According to the journal of a nearby resident, Union troops burned many homes and villages in the surrounding countryside in retaliation for the active guerrilla warfare in the area. Many houses and buildings were burned,[40] although most of Huntsville was kept intact as it housed both Union officers and troops.[39]"

It was named for educator and school founder William Hooper Councill.[42] Huntsville became a center for cotton textile mills, such as Lincoln, Dallas, and Merrimack. Each mill company constructed worker housing outside the city, creating communities that eventually included schools, churches, grocery stores, theaters, and hardware stores, all within walking distance of the mill. In many such company towns, workers were required to buy goods at the company stores, which sometimes overcharged them. The mill owners also established rules for behavior and could throw out workers from housing if they violated these policies. As was common for the time, work was highly segregated with only whites being allowed to work inside the mills and Blacks relegated to working outside as laborers and groundskeepers.[43] During the 1930s, industry declined in Huntsville due to the Great Depression. Huntsville became known as the Watercress Capital of the World because of its abundant harvest in the area. Madison County led Alabama in cotton production during this time.[44]"

This quickly changed in early 1941 when the U.S. Army selected 35,000 acres (140\u00a0km2) of land adjoining the southwest area of the city for building three chemical munitions facilities: the Huntsville Arsenal, the Redstone Ordnance Plant (soon redesignated Redstone Arsenal), and the Gulf Chemical Warfare Depot. These operated throughout World War II, with combined personnel approaching 20,000. Resources in the area were strained as new workers flocked to the area, and the construction of housing could not keep up.[45] At the end of the war in 1945, the munitions facilities were no longer needed. They were combined with the designation Redstone Arsenal (RSA), and a considerable political and business effort was made in attempts to attract new tenants. One significant start involved manufacturing the Keller automobile, but this closed after 18 vehicles were built. With the encouragement of US Senator John Sparkman (D-AL), the U.S. Army Air Force considered this for a major testing facility, but selected another site. Redstone Arsenal was prepared for disposal, but Sparkman used his considerable Southern Democratic influence (the Solid South controlled numerous powerful chairmanships of congressional committees) to persuade the Army to choose it as a site for rocket and missile development.[45] As the Korean War started, the Ordnance Guided Missile Center (OGMC) was given the mission to develop what eventually became the Redstone Rocket. This rocket set the stage for the United States' space program, as well as major Army missile programs, to be centered in Huntsville. Brigadier General Holger Toftoy commanded OGMC and the overall Redstone Arsenal. In early 1956, the Army Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA) under Major General John Medaris was formed.[45] In 1950, about 1,000 personnel were transferred from Fort Bliss, Texas, to Redstone Arsenal to form the Ordnance Guided Missile Center (OGMC). Central to this was a group of about 200 German scientists and engineers, led by Wernher von Braun; they had been brought from Nazi Germany to the United States by Colonel Holger Toftoy under Operation Paperclip following World War II. Assigned to the center at Huntsville, they settled and raised families.[46] The city is nicknamed \"The Rocket City\" for its close association with U.S. space missions.[47] On January 31, 1958, ABMA placed America's first satellite, Explorer 1, into orbit using a Jupiter-C launch vehicle, a descendant of the Redstone. This brought national attention to Redstone Arsenal and Huntsville, with widespread recognition of this being a major center for high technology.[48] On July 1, 1960, 4,670 civilian employees, associated buildings and equipment, and 1,840 acres (7.4\u00a0km2) of land were transferred from ABMA to form NASA's George C. Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). Wernher von Braun was MSFC's initial director. On September 8, President Dwight D. Eisenhower formally dedicated the MSFC.[49] During the 1960s, the major mission of MSFC was in developing the Saturn boosters used by NASA in the Apollo Lunar Landing Program. For this, MSFC greatly increased its employees, and many new companies joined the Huntsville industrial community. The Cummings Research Park was developed just north of Redstone Arsenal to partially accommodate this industrial growth, and has now become the second-largest research park of this type in America.[49] Huntsville was selected as the permanent home of the United States Space Operations Command in 2020, but in 2023 the Pentagon announced that the temporary headquarters would be expanded and remain in Colorado.[50]"

Around the same time, the color barrier was broken further when the first white person enrolled at Alabama A&M University.[55] In August 1963, a court ruling determined that Huntsville must desegregate their schools. Wallace used state troopers to stop four students from entering the first desegregated school. On September 6, the troopers announced that the desegregated schools were closed for three more days, but the Board of Education issued a statement denying the closure.[56] When the schools opened on September 9, Wallace was served a restraining order against further interference with the desegregation of Huntsville schools.[57] Huntsville became the first city in Alabama to desegregate its schools as well.[58] Alabama's opposition to desegregation at this time caused concern from the NASA Administrator James E. Webb, who investigated equal employment opportunities for Black people in Huntsville. After failing to attract high-level staff to Huntsville, Webb said that \"some research work would have to be switched from Huntsville to New Orleans\". This investigation into employment caused MSFC to open their engineering education programs to Black students at Alabama A&M and Oakwood College, as well as for local contractors to \"work for progress in race relations\".[59][60] The emergence of the Space Shuttle, the International Space Station, and a wide variety of advanced research in space sciences led to a resurgence in NASA-related activities that has continued into the 21st century.[61] In addition, new Army organizations have emerged at Redstone Arsenal, particularly in the ever-expanding field of missile defense.[62]"

Huntsville has the 29th largest land area in the United States, for cities with a population over 100,000. Huntsville has borders surrounding both the cities of Madison and Triana. Huntsville also borders the cities of Decatur, Athens, Owens Cross Roads, the town of Mooresville as well as the census-designated places of Moores Mill, Meridianville, Laceys Spring, and Redstone Arsenal. Situated in the Tennessee River valley, Huntsville is partially surrounded by several plateaus and large hills. These plateaus are associated with the Cumberland Plateau, and are locally called \"mountains\". Monte Sano Mountain (Spanish for \"Mountain of Health\") is the most notable and is east of the city, along with Round Top (Burritt), Chapman, Huntsville, and Green mountains.[65] Others are Wade Mountain to the north, Rainbow Mountain to the west, and Weeden and Madkin mountains on the Redstone Arsenal property in the south. Brindley Mountain is visible in the south across the Tennessee River.[66] As with other areas along the Cumberland Plateau, the land around Huntsville is karst in nature. The city was founded around the Big Spring, which is a typical karst spring. Many caves perforate the limestone bedrock underneath the surface, as is common in karst areas. The National Speleological Society is headquartered in Huntsville.[67]"

It experiences hot, humid summers and generally mild winters, with average high temperatures ranging from near 90\u00a0\u00ac\u221eF (32.2\u00a0\u00ac\u221eC) in the summer to 49\u00a0\u00ac\u221eF (9.4\u00a0\u00ac\u221eC) during winter.[68][69] Huntsville is near the center of a large area of the U.S. mid-South that has maximum precipitation in the winter and spring, not summer.  The average yearly precipitation is more than 54 inches. On average, the wettest single month is December, but Huntsville has a prolonged wetter season from November to May with, on average, nearly or over 5 or more inches of precipitation most of those months. On average, August to October represent slightly drier months (see climate chart, showing less than 3.6 inches of precipitation these months). Droughts can occur, primarily August through October, but usually there is enough rainfall to keep soils moist and vegetation lush. Much of Huntsville's precipitation is delivered by thunderstorms.[68] Thunderstorms are most frequent during the spring, and the most severe storms occur during the spring and late fall.[70] These storms can deliver large hail, damaging straight-line winds, and tornadoes. Huntsville lies in a region colloquially known as Dixie Alley, an area more prone to violent, long-track tornadoes than most other parts of the US.[71][72] On April 27, 2011, the largest tornado outbreak on record, the 2011 Super Outbreak, affected northern Alabama. During this event, an EF5 tornado that tracked near the Browns Ferry Nuclear Power Plant destroyed many transmission towers and caused a multi-day power outage for the majority of North Alabama. That same tornado also resulted in considerable damage to the Anderson Hills subdivision and in Harvest, Alabama. In total, nine people were killed in Madison County, and many others were injured.[73] Other significant tornado events include the Super Outbreak in April 1974, the November 1989 tornado that killed 21 and injured over 460, and the 1995 Anderson Hills tornado that killed one person and caused extensive damage.[74][75] On January 21, 2010, an EF2 tornado struck Huntsville, resulting in moderate damage. Because it was not rain-wrapped and was easily photographed, it received extensive media coverage.[76] While most winters have some measurable snow, heavy snow is rare in Huntsville.[77] However, there have been some unusually heavy snowstorms, like the New Year's Eve 1963 snowstorm, when 17\u00a0in (43\u00a0cm) fell within 24 hours. Likewise, the Blizzard of 1993 and the Groundhog Day snowstorm in February 1996 were substantial winter events for Huntsville. On Christmas Day 2010, Huntsville recorded over 4 inches (10\u00a0cm) of snow, and on January 9\u201a\u00c4\u00ec10, 2011 it received 8.9 inches (23\u00a0cm) at the airport and up to 10 inches (25\u00a0cm) in the suburbs.[78]"

Before then, the News was the morning paper, and the Times was the afternoon paper until 2004. The Times has a weekday circulation of 60,000, which rises to 80,000 on Sundays. Both papers were owned by the Newhouse chain.[254] In May 2012, Advance Publications, owner of the Times, announced that the Times would become part of a new company called the Alabama Media Group, along with the other three newspapers and two websites owned by Advance. As part of the change, the newspapers moved to a three-day publication schedule, with print editions available only on Wednesday, Friday and Sunday. The Huntsville Times and its sister papers publish news and information seven days a week on AL.com.[255][256][257] As of 2023, print editions have stopped production. A few alternative newspapers are available in Huntsville. The Redstone Rocket is a newspaper distributed throughout Redstone Arsenal's housing area covering activities on Redstone.[258] Speakin' Out News is a weekly newspaper focused on African Americans.[259] Huntsville Magazine is a quarterly lifestyle magazine, which, \"Serves as a guide to the best of the city with insightful reads on culture, people, entertainment, and businesses catalyzing the city's transformation.\"[260][261]"

Alabama Highway 53 also connects the city with I-65 in Ardmore, Tennessee.[270] Other major roadways include University Drive, Governors Drive, Airport Road, Memorial Parkway and Research Park Boulevard (SR 255).[271] Public transit in Huntsville is run by the city's Department of Parking and Public Transit.[272] The Huntsville Orbit runs 11 fixed routes throughout the city, mainly around downtown and major shopping areas like Memorial Parkway and University Drive and has recently expanded some of the buses to include bike racks on the front for a trial program.[273] The city runs Access, a demand-response transit system for the handicapped,[274] and CommuteSmart, a county-wide carpooling program.[275] There are several bicycle routes in the city.[276][277] There are bike paths for exercise available.[278]  Huntsville's government is working to improve bicycle network within the city limits.[279] In 2020, Huntsville released a master plan for a 70-mile bicycling and walking trail, named Singing River Trail of North Alabama, to connect downtown Huntsville to the cities of Madison, Decatur, and Athens.[280] Huntsville has two active commercial rail lines. The mainline is run by Norfolk Southern, which runs from Memphis to Chattanooga, Tennessee. The original depot for this rail line, the Huntsville Depot, still exists as a railroad museum, though it no longer offers passenger service.[281][282] Another rail line, formerly part of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad (L&N), successor to the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway (NC&StL), is being operated by the Huntsville and Madison County Railroad Authority (HMCRA). The line connects to the Norfolk Southern line downtown and runs 13 miles (21\u00a0km) south, passing near Ditto Landing on the Tennessee River, and terminating at Norton Switch, near Hobbs Island. This service, in continuous operation since 1894, presently hauls freight and provides transloading facilities at its downtown depot location. Until the mid-1950s, the L&N provided freight and passenger service to Guntersville. The rail cars were loaded onto barges at Hobbs Island. The barge tows were taken upstream through the Guntersville Dam & Locks and discharged at Port Guntersville. Remnants of the track supporting piers still remain in the river just upstream from Hobbs Island. The service ran twice daily. L&N abandoned the line in 1984, at which time it was acquired by the newly created HMCRA, a state agency.[283] A third line, the Mercury and Chase Railroad, runs 10-mile (16\u00a0km) weekend tourist rides on part of another former NC&StL and L&N line from the North Alabama Railroad Museum's Chase Depot, located in the community of Chase, Alabama. Their collection includes one of the oldest diesel locomotives in existence (1926). The rail line originally connected Huntsville to NC&StL's Nashville-to-Chattanooga mainline in Decherd, Tennessee. The depot was once the smallest union station in the United States when it served the NC&StL and Memphis and Charleston Railroad, the predecessor to the Norfolk Southern.[119]"

TVA attempted to sell the plant in 2016, but withdrew from the deal, stating they could not sell the plant under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954.[294] Telephone service in Huntsville is provided by AT&T, EarthLink, WOW!, and Comcast. Comcast and WOW! are the two cable providers in the Huntsville city limits. Mediacom operates in rural outlying areas.

Huntsville Fire & Rescue also has Fire Investigations, emergency response dispatch, logistics, and training divisions.[299] Huntsville has two volunteer public safety organizations in their city. The Huntsville-Madison County Rescue Squad is the county-wide volunteer rescue organization with tasks ranging from vehicle extrication to water rescues.[300] The other is the Huntsville Cave Rescue Unit which is the region's only all-volunteer cave rescue organization. It is tasked with cave, cliff and high angle rope rescues. These organizations are located in Huntsville but operate both in the city and outside with HCRU, responding to many cave rescue calls coming from caves well outside the city limits.[301] Huntsville Hospital in the downtown area is the largest hospital and trauma center. In 2021, Huntsville Hospital opened the Orthopedic & Spine Tower, a seven-story building with 24 surgical orthopedic suites,[302] which brings the total bed count to 881 for Huntsville Hospital.[303] Located further south, Crestwood Medical Center is a smaller, 180-bed[304] teaching hospital that is ranked nationally in two specialties.[305] Huntsville Emergency Medical Services, Inc. (HEMSI) provides emergency medical services to Huntsville and surrounding Madison county. HEMSI operates from 12 stations with a fleet of 36 ambulances.[306] The Huntsville Police Department has three precincts and one downtown headquarters, over 500 sworn officers,[307] 200 civilian personnel, and patrols an area of approximately 220 square miles. The department also boasts its own academy, which has been in operation since 1965.[308] Huntsville spent $1.2 million in 2015 to buy body cameras to be used by the Huntsville Police Department. Mayor Tommy Battle pushed for the purchase of the body cameras, saying: \"We can provide a trust situation with police and our general public.\"[309] The mayor also said: \"Having that body cam there, having the police video there record what actually happens, and when people come in with complaints against Huntsville police officers, they get to see the action that actually happened.\"[310] Following the conviction of a former Huntsville police officer for murder, after he was originally cleared of any wrongdoing by the Police department,[311] the City of Huntsville voted to change the way police shootings are reviewed. Beginning in August 2021, all shootings that result in death that occur by Huntsville Police are to be investigated by the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency instead.[312] The first investigation following the policy change started in January 2022 after an off-duty Huntsville police officer allegedly killed his girlfriend.[313][314] The officer had initially reported the death as a suicide; however, it was later investigated as a homicide.[315] An advisory council created by the city[316] described actions by Huntsville Police department (HPD) as being \"in a manner that was, at a minimum, unprofessional and on multiple occasions in violation of HPD policy.\"[317][318]"

        "content": " Hurricane Danny produced 13\u00a0significant (F2+) tornadoes in the Southern United States during August\u00a01985, the most spawned by a tropical cyclone until Hurricane Ivan in 2004. The fourth named storm and third hurricane of the season, Danny developed from a tropical wave in the northwestern Caribbean Sea on August\u00a012. The system moved northwestward and initially remained weak. Early on August\u00a013, it brushed Cape San Antonio, Cuba before emerging the Gulf of Mexico later that day. The system then intensified into Tropical Storm Danny on August\u00a014. Danny deepened further and became a hurricane early on the following day, while beginning to re-curve north-northwestward. Late on August\u00a016, Danny attained its peak intensity with winds of 90\u00a0mph (150\u00a0km/h). Shortly thereafter, the storm made landfall near Grand Chenier, Louisiana at the same intensity. Early on August\u00a017, Danny weakened to a tropical storm and was downgraded to a tropical depression several hours later. It moved east-northeastward across the Southeastern United States, until dissipating over southeastern Virginia on August\u00a018. There was widespread coastal and inland flooding in Louisiana. The storm brought up to 8.91 inches (226\u00a0mm) of precipitation to Kentwood. Additionally, there were two tornadoes reported in the state. Overall, 33\u00a0single-family homes and 26\u00a0mobile homes were destroyed, while three condos, 908\u00a0single-family houses and 265\u00a0mobile homes were damaged. A combination of rainfall and storm surge in southern Mississippi caused severe beach erosion and flooded 70\u00a0homes in Hancock County alone. Further north, a tornado in Enterprise severely damaged six homes, three barns, and two roofs; it also destroyed one house. In Alabama, the storm spawned 34\u00a0tornadoes, which destroyed 27\u00a0single-family residences and 18\u00a0mobile homes. About 90\u00a0homes, eight mobile homes, and 23\u00a0businesses suffered damage. Impact was similar but less severe in several other states, including Georgia, Maryland, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia. Danny caused five fatalities and about $100\u00a0million in damage (1985\u00a0USD)."

        "content": "A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa on July\u00a030. The system moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean without much convection, or thunderstorms. On August\u00a08, the wave crossed the crossing the Windward Islands and entered the Caribbean Sea, whereupon convection increased. A broad low-pressure area was evident on August\u00a010 in the central Caribbean Sea. Two days later, a United States Air Force reconnaissance aircraft observed a poorly-defined circulation near the Cayman Islands with enough organization to be designated Tropical Depression Four. The nascent depression moved northwestward without further organization, crossing over western Cuba near Cape San Antonio early on August\u00a013. After crossing Cuba into the Gulf of Mexico, the depression organized more and intensified into Tropical Storm Danny early on August\u00a014.[1][2] Intensifying over the open waters of the Gulf of Mexico, Danny attained hurricane status around 00:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a015, only 24\u00a0hours after being upgraded to a tropical storm. Danny continued to strengthen as it approached the southern United States, maintaining a northwest trajectory. The Hurricane Hunters flew into the hurricane on August\u00a015, observing peak winds of 90\u00a0mph (150\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 987\u00a0millibars (29.15\u00a0InHg). At 16:30\u00a0UTC that day, Danny turned to the north and made landfall near Lake Charles, Louisiana. While moving through the state, the hurricane's winds dropped below gale-force within 24\u00a0hours.[1][3] Danny remained a distinct tropical entity as it progressed into the Tennessee Valley on August\u00a017, its circulation drawing in drier air from the northwest. To its north, a weakening weather front was moving to the northwest ahead of a large approaching trough. These weather conditions caused a tornado outbreak, due to the  atmospheric instability and high convective available potential energy.[4] On August\u00a019, the circulation associated with former Hurricane Danny merged with the approaching trough, thereby becoming an extratropical cyclone. The remnants of Danny continued to the east-northeast, emerging into the western Atlantic Ocean near the Eastern Shore of Virginia, and were tracked until August\u00a020 to the southeast of Nantucket.[1][3][2]"

The next day, the gale watch was extended westward. Later that day, the watch was replaced with a hurricane warning, however, the warning area did not include New Orleans.[1] In preparations for this storm, most of the off-shore oil companies evacuated their workers, with Amoco Corporation evacuating 900 people and Exxon-Mobil evacuated nearly 1000 people.[5] About 5,700\u00a0people in Louisiana were housed in shelters."

As it was transitioning into a frontal wave across the Eastern United States, heavy rainfall became focused to the left of its track, overrunning the frontal surface ahead of the storm.[9]"

        "content": "The primary effect from Danny in Louisiana was coastal and inland flooding. The storm dropped heavy rainfall, peaking at 8.91 inches (226\u00a0mm) in Kentwood.[10] Along the coast, storm surge inundated barrier islands, damaged coastal marshes, and caused erosion. Two tornadoes were spawned by the storm in Louisiana. Overall, the American Red Cross reported that 33\u00a0single-family homes and 26\u00a0mobile homes were destroyed, with 454\u00a0single-family houses and 175\u00a0mobile homes receiving extensive impact. Minor damage was reported at three condos, 90\u00a0mobile homes, and 454\u00a0single-family homes.[9] Additionally, about 38,000\u00a0acres of crops were damaged.[11] Sixty-six people were injured by the storm, though no deaths were reported. Initial property estimations revealed $17 to $23\u00a0million in damage, with roughly half of this coming from agricultural damage. The American Insurance Association estimated $25.1\u00a0million in insured losses, with the damage toll about two to three times greater than this.[9] In St. Tammany Parish, 5.5 inches (140\u00a0mm) of rain fell in Slidell, flooding streets and dozens of homes. Additionally, strong winds toppled trees, which fell on houses, mobile homes, and cars. Along the coast, storm tides destroyed a $5,000 pier, while low-lying roads in Madisonville and Mandeville were closed due to inundation. Another tornado was spawned in St. Bernard Parish north of Reggio. Coastal flooding along Highway 46 near Hopedale left the road impassable. In Plaquemines Parish, 3 to 4\u00a0ft (0.91 to 1.22\u00a0m) of storm tides flooded areas along the Mississippi River and outside of the levee system from Empire southward. In Jefferson Parish, a small tornado on Grand Isle de-roofed two buildings, resulting in about $25,000 in damage. At Grand Isle State Park, storm surge destroyed a 100\u00a0ft (30\u00a0m) section of the pier and 60\u2013100\u00a0ft (18\u201330\u00a0m) of the shoreline was eroded, with about 7.8\u00a0million cu ft (220,871\u00a0m3) of sand washed away from the hurricane protection levee. Overall, at least $320,000 in damage was reported at the state park. Storm surge also damaged several homes and fishing camps in the cities of Galliano, Golden Meadow, Leeville, and Port Fourchon in Lafourche Parish. At Port Fourchon, about 75\u00a0ft (23\u00a0m) of beach was eroded. Winds downed trees in Lockport, Raceland, and Thibodaux. A 41\u00a0ft (12\u00a0m) sailboat offshore Terrebonne Parish sank due to rough seas and gales.[11] A Coast Guard helicopter had to evacuate 7 Texans who were on a yacht in the Gulf of Mexico forty miles offshore, since their radio was broken and they were therefore unaware they were sailing into the storm. After being rescued, they were treated for minor injuries at a suburban New Orleans hospital.[12] Inland, the communities of Cocodrie, Montegut, Isle de Jean Charles, and Pointe-aux-Chenes were hardest hit.[11] In St. Mary Parish, storm surge caused about $500,000 in damage at Cypremort Point State Park. In Iberia Parish, storm surge heights ranging from 5 to 6\u00a0ft (1.5 to 1.8\u00a0m) inundated barrier islands and coastal marshes, resulting in about $2\u00a0million in damage to houses, businesses, and fishing camps. In Vermilion Parish, storm surge inundated areas of Henry and Intracoastal City with up to 3\u00a0ft (0.91\u00a0m) of water. In the latter, 30\u00a0businesses were flooded and a kerosene tank was damaged. Strong winds were also observed in the parish, with gusts up to 114 miles per hour (183\u00a0km/h)  recorded in Abbeville. The roof of a school in the city was blown off, resulting in about $60,000 in damage. Wind also de-roofed houses and destroyed mobile homes in the cities of Gueydan and Kaplan, while numerous trees were uprooted. Throughout the parish, 23\u00a0homes were damaged and seven mobile homes were inflicted with impact or destroyed. In Cameron Parish, a tornado spawned near Hackberry damaged two trailers. A shrimp boat in the Calcasieu River near Cameron was swamped due to strong winds. Moderate storm surge damage was reported in some areas near the mouth of the Mermentau River, in the Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge, and the community of Chenier Au Tigre.[11] Strong winds in Calcasieu Parish destroyed an airplane hangar in Iowa and uprooted trees. Falling trees crushed cars in Lake Charles and Sulphur. In Jefferson Davis Parish, wind inflicted $3,000 in damage to a warehouse in Jennings. In Acadia Parish, falling trees blocked streets in Crowley, while the roof of a school in Rayne was damaged. Winds also destroyed a barn and overturned a mobile home in Church Point. Strong winds in Allen Parish caused large oaks trees fall on a home and a trailer in Kinder, Louisiana. In Evangeline Parish, several buildings and trees were damaged in the cities of Mamou and Ville Platte. Strong winds in St. Martin Parish also felled trees, which struck a church and homes in Breaux Bridge and St. Martinville. Numerous trees were uprooted in Opelousas, located in St. Landry Parish; one of which fell on a home. Many trees and a business suffered roof damage due to strong winds in Rapides Parish. Additionally, 3 to 4 inches (76 to 102\u00a0mm) of rain flooded some streets.[11]"

While crossing through the city, the F2 tornado severely damaged or destroyed 15\u00a0commercial buildings, 12\u00a0homes, and one mobile home. A number of cars were also flipped over. The tornado caused one death \u2013 an elderly woman in a mobile homes \u2013 and at least one injury.[11] After this tornado, state troopers were dispatched to guard against looting.[13] The next tornado was also spawned in Walker County in the county seat of Jasper. The tornado moved northward just east of downtown and caused extensive damage to an auto parts store and two mobile home sales parks along Route 78. Several vehicles and other homes nearby were damaged, nine of which were left uninhabitable. A third tornado developed over Lawrence County about 5\u00a0mi (8.0\u00a0km) southeast of Moulton. The brief, F1 tornado downed trees onto a highway, trapping a motorist.[11] The cyclone then spawned an F2 tornado in Spring Valley in Colbert County. Within the community, the tornado damaged two homes, three mobile homes, and a school, and destroyed an outbuilding. The tornado reached the Muscle Shoals area before lifting, where it primarily impacted trees and power lines, though some buildings suffered roof damage. Shortly thereafter, a long-tracked F3 tornado developed about 3\u00a0mi (4.8\u00a0km) south of Danville. The tornado damaged or destroyed numerous homes and buildings along its 45\u00a0mi (72\u00a0km) path, especially over western Limestone County. Few injuries or deaths occurred as many residents took shelter in safe areas of their homes. Two people suffered minor injuries when the tornado destroyed a shop near Trinity. The next tornado touched down near Alliance in Jefferson County. An F2 tornado with a 3\u00a0mi (4.8\u00a0km) path, the tornado downed trees and destroyed one barn, a few outbuildings, and two buildings at a church campus, while the other buildings at the church suffered damage to their roofs and windows.[11] In West Jefferson, the storm spawned a tornado which peaked as an F1. The twister damaged three homes in the city, but mainly only damaged trees and power lines elsewhere along its 3\u00a0mi (4.8\u00a0km) path. A very brief tornado in the Cold Springs area in southwest Cullman County damaged a home and destroyed an outbuilding. Another very brief tornado was spawned near Sumiton, destroying one mobile home. The next tornado touched down in Birmingham near Interstate 459, causing damage to at least one home after trees fell on Alton Road. A second tornado was then spawned in Cullman County, but resulted in no damage. Shortly thereafter, a third tornado touched down in Cullman near Hanceville. The twister caused varying degrees of damage along its path, with the worst impact from near Berlin in Morgan County to the Cullman\u2013Morgan county line, while homes were also damaged in Cotaco, Eva, and Valhermoso Springs in the latter. The tornado damaged more than 30\u00a0homes and destroyed a few others. Multiple injuries and one death occurred \u2013 an elderly woman had a heart attack while seeking shelter. The next tornado touched down in Lauderdale County near State Route 20 and Natchez Trace Parkway, causing little damage. Another tornado was spawned in Cullman County, moving from just north of Hanceville to just east of Berlin, damaging some buildings before lifting.[11] A tornado touched down in Jackson County, but caused no damage other than uprooted trees. The cyclone then generated a very brief tornado in Labuco, a community in western Jefferson County, damaging one home. The next tornado was also very briefly, touching down in Barfield, where it unroofed a chicken house. Another tornado occurred in Madison County, moving from just north of Madison to just southeast of Jeff, downing trees and damaging some mobile homes before lifting. An F2 was then spawned in Colony in Cullman County. Along its path, the twister damaged or destroyed several mobile homes and blocked roads due to falling trees. The next tornado touched down at the Redstone Arsenal in Madison County and moved northward toward Jeff. It damaged a 3-story building at Redstone Arsenal and damaged at least four homes and mobile homes. The cyclone also spawned a tornado in Etowah County, which sheered off tree tops just west of Attalla.[11] Overall, twenty-seven single family residences and 18 mobile homes were destroyed. Forty-six houses and six mobile homes suffering from major damage. Minimal damage was reported in 44\u00a0homes, two mobile homes, and 23\u00a0businesses. There were two fatalities and 14\u00a0injuries in Alabama and $5\u00a0million in damage, mostly from tornadoes.[9] Following the storm, then-Governor of Alabama George Wallace declared three counties in the state as a disaster area."

        "content": "Minimal impact from Danny was reported in Texas. The strongest wind speed observed in the state was 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h) at Beaumont. Tides of 2 to 3\u00a0ft (0.61 to 0.91\u00a0m) above normal caused only minor beach erosion, though State Highway 87 was temporarily closed between Sabine Pass and High Island due to sand and debris washed onto the road. Light rainfall was reported in the state, peaking at 1.85 inches (47\u00a0mm) in Bon Weir, which is located in extreme eastern Newton County. One indirect death occurred when a man was electrocuted while moving a sailboat near Galveston.[9] In Mississippi, an F2 tornado spawned by Danny touched down near Hickory at 1230\u00a0UTC. Although it mainly moved through forested areas, the tornado severely damaged 6\u00a0homes, 3\u00a0barns, and 2\u00a0roofs; it also destroyed 1\u00a0house. Another tornado touched down at Enterprise in Clarke County. Damage was done almost entirely to trees and power lines. Flooding was reported along the south coast of the state, due to rainfall amounts reaching 5 inches (130\u00a0mm), high tides, and waves about 2\u00a0ft (0.61\u00a0m) above normal. Although flooding as mostly limited to streets and low-lying areas, about 70\u00a0homes in Hancock County experienced water intrusion. Beach erosion was significant, with roughly 250,000\u00a0cu\u00a0yd (190,000\u00a0m3) of sand lost. The cost to replace the sand was estimated at between $3 and 5\u00a0million. Wind gusts between 30 and 50\u00a0mph (50 and 80\u00a0km/h) down power lines, resulting in numerous electrical outages across the state.[11] The storm spawned 4\u00a0tornadoes in Georgia. A tornado touched down near Jefferson in Jackson County. Along its 10 miles (16\u00a0km) path, the tornado destroyed two chicken houses and killed several thousand chickens. Additionally, two houses experienced severe damage and a number of others received minor impact. The tornado ended after impacting the Jackson County Airport, where it destroyed 13\u00a0aircraft and severely damaged and unroofed a hangar. Another tornado was spawned in Oconee County at the town of Bogart. One mobile home and a house were destroyed and several others suffered various degrees of damage; a number of trees were also downed along its path.[11] Other than tornadoes, impact in Georgia was minimal, with up to 3 inches (76\u00a0mm) of rainfall in the northeastern corner of the state. An F3 tornado spawned by Danny, struck Waco and was 500\u00a0yards wide making the tornado the largest hurricane spawned tornado at that time.[3] Thirty-six injuries were also reported by the Red Cross in South Carolina.[9] In some areas of the Carolinas, 7\u00a0in (180\u00a0mm) of rain fell.[6] After the storm, then-Governor of South Carolina Richard Riley declared a disaster in Spartanburg County.[7] Two people were killed when their car hydroplaned due to a tornado in Rockingham County in North Carolina. The same tornado injured 35\u00a0people and displaced 102\u00a0families. High winds downed trees and minor flooding was reported.[6] A frontal boundary, which combined with the remnants of Danny, brought heavy rainfall to the Roanoke Valley region of Virginia. Precipitation amounts ranged from 7 to 8 inches (180 to 200\u00a0mm), with estimates of 10 inches (250\u00a0mm) in isolated locations. The South Mayo River began to overflow, after rapidly reaching a height of 16 feet (4.9\u00a0m). The town of Stuart in Patrick County flooded. Masonite International and the J.P. Stevens Textile Corporation suffered $1.3\u00a0million and about $5\u00a0million in losses, respectively. Throughout the state, damage totaled approximately $10\u00a0million. Following the storm, Governor of Virginia Chuck Robb declared Patrick County a disaster area.[11] Heavy rainfall was also reported in Maryland in association with the remnants of Danny, with precipitation totals of 10.49 inches (266\u00a0mm) in Hollywood, 7.65 inches (194\u00a0mm) in Scotland, 5.69 inches (145\u00a0mm) in Tall Timbers, 5.35 inches (136\u00a0mm) in Compton, 5.23 inches (133\u00a0mm) in Mechanicsville, and 5.12 inches (130\u00a0mm) in Budds Creek. Throughout St. Mary's County, at least 14\u00a0roads were flooded, with the worst being on Route 243 at McIntosh Run. At some houses, foundations washed away, basements collapsed, and walls fell. Additionally, there were driveways with severe erosion. Additionally, some cars were flooded.[11] In New York City, 17,000 government workers got a day off to save electricity. Six fires occurred in lower Manhattan. Numerous power failures were reported in New England, especially in Massachusetts, forcing the state to buy power from New York and New Brunswick.[14]"

According to the town history he was a \"conductor or a brakeman, lived in a boxcar at the camp and had difficulty receiving his mail. He painted his name \u2013 \"Moore\" \u2013 on a board and nailed it on the boxcar. When a postmaster was appointed, he continued to call the settlement Moore. When the town incorporated in 1893 the name was legalized.\"[6][7] The city's history notes that the community before the post office may have been called \"Verbeck\" by the railroad.[6] However, other histories indicate that Verbeck was actually the original name of the nearby telegraph station \"Oklahoma\" which became the basis for the founding of Oklahoma City.[8] The community remained small until 1961, when it annexed 21.6 square miles (56\u00a0km2), becoming a full-fledged city in 1962, which in turn increased its population from 1,221 in 1960 to 18,761 in 1970 and 55,081 in 2010.[6] Moore's 1961 annexation kept it an independent city at a time when Oklahoma City through annexations increased its size from 25 square miles (65\u00a0km2) to 643 square miles (1,670\u00a0km2) surrounding Moore on three sides (north, east, west). Norman forms its southern border.[9] In 1966 the Hillsdale Free Will Baptist College, after moving through various locations around Oklahoma, opened in the community. The Moore post office turned into a branch of the Oklahoma City post office on January 7, 1972.[7] In the 1970s the city launched a \"Smile America\" campaign in which giant red, white and blue smileys were painted on the town water towers. A smiley also adorns the city's official logo (as does a water tower).[10] Some of the water towers now have a sign that says, \"Moore - Home of Toby Keith.\"[11][12] On September 24, 2014, at the local Vaughan Foods food processing plant, one employee was beheaded with a knife and another coworker had her throat slit and was injured, but survived. The alleged attacker, 30-year-old Alton Nolen, who was on suspension from the plant prior to the attack due to interactions with the employee who survived the attack, was shot and wounded by company owner Mark Vaughan.[13][14] Nolen was convicted of murder and assault in October 2017. A jury recommended that he receive the death penalty,[15] and, on December 15, 2017, a judge sentenced Nolen to death by lethal injection.[16]"

Due to this, Moore is sometimes considered the Tornado Capital of either the United States or the world.[19][20][21][22] Moore itself has seen nine tornadoes between 1998 and 2015, three of them big enough to claim lives and cause catastrophic damage.[23] The city of Moore was damaged by significant tornadoes on October 4, 1998; May 3, 1999; May 8, 2003; May 10, 2010; and May 20, 2013, with weaker tornadoes striking at other times, notably May 31, 2013 and March 25, 2015. Moore is located in Tornado Alley, a colloquial term for the area of the United States where tornadoes are most frequent. About 20 tornadoes occurred in the immediate vicinity of Moore from 1890 to 2013.[24] The most significant tornadoes to hit Moore occurred in 1893, 1999, and 2013. To warn residents of tornadoes, 42 siren warning devices have been installed throughout Moore.[25]"

The flag plaza is surrounded by a polished concrete walking area with a stained five-pointed star stretching the entire width and height of the walking area. A committee was formed to plan the second phase of the Moore Veterans Memorial. A campaign to sell bricks to be placed in the memorial was completed in early 2009. Over 190 bricks were purchased by supporters from the community and surrounding areas. The bricks were placed in the Memorial Wall and Phase II was completed in May 2009. The Soldiers' Memorial was dedicated on May 15, 2010. It consists of four carved wooden soldiers representing the four major wars since the end of World War I. They include World War II, Korea, Vietnam, and the Afghanistan/Iraq War.[36] After being destroyed by the May 2013 tornado, the park won the title of \"America's Favorite Park\"[citation needed] in an online competition sponsored by Coca-Cola, beating out numerous other parks from around the country. First prize was a $100,000 grant, which was combined with other funds to cover the estimated $200,000 in rebuilding expenses. The first steps toward rebuilding began in November 2013, during a groundbreaking ceremony and the awarding of the grant to Mayor Glenn Lewis.[37] The park's playgrounds are now open to the public."

At its height, the fire engaged as many as 4,766 personnel from multiple agencies.[10] The fire was reported on the afternoon of July 23, 2018, near the intersection of Highway 299 and Carr Powerhouse Road, at mile marker 9, in the Whiskeytown district of the Whiskeytown\u2013Shasta\u2013Trinity National Recreation Area. Coincidental to the name of the incident, the fire was started when a flat tire on a vehicle caused the wheel's rim to scrape against the asphalt, creating sparks that set off the fire.[11] On July 26, the fire jumped the Sacramento River, making its way into the city of Redding, causing the evacuation of 38,000 people. Evacuations also took place in Summit City, Keswick, Lewiston, Shasta Lake City, Igo, Ono, and French Gulch. Eight people died in the fire, including three firefighters."

The fire was believed to have been started accidentally by a vehicle towing a dual-axle travel trailer.  One of the tires on the trailer blew out, causing the steel rim to scrape along the pavement, generating sparks that ignited dry vegetation along the edge of the highway.  Wind caused the fire to spread quickly.[12][13] Hot conditions and steep, inaccessible terrain presented challenges for fire crews as they strengthened containment lines. Highway 299 was closed and French Gulch was placed under mandatory evacuation.[14] Overnight from July 25 to 26, the fire grew to 20,000 acres (8,094\u00a0ha) in total area burned.[15] By the evening of July 26, the fire had burned 28,763 acres (11,640\u00a0ha) and was 10 percent contained.[16] It was reported to have destroyed 15 buildings and damaged 5, while remaining a threat to 496 other buildings.[1] The fire jumped the Sacramento River and portions of the western area of Redding were put under mandatory evacuation orders. Power to residents in North Redding was shut off by Redding Electric Utility. A state of emergency was declared by Governor Jerry Brown.[16] The evacuation center at Shasta High School was relocated to Shasta College.[17] A firefighter was killed while operating a bulldozer.[18] The National Guard was called in to help fight the fire on the night of July 26.[19] The fire remained active overnight, with fire crews continuing to build containment lines. However, crews were stalled in their work due to the fire's extreme behavior.[20] Just after midnight, evacuation orders were put in place for Shasta Dam, Summit City, and neighborhoods in western Redding.[21] A second firefighter, Jeremy Stoke of the Redding Fire Department, was killed and it was reported that three firefighters from Marin County sustained burns. They were defending a structure when a heat blast from the flames came towards them. All three were released, with one being evaluated at the University of California, Davis Burn Center for burns on his face, hands and ears.[18][22][23] By the evening of July 27, the fire had destroyed 500 structures and threatened almost 5,000. CrossPointe Community Church was named the third evacuation place.[24] Amtrak announced that their Coast Starlight service would stop in Sacramento and Klamath Falls with alternative transportation being provided.[25] Containment lines remained the priority for firefighters overnight. Red flag warnings and heat advisories were put in place for the area.[26] By the next morning, over 38,000 individuals had been evacuated.[23] The Shasta College evacuation center reached capacity by July 28 and two more shelters operated by the Red Cross, and one at Grace Baptist Church, were opened.[27] President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency for the state of California due to this fire and other fires burning in the state.[28] The communities of Happy Valley and Anderson, as well as other areas, were put under mandatory evacuation in the mid-morning.[1] A woman and two children, who were reported missing on July 26 due to the fire, were reported dead.[2] More buildings were evaluated for damage, bringing the total up to 536 destroyed and 117 damaged. Winds were erratic, fueled by hot weather, which created spot fires throughout the fire area.[29] Weaverville Elementary School was closed as an evacuation center and a new center was opened at Trinity High School.[30] In the evening, new evacuation orders were put in place for Highway 299 at Trinity Dam Road west to Douglas City and other nearby subdivisions.[31] A sixth fatality was reported on July 29, as the fire moved from densely populated areas and into rural parts of Shasta and Trinity Counties. The community of Lewiston was evacuated. By the evening, fire containment had grown from 5 to 17 percent. The National Guard was assigned to Redding to monitor for looting in evacuated neighborhoods.[32] The next day, repopulation began of areas of western Redding, Shasta Lake, and Happy Valley that had previously been evacuated.[33][34][35] Overnight, strengthening containment lines remained a priority as east and west winds converged and created challenges for firefighters.[1] Repopulation efforts continued, starting on the morning of July 31 for areas of western Redding, Summit City, Buckeye, and Happy Valley.[36][37] Celebrity chef Guy Fieri provided food for evacuees in Redding.[38] By the evening of July 31, the fire had burned 112,888 acres (45,684\u00a0ha) and was 30 percent contained.[1] Crews were challenged by the fire along the western edge, where the fire burned in high terrain with strong winds and dry fuels.[39]"

Shasta College, which served as an evacuation center, resumed normal services. Six people were reported as arrested for alleged looting or illegally being in evacuated areas.[43] The area west of Lakehead, California, was closed to public access to allow for fire crews' safety.[45] Thus far, the fire had destroyed 1,546 structures, including 1,058 residential and 13 commercial.[46] On the morning of August 2, the fire covered 125,842 acres (50,926\u00a0ha) and remained 35 percent contained.[1] Over 1,600 structures remained threatened, due to the fire. The Carr Fire continued to grow as the terrain, wind, and dry fuels continued to create challenges for fire crews. The Sunset West, Sunset Terrace, Ranch Land Acres, Middletown Park neighborhoods, and Centerville were reopened to population in the morning.[47] By August 4, the fire grew to 145,015 acres (58,685\u00a0ha) and to 41 percent containment. California Governor Jerry Brown toured the site and announced that he had requested a major disaster declaration, which provides federal assistance.[48] Later that day, President Donald Trump approved the request for Shasta County.[49] A seventh fatality was reported when a PG&E employee died in a vehicle incident.[50] By August 9, the fire grew to 178,752 acres (72,338\u00a0ha), with 49 percent containment.

Additionally, electrical wires were damaged, a car was hurled into a house, and a dumpster was thrown 50\u00a0ft (17\u00a0yd). The tornado moved northeast at 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) across the Everglades, entering northwest Dade County and then southwest Broward County. Subsequently, the tornado struck the communities of Sunrise, Lauderhill, North Lauderdale, Margate, Pompano Beach, and Lighthouse Point. It first hit several homes and a recreation center in Sunrise, causing extensive damage. As it moved through Sunrise, the tornado downed power poles, wires, screen enclosures, trees, and mailboxes. Doors at the Sunrise city hall were blown open, allowing debris inside that covered the first floor of the building. Damage was widespread throughout the city, particularly along and near Oakland Park Boulevard (SR 816). At least three\u00a0funnel clouds were reported in Sunrise, and at least one\u00a0tornado touchdown was alleged. Windows were broken in hundreds of homes, while trees and power lines were prostrated. The mayor of the town of Sunrise, John Lomelo, declared a state of emergency in town, upon hearing of damage to city hall and across the city. Next, the tornado blew a porch from a home in Lauderhill. In North Lauderdale, the tornado damaged 30\u00a0to 40\u00a0homes in a four-block area, blowing awnings loose and uprooting trees. In Margate, the tornado affected the 600 and 700 blocks along SW 51st Avenue. A home was unroofed, another home lost most of its roof, and trees and power lines were downed. The tornado tore a bedroom door from its hinges, broke glass, and snapped a 40-foot-tall (12\u00a0m) Norfolk Island pine tree in half. After hitting Margate, the tornado struck the Pompano Beach service plaza on Florida's Turnpike, overturning an 18-wheeler tractor trailer, uprooting trees, and blowing away signs. In this area, the tornado was estimated to have been 1\u20444 to 1\u20442\u00a0mi (0.40 to 0.80\u00a0km) wide. After hitting the service plaza, the tornado continued northeast to Golf View Estates, a mobile-home park north of Palm-Aire Country Club, damaging about 15\u00a0mobile homes, of which six\u00a0to eight\u00a0had major damage. Several mobile homes were unroofed. Near the intersection of Copans Road and Northeast Third Avenue, the tornado struck another mobile-home park, where its winds overturned a mobile home and moved another off its foundation. Trees in the park were snapped \"like toothpicks,\" and a downed tree landed on a mobile home. Nearby, the tornado also broke glass in a two-story home. As it continued across north Pompano Beach, the tornado destroyed a satellite dish at a restaurant. The tornado continued northeast to Lighthouse Point, where a department store on Federal Highway had its roof damaged. Flying debris from the store also damaged nearby apartments. Nearby, windows were shattered in a public library, and a supermarket delivery truck carrying frozen food was overturned. The Lighthouse Point section of the path was described as having been being done by a separate tornado. The Everglades\u2013Lighthouse Point tornado featured the second-longest path recorded south of Lake Okeechobee; only one tornado in 1968 featured a longer path of 65\u00a0mi (105\u00a0km) in southern Florida.[25]"

After graduating from Wicomico Senior High School, now Wicomico High School, Seidel attended Salisbury State College and earned a Bachelor of Science degree, double majoring in mathematics and geography, in 1979.[5] Seidel is also a 1979 student initiate of the Omicron Delta Kappa Circle and Phi Kappa Phi Honor Society at Salisbury State College. Immediately after his graduation, Seidel began his television career with WMDT-TV, from 1980 to 1982, in Salisbury.[1] Seidel also entered graduate school, and he earned his Master's degree in Meteorology at Pennsylvania State University. Seidel wrote his master's thesis under the direction of Dr. Greg Forbes, The Weather Channel's retired severe weather expert. During his graduate studies, Seidel appeared on Weather World on the Pennsylvania Public Television Network. Seidel's first full-time broadcasting position was at WYFF-TV in Greenville, South Carolina, where he worked from 1983 through 1989.[1] He next returned to Salisbury in 1989 to work as the meteorologist for WBOC-TV.

Originating from an area of low pressure associated with a monsoon trough in late-September, Brian quickly organized into a tropical storm over the South China Sea on September\u00a030. Tracking along a general west-southwest to westerly course, the storm attained typhoon status on October\u00a01 before making landfall along the southern coast of Hainan Island the following day. Slight weakening occurred during Brian's brief passage of Hainan Island before the system entered the Gulf of Tonkin. The storm ultimately struck Vietnam on October\u00a03 before dissipating the next day over Laos. Across Hainan Island, Brian caused extensive damage to property and infrastructure. Nearly 185,000\u00a0homes were damaged or destroyed by the storm's high winds or flash flooding. Communications were severely disrupted as 2,800\u00a0km (1,700\u00a0mi) of power and telephone lines were downed. Brian killed 40 people and inflicted 837\u00a0million Renminbi (US$222\u00a0million) in damage throughout Hainan before impacting Vietnam and causing further damage.

By September\u00a028, a broad band of convection associated with a weak area of low pressure developed within the trough.[1] Later that day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began monitoring the system as a tropical depression.[2][nb 1]  Aided by a well-defined anticyclone, the low quickly organized, prompting the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert.[nb 2] Initially steered westward by a subtropical ridge, the depression became quasi-stationary on September\u00a030 about 360\u00a0km (225\u00a0mi) southeast of Hong Kong as the ridge weakened. Shortly after the system stalled, the JTWC also began warning on it as a tropical depression.[1] Following a reintensification of the ridge later on September\u00a030, the depression resumed a west-southwesterly track. During this time, the depression attained tropical storm status and was given the name Brian by the JTWC. Over the following 24\u00a0hours, Brian continued to intensify and ultimately reached typhoon strength late on October\u00a01.[1] After developing a large eye,[5] Brian reached its peak intensity on October\u00a02 with winds of 150\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph; one-minute sustained).[1] The JMA also classified Brian as a typhoon around this time, estimating the storm to have attained peak ten-minute sustained winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph) as well as a minimum pressure of 970\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.64\u00a0inHg).[2] Now tracking due west, the typhoon moved towards Hainan Island and ultimately made landfall along the southeastern coast of the island around 1500\u00a0UTC.[1] Only slight weakening took place as the typhoon skirted along the southern coast of Hainan Island. By October\u00a03, Brian had entered the Gulf of Tonkin and struck Vietnam later that day near Vinh with winds of 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph). Rapid dissipation ensued once onshore and Brian eventually dissipated on October\u00a04 over the mountainous terrain of Laos.[1][5]"

Over 25\u00a0million lumber and rubber trees were snapped or uprooted by the typhoon.[5][8] Heavy rains accompanying the storm triggered significant flash flooding.[6] Many rivers across the island overtopped their banks and inundated surrounding areas, including an estimated 194,000 acres of rice paddies.[8] Across Hainan, 40 people were killed and 529 others were injured by the storm.[9] Losses throughout the region reached 837\u00a0million Renminbi (US$222\u00a0million).[5] Although Hong Kong was not in the direct path of the storm, the Hong Kong Observatory issued storm signals on September\u00a030 as high winds associated with the typhoon were expected to impact the city. On October\u00a02, the storm passed 270\u00a0km (170\u00a0mi) south of the city. Wind gusts associated with the storm reached 124\u00a0km/h (77\u00a0mph) on Waglan Island; however, no damage was reported. Along the coast, a storm surge of 0.62\u00a0m (2.0\u00a0ft) occurred on Waglan.[5] Due to the severe damage caused by Typhoon Brian, the provincial flood control headquarters urged the Chinese Government to organize relief efforts at all levels.[7] By October\u00a08, the Government of Hainan Island deployed two relief teams to the hardest hit areas. Additionally, 5\u00a0million Renminbi in aid was supplied to the region.[9] In Vietnam, heavy rains produced by the typhoon caused widespread flooding in northern provinces. Early assessments from the Vietnamese flood control committee indicated that 60,000\u00a0hectares (148,000\u00a0acres) of rice fields were submerged and 6,700\u00a0metric tons (7,400\u00a0short tons) of grain were soaked. High winds also caused extensive damage. At least 29,000\u00a0homes collapsed and 119,000\u00a0others were left roofless. Additionally, 572 hospitals or clinics were damaged. Several fatalities were reported in the region; however, they had yet to be verified by October\u00a012. Within two weeks of Brian's passage, Typhoons Angela and Dan struck the country, causing further damage and loss of life. Due to the rapid succession of storms, losses resulting from the three typhoons are difficult to differentiate. Because of the widespread damage caused by the storms, the Vietnamese Government appealed for international assistance.[10]"

A large area of convection was first detected on satellite imagery, and at midday, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center determined that a closed area of low pressure developed between the 135th meridian east and the 140th meridian east. The associated thunderstorm activity initially failed to consolidate due to strong wind shear caused by a displaced anticyclone.[1] The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started to track the system 06:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a026.[2][nb 1] The next day, the wind shear began to relent, as an upper-level anticyclone became located over the system as the system tracked westward, although the circulation remained tough to identify by weather satellites. At 06:51\u00a0UTC on August\u00a027, a Hurricane Hunter aircraft reported winds of 55\u00a0km/h (35\u00a0mph). Based on the above data and an increase in the system's organization, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. On August 28, the storm's center of circulation became better defined,[1] and at 06:00\u00a0UTC, both the JTWC and JMA upgraded it to a tropical storm.[4][nb 2] Around this time, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also began to monitor the storm and assigned it with the local name Maring.[6] Continuing westward due to a subtropical ridge to its north,[1] June slowly intensified.[7] On the afternoon of August\u00a028, June made landfall along the coast of Luzon[1] as a strong tropical storm, with the JTWC and JMA estimating winds of 105\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph) and 80\u00a0km/h (50\u00a0mph) respectively.[4] Over land, the low- and mid-level circulations began to decouple, with the mid-level center and most of the deep convection continuing west and the low-level center veering west-northwest and early on August\u00a029, the surface center re-merged into open water,[1] having weakened slightly according to both the JTWC and the JMA.[4] June began to turn northwest in response to a trough over the East China Sea.[1] At 18:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a029, the JMA classified June as a severe tropical storm.[2] Six hours later, the JTWC reported that June attained its peak intensity of 115\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph).[7] Despite lacking in organization,[7] a surface pressure of 986\u00a0mbar (29.1\u00a0inHg) was measured in Basco as the cyclone passed near the area.[8] The JMA declared June a typhoon at midday on August\u00a030. At this time, it also estimated a peak intensity of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 985\u00a0mbar (29.1\u00a0inHg).[2] Five hours later, June made landfall 240\u00a0km (150\u00a0mi) east of Hong Kong[1] while at peak intensity.[4] The JMA continued to follow the system inland throughout September\u00a03.[2]"

The storm brought heavy rains and strong winds to the region. A minimum pressure of 990\u00a0mbar (29\u00a0inHg) was recorded at the Hong Kong Royal Observatory early on August\u00a030. Tate's Cairn recorded a peak wind speed of 50\u00a0km/h (31\u00a0mph) and a peak wind gust of 78\u00a0km/h (48\u00a0mph). Cheung Chau observed 187.3\u00a0mm (7.37\u00a0in) of rain over a five-day period.

        "content": " Typhoon Noru, known in the Philippines as Super Typhoon Karding, was an intense and destructive tropical cyclone that affected Vietnam, Thailand, and the Philippines \u2014 where it caused widespread agricultural damage. Noru, which means Roe deer in Korean, the sixteenth named storm and eighth typhoon, and third super typhoon of the 2022 Pacific typhoon season, Noru originated from a disturbance over the Philippine Sea, slowly tracking eastward until its development into a tropical depression, where it began to move westward. Noru underwent rapid intensification as it approached Luzon, with 10-minute maximum sustained winds intensifying by  85\u00a0km/h (50\u00a0mph) in the span of 24 hours. Right before its first landfall, Noru reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of up to 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph) and as a PAGASA super typhoon. Noru made its first landfall over the Polillo Islands on September 25 at 15:30 PHT (09:30 UTC) as a Category 4. It then made its second over Dingalan, Aurora five hours later as a high-end typhoon. It significantly weakened while crossing Luzon and emerged into the South China Sea nine hours later. Noru continued to re-intensify over the South China Sea, reaching winds of up to 155\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph) before making its third and final landfall in Da Nang, Vietnam. Tracking further westward, Noru brought heavy winds and rains to Thailand as a tropical depression and later dissipated on October 1. Typhoon Noru, which struck the Philippines in 2022, was the strongest typhoon to hit the country in the Pacific typhoon season of that year.[1] The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) of the Philippines reported at least \u20b1304\u00a0million (US$6.18\u00a0million) in infrastructural damages and \u20b13.08\u00a0billion (US$62.5\u00a0million) in agricultural damages, totalling to \u20b13.38\u00a0billion (US$68.7\u00a0million). 40 people have been reported dead following the typhoon, another 5 remain missing."

        "content": "On September 21 at 00:00 UTC, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began tracking a tropical depression at 22\u00b0N 141\u00b0E\ufeff / \ufeff22\u00b0N 141\u00b0E\ufeff / 22; 141, far east of the Philippine Sea.[2] The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also began tracking the disturbance later on as the system slowly moved eastwards, deeper into the Pacific Ocean. Analysis from the JTWC indicated that the system was in a favorable environment for development, with warm sea surface temperatures, low vertical wind shear, and medium radial outflow.[3] The agency began issuing a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the disturbance shortly after.[4] The system slowly consolidated as it moved eastward and was designated as Tropical Depression 18W by JTWC on September 22.[5] Around the same time, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) noted the system's formation into a tropical depression. As a system formed within the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR), it was immediately given the local name Karding, and the agency began releasing bulletins on the storm.[6] Shortly after, the JMA also recognized the system as a tropical depression.[7] After a lack of steering flow stalled the depression, it began tracking westward along a mid-level subtropical high, maintaining its intensity as it failed to consolidate further despite its favorable environment.[8][9] Despite this, the JTWC and the PAGASA would upgrade the depression to a tropical storm at 09:00 UTC.[10][11] The JMA would later upgrade the depression to a storm a day later, on September 23, and was subsequently named Noru.[12] Up until this point, forecasts from all three agencies expected wind speeds of only up to 55 knots (100\u00a0km/h; 65\u00a0mph); the JTWC further cited a weak upper-level outflow and dry air as hindrances to rapid intensification.[13][14][15] On September 24, the JMA assessed the storm's development into a severe tropical storm.[16] The PAGASA also upgraded the storm shortly after.[17] Satellite imagery now showed a deep convective core with a central dense overcast and cloud tops reaching \u221282\u00a0\u00b0C (\u2212116\u00a0\u00b0F), with animated infrared imagery showing bursts of convection along the circulation center. The environment around the storm were now very favorable for further development.[18] Intensifying 20 knots (35\u00a0km/h; 25\u00a0mph) in the course of 12 hours, the JMA and the PAGASA upgraded the storm into a typhoon by 12:00 UTC; the JTWC following shortly after as Noru's eye began to form.[19][20][21] Under very favorable conditions for development, Noru continued its trend of rapid intensification, reaching its peak intensity of 95 knots (175\u00a0km/h; 110\u00a0mph) 10-minute maximum sustained winds with a minimum central barometric pressure at 940 hectopascals (940\u00a0mbar; 28\u00a0inHg) by 00:00 UTC on September 25, a mere 230 kilometres (140\u00a0mi) east of Infanta, Quezon.[22] Given its intensity, the PAGASA upgraded the system to its classification of super typhoon; the JTWC had also done the same three hours prior.[23][24] At 15:30 PHT (09:30 UTC), the typhoon made its first landfall over the Polillo Islands in the municipality of Burdeos, Quezon.[25] Following interaction with land over the Polillo Islands, the PAGASA downgraded the system to a high-end typhoon, just prior to its second landfall over Dingalan, Aurora at 20:20 PHT (12:20 UTC).[26] Now tracking westward over Central Luzon, Noru weakened further as it interacted with land and the rugged terrain of the Sierra Madre mountain range; the eye of the system later disappeared from multispectral satellite imaging.[27][28] Noru emerged over the coastal waters of Zambales at 05:00 PHT, September 26 (21:00 UTC, September 25) as a Category 2-equivalent typhoon.[29][28] As the typhoon re-entered the South China Sea, it was met with a neutral environment for development, but was able to re-consolidate and form a 17 nautical miles (31\u00a0km; 20\u00a0mi) eye.[30][31] Noru left the PAR at 20:00 PHT (12:00 UTC) and subsequently the PAGASA ceased issuing bulletins for the typhoon.[32] Returning to favorable conditions over the South China Sea, Noru re-intensified to a Category 4-equivalent super typhoon on September 27, reaching 10-minute maximum sustained winds of 155\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph).[33][34] Interaction with the land on the Vietnam coast and easterly wind shear slightly weakened the typhoon prior to landfall.[35][36] At 21:00 UTC, the cyclone made landfall just south of Da Nang, Vietnam; the JTWC released its final warning on the storm shortly after.[37]  Noru rapidly weakened as it moved westward and further inland, weakening to a tropical storm by 06:00 UTC, September 28.[38][39][40] The JMA downgraded the storm to a tropical depression later that same day, and ceased advisories for the storm.[41] The storm tracked further westward as a tropical depression and dissipated on September 30, 06:00 UTC.[42][43]"

Initially expected to remain a tropical depression, the agency raised the possibility of raising tropical cyclone wind signals up to Signal No. 1.[44] The PAGASA began raising Signal No. 1 as early as September 23; signals were first raised in Isabela and Aurora.[45] The Flood Forecasting and Warning Section of the PAGASA (PAGASA-FFWS) also issued advisories in parts of Ifugao and Isabela which were next to the Magat River \u2014 the main spillway of the Magat Dam, which was nearby the storm's forecast track.[46] The National Telecommunications Commission also instructed telecommunications companies to ensure sufficient resources in areas forecast to be affected by the storm.[47][48] On September 24, the Magat Dam began discharging excess water at a rate of 200 cubic centimetres (12\u00a0cu\u00a0in) per second in preparation for the storm.[49][50][51] The PAGASA also began raising Signal No. 2 in parts of Isabela, Aurora, and the Polillo Islands. Now expected to reach typhoon intensity, the agency warned of the possibility of raising Signal No. 4 as the storm neared.[52] In Cagayan and Isabela, farmers harvested their crops early in preparation.[53] The Office of Civil Defense (OCD) in Cagayan Valley was put on red alert; bans on sailing, fishing, and the sale of liquor were imposed on the region.[54] The Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) and the provincial disaster agency for Cagayan also secured funds for immediate response and prepared food packs and personnel throughout the region.[55] The OCD in the Bicol region also went on blue alert, bracing for the effects of the enhanced southwest monsoon.[56] The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) was also put on red alert as it activated its Emergency Operations Center teams.[57][58] The Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority also prepared for the impacts of the storm.[59][60] The Mines and Geosciences Bureau also warned of landslides and flooding in parts of Nueva Vizcaya, Quirino, and Cagayan.[61] The Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) also closed Kennon Road, a major yet hazardous road that connects La Union and Baguio in Benguet, citing public safety reasons.[62][63] The DPWH also began preparing quick response teams consisting of maintenance personnel and equipment which will oversee the possibility of roads in affected areas.[64] The Philippine Red Cross prepared its volunteers, which included operations staff and on-the-ground personnel.[65] Telecommunications companies PLDT, Smart, and Globe prepared their free calling and charging stations for rapid deployment.[66][67] On the evening of September 24 (PHT), Signal No. 3 was raised in the Polillo Islands and in parts of Camarines Norte.[68] In the morning of September 25 (PHT), following a sustained period of rapid intensification, the PAGASA assessed the storm's development into a super typhoon. Subsequently, the agency began raising Signal No. 4, starting with the Polillo Islands. A landfall as a super typhoon was not ruled out, with the agency expecting to raise its highest wind signal level, Signal No. 5, as the storm passes.[69] Quezon, Bicol, and Baguio's local disaster agencies were placed on red alert.[70][71][72] At 11:00 PHT (03:00 UTC), Signal No. 5 was raised in the Polillo Islands and the extreme northern portion of Quezon; the PAGASA would later raise the signal in parts of seven other provinces, while signal number 4 being raised at western Luzon.[73][74] Coastal areas were warned of storm surges in coastal areas.[75] The Pampanga, Agno, Cagayan, and Pasig\u2013Marikina river basins, including the Magat sub-basin, were also placed under a flood watch by the PAGASA-FFWS.[76][77][78][79][80] The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology also raised lahar advisories for Mount Pinatubo and the Taal Volcano.[81] The cities and lone municipality of Metro Manila, with the exception of Makati, all independently declared the suspensions of classes on all levels for the following day, September 26 (a Monday). Classes for September 26 were also suspended by local government units on all levels in parts of Calabarzon and Central Luzon.[82] Courts in Metro Manila, Central Luzon, Calabarzon, and Bicol were ordered closed by the Supreme Court on September 26.[83] On the evening of September 25 (PHT), the Office of the President released a memorandum suspending work in government offices and classes in all levels of public schools in Metro Manila and in the Ilocos Region, Cagayan Valley, Central Luzon, Calabarzon, Mimaropa, the Bicol Region, and the Cordillera Administrative Region for September 26.[84] The United States Embassy in the Philippines and the Philippine Stock Exchange also declared work and operations suspensions for September 26.[85][86] National Collegiate Athletic Association and Shakey's Super League games were canceled as the storm neared Metro Manila \u2014 under Signal No. 3 at the time; the Philippine Basketball Association also postponed its games slated for September 25 to 27.[87][88] Muntinlupa, Quezon City, and the province of Quezon both began forced evacuations of their residents on September 25.[67] The NDRRMC reported 91,169 people \u2014 23,151 families \u2014 preemptively evacuated.[89]"

It was the twelfth named storm and fourth typhoon of the 2022 Pacific typhoon season, having originated from an invest in the Pacific Ocean. Muifa originated from a disturbance near the Philippine Sea, slowly tracking westward until its development into a tropical depression, where it began to move south westward. Muifa underwent rapid intensification as it approached eastern China, with maximum sustained winds of up to 155\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph) Right before its first landfall, Muifa was downgraded to a Category 3, then Muifa made its first landfall over eastern China on September 13 as a Category 1."

Megi made two landfalls, one in Calicoan Island in Guiuan, and another in Basey, Samar. It continued to track southwestward and reentered the Philippine Sea before dissipating. Heavy rains and gales led to the sinking of two ships. Major landslides pushed mud over villages in Leyte, burying around 210 houses.

The agency also reports a total 214 dead, 132 left missing, and 8 injured as of April\u00a029, 2022[update].[43] In Baybay, the city reported a total of 101 deaths, 102 left missing, and 103 injured, with a landslide covering an entire barangay of 210 households in mud.[45][46] In Pilar, Abuyog, 26 people were killed, 96 were injured, 150 were left missing, and 80 percent of houses were buried.[47][48][49] The Ministry of Social Services and Development in the Bangsamoro reported at least 136,000 affected people in the Bangsamoro Special Geographic Area (geographically in Cotabato).[50] On April 21, the NDRRMC incorrectly reported 224 deaths after some of the bodies found were duplicated in their latest report.[51] Agricultural damages are estimated by the NDRRMC at \u20b12.27\u00a0billion, with infrastructural damages estimated at \u20b16.95\u00a0million. In addition, 16,382 houses were damaged (with 2,258 houses totally destroyed), causing an additional estimated \u20b1709,500 in damages. In total, the NDRRMC estimates at least \u20b12.27\u00a0billion (US$43.7\u00a0million) in damages due to Megi.[43] The Department of Agriculture estimates a higher damage toll for the agricultural sector, reaching over \u20b13.27\u00a0billion.[52] The Department of Public Works and Highways also reports a higher damage to infrastructure; estimating around \u20b11.45\u00a0billion, for a total of  \u20b14.72\u00a0billion (US$90.8\u00a0million) in damages.[53]"

This included a historic outbreak of 37 tornadoes in Colorado on June 21.[5] A slow moving trough interacted with extremely high moisture and atmospheric instability to produce favorable conditions for supercells. Large hail and damaging winds accompanied a multi-day tornado risk which produced multiple strong tornadoes, including a destructive high-end EF3 tornado that killed 4 people in Matador, Texas on June 21,[1] and another EF3 tornado south of Granada, Colorado on June 23. Multiple EF2 tornadoes touched down from Indiana to Kentucky on June 25. Reports of power outages, wind damage, hail damage, and tornadic damage accumulated across the affected region. In all, five people died from tornadoes, and three other non-tornadic deaths also occurred. Over 120 people were injured as well."

        "content": "On the heels of another tornado outbreak sequence, a second tornado outbreak sequence began on June\u00a020 with a few weak tornadoes in North Dakota and Minnesota. On June 21, strong southwesterly winds associated with a large upper-level trough over the Western United States began overspreading central portions of the country. The Storm Prediction Center (SPC) issued a bimodal level 3/Enhanced risk, one encompassing the tri-state region of Wyoming, Colorado, and Nebraska, and the second stretching from the Texas/Oklahoma panhandles into North Texas. To the south, an extraordinarily moist environment with dewpoints in the mid-70s \u00b0F over the spread area.[6] High moisture combined with daytime heating resulted in an unstable airmass characterized by mixed-layer convective available potential energy (CAPE) in excess of 4,500\u00a0J/kg. Favorable wind shear overspread this environment, while the combination of outflow from morning storms and a nearby dry line became the focal point for thunderstorm development.[7] A broken line of supercells developed from Kansas southward into Texas, contributing to large hail, damaging winds, and a few tornadoes. An especially intense tornado moved through western sections of Matador, Texas, killing four people and causing major damage. To the north across Colorado, Wyoming, and Nebraska, storms similarly developed along remnant outflow. Although low-level shear was weak, this outflow enhanced shear in the immediate vicinity of storms,[8] resulting in numerous tornadoes that over largely open country. A total of 37 tornadoes touched down in Colorado that day, 27 of which were spawned by a single slow-moving supercell near Akron.[9] A less active day occurred on June\u00a022, although sporadic severe weather occurred across the Southern Plains, including a few brief tornado touchdowns in Colorado and Wyoming. This included a rain-wrapped EF1 tornado that moved through the Denver suburb of Highlands Ranch.[10] On June\u00a023, the focal point for active weather shifted northward into eastern Wyoming and The Dakotas, where the SPC outlined a level 3/Enhanced risk.[11] Stronger wind shear associated with an approaching shortwave trough overspread an unstable airmass with mixed-layer CAPE upwards of 2,500\u00a0J/kg. Through the afternoon, convection developed along the Laramie and Bighorn mountains, and along a warm front/outflow boundary across Wyoming and Nebraska.[12] A few supercells evolved in this region, particularly later into the afternoon as low-level shear increased, producing large hail and numerous tornadoes, some of which were strong.[13] This included an EF2 tornado that injured eight workers at the North Antelope Rochelle Mine in Campbell County, Wyoming. With time, outflow from ongoing convection merged, leading to a line of storms that pushed eastward.[14] Farther south in southeastern Colorado and western Kansas, more isolated but significant supercells developed along a dryline and in an area of strong orographic lift. These highly structured cells moved east in a favorable environment, producing large hail and long-lived, photogenic tornadoes, including an EF3 tornado that completely destroyed a farmstead near Granada, Colorado.[15] On June\u00a024, the risk area shifted deeper into the Midwestern United States.[16] A low-pressure area tracked across southeastern North Dakota during the afternoon, supporting a warm front across northern Minnesota. Modest CAPE of 1,500\u00a0J/kg combined with strong shear along the boundary fostered low-topped convection and multiple tornadoes,[17] including a strong EF2 tornado near Mahnomen, Minnesota. To the south, combined clusters of convection produced sporadic damaging winds across Iowa and Illinois.[18] An expansive level 3/Enhanced risk encompassed much of the Ohio River Valley and Mid-South on June\u00a025. The greatest threat for potentially strong tornadoes was focused across Indiana, Ohio, and Kentucky.[19] Here, the environment rapidly destabilized amid daytime heating, CAPE upwards of 2,000\u00a0J/kg, and the approach of an upper-level trough. An arcing band of supercells quickly developed by midday along a pseudo-dryline feature,[20][21] producing very large hail and multiple strong tornadoes.[22] To the north across Michigan, a line of convection in a more marginal environment produced sporadic damaging winds.[23] Across the Southeastern United States, a moist and unstable environment devoid of strong low-level shear aided a long-lived mesoscale convective system that produced widespread damaging winds as well.[24] Multiple rounds of linear convection contributed to additional severe reports through the evening.[25] The threat for severe weather shifted eastward into the Mid-Atlantic on June\u00a026, where the SPC issued a broad level 3/Enhanced risk stretching from The Carolinas into Pennsylvania and New Jersey.[26] An area of low pressure moved across Michigan and supported a cold front across the Ohio River Valley. To the east, a pre-frontal trough also developed along the Blue Ridge Mountains. Mixed-layer CAPE of 1,000-2,500\u00a0J/kg and dewpoints in excess of 65\u00a0\u00b0F (18\u00a0\u00b0C) across a wide region were forecast to materialize. However, diurnal heating was at least somewhat hampered by multiple rounds of convection and widespread cloudiness through the morning hours.[27] Clusters of storms developed throughout the region ahead of the cold front,[28] contributing to numerous instances of damaging winds and a few tornadoes as far north as Ontario until they began to weaken with the loss of daytime heating or pushed offshore beyond the coastline.[29][30][31]"

        "content": "This very intense tornado touched down along CR 205 to the north-northwest of Matador and tracked due-south at EF2 strength, snapping multiple power poles and trees. The tornado turned in a more south-southeastward direction and rapidly intensified to high-end EF3 intensity near FM 94 just northwest of Matador. A house was swept completely away in this area with only its basement left behind, where a family of three survived as the house was swept away above them. Two vehicles parked at this residence were thrown long distances and were never located, while a third was found hundreds of yards away. A large metal canopy on the property was also destroyed, and trees near the residence were uprooted and significantly debarked. The tornado then moved south through an open field, producing a swath of ground scouring before it destroyed two homes near SH 70 as it entered the far northwestern outskirts of Matador. A truck was thrown over 200 feet from one home and was mangled beyond recognition, two more homes near Pipkin Street had their roofs torn off, extreme debarking of trees was observed in this area, and damage along this segment of the path was rated mid-range EF3. The tornado reached high-end EF3 intensity again as it continued due-south, completely destroying multiple buildings at the intersection of US 62 and SH 70 at the west edge of town. A two-story brick home and several nearby outbuildings were completely swept away near Stewart Avenue, and another brick home was flattened at the intersection of Dundee Avenue and Echols Road. Several other homes in this area were significantly damaged and multiple vehicles were rolled and mangled, one of which had a metal pole driven into it. A tractor-trailer was tossed as well, and debris was strewn throughout this area. A recently-built, metal-framed Dollar General store on the south side of US 62 was completely leveled at high-end EF3 intensity, with its beams twisted and bolted anchor plates torn from the building's concrete foundation. Concrete parking bollards at this location were snapped at ground-level as well, and a semi-truck was torn from its chassis and destroyed, killing the driver.[103] Two convenience stores to the east of the Dollar General store were damaged, and a restaurant and motel were both partially destroyed. A small house and several metal buildings were completely destroyed nearby, one of which had sections of its tile floor removed. Trees in this area were again debarked, some of which were torn of out the ground by their root balls. An RV was thrown and a power substation was partially collapsed as well, leaving 99% of the town without electricity.[104] Past the intersection, the tornado maintained high-end EF3 strength as it paralleled SH 70 and kept moving south, causing major damage at the southwest edge of town. A home was completely leveled and mostly swept from its foundation, and large trees were completely debarked and stripped of their branches nearby. Several other houses suffered major structural damage, and a large metal outbuilding was completely swept off its foundation. A truck was thrown and had its Ford Power Stroke engine ripped out, which was tossed into a pond. A livestock trailer was thrown as well, and debris from destroyed buildings was scattered across fields.[33] The tornado started to weaken and began moving in a more south-southeasterly direction as it crossed SH 70, where it destroyed a guyed 500-foot (150 m) tall radio tower and caused additional major tree damage. A house near the highway was destroyed, and damage in this area was rated low-end EF3. Some ground scouring was observed in this area, and multiple fence posts, power poles, light poles, and signs were blown to the ground along the highway as well. The tornado then weakened rapidly and turned further to the southeast, inflicting minor damage to a house and a barn before it dissipated in a nearby field. In total, four people were killed and 15 others were injured by the tornado.[1] One of the four people killed by the tornado was first reported as injured and later died at a local hospital.[33][105][106][107][108]"

National Weather Service meteorologist James LaDue stated the local tornado sirens for Matador did not activate until the tornado was already destroying homes in northwestern portion of the town. This only gave four-minutes or less of lead time to residents in the town to take shelter.[109] There was also controversy regarding the tornado's rating of EF3, with some meteorologists and storm chasers saying it was \"a gross underestimate of such a violent tornado\".[109][110] Mechanical engineer Ethan Moriarty stated with regards to the extreme vehicle damage that \"the problem is that we can't really go outside of the confines of the scale\"...\"that's the thing with standards like this. You have to stay consistent, even if they are limiting the actual classification of the tornado\". One issue with the Enhanced Fujita scale stated by Moriarty is that vehicles are not a specific damage indicator on the scale, meaning they cannot be used to rate the tornado.[111] Chief meteorologist for KWTV-DT David Payne stated the damage in Matador, \"looks like EF4 damage to me\".[112][113]"

        "content": " Typhoon Chaba was the strongest tropical cyclone in the western Pacific during 2004 and caused a swath of damage from the Mariana Islands to Japan from August through September of that year. Chaba was the Japan's second costliest storm during the season, only behind Songda in September, and peaked as a typhoon with maximum sustained winds equivalent to that of a Category\u00a05 on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale. Chaba originated from a gradually developing area of disturbed weather on August\u00a018, northeast of Kwajalein. Tracking westward, the system gained tropical storm strength the following day and  reached typhoon intensity on August\u00a020. Rapid intensification ensued thereafter, with Chaba quickly attaining its peak intensity on August\u00a023 as it began to curve towards the northeast. This intensity was maintained for several hours before the typhoon began to fluctuate in strength as it began to meander south of Japan beginning on August\u00a026. Three days later, Chaba made landfall on Kyushu, later tracking across the Sea of Japan as it concurrently weakened. On August\u00a031, the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, and later dissipated in the Sea of Okhotsk on September\u00a05. The typhoon caused significant damage to areas of the Northern Mariana Islands, which were buffeted by strong typhoon-force winds. Rota was worst affected by Chaba, as the island remained under the storm's eyewall for several hours. Gusts peaked at 219\u00a0km/h (136\u00a0mph) at Rota International Airport, and the strong winds damaged and destroyed a multitude of homes. Power outages were frequent across the commonwealth, and beach erosion resulted from strong storm surge. Damage in the Northern Mariana Islands amounted to US$18\u00a0million, and 13\u00a0people were injured, with one fatality. Another fatality occurred in Guam under similar circumstances, though the island sustained less damage. Following the storm, a state of emergency was declared in Guam and areas of the Northern Mariana Islands were declared federal disaster areas. Most of the damage caused by Chaba occurred in Japan, where 18\u00a0people were killed and damage figures reached JP\u00a5105.4\u00a0billion (US$959\u00a0million). The typhoon remains the country's fourteenth costliest on record. A total of 8,627 homes were destroyed by the storm's effects, with another 46,561\u00a0inundated by floodwater. Impacts in Japan were primarily concentrated on Kyushu, where Chaba made its first landfall. Rainfall peaked at 821\u00a0mm (32.3\u00a0in) in Miyazaki Prefecture. Like in the Northern Mariana Islands, power outages and transportation delays were of numerous extent in Japan."

        "content": "Typhoon Chaba stemmed from an area of disturbed weather that quickly developed northeast of Kwajalein on August\u00a018. Within an area of favorable atmospheric conditions,[1] the system became sufficiently organized to be classified as a tropical depression by the Japan Meteorological Agency\u00a0(JMA) at 0600\u00a0UTC that day. Tracking westward under the influence of a nearby ridge,[1][2] strengthening continued and the storm reached tropical storm intensity at 1200\u00a0UTC on August\u00a019.[2] It was at this time that the system was assigned the name Chaba.[1] Strengthening at a climatologically normal pace,[3] Chaba reached severe tropical storm intensity at 0000\u00a0UTC on August\u00a020.[2] However, over the day's course, analysis of wind patterns about the cyclone indicated that Chaba's upper-level circulation was decoupled from its surface circulation. Nonetheless, this period of disorganization was limited, and the tropical storm began to quicken in intensification. Early on August\u00a021, microwave imagery showed that Chaba had developed a large cloud-filled eye, signifying additional strengthening.[1] At 1800\u00a0UTC on August\u00a020, the JMA upgraded Chaba to typhoon status,[2] while the system was roughly 345\u00a0km (214\u00a0mi) east-southeast of Saipan.[1] Much of the rapid intensification pattern was attributed to the development of dual outflow channels during the day's course. Concurrently Chaba began to curve towards the northwest around the periphery of the nearby, dominant subtropical ridge in response to an approaching longwave,[3] sweeping past the Mariana Islands.[1] At 1800\u00a0UTC on August\u00a023, the JMA assessed the typhoon to have reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 205\u00a0km/h (127\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 910\u00a0mbar (hPa; 26.87\u00a0inHg).[2] An intense albeit average-sized typhoon, Chaba held this intensity for two days before dry air began to impact the cyclone. On August\u00a026, the typhoon's convection slightly weakened, and the more intense convective activity became limited to the southern and eastern sides of the system.[1] On August\u00a027, the longwave trough that had in part steered Chaba northward moved out of the region,[3] and after slowing down, the typhoon began to assume a westerly course. Chaba initiated an eyewall replacement cycle the next day, further weakening the system. A second longwave trough propelled Chaba towards the north-northeast,[1] bringing it to a landfall near Kushikino, Kagoshima at 0000\u00a0UTC on August\u00a030,[3] with sustained winds of 150\u00a0km/h (93\u00a0mph).[2] Chaba quickly crossed Kyushu and briefly emerged over water before making a second landfall on H\u014dfu, Yamaguchi.[3] At 1200\u00a0UTC on August\u00a030, the JMA downgraded from typhoon status to severe tropical storm status,[2] and six hours later, Chaba entered the Sea of Japan. Racing towards the northeast, the storm made its final landfall as a tropical system near Oshamambe, Hokkaido on August\u00a031 shortly before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone. These remnants persisted for several days, tracking across the Sea of Okhotsk and moving towards the coast of Russia.[1][3] On September\u00a04, the extratropical cyclone became quasi-stationary near Sakhalin before fully dissipating by 1800\u00a0UTC the following day.[1][2]"

On August\u00a021 on Marpi Point Field in Saipan, a large wave resulted in a fatality and caused another person to become hospitalized.[14] As the typhoon moved through the Northern Mariana Islands, tropical storm conditions were felt in Saipan while typhoon-force winds were felt in Rota and Tinian. Rota was positioned beneath Chaba's eyewall for several hours, resulting in extremely heavy rain and strong winds. The highest recorded wind gust there peaked at 219\u00a0km/h (136\u00a0mph), and gusts in excess of 160\u00a0km/h (99\u00a0mph) were documented for ten consecutive hours. Total rainfall measurements at Rota International Airport reached 528\u00a0mm (20.8\u00a0in). Extensive damage resulted on Rota, with the complete destruction of 50\u00a0homes. An additional 175\u00a0homes sustained minor damage. At the coast, the storm surge from Chaba caused coastal inundation up to 3.4\u00a0m (11\u00a0ft) inland, resulting in beach erosion. The toppling of electrical infrastructure resulted in island-wide power outages. Similar effects occurred on Tinian and Saipan, which also experienced widespread power outages and coastal inundation. Across both islands 270\u00a0homes were destroyed and 700\u00a0others were at least partially damaged. Telephone services were also cut in Tinian. Overall, 13\u00a0people were injured and damage costs totaled to approximately US$18\u00a0million in the Northern Mariana Islands.[15] Guam suffered less impacts from Chaba than the Northern Mariana Islands, but was still buffeted by tropical storm-force winds. At Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport, which had remained closed through the duration of the storm, wind gusts peaked at 109\u00a0km/h (68\u00a0mph). The same airport documented 329\u00a0mm (13.0\u00a0in) of rain over a three-day period as a result of the typhoon. However, the highest wind gust measured in Guam overall was in Apra Harbor, where a station clocked a wind gust at 127\u00a0km/h (79\u00a0mph). Effects were mostly of minor extent in Guam. Despite moderate coastal inundation, beach erosion was minimal, and the heavy rainfall did not cause significant flooding. The cost of damage in Guam reached US$25,000. Four minor injuries occurred, and no deaths took place as the storm passed near the island.[15] However, on August\u00a025, after Chaba had begun moving away from Guam, four people were swept to sea by strong rip currents caused by the departing typhoon. Though three of the four were later recovered and treated for injuries, the other person was never found.[16] After the storm passed, governor Felix Perez Camacho declared a state of emergency for Guam, allocating US$250,000\u00a0in funds towards emergency civil defense, public safety, and health care costs. Several executive offices, including the Guam Office and Defense and Homeland Security, were tasked with assessing damage and assisting in repair operations.[6] Similarly, governor Juan Babauta of the Northern Mariana Islands requested that U.S. president George W. Bush declare the commonwealth a disaster area in order to receive federal disaster assistance.[17] This request for funding was granted six days later.[18]"

As a result of these effects, power was initially cut to 5,800\u00a0households,[24] quickly increasing to near 20,000. Precipitation peaked at 300\u00a0mm (12\u00a0in) on the island, and one hundred homes were flooded.[25] The strong winds blew the roof off of a house and burst windows in several other buildings.[26] One person was injured as a result of flying glass. Similarly another person was injured due to broken glass in Yakushima.[12] Striking the largest part of Kagoshima Prefecture on August\u00a030, the typhoon caused heavy losses to agriculture and infrastructure. Numerous buildings sustained damage, and 1,033\u00a0of them were inundated underwater.[27] On August\u00a030, roughly 32,300\u00a0homes in Kagoshima were without power,[12] and by the next day, Chaba's impacts resulted in 328,000\u00a0homes without electricity.[28] Damage in the prefecture amounted to JP\u00a55.17\u00a0billion (US$47\u00a0million), and two people were killed.[27] The highest rainfall totals measured throughout Japan as a result of Chaba occurred in nearby Miyazaki Prefecture. Precipitation in the prefecture peaked at 821\u00a0mm (32.3\u00a0in) in Ebino. A station in Mikado observed 61\u00a0mm (2.4\u00a0in) of rain in a one-hour period, greater than any other measurement in Japan over the same time period.[19] In that prefecture, 1,000\u00a0homes were left without power.[12] Two people were killed and 27\u00a0others were injured. Damage figures in Miyazaki reached JP\u00a538.8\u00a0billion (US$353\u00a0million).[29] The Japan Ground Self-Defense Force was dispatched in both Miyazaki and Kagoshima prefectures to rescue impacted persons and search for missing people.[13] In Kumamoto Prefecture, 100\u00a0homes were left without power.[12] Roads and transportation routes became blocked due to the rains and numerous landslides. Damage there reached JP\u00a51.9\u00a0billion (US$17.4\u00a0million), and though no deaths occurred, there were seven injuries.[30] Storm surge in Fukuoka Prefecture caused damage along the coast, and resulted in some inland flooding.[31] Though being located next to the coast, Nagasaki Prefecture only experienced moderate flooding, with a few buildings becoming inundated by floodwater. Agricultural damage was much more considerable, with 5,645 hectares (13,950 acres) of farmland becoming submerged underwater.[32] Similar effects were felt in Saga Prefecture, where damage amounted to JP\u00a52.2\u00a0billion (US$20.1\u00a0million).[33] \u014cita Prefecture suffered heavy losses as it was battered by both heavy rains and strong winds, affecting the entirety of the prefecture. Several buildings sustained fa\u00e7ade damage. Impacts to rice, vegetable, and fruit production were also reported. Damage accrued in \u014cita amounted to JP\u00a53.4\u00a0billion (US$31\u00a0million).[34]"

It is the seventeenth named storm and the seventh typhoon of the annual typhoon season. Megi started as a tropical disturbance in the northeast of Pohnpei. On September 21, JMA upgraded the disturbance to a tropical depression. The depression was immediately named Megi by the JMA as it was classified as a tropical storm. It was later then designated by JTWC as a newly formed Tropical Depression 20W. Moving northwestwards, Megi was trying to form an eye which prompted the agencies to upgrade into a typhoon. Megi later entered PAR, attaining the name Helen as it continued to intensify. Favorable conditions and low vertical wind shear allow Megi to perform an eyewall replacement cycle as it approaches Taiwan. On September 26, Megi has reached its 1-minute winds of\t220 km/h (140 mph) and a central pressure of 933 hPa (27.55 inHg). The typhoon later made landfall at Hualien City in Taiwan around 14:00 NST (06:00 UTC). The interaction with the high mountains result Megi to weaken significantly and emerge through Taiwan Strait. On September 28, Megi made its final landfall in Hui'an County, Fujian as a weakening severe tropical storm. Rapid weakening has ensued as it moved inland. Megi later dissipated on the next day."

Located in an area of low vertical wind shear and above warm sea surface temperatures near 30\u00b0C, diurnal weakening of convection still continued to occur, especially over the northern half of the system.[9][12] With excellent radial outflow tapping into westerlies and a large tropical upper tropospheric trough (TUTT) cell to the east, a defined eye remained absent from the typhoon.[13] After completing an eyewall replacement cycle on September 26, Megi eventually started to strengthen more in the afternoon, resulting in a ragged but larger eye embedded in this large typhoon.[14][15] The JMA indicated that Megi had reached its peak intensity at 18:00 UTC, with ten-minute maximum sustained winds at 155\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph) and the central pressure at 940 hPa (27.76 inHg).[16] Megi's large eye was temporarily more defined early on September 27; however it soon became cloud-filled as the typhoon had approached the eastern coast of Taiwan. Shortly before Megi made landfall over Hualien City at 14:00 NST (06:00 UTC), it had already intensified into a stronger typhoon at around 03:00 UTC, with one-minute maximum sustained winds at 220\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph) indicated by the JTWC, equivalent to Category 4 of the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale.[17][18] Subsequently, interaction with the high mountains of Taiwan caused Megi to weaken significantly and the typhoon emerged into the Taiwan Strait from Mailiao at 21:10 NST (13:10 UTC).[19][20] At 04:40 CST on September 28 (20:40 UTC on September 27), Megi made landfall over Hui'an County, Fujian as a minimal typhoon.[21]"

As a result of an intense monsoon surge, Abe's trajectory briefly changed to an eastward then northward path before returning to its original track. Abe only intensified by a small amount between 00:00\u00a0UTC August\u00a024 and 06:00\u00a0UTC August\u00a027 due to the disruptive effects of the surge, and on August\u00a030, Abe peaked in intensity as a Category\u00a02-equivalent typhoon on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale.

        "content": "The tropical disturbance which would eventually intensify to become Typhoon Abe was first noted by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) in a Significant Tropical Weather Advisory as an area of persistent atmospheric convection on August\u00a023 at 01:00\u00a0UTC.[nb 1] Located near the end of what the JTWC considered to be \"an active monsoon trough\", the initial minimum sea-level pressure was estimated to be approximately 1,007 millibars (1,007\u00a0hPa; 29.74\u00a0inHg). Following this mention, the disturbance tracked in a mostly west-northwestward direction, traveling beneath a subtropical ridge, with a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert being issued at 06:00\u00a0UTC based on the improving state of the low.[3] Following an increase in the storm's central convection, the JTWC determined at 00:00\u00a0UTC August\u00a024 that it had intensified into a tropical storm which it assigned the designation 15W, and the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began to monitor the system six hours later.[3][12][nb 2] The JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm on its scale at 00:00\u00a0UTC August\u00a025, and by the time twelve hours had passed, a strong surge in the monsoon westerlies had started to develop to the south of the storm's convective area, slowing its westward movement. After enhanced convection associated with the surge on the east side of Abe's main convective cloud mass wrapped around the north, the storm's center of circulation reorganized to the north between the competing convective masses. At 06:00\u00a0UTC August\u00a027, the JMA upgraded Abe to a severe tropical storm with winds of 95\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph),[12] and as a ragged eye developed in the storm, the JTWC upgraded Abe to typhoon status six hours later.[3] Late on August\u00a028, the JMA upgraded Abe to a typhoon on its scale, with ten-minute sustained winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph).[12] Following the monsoon surge, Abe returned to its original west-northwestward track, further intensifying to become a Category\u00a02-equivalent typhoon at 12:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a029.[14] A weakness appeared in the subtropical ridge in association with a short-wave trough, and Typhoon Abe recurved through this weakness, taking it along the coast of China.[3] Prior to making landfall, Abe attained a minimum atmospheric pressure of 955\u00a0millibars (hPa; 28.20\u00a0inHg) on August\u00a029 at 18:00\u00a0UTC as determined by the JMA.[12] It was found by the JTWC that Abe's one-minute sustained winds peaked at 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph) at 00:00\u00a0UTC August\u00a030,[14] and the JMA determined that its ten-minute sustained winds peaked at 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph) at 18:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a029.[12] As a direct result of this interaction with land, Abe weakened to a tropical storm at 12:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a031, entering the Yellow Sea and crossing South Korea in the 30\u00a0hours that followed. It was determined at 18:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a01 that the storm had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone.[3] The JTWC ceased tracking the system at 06:00\u00a0UTC September\u00a02,[14] and the JMA followed suit 36\u00a0hours later.[12]"

        "content": " The 1987 Gulf Coast tropical storm caused flooding along the Gulf Coast of the United States. The second tropical cyclone and first tropical storm of the 1987 Atlantic hurricane season, it originated from a tropical wave in the Gulf of Mexico, southeast of Texas, on August\u00a09. Initially a tropical depression, the cyclone moved north-northwestward and slightly intensified into a tropical storm later that day. By August\u00a010, it made landfall between Galveston and Beaumont. The system weakened after moving inland and turned towards the east and later southeast. Briefly reemerging over the Gulf on August\u00a015, the depression moved onshore a second time in Florida, before dissipating over eastern Georgia on August\u00a017. Due to the relatively weak nature of the system, it caused relatively little damage. However, the system dropped heavy rainfall, peaking at 21.05 inches (535\u00a0mm) in southern Mississippi. This resulted in flooding, which forced more than 400\u00a0people to evacuate their homes, some of which had 2 to 4 feet (0.61 to 1.22\u00a0m) of water. Flash flooding was reported in a few others states, including Alabama, Florida, and Louisiana. In all, losses from the unnamed storm reached $7.4\u00a0million (1987\u00a0USD) and one person was reported missing after being thrown overboard a boat in rough seas."

        "content": "On July\u00a029, 1987, a tropical wave emerged off the west coast of Africa into the Atlantic Ocean. Tracking westward along the southern edge of the Saharan Air Layer, a feature associated with large masses of dry air, little convective development took place over the following several days. Once near the Lesser Antilles in early August, atmospheric conditions became more favorable for development. Traveling across the Caribbean, the system became increasingly organized and a mid-level circulation formed shortly before the wave moved inland over Central America on August\u00a07. The following day, the northern portion of the wave interacted with a cold-core low over the Gulf of Mexico, resulting in the formation of a low-level circulation, exhibiting tropical characteristics, on August\u00a09. Over the following two days, the system tracked in a general north-northwest direction towards the Texas coastline. Aided by an anticyclone aloft, outflow became pronounced and convection increased in coverage and intensity. Around 1200\u00a0UTC, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) estimated that the system developed into a tropical depression while located about 145\u00a0miles (235\u00a0km) south-southeast of Galveston, Texas.[1] Hours after being classified a tropical depression, the convective structure of the system deteriorated, a sign of a weakening storm; however, nearby oil rigs indicated a gradual increase in winds. Later on August\u00a09, several rigs reported tropical storm-force winds \u2013 winds greater than 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h) \u2013 and the NHC estimated that the depression strengthened into a tropical storm. Operationally, however, these winds were considered to be related to local convective activity rather than the storm itself and it was not considered to be a tropical storm until post-storm analysis.[1] As such, it was not named and is officially classified as \"Unnamed Tropical Storm.\" Additionally, the strongest winds were located well away from the center of circulation, a signature of subtropical cyclones.[2] Remaining relatively weak, the unnamed system attained peak winds of 45\u00a0mph (75\u00a0km/h) before making landfall along the Texas coastline between Galveston and Beaumont at 0600\u00a0UTC on August\u00a010.[3] Once over land, the storm weakened to a tropical depression as it neared the Texas-Louisiana border and began a gradual turn towards the east-southeast.[2] On August\u00a012, while over central Mississippi, the cyclone attained its lowest barometric pressure of 1,007\u00a0mbar (29.7\u00a0inHg).[3] On August\u00a015, the low emerged back over the Gulf of Mexico after crossing the Florida Panhandle. No redevelopment took place during its brief time back over water before making its final landfall near St. Marks, Florida the following day. The depression gradually diminished before losing its identity over eastern Georgia on August\u00a017.[2]"

        "content": "Due to the system's proximity to land upon being declared a tropical depression and subsequent intensity uncertainties, the unnamed storm posed several challenges to forecasters that \"vividly illustrated limitations that are of major concern at the National Hurricane Center.\"[4] With operational forecasters noting the possibility of intensification, the first-ever tropical storm warning was issued along the northern Gulf Coast between Matagorda, Texas and Morgan City, Louisiana on August\u00a09.[3] Prior to 1987, gale warnings were issued in areas where winds above 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h) were anticipated.[1] This warning was later discontinued on August\u00a010 once the system moved inland and weakened.[3] The United States Coast Guard advised ships to seek harbor to avoid large swells associated with the cyclone. Additionally, some non-essential workers were evacuated from offshore rigs.[5] By August\u00a013, several flash flood watches were in place over portions of Mississippi, Alabama and Florida as remnants of the unnamed system slowly moved through the region.[6] Throughout the United States, damage from the tropical storm amounted to $7.4\u00a0million, the majority of which resulted from flooding.[7] Offshore, a woman was reported missing after she was thrown off her boat amidst rough seas produced by the storm.[8] The system produced rainfall across a large swath of the southern states, with many areas recording more than 5\u00a0in (130\u00a0mm).[4] Though it made landfall in Texas, the system's asymmetric structure led to relatively little rain falling in the state, peaking at 4.25\u00a0in (108\u00a0mm) in Umbarger.[9] In parts of Louisiana, many streets were left impassable by high waters, creating widespread traffic delays.[10] The most significant impact took place in southern Mississippi where rainfall in excess of 12\u00a0in (300\u00a0mm), peaking at 21.06\u00a0in (535\u00a0mm) in Vancleave,[9] caused significant flash flooding, especially along the Biloxi and Tchoutacabouffa Rivers. The former of these experienced a record crest of 16.8\u00a0ft (5.1\u00a0m). More than 400 people were forced to evacuate due to rising water across the region as several homes were inundated with 2 to 4\u00a0ft (0.61 to 1.22\u00a0m) of water.[4] In Columbia, 12.2\u00a0in (310\u00a0mm) of rain fell in just eight hours, triggering flash floods that washed away a portion of a small dam. Further east in Baldwin County, Alabama and Pensacola, Florida, many roads ere closed or left impassable due to high water.[11] Additionally, the system spawned a brief tornado in Mobile County but no damage resulted from it.[12][13]"

It included a deadly pair of tornado families that struck the I-4 corridor in Central Florida from the Tampa Bay Area to Brevard County. At least two\u00a0long-tracked tornadoes affected the region, each of which featured a path length in excess of 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km). The two\u00a0tornadoes are officially listed as continuous events, but the tornadoes' damage paths did not cross the entire state, and downbursts may have been responsible for destruction near Lake Juliana and in the Kissimmee\u2013Saint Cloud area. However, tornado and downburst damage combined was continuous from coast to coast. One\u00a0of the tornadoes produced estimated F4 damage on the Fujita scale; it remains one of only two F4 tornadoes to strike the U.S. state of Florida, the other of which occurred on April\u00a015, 1958. Both F4 tornadoes coincided with El Ni\u00f1o\u2014a condition known to locally enhance severe weather over Florida. On April\u00a04, 1966, a total of 11\u00a0people were killed across the state of Florida, including three\u00a0in the city of Tampa and seven\u00a0in Polk County.

The JTWC also upgraded the depression to a tropical storm that evening.[9][10][11] Early on September 9 the JMA upgraded Sinlaku to a Severe Tropical Storm.\n[12] Whilst during that afternoon the JTWC reported that Sinlaku had intensified into a Typhoon, the JMA then upgraded Sinlaku to a typhoon later that day.[13][14]  The JTWC then reported Sinlaku had intensified into a category two typhoon. During the next day Sinlaku continued to intensify and reached its maximum 1 minute sustained winds of 125 knots which made it a Category 4 typhoon. It stayed at this intensity until the next day when it started to weaken as it went through an eye wall replacement cycle. Sinlaku then struggled to come out of its eye wall replacement cycle and as a result weakened into a Category 3 typhoon. The weakening trend continued until on September 13 Typhoon Sinlaku made landfall on Taiwan as a Category 2 typhoon. It moved towards the North West through Taiwan and then turned towards the north east and moved back into the South China Sea and started moving slowly towards Japan. Early on September 14, the JMA downgraded Sinlaku to a severe tropical storm. Meanwhile, the JTWC were reporting that Sinlaku was a weak Category 1 typhoon. Later that day PAGASA issued their final advisory on Sinlaku as Sinlaku moved out of its area of responsibility. Late the next day the JTWC downgraded Sinlaku to a Tropical storm and then early on September 16 the JMA then downgraded Sinlaku into a tropical storm whilst Sinlaku moved closer to Japan. On September 17 Sinlaku strengthened into a severe tropical storm whilst the JTWC reported that Sinlaku had regained Typhoon strength, However, later that day the JTWC downgraded sinlaku to a Tropical storm again. However early the next day the JTWC reported that Sinlaku had once again regained Typhoon intensity however the JTWC downgraded Sinlaku to a tropical storm. Early on September 20, the JTWC issued its final advisory on Tropical Storm 15W as the storm became extratropical. Later that day the JMA, downgraded Sinlaku to a tropical storm.[15] Early on September 21 the JMA downgraded Sinlaku to an extra tropical low as it moved further away from Japan.[16]"

As Fengshen moved towards the northwest it continued to intensify. [7] Fengshen was initially forecast to go through the Bicol Region but later on shifted its course further westward, eventually going towards the direction of Mindoro Province. However, before even reaching Mindoro or specifically over the coastal waters of northern Panay, it again shifted its direction northwards towards the direction of Metro Manila, mainly because of the weakening of the high pressure area in the northern part of the Philippines.[8] Fengshen passed Metro Manila between 5 am and 6 am on Sunday with winds of 165\u00a0km/h, This was confirmed by eyewitness reports of the weather becoming suddenly calm after strong winds and rains in Quezon City, Marikina, and other nearby areas. Typhoon Fengshen, after creating havoc in the Philippines, travelled through the South China Sea early on June 23 and was heading northwards towards China.[9] Soon after moving into the South China Sea, the JMA and PAGASA downgraded it to a severe tropical storm while the JTWC downgraded Fengshen from a typhoon to a tropical storm. PAGASA then issued its final advisory on Fengshen due to the storm leaving PAGASA's Area of Responsibility. Around June 24 22:00 UTC, Tropical Storm Fengshen made landfall on Shenzhen, Guangdong, entering Mainland China. The JTWC announced their final warning later that day."

They further blamed Sulpicio for not personally informing them about the tragedy, the details of the accident, and the condition of the ship plus its passengers. Sulpicio's counsel Manuel Espitan, however stated that \"the ship never received advice from Coast Guard, while Metro Manila was still under public storm signal No. 1 when the ship left the port.\" Despite all these, there are even reports stating that the ferry actually passed the eye of the typhoon directly.[28] BBC quoted President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo as saying: \"Why did you allow it to sail and why was there no ample warning? I want answers!\"[29][30]"

The BMI recommended that Marina \"consider the suspension of the Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC) of Sulpicio Lines in accordance with existing laws, rules and regulations (and its criminal liability for the sinking).\" The final report blamed human error, and ruled that the ship's missing and presumed dead captain, Florencio Marimon, \"miscalculated\" the risk of continuing the trip to Cebu while the storm raged: \"There was a failure of the master to exercise extraordinary diligence and good seamanship thereby committing an error of judgment. The immediate cause of the capsizing of MV Princess of the Stars was the failure of the Master to exercise extraordinary diligence and good seamanship thereby committing an error of judgment that brought MV Princess of the Stars in harm's way into the eye of typhoon Frank or Typhoon Fengshen (2008). It is found negligent for its failure to exercise its duty in ensuring that they transport passengers and cargo safely to (their) destination.\u201d Sulpicio said 52 survived the tragedy and 312 bodies were recovered of 825 passengers listed. The rest were declared missing and presumed dead. Sulpicio may appeal within 30 days, the Board's recommendation to the Maritime Industry Authority (Philippines) and the Department of Transportation. Meanwhile, cargoes of 5 toxic pesticides and other poisonous substances are still on board the ferry and will be refloated on September.[41][42][43][44][45] Sulpicio Lines, the 2nd largest cargo carrier in the Philippines, accounts for 40% of all cargo movement across the country.[46]"

The 21st depression, 14 tropical storm and 10th typhoon of the 2008 Pacific typhoon season, Hagupit developed from a tropical wave located a couple hundred miles east of the Marshall Islands on September 14. Moving generally north-west westwards towards the Philippines, the depression gradually intensified into a tropical storm the following day, and then into became a typhoon on September 22 off the northern coast of Luzon. Located within an environment conducive for strengthening, Hagupit rapidly strengthened to attain 10-min sustained winds of 165 kilometres per hour (103\u00a0mph; 89\u00a0kn) and 1-min sustained winds of 230 kilometres per hour (140\u00a0mph; 120\u00a0kn).

Early on September 19, the JMA began to issue full advisories on the depression; that same day, the depression moved into PAGASA's area of responsibility and was assigned the local name Nina.[13][14] Later that day both the JMA & the JTWC upgraded the depression to a tropical storm, with the JMA assigning the international name of Hagupit and the international number of 0814.[15][16] Throughout the next day, Hagupit continued to organize; as a result, the JMA reported that Hagupit had intensified into a severe tropical storm. Simultaneously, the PAGASA reported that Hagupit had intensified into a typhoon; however, both the JMA and the JTWC did not upgrade Hagupit to a typhoon until early the next afternoon. Rapid intensification ensued as the storm tuned west and paralleled the northern coast of Luzon, and on September 22, the JTWC upgraded the storm a Category 2 typhoon. Continuing to intensify while moving through the Luzon Strait, Hagupit was upgraded later that day by the JTWC to Category 3-equivalent strength. Early the next day PAGASA issued its final advisory on Hagupit after it moved out of PAR into the South China Sea. Later that day the JTWC upgraded Hagupit to a Category 4 typhoon as Hagupit approached southern China.

Shortly after Hagupit's landfall, the JTWC issued its final warning on the typhoon. Continuing to move inland, Hagupit rapidly weakened, dropping below typhoon strength within 12 hours of landfall.

Jangmi was significantly weakened as it interacted with Taiwan, as being downgraded to tropical storm status after leaving Taiwan on September 29. After undergoing an extratropical transition, Jangmi became a remnant low on October 1. After slowly moving eastward, until finally dissipating near Iwo Jima on October 5. Jangmi killed 2 people and caused about $77.8\u00a0million (2008 USD) in damage in Taiwan, as well as the typhoon also made operations of Maokong Gondola suspended due to erosion around a pillar, until March 30, 2010.[2][3] When Jangmi was weakening and becoming extratropical, it killed 4 people and caused about $9.9\u00a0million (2008 USD) in damage in Japan.[4]"

        "content": "A low-pressure area formed south of Guam on September 22.[5] On the next day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the system. Owing to the low-level circulation center (LLCC) rapidly consolidating with convective banding, JTWC upgraded it to a tropical depression late on the same day. Overall, the environment was favorable for further development, with a developing anticyclone over the LLCC, weak vertical wind shear, and good poleward outflow due to a cold-core low north of the system.[6] Early on September 24, JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical storm; however, according to RSMC Best Track Data, the system intensified into a tropical depression at the same time. At noon, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the system to a tropical storm and named it Jangmi, when it was tracking northwestward under the steering influence of the subtropical ridge in the northeast.[7] Several hours later, Jangmi entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility, earning the name Ofel from the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA).[8] Shortly after JMA upgraded Jangmi to a severe tropical storm early on September 25, JTWC upgraded it to a typhoon for its developing eye; moreover, according to RSMC Best Track Data, Jangmi intensified into a typhoon simultaneously.[9] Tracking toward a weakness in the subtropical ridge induced by a mid-latitude trough to the north-northeast on September 26, Jangmi formed an cirrus-filled and ambiguous eye, as the typhoon gradually intensified owing to strong radial outflow provided by a mesoscale anticyclone aloft, which persisted into a tropical upper tropospheric trough cell to the east.[10] At 00Z on September 27, JTWC upgraded Jangmi to a super typhoon, with a round 28 nautical miles (52\u00a0km; 32\u00a0mi) eye with an intense and symmetric core of deep convection and excellent convective banding over all quadrants.[11] Six hours later, the typhoon reached category 5 strength on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale. At 12Z, Jangmi attained peak intensity by the ten-minute maximum sustained winds reaching 115 knots (215\u00a0km/h, 130\u00a0mph) and the atmospheric pressure decreasing to 905\u00a0hPa (26.7\u00a0inHg). In terms of ten-minute maximum sustained winds, it became the most intense tropical cyclone in the Northwest Pacific Ocean since Angela in 1995, tied with Nida in the next year, until Megi surpassed all of them in 2010. Jangmi weaken gradually due to land interaction with Taiwan early on September 28. After JTWC downgraded Jangmi to a typhoon, it made landfall over Nan'ao in Yilan, Taiwan at 15:40 TST (07:40 UTC) with ten-minute maximum sustained winds of 100 knots (185\u00a0km/h, 115\u00a0mph) and an atmospheric pressure of 925\u00a0hPa (27.3\u00a0inHg).[2] Because of the frictional effects of land, the typhoon showed trochoidal motion overland, unexpectedly shifting toward the south-southwest shortly. Jangmi weakened significantly by the mountainous terrain of Taiwan after landfall; therefore, it lost the majority of deep convection. Under the steering influence by the eastern subtropical ridge, the system began to track northward toward a break situated east of Shanghai, China, and it arrived at the Taiwan Strait from Taoyuan County (now Taoyuan City) at 04:20 TST on September 29 (20:20 UTC on September 28).[12][2] Early on September 29, Jangmi weakened into a severe tropical storm in the East China Sea, when JTWC downgraded it to a tropical storm. Despite lacking significant deep convection, the storm still had good radial outflow, especially the poleward outflow tapped into strong mid-latitude westerlies. As JMA downgraded Jangmi to a tropical storm at noon, the system started to track northeastward along the weakened western finger of the subtropical ridge.[13] Jangmi underwent extratropical transition while accelerating east-northeastward and then eastward on September 30, as well as upper-level westerly winds sheared the remaining convection to the east and south of the low-level circulation center with frontal features. Late on the same day, JTWC reported that Jangmi became extratropical with a final warning.[14] JMA reported that Jangmi became an extratropical cyclone near the \u014csumi Islands early on October 1, and the system kept moving eastward rapidly during that day. Remaining weak and shallow, it began to drift east-southeastward slowly by early on October 2. Since the noon on the same day, the system turned to drift southward very slowly. It ultimately dissipated near Iwo Jima on October 5."

In Wuqi, Taichung, an 82-year-old male was killed by blown into a flooded rice paddy when riding a bike.[15] The heavy rains brought by Typhoon Jangmi caused a landslide on the mountain slope near the Maokong Gondola Tower No. 16 on September 28. Considering local residents\u2019 worries, On October 1, the Taipei City Government announced that the Maokong Gondola would temporarily suspend service and carry out further assessment; based on the suggestions made by construction, environment protection, and geological associations, it was decided that Tower No. 16 should be moved.[3] The New Construction Office of Taipei City Government completed the work of moving T16 tower base and re-hanging cable on January 31, 2010. After examination of operational simulation by TRTC, the system met the requirements by the inspection committee on March 4, 2010.

For much of its duration, the storm moved toward the northwest, gradually intensifying. Early on July\u00a010, Halong passed just south of Guam as a tropical storm, producing high waves and gusty winds on the island. The storm disrupted relief efforts from Chataan, causing additional power outages but little damage. After affecting Guam, Halong quickly strengthened and reached its peak winds on July\u00a012. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center estimated peak 1-minute winds of 250\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph), while the Japan Meteorological Agency estimated 10\u2011minute winds of 155\u00a0km/h (96\u00a0mph). Subsequently, the typhoon weakened greatly while curving to the northeast, although it still passed near Okinawa with strong winds that left widespread power outages.

The system remained nearly stationary,[1] tracking slowly to the southwest.[2] Gradually organizing,[1] the system developed into a tropical depression on July\u00a06 over the Marshall Islands.[3] Without having issued a tropical cyclone formation alert, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)[nb 2] initiated advisories on Tropical Depression 10W at 0000\u00a0UTC on July\u00a07.[2] Late that day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) [nb 3] upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Halong near the island of Chuuk in the Federated States of Micronesia.[3] By that time, the storm was moving west-northwestward, steered by a ridge to the north. Halong slowly intensified, although it continued to develop deep convection that wrapped into the center.[1] Early on July\u00a09, the JMA upgraded the storm to a severe tropical storm.[3] At 1200\u00a0UTC that day, the JTWC upgraded Halong to typhoon status about 405\u00a0km (252\u00a0mi) east-southeast of Guam.[1] While moving toward Guam, Halong became better organized, developing an eye and well-defined rainbands. After a brief turn more toward the west, the storm passed about 140\u00a0km (87\u00a0mi) south of the southern tip of Guam at 0200\u00a0UTC on July\u00a010; at the time, the JTWC estimated 1\u2011minute sustained winds of 165\u00a0km/h (103\u00a0mph),[1] although the JMA had maintained Halong as a tropical storm until upgrading to a typhoon at 1800\u00a0UTC that day.[3] An approaching trough increased shear over Halong, and a weak ridge to the north restricted outflow; this briefly prevented significant intensification after the convection decreased. Late on July\u00a011, the thunderstorms increased, and restrengthening resumed.[1] Late on July\u00a012, the JMA assessed Halong as reaching peak 10\u2011minute sustained winds of 155\u00a0km/h (96\u00a0mph).[3] Around that time, the typhoon entered the area of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), which gave it the local name Typhoon Inday.[5] Early on July\u00a013, the JTWC upgraded Halong to a super typhoon after the storm developed a well-defined eye 63\u00a0km (39\u00a0mi) in diameter. Shortly thereafter, the agency estimated peak 1\u2011minute sustained winds of 250\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph).[1] At its peak intensity, Typhoon Halong had gale-force winds that extended 415\u00a0km (258\u00a0mi) northeast of the center. It was continuing to the northwest toward Okinawa, and threatened to strike the island at near peak intensity. However, the typhoon began rapidly weakening due to increasing wind shear, and the eye quickly deteriorated.[1] At around 1200\u00a0UTC on July\u00a014, Halong made landfall on Okinawa with 10\u2011minute winds of 130\u00a0km/h (81\u00a0mph).[3] Around that time, the typhoon moved through a weakness in the ridge, turning to the north and later accelerating to the northeast.[1] The combination of cool, dry air,[2] and the persistent wind shear removed the convection from the center by early on July\u00a015, weakening Halong to tropical storm status. Later that day, the JTWC discontinued advisories while the storm was approaching Japan, and the agency classified Halong as extratropical. The JMA continued tracking the storm, and Halong struck both the Izu and B\u014ds\u014d peninsulas along Honshu. Late on July\u00a016, the JMA classified Halong as extratropical, and shortly thereafter the storm dissipated over the Kuril Islands.[3] The extratropical remnants of Halong moved out of the basin late on July 19, just prior dissipating."

The waves left beach erosion along Guam's southern coast,[6] and were higher than during Chataan's passage.[1] The typhoon produced peak sustained winds of 69\u00a0km/h (43\u00a0mph), with gusts to 90\u00a0km/h (56\u00a0mph); both observations were recorded at Guam's National Weather Service. Damage on the island was estimated at $40,000.[6] The storm disrupted work to repair damage from Chataan.[8] Portions of the island, including Guam Memorial Hospital, had their power restored after Chataan, only to lose electricity during Halong.[9] The additional damage caused by Halong contributed to Governor Carl T.C. Gutierrez declaring the island as a state of emergency on July\u00a022, which activated the Guam National Guard.[10] While passing northeast of the Philippines, Halong enhanced the monsoon, and combined with the effects from previous typhoons Rammasun and Chataan, as well as Severe Tropical Storm Nakri, there were 85\u00a0deaths, with 45\u00a0people injured in the Philippines.[11] About ten of the deaths were estimated to have been caused by Halong.[12] The combined damage in the country totaled $10.3\u00a0million (\u20b1522\u00a0million 2002\u00a0PHP).[nb 4][11] In Japan, Halong dropped heavy rainfall that peaked at 362\u00a0mm (14.3\u00a0in) in Nagano Prefecture. The highest rainfall in Okinawa was 258\u00a0mm (10.2\u00a0in). Near Tokyo, a station recorded winds of 112\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph),[14] although winds gusted to 183\u00a0km/h (114\u00a0mph) at Kadena Air Base on Okinawa.[1] In the Ryukyu Islands of Japan, including Okinawa, Halong left more than 48,800\u00a0houses without power due to the strong winds. Officials canceled bus service in Naze, Kagoshima during the storm.[15] Throughout the country, the typhoon destroyed six houses and damaged 223\u00a0others to varying degrees. Halong also flooded 301\u00a0houses,[14] forcing about 4,000\u00a0people to evacuate their homes, many along rivers.[16] Officials canceled 54\u00a0airline flights,[17] 10 of them international,[16] and due to the storm, 171\u00a0schools were closed.[17] In Sendai, Halong damaged roads in 550\u00a0locations and railroads in seven locations. Nine levees were breached, and there were at least 270\u00a0landslides.[18] Damage totaled $89.8\u00a0million (\u00a510.3\u00a0billion 2002\u00a0JPY) across the country, mostly from agriculture.[nb 5][18][19][20][21][22][23][24] During its passage, the typhoon injured nine people, one of them severely,[14] and there was one death.[18]"

        "content": " Typhoon Mamie was the worst tropical cyclone to affect northeastern China in 26\u00a0years. Originating from an area of disturbed weather near the Philippines in mid-August\u00a01985, the system gradually became better organized, and was upgraded into a tropical storm early on August\u00a016. It continued to deepen, and late on August\u00a017, Mamie attained typhoon intensity. Around this time, Typhoon Mamie reached its peak intensity of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph), which it maintained for 12\u00a0hours. After making landfall in Shanghai, the storm steadily weakened. However, after turning north and crossing the Shanghai Peninsula and the Yellow Sea, Mamie made a second landfall near Yantai as a tropical storm. After turning northwest and re-entering the Yellow Sea, Mamie moved ashore for the third and final time near Dairen. On August\u00a021, Mamie dissipated inland over northeastern China. Due to both Mamie and Nelson, widespread flooding was reported across much of northern China, with 19\u00a0rivers overflowing. The typhoon forced around 1,000\u00a0factories to temporarily close, and toppled approximately 6.5\u00a0million trees. Moreover, about 8,000\u00a0homes were flooded and 120,000\u00a0houses received damage Nearly 1\u00a0million people were directly affected by the typhoon. The typhoon killed more than 120,000\u00a0animals and sank more than 200\u00a0boats. Overall, 17\u00a0fatalities occurred and 165\u00a0were injured. Losses totaled $172\u00a0million (1985\u00a0USD)."

        "content": "Typhoon Mamie originated from the southwesterly monsoonal flow near the Philippines. The monsoon flow was situated near Tropical Storm Lee, which was situated east of Taiwan at that time. At 0000\u00a0UTC on August\u00a014, banding features were noted via satellite imagery. The system was first monitored by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) at 0600\u00a0UTC on August\u00a014; the JTWC noted that the chances of significant development were poor. Throughout the day, the system became better organized while turning north[1] and at 1800\u00a0UTC that day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started watching the disturbance.[2][nb 1] Early on August\u00a015, the JTWC remarked that the storm had a \"fair\" chance at potential development. As such, Hurricane Hunter aircraft was requested. Following an increase in banding features and outflow, a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) was issued by the JTWC that afternoon. Thereafter, the cyclone began to strengthen as interaction with Tropical Storm Lee diminished. At 2300\u00a0UTC on August\u00a015, the aircraft discovered a closed low-level circulation, as well as tropical storm-force winds.[1] Based on this, both agencies designated the system as Tropical Storm Mamie early on August\u00a016.[4][nb 2] On August\u00a016, the tropical storm began to turn northwest in response to the strengthening of a subtropical ridge north of Mamie and a westward-moving mid-latitude cyclone.[1] At 0000\u00a0UTC on August\u00a017, the JTWC classified Mamie as a typhoon while the JMA reported winds of 105\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph), a severe tropical storm. Around midday, the JTWC estimated winds of 130\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph), equivalent to a Category\u00a01 hurricane on the United States-based Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.[4] However, the aforementioned ridge was not strong enough to prevent the storm from turning north-northwest on August\u00a017.[1] That evening, the JMA upgraded Mamie to typhoon status. Simultaneously, the JMA estimated peak winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph), and a minimum barometric pressure of 975\u00a0mbar (28.8\u00a0inHg). According to the JMA,[2] the typhoon held on to peak intensity for 12\u00a0hours while moving onshore near Shanghai on August\u00a018.[1] Mamie only gradually weakened overland, but according to the JMA, the storm's winds had decreased to 105\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph) midday on August\u00a018.[4] Typhoon Mamie moved offshore at 0200\u00a0UTC on August\u00a019;[1] subsequently, the JTWC estimated winds of 95\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph) while the JMA estimated winds of 95\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph).[4] After crossing the Shanghai Peninsula, Mamie entered the Yellow Sea while turning north along the western periphery of a subtropical ridge, and at 0600\u00a0UTC, struck Yantai[1] as a minimal tropical storm.[4] Following a turn towards the northwest, Tropical Storm Mamie briefly emerged into the Yellow Sea before making a third and final landfall just west of Dairen at noon.[1] At the time of landfall, both the JMA and the JTWC reported winds of 70\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph).[4] Due to interaction with the mountainous terrain of China, Mamie began to dissipate over land, and by 0000\u00a0UTC on August\u00a020, the JTWC ceased watching the cyclone.[1] The JMA followed suit 42 hours later.[2]"

More than 3,000 residents were evacuated in the Jilin province.[14] At least 36,400\u00a0villagers necessitated rescue.[12] Nearly 1 million individuals were directly affected by the typhoon.[15] Elsewhere, in Yantai, the typhoon killed more than 120,000\u00a0animals, damaged 120,000\u00a0homes, and sank more than 200\u00a0boats.[16] Waves up to 8\u00a0m (26\u00a0ft) in height pounded the Bohai Bay shoreline, forcing more than 200\u00a0ships to be evacuated.

Alma degenerated into a remnant low on May 30, before merging with another approaching tropical wave in the Gulf of Honduras shortly afterward, which became Tropical Storm Arthur on the next day. Alma was the first tropical storm on record to strike the Pacific coast of Nicaragua. In Costa Rica, heavy rainfall caused flooding and landslides, killing two and causing $35\u00a0million (USD) in damage.

        "content": "Towards the end of May 2008, computer hurricane models forecast the development of a broad low-pressure area to the southwest of Central America.[1] On May 26, a large trough extended from the southwestern Caribbean Sea across Costa Rica into the eastern Pacific Ocean, forming a broad low-pressure area across the region.[2] A scattered area of strong convection developed, partially in association with the Intertropical Convergence Zone.[1] Located within an area of weak steering currents, the disturbance remained nearly stationary, and on May 27 its shower activity increased in organization.[3] Initially the system consisted of several cyclonic swirls, of which the most pronounced one was located about 340 miles (550\u00a0km) west-southwest of San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica.[4] The system gradually became better organized, and with a sufficiently well-developed circulation and convective structure, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) classified the system as Tropical Depression One-E at 0300\u00a0UTC on May 29, about 105 miles (169\u00a0km) west-northwest of Cabo Blanco, Costa Rica.[5] With a mid-level ridge located in the Gulf of Mexico, the depression drifted generally northward through an area of warm water temperatures and low wind shear. Initially its convection was weak and confined to a few rainbands far from the center. As such, intensification was not expected beyond minimal tropical storm status.[5] However, the system quickly developed intense thunderstorms near the center with increased banding in its southern semicircle, and at 1500\u00a0UTC on May 29, the NHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Alma, about 55 miles (89\u00a0km) southwest of Managua, Nicaragua. This marked one of the rare cases in the Eastern Pacific in which a tropical cyclone formed without the involvement of a tropical wave.[6] The system's intensity was set at 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h), and the storm was forecast to intensity only slightly more before moving ashore.[7] However, one hour after it was upgraded to tropical storm status, the NHC re-assessed the intensity as 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h), citing updated observations from satellite imagery and QuikSCAT.[8][6] An eye feature formed, surrounded by a very tight ring of convection,[9] and at around 1900\u00a0UTC on May 29, Alma made landfall near Le\u00f3n, Nicaragua as a strong tropical storm.[10] The storm quickly weakened after moving ashore, though a small area of thunderstorms persisted as it crossed into the mountainous region of southern Honduras.[11] After passing near Tegucigalpa Alma weakened to tropical depression status,[12] and at 1500\u00a0UTC on May 30, the cyclone's low-level lcirculation center dissipated, while the system was situated near the border of Honduras and Guatemala.[13] On May 30, after crossing Central America as a remnant low, Alma's remnants moved into the Gulf of Honduras and merged with another approaching tropical wave from the east, which became Tropical Storm Arthur on the next day.[14][15]"

The city of David, Chiriqu\u00ed in western Panama reported 5.75 inches (146\u00a0mm) of precipitation in 48\u00a0hours. Additionally, the capital city of San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica reported 3.07 inches (78\u00a0mm) of rainfall in a 48\u2011hour period.[21] In Costa Rica, the precipitation caused river flooding, threatening 17\u00a0communities. It also caused widespread mudslides, which closed at least eight roads. The storm downed trees and power lines, leaving about 42,000\u00a0people without electricity in the country.[19] Two deaths were reported in the country, and damage in Costa Rica was estimated at \u20a120\u00a0billion col\u00f3nes ($35\u00a0million 2008\u00a0USD).[22] In Le\u00f3n near where it moved ashore in Nicaragua, the passage of Alma left the city without power. Several buildings were destroyed in the city, and some roads were damaged. Much of the departments of Le\u00f3n and Chinandega experienced power outages, due to the strong winds. One person died from electrocution, due to a downed high-tension cable,[19] and another person died in a similar manner.[23] Offshore, one person drowned when he rode out the storm in his boat.[24] In Tegucigalpa, TACA Flight 390 skidded off a runway sodden by torrential rain, killing three passengers (plus two more on the ground) and injuring over eighty.[6] One other fatality was reported in Honduras when a young girl was swept away in a raging stream.[6]"

Large pine trees were snapped and a mobile home was rolled about 20 yards (18\u00a0m) before being completely destroyed. A truck was also flipped outside a church parking lot before the tornado lifted. However, several minutes later it touched down again, destroying the roof and severely damaging the walls of a brick home. After traveling for about one third of a mile, the tornado destroyed the roof of another brick home. The tornado was estimated to have become a strong EF2 tornado with winds between 120 and 135\u00a0mph (193 and 217\u00a0km/h) as it hit a third brick home, nearly destroying it. In all, the tornado damaged 25 structures and destroyed seven others. Three cars were also damaged and another three were destroyed along the tornado's 1\u00a0mi (1.6\u00a0km) path. No injuries were reported as a result of the tornado and damages amounted to $325,000.[4] Around 1:35\u00a0a.m. EST, a weak tornado touched down near several mobile homes about 2\u00a0mi (3.2\u00a0km) east-southeast of St. Pauls, North Carolina in Robeson County, one of which sustained severe damage. Afterwards, the tornado traveled towards the north-northeast and crossed NC 20. An auto repair shop located along the highway sustained significant damage with all of the bay windows being blown out and 17 nearby storage sheds were destroyed. Several trees were knocked down onto railroad tracks before the tornado damaged another mobile home and dissipated. No injuries were reported as a result of the tornado and damages amounted to $50,000. The tornado was rated as an EF0 with winds up to 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h).[6] The third tornado touched down around 2:15\u00a0a.m. EST near the town of Autryville in Sampson County. Several trees were damaged along the tornado's path and one home sustained notable damage. A carport near the home was blown down and twisted into nearby trees. No injuries were reported as a result of the tornado and damages amounted to $25,000. The tornado was rated as an EF0 by the National Weather Service.[7] The fourth tornado of the outbreak touched down around 2:45\u00a0a.m. EST near Peacocks Crossroads in Johnston County, knocking down several trees, some of which were mature. Significant roof damage occurred after the tornado struck a double-wide mobile home and destroyed the porch of another home. Another mobile home had some of its siding torn off before the tornado dissipated. No injuries were reported as a result of the tornado and damages amounted to $30,000. The tornado was rated as an EF1 by the National Weather Service.[8] The fifth tornado of the outbreak touched down around 3:03\u00a0a.m. EST near US 70, damaging several pine trees and causing minor roof damage. Tracking towards the northeast, the tornado destroyed a carport and the car inside. A trailer was rolled on its side and a nearby home sustained siding and shingle damage. Afterwards, the tornado struck a horse farm where it destroyed a small barn and damaged a stable. Before dissipating, the tornado blew out the windows in the garage of one home. No injuries were reported as a result of the tornado and damages amounted to $75,000. The tornado was rated as a high-end EF0 by the National Weather Service.[9] The sixth and first killer tornado of the outbreak touched down around 3:10\u00a0a.m. EST and snapped several trees. After traveling for three quarters of a mile, it produced significant structural damage along NC 222 where a brick home was destroyed. A nearby trailer was rolled 30\u00a0ft down the driveway of the home. The four residents sustained no injuries despite having not taken shelter before the tornado. A double-wide mobile home was blown off its foundation and flipped for 50\u00a0ft before falling to the ground. One of the occupants, a 61-year-old woman was killed and her husband sustained major injuries. Three other mobile homes were destroyed by the tornado before it crossed into Wilson County. Once in Wilson County, several more mobile homes sustained significant damage before the tornado lifted. Damages from the tornado in both counties amounted to $700,000. The tornado was rated as an EF2 by the National Weather Service.[10][11] The most significant tornado during the outbreak touched down around 3:30\u00a0a.m. EST near Harrison Drive where a tree was snapped. Traveling towards the northeast, the tornado blew a home off its foundation and completely destroyed it near Route 1330. Local firefighters and rescue responders estimated that the home rolled four times before being destroyed. At the time the tornado struck, three people were in the home, one of which was killed. After destroying the home, the tornado caused major damage to the upper portion of another home and tore off the roof of another. Afterwards, the tornado tracked into Elm City where numerous trees were damaged and a porch was blown off a home.[12] An estimated 8,000 residents in Wilson County were left without power following the tornado.[13] Four other people were injured as a result of the tornado and damages amounted to $1.2\u00a0million.[12] About 100 people were also displaced due to the tornado.[14] The tornado was rated as a low-end EF3 along its discontinuous 8\u00a0mi (13\u00a0km) track.[12] The final tornado of the outbreak touched down near US 64 around 4:30\u00a0a.m. EST. The tornado traveled towards the northeast, damaging two mobile homes and a chapel. Several outbuildings were also damaged or destroyed near a farm before the tornado dissipated. The tornado was rated as an EF1 along its 2\u00a0mi (3.2\u00a0km) track. No injuries were reported as a result of the tornado and damages amounted to $50,000.[5]"

The governor of Wilson County requested that the areas struck by the EF3 tornado and the EF2 prior as disaster areas to allow federal assistance.[14] In Kenly, hospital staff raised about $300 to help a family whose home was completely destroyed. Up to 125 personnel were deployed to check on residents who were still at home and to assist those in need. Several volunteers helped remove trees and debris off roads to make way for aid. Two Red Cross teams set up a shelter at the Kenly Free Will Baptist Church.[15] During church ceremonies, volunteers organized outside the church to feed residents who lost their homes. A Methodist church group from Virginia arrived in Johnston and Wilson counties the day after the tornadoes to assist with cleanup efforts.[16] A fund was set up for the 11-year-old boy, Joshua Wiggens, who was killed by the Elm City tornado.[17] By November\u00a017, the Red Cross funds were depleted funds needed to keep the organization out of debt were $38\u00a0million below what was required. About $20,000 was spent in the charity effort in Kenly and the governor of Wilson County urged residents who were no affected by the storm to send donations to the Red Cross.[18] The lack of funding for the Red Cross prompted the governor to allow up to $28,000 in the state's emergency funds to be used for assistance by the Red Cross.[19] On November\u00a021, low-interest loans were approved for residents in the affected counties. Homeowners in Johnston, Franklin, Harnett, Nash, Sampson, Wake, Wayne and Wilson counties were able to apply for loans up to $200,000 to repair storm damage and businesses were allowed to apply for loans up to $2\u00a0million.[20] On November\u00a024, an unknown member of the 82nd Airborne Division donated 50 cases of non-perishable food and water to assist victims of the tornado. The relief goods were dropped off at the J.S. Waters School in Goldston without notice.[21]"

It formed on November\u00a014 near the International Date Line from a monsoon trough, which also spawned two other systems. Typhoon Gay later moved through the Marshall Islands as an intensifying typhoon, and after passing through the country it reached its peak intensity over open waters. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) estimated peak winds of 295\u00a0km/h (183\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 872\u00a0mb (25.8\u00a0inHg). However, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), which is the official warning center in the western Pacific, estimated winds of 205\u00a0km/h (127\u00a0mph), with a pressure of 900\u00a0mbar (27\u00a0inHg). Gay weakened rapidly after peaking because of interaction with another typhoon, and it struck Guam with winds of 160\u00a0km/h (99\u00a0mph) on November\u00a023. The typhoon briefly re-intensified before weakening and becoming extratropical south of Japan on November\u00a030. The typhoon first affected the Marshall Islands, where 5,000\u00a0people became homeless and heavy crop damage was reported. The nation's capital of Majuro experienced power and water outages during the storm. There were no fatalities among Marshall Islands citizens, although the typhoon killed a sailor traveling around the world. When Gay struck Guam, it became the sixth typhoon of the year to affect the island. Most of the weaker structures had been destroyed during Typhoon Omar earlier in the year, resulting in little additional damage from Gay. Because of its substantial weakening, the typhoon had a disrupted inner-core and produced minimal rainfall. However, strong winds scorched the plants on Guam with saltwater, causing extensive defoliation. Further north, high waves from the typhoon destroyed a house on Saipan, and heavy rainfall in Okinawa, Japan, caused flooding and power outages."

        "header": "Meteorological history",
        "content": "The origins of Typhoon Gay were from a tropical disturbance east of the International Date Line along a monsoon trough that extended west to the South China Sea in mid-November\u00a01992. The same trough had earlier spawned Tropical Storm Forrest and would later create Typhoon Hunt. The tropical disturbance moved westward across the dateline and gradually became better organized with increased convection. On November\u00a014, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)[nb 1] issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. At 1800\u00a0UTC that day, the agency initiated advisories on Tropical Depression 31W, located to the east of the Marshall Islands.[2] The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA)[nb 2] also assessed that the depression had developed by that time.[4] The next day, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Gay.[2][4] For most of Typhoon Gay's existence, a strong anticyclone to its north steered the storm to the west or west-northwest. The JTWC upgraded the storm to typhoon status early on November\u00a017, and the JMA followed suit the next day. Gay first affected Mejit Island and eventually crossed the central portion of the Marshall Islands. Owing to favorable sea surface temperatures and upper-level wind patterns, the storm entered a phase of rapid deepening similar to other November typhoons near that location.[2] On November\u00a019, the JTWC upgraded Gay to a super typhoon, which is a typhoon with 1-minute sustained winds of 240\u00a0km/h (150\u00a0mph). Gradual intensification ensued, and based on satellite estimates, the JTWC estimated that Typhoon Gay attained peak winds of 295\u00a0km/h (183\u00a0mph) at 0000\u00a0UTC on November\u00a021.[5] The agency also estimated that the typhoon reached a minimum barometric pressure of 872\u00a0mb (25.8\u00a0inHg), which would have made Gay the most intense typhoon since Typhoon Tip in 1979, tying with Hurricane Patricia in 2015 for the second-strongest tropical cyclone worldwide.[2] At the same time, the JMA estimated peak 10-minute sustained winds of 205\u00a0km/h (127\u00a0mph), with a pressure of 900\u00a0mbar (27\u00a0inHg).[4] After Gay attained its peak intensity, outflow from Typhoon Hunt to its northwest increased the wind shear over the typhoon. The wind shear deteriorated Gay's northern eyewall, causing the typhoon to weaken. In the 24\u00a0hours after Gay reached its peak intensity, the JTWC estimated that the winds had decreased by 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph) to below super typhoon status; such rapid weakening is uncommon for a storm over open waters. Tropical cyclone forecast models had anticipated Gay to make a turn to the north and northeast, but it maintained a west-northwest track toward Guam. Despite weakening steadily, the typhoon maintained a large size with a wind diameter of 1,480\u00a0km (920\u00a0mi). Around 0000\u00a0UTC on November\u00a023, Gay made landfall on Guam, becoming the third typhoon in three months to strike the island\u2014the others were Typhoon Omar in August and Typhoon Brian in October.[2] Both the JTWC and the JMA estimated the typhoon to have had winds of 160\u00a0km/h (99\u00a0mph) at landfall.[2] The influence from Typhoon Hunt diminished after Gay affected Guam, allowing it to begin restrengthening. Late on November\u00a025, the JTWC estimated that the typhoon attained a secondary peak intensity of 215\u00a0km/h (134\u00a0mph). Gay subsequently slowed while moving along the western periphery of the subtropical ridge, and it turned north while gradually weakening.[2] On November\u00a028, the JMA downgraded Gay to a tropical storm,[4] and the JTWC followed suit the next day.[5] The JMA assessed that Gay became an extratropical cyclone at 0000\u00a0UTC on November\u00a030;[4] however, the JTWC continued issuing advisories until December\u00a01, making it the longest-lasting typhoon of the season with 63\u00a0advisories.[2] The remnant of Gay accelerated and turned to the northeast, passing to the southeast of Japan and crossing the International Date Line.[4]"

The large wind field extended to the south, affecting Maloelap and Aur atolls with winds that damaged 30% of the houses and crops. Further south, the Marshall Islands capital city of Majuro experienced lightning strikes from the typhoon, which caused an island-wide power outage and cuts to the water supply and radio communication. Debris from the storm closed the Marshall Islands International Airport for two days. On Ujae Atoll, the typhoon destroyed an automated meteorological observing station that had been installed in 1989.

Extensive preparations were made, including the sending of ships to mitigate damage[2] and flying United States Air Force planes to other bases in the region.[8] The schools, government buildings, airport, and port were closed, and about 4,300\u00a0people evacuated to storm shelters. Further north, 1,639\u00a0people evacuated to storm shelters on Saipan, which set the record for the most storm evacuees at the time.[2] Despite weakening greatly from its peak intensity, Gay struck Guam with sustained winds of 160\u00a0km/h (99\u00a0mph), with gusts to 195\u00a0km/h (121\u00a0mph) on Nimitz Hill.[2] The winds were strong enough to disrupt power and water utilities, as well as destroy a few houses.[9] As a result of its weakening, Gay had a disrupted inner-core with little precipitation, which prompted the JTWC to label it as a \"dry typhoon\"; rainfall totals on the island ranged from only 40\u201390\u00a0mm (1.6\u20133.5\u00a0in).[2] Despite the extreme winds, little wind-thrown trees or snapped branches were observed.

Majority of the local dicots withered and lost their leaves within two days after the storm, while other plants such as palms, cycads and gymnosperms retained their foliage but turned brown.[10] The defoliation led to significant losses for crop farmers;[2] in some locations, the crops did not recover for four years.[11] Along the east coast of Guam, Gay produced a storm surge of 1.2\u20131.8\u00a0m (3.9\u20135.9\u00a0ft). The surge reached 3.4\u00a0m (11\u00a0ft) on Cabras Island in northern Guam, washing sand and water onto coastal roads and breaking a boat from its moorings. The JTWC estimated that damage would have been worse had Typhoon Omar not destroyed the weaker structures three months earlier;[2] little additional damage occurred to the island's capital of Hag\u00e5t\u00f1a.[12] The typhoon destroyed four iron roofs on Tinian Island, located north of Guam. On Saipan to its north, the storm surge destroyed one house and threatened the foundation of several others; twelve\u00a0families required rescue by emergency workers. The storm caused power outages, and one house sustained fire damage due to candles and kerosene lamps.[2]"

Rough winds with gusts peaking at 82\u00a0km/h (51\u00a0mph) caused isolated power outages and the cancellation of two airline flights.[13]"

After the storm, workers near Majuro planted seeds to regrow the damaged crops.[16] The rapid succession of typhoons in 1992 caused a significant drop in tourism in Guam.[17] During typhoons Omar and Gay, there was little communication between residents on the island. As a result, the Guam Communications Network was created to facilitate future relief efforts during storms.[18] A research paper published ten years after the storm suggested that Gay could have been stronger than Typhoon Tip, which attained the lowest barometric pressure ever recorded. While at its peak intensity, Gay registered a rating of 8.0 for nine consecutive hours using the Dvorak technique, indicating sustained wind speeds of at least (315\u00a0km/h (196\u00a0mph). In addition, the cyclone had a significantly colder band of clouds around the eye. Typhoon Angela in 1995 presented similar features and could have been stronger than Gay. Neither of the two had direct observations into their eyes, however, making it impossible to confirm such intensity.[19]"

The cyclone formed on August\u00a023 from the monsoon trough across the western Pacific Ocean. Moving westward, Omar slowly intensified into a tropical storm, although another tropical cyclone nearby initially impeded further strengthening. After the two storms became more distant, Omar quickly strengthened into a powerful typhoon. On August\u00a028, it made landfall on Guam with winds of 195\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph). The typhoon reached its peak intensity the next day, with estimated 1\u2011minute winds of 240\u00a0km/h (150\u00a0mph), making it a \"super typhoon\" according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC).[nb 1] Omar weakened significantly before striking eastern Taiwan on September\u00a04, proceeding into eastern China the next day and dissipating on September\u00a09. On Guam, Omar caused one death and $457\u00a0million (1992\u00a0USD) in damage.[nb 2] Strong gusts up to 248\u00a0km/h (154\u00a0mph) left nearly the entire island without power for several days. The outages disrupted the water system and prevented the island-based JTWC from issuing advisories for 11\u00a0days. Omar damaged or destroyed 2,158\u00a0houses, leaving 3,000\u00a0people homeless. In response to the destruction, the island's building codes were updated to withstand winds of 250\u00a0km/h (155\u00a0mph), and insurance companies discontinued new policies for structures not made of concrete. While passing well north of the Philippines, the typhoon killed 11\u00a0people and wrought \u20b1903\u00a0million ($35.4\u00a0million) worth of damage to 538\u00a0houses. Omar then brushed the southern islands of Japan with strong gusts and light rainfall, causing \u00a5476\u00a0million JPY (US$3.8\u00a0million) in crop losses. In Taiwan, scattered flooding caused three deaths and $65\u00a0million in damage, mostly to agriculture."

        "content": "Typhoon Omar originated from a tropical disturbance that was first noted on August\u00a020 over the open Pacific Ocean, which exhibited persistent convection, or thunderstorms. During this early phase, two tropical cyclones dissipated and another became extratropical across the western Pacific basin; this caused the monsoon trough, which spawned most of the storms in the basin, to realign in a more climatologically appropriate manner.[2] According to the Japan Meteorological Agency\u00a0(JMA), Omar developed into a tropical depression at 1800\u00a0UTC on August\u00a023.[4] The Joint Typhoon Warning Center\u00a0(JTWC) assessed a slower pace of strengthening, issuing a tropical cyclone formation alert at 2100\u00a0UTC before initiating advisories on Tropical Depression\u00a015W on August\u00a024.[2] As the depression traveled generally westward, the JTWC upgraded it to Tropical Storm Omar on August\u00a025,[2] and the JMA followed suit on the next day.[4] Omar began to slow as it tracked westward. Outflow from nearby Tropical Storm Polly to the west produced a stream of strong wind shear over Omar, slowing intensification. The JTWC noted that the shear could decouple Omar's wind circulation from its convection, possibly weakening the storm. However, as Omar and Polly moved farther apart, a high-pressure ridge developed between the storms. This caused Omar to drift northward and then west-northwestward into a region with decreased shear, which allowed it to resume strengthening. Early on August\u00a027, the JTWC upgraded the system to a typhoon, and an eye began to appear around 23:00\u00a0UTC that day.[5] Omar entered a phase of rapid intensification on August\u00a028,[2] at which point the JMA also classified it as a typhoon.[4] The typhoon made landfall on Guam soon after, with 1\u2011minute sustained winds of about 195\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph).[2] The eye, 37\u00a0km (23\u00a0mi) in diameter,[2] slowly crossed the northern portion of the small island over a period of 2.5\u00a0hours.[5] At 1800\u00a0UTC on August\u00a029, Omar reached its peak intensity with 10\u2011minute sustained winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 920\u00a0mbar (hPa; 27.17\u00a0inHg) as estimated by the JMA; this intensity was maintained for 24\u00a0hours before a steady weakening trend began.[4] The JTWC estimated higher 1\u2011minute winds of around 240\u00a0km/h (150\u00a0mph), making Omar a super typhoon.[2] Two days later, the typhoon came close enough to the Philippines to warrant monitoring from PAGASA,[nb 3] who named the storm Lusing.[1] By 1500\u00a0UTC on September\u00a03, the JMA downgraded Omar to a tropical storm,[4] although the JTWC maintained its typhoon intensity through the next day.[2] Heading generally westward, the storm made landfall on the east coast of Taiwan near Hualien City on September\u00a04.[6] After traversing the island in seven hours, Omar exited the coast of Yunlin County and emerged into the Taiwan Strait.[7] The storm crossed the body of water and moved ashore in eastern China near Xiamen, Fujian, on September\u00a05.[6] Inland, Omar quickly degenerated into a tropical depression before turning west-southwest. It proceeded across southern China while heavily weakening, and completely dissipated over northern Vietnam on September\u00a09.[4]"

A day later, the COR was raised to stage 2; all but two United States Navy ships were sortied from the harbor to prevent damage,[8] and the remainder rode out the storm southwest of Guam.[9] On August\u00a028, COR 1 was declared, the highest level.[8] In response, all fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters on the island were moved into hangars or transported to Japan or the Philippines.[9] All schools were closed for the duration of Omar's passage over Guam.[10] Flight operations were suspended for at least two days,[11] stranding 5,000\u00a0passengers on the island. About 3,100\u00a0people rode out the storm in emergency shelters.[12] Omar was the strongest and most damaging typhoon to hit Guam since Typhoon Pamela in 1976.[2][5] The typhoon was felt on all parts of Guam;[13] tropical-storm-force winds affected the island for 16\u00a0hours,[2] and wind gusts were estimated to have reached 248\u00a0km/h (154\u00a0mph) in areas beneath the western eyewall.[5] However, the high winds caused the anemometer at Hag\u00e5t\u00f1a to fail during the eye's passage, and the radar at Andersen Air Force Base was lost,[2] preventing accurate wind speed assessments.[8] The lowest barometric pressure was 940\u00a0mbar (27.76\u00a0inHg) at Apra Harbor. Omar's slow movement resulted in prolonged heavy rainfall, peaking at 519\u00a0mm (20.44\u00a0in) at the Guam National Weather Service Office in Tiyan and reaching 417\u00a0mm (16.41\u00a0in) at Andersen AFB.[5][14] Damage on Guam was heaviest from the central region to the northern coast, in particular to tourist areas and military bases.[11][15] The Naval Computer and Telecommunications Area Master Station was shut down due to power outages and water damage to the generators.[8] Two US Navy ships, the USS Niagara Falls (AFS-3) and the USS White Plains (AFS-4)\u2014both naval supply ships\u2014went aground due to rough seas and strong winds,[16] and the dry dock at Apra Harbor was washed ashore.[8] Omar destroyed dozens of businesses on the island.[17] High winds knocked a crane into an apartment building[18] and downed 400\u00a0wooden and 20\u00a0concrete power poles across Tumon,[2] leaving 70% of the island without power.[16] Throughout Guam, Omar disrupted transportation and communication systems, and led to the failure of water pumping systems.[2] Landslides covered roads, and low-lying areas were flooded.[11] About 2,000\u00a0homes were destroyed and another 2,200 were damaged to varying degrees,[12] displacing nearly 3,000\u00a0people.[2] Destruction was heaviest to wooden structures; buildings made of concrete fared relatively well during the storm.[8] Island-wide, damage totaled $457\u00a0million,[2] split nearly evenly between the military bases and civilian damage.[17] One person died on Guam,[8] and more than 200\u00a0people required emergency treatment[2]\u2014including about 80\u00a0injured by flying debris.[15]"

High waves washed ashore four ships in Kaohsiung,[6] and farmland and fisheries there, as well as in Yunlin, Chiayi City, and Pingtung County, suffered heavy damage.[7] Throughout Taiwan, Omar resulted in three deaths (two of which drownings), twelve injuries, and more than $65 million (USD) in damage.[2][22] The fringes of the typhoon dropped light rainfall in the outer regions of Japan, peaking at 28\u00a0mm (1.1\u00a0in) on Iriomote-jima. The highest wind gust was 72\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph) on Yonaguni.[23] Omar damaged the sugar cane and okra in the southern Japanese islands, leading to crop losses of \u00a5476\u00a0million JPY (US$3.8\u00a0million).[nb 5] In addition, traffic was disrupted and 38\u00a0flights were canceled.[25] Later, Omar spread rainfall along its path through southern China, flooding parts of northwestern Hong Kong on September\u00a07.[2][6]"

        "content": "Immediately after Omar's landfall in Guam, former Governor Joseph Franklin Ada declared a state of emergency,[26] and former U.S. President George H. W. Bush declared the island a federal disaster area.[27] In the wake of the storm, several people were arrested for looting.[15] The Federal Emergency Management Agency opened up disaster assistance centers where residents were able to apply for federal aid; it ultimately provided about $18.4\u00a0million in assistance, including disaster housing, storm-related unemployment benefits, and grant programs for families or businesses,[28] helping over 11,000\u00a0people.[17] The federal government paid for 100% of the debris removal, emergency work, and reconstruction of uninsured public buildings, although it usually only provides 75% of the cost for typical disasters. This was due to the sequence of three significant tropical cyclones affecting the United States in three weeks; in addition to Omar, Hurricane Andrew struck Florida in August and Hurricane Iniki hit Hawaii in September. The Department of Defense assisted the affected areas with 27\u00a0members of the Guam National Guard and 700\u00a0members of the military. The military provided temporary housing, generators, and construction supplies, at a cost of $5.75\u00a0million, though most of the disaster needs were handled by the government.[16] The local Red Cross provided $6\u00a0million in assistance after the storm.[28] Due to the combined damages from Andrew, Iniki, and Omar, the United States Congress passed the Dire Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1992, which provided additional funding for the agencies responding to the disasters through the fiscal year ending on September\u00a030.[29] For 11\u00a0days, the JTWC on Guam was unable to continue operations, relying on a backup agency. The damage to the airport radar prompted the NEXRAD\u2014a network of high-resolution weather radars\u2014to be installed earlier than scheduled, in February 1993,[2] and limited incoming and outgoing flights to the daytime.[12] On August\u00a030, a naval ship docked at Apra Harbor to provide a temporary mobile radar. By September\u00a015, both ships that had been washed ashore were refloated.[8] In the aftermath of the destruction, insurance companies decided to stop issuing new policies for structures not made of concrete.[28] In January 1996, former Governor Carl Gutierrez issued an executive order, mandating that homes or storm shutters on the island withstand winds of at least 250\u00a0m/h (155\u00a0mph).[30] The citizens left homeless by Omar resided in a tent city nicknamed Camp Omar, consisting of 200\u00a0tents holding more than 1,000\u00a0people.[2][17] Volunteers and military efforts cleaned most of the debris on the island within a few weeks.[2] Many important roads were reopened by three days after the storm.[12] The power took four weeks to be restored island-wide, disrupting schools and businesses,[31] although water access was expected to be restored within a few days of the storm.[12] Schools reopened on September\u00a014,[8] and most businesses resumed their work by the end of the month.[17] The United States military ceased relief operations on September\u00a019,[8] though complete recovery was disrupted by the passage of several subsequent typhoons. These storms caused less damage than normal after Omar wrecked the more vulnerable structures. As a result, it became difficult to discern the damage between Omar and Typhoon Gay in December 1992.[5] A 1993 study in the medical journal Anxiety found that 7.2% of 320\u00a0participants affected by Omar developed acute stress reaction, and another 15% developed early traumatic stress response, especially those affected by the later typhoons. About 5.9% of the participants displayed symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, similar to the levels shown after Hurricane Hugo in 1989.[31] Due to the destruction in Guam, the name Omar was retired and was replaced with Oscar in 1993.[2][32]"

        "content": " Typhoon Amy was an intense and deadly tropical cyclone that struck areas of the central Philippines in December\u00a01951. Impacting the archipelago during the 1951 eruption of Mount Hibok-Hibok, Amy exacerbated the effects of the volcano, greatly increasing the number of resulting deaths. The fifteenth named storm and fourteenth typhoon within the western Pacific Ocean that year, Amy developed from an area of low pressure near the Kwajalein Atoll on December\u00a03. Tracking in a general westward direction, the storm quickly intensified to reach typhoon intensity the next day. However, the typhoon's asymmetricity resulted in a fluctuation of intensity over the following few days. Afterwards, Amy intensified to reach its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 220\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 950\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.05\u00a0inHg) on December\u00a08.[nb 1] Over the ensuing two days, Amy moved over several islands in the central Philippines before emerging in the South China Sea on December\u00a011 as the equivalent of a minimal typhoon. Shortly after, the tropical cyclone executed a tight anticyclonic loop while oscillating in strength several times before eventually weakening and dissipating on December\u00a017, just east of Vietnam. Amy was considered one of the worst typhoons to strike the Philippines on record. Making its initial landfall along with the concurrent eruption of Mount Hibok-Hibok on Camiguin, the typhoon disrupted volcanic relief operations and forced the displacement of victims already displaced by the volcano. Cebu City suffered the worst impacts of Amy\u00a0\u2013 most of the city's buildings were heavily damaged, and 29\u00a0people died in the city. Strong winds and rainfall in the city associated with Amy also set records which still remain unbroken today. Damage there was estimated at 560\u00a0million Philippine pesos. Along the east coast of Leyte, where Amy initially struck, ninety percent of homes were destroyed, and a large swath of coconut plantations were wiped out. In Panay, located on the western side of the Philippines, at least a thousand homes were destroyed in 41\u00a0towns. Overall, Amy caused $30\u00a0million in damage,[nb 2] and at least 556\u00a0fatalities, though the final death toll may have been as high as 991, making the typhoon one of the deadliest in modern Philippine history. An additional 50,000\u00a0people were displaced."

        "content": "The origins of Typhoon Amy can be traced back to a low-pressure area first detected over Kwajalein at 0500\u00a0UTC on November\u00a029. Tracking westward, the Fleet Weather Center in Guam began to monitor vorticity for potential development,[nb 3] assigning the numeric designation 11122 to the tropical system. Late on December\u00a02, a routine weather reconnaissance flight unexpectedly intercepted the disturbance and detected unusually strong westerly winds, a characteristic typically indicative of a tropical cyclone. As such, the flight, named Vulture George, was rerouted to investigate the area. After finding conclusive evidence of a closed low-pressure area, the Fleet Weather Center in Guam classified the disturbance as a tropical storm with winds of 100\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph). At the time, Amy had two separate centers of circulation, resulting in an asymmetrical wind field.[3] Following tropical cyclogenesis, the fast-moving tropical cyclone quickly intensified, reaching the equivalent of a Category\u00a01 on the modern-day Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale. Between December\u00a04 and 5, however, Amy briefly weakened back to tropical storm intensity before restrengthening. Steady intensification followed afterwards, with the typhoon reaching the equivalent of a Category\u00a03 hurricane by 0000\u00a0UTC on December\u00a06.[4] By this time, the storm had slowed in forward speed. Later that day, the two, formerly separate circulation centers merged, resulting in an eye spanning 26\u00a0km (16\u00a0mi) in diameter.[3] At 1200\u00a0UTC on December\u00a08, Amy reached its peak intensity with winds of 220\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 950\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.05\u00a0inHg), which would classify it as a modern-day Category\u00a04 typhoon. At the same time, the tropical cyclone began to track slightly southwestward.[4] At 0600\u00a0UTC the following day, Amy made its first landfall on southern Samar with an intensity equivalent of a Category\u00a02 typhoon. Over the next two days, the typhoon weakened and moved over several islands in the Philippines including Leyte, Cebu, and Panay before emerging into the South China Sea on December\u00a011.[3][4] In the South of China Sea on December\u00a011, Amy quickly slowed in forward motion and began to execute a cyclonic loop. Late that day, the typhoon strengthened back to Category\u00a02 intensity, and as such concurrently attained a tertiary peak intensity with winds of 160\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 968\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.59\u00a0inHg). Late on December\u00a013, Amy weakened back to a Category\u00a01 typhoon for a transient period of time before restrengthening and reaching a quaternary peak intensity as a Category\u00a03 typhoon with maximum sustained winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h).[4] Afterwards, the typhoon began to weaken, and at 0900\u00a0UTC on December\u00a017, the Fleet Weather Center in Guam issued their last bulletin on the tropical cyclone. Upon the issuance of the last advisory, Amy set records for most typhoon bulletins issued at 58, and most reconnaissance fixes at 25.[3] However, Amy continued to persist through the next day before degenerating into a remnant low-pressure area late on December\u00a018. The following day, the associated remnants of Amy dissipated east of Vietnam.[4]"

        "content": "Beginning on September\u00a01, 1948,[5] the then-active volcano Mount Hibok-Hibok on Camiguin Island in the Philippines began to release lava in a series of eruption events which continued for the ensuing three years.[6] On December\u00a04, 1951,[7] a large, Pel\u00e9an eruption event later rated between a 2 and 3 on the Volcanic Explosivity Index, sending pyroclastic flows and lahars down the northeast flank of the volcano.[5][6] The resultant ash flows alone killed an estimated 500\u00a0people on the island, making it one of the deadliest volcanic eruption events in recorded history.[8] As the typhoon approached the archipelago, relief agencies were forced to divert aid operations to victims of the recent eruption, slowing the recovery process.[9][10] Upon making landfall on south Samar on December\u00a010, Hibok-Hibok erupted six times in rapid succession, worsening the effects of both the typhoon and the volcano.[10] Amy had also made landfall on an area impacted by a second typhoon three weeks prior.[11] Strong winds displaced and destroyed residences and uprooted trees, while torrential rainfall caused rivers to overflow, resulting in the flooding of sugarcane fields and the washing away of bridges.[12] Radio communications to and between most of the central Philippine islands were disrupted.[13] Cebu was one of the worst impacted cities.[14] At the local airport, an anemometer recorded sustained winds of 160\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph) early on December\u00a010, which remains a record for the city.[15] Rainfall peaked at 195.3\u00a0mm (7.69\u00a0in); at the time this made the typhoon the wettest tropical cyclone in Cebu history.[16] All buildings made of light construction materials were at least partially damaged, with many large structures sustaining roof or other damage. At least 29\u00a0people were killed in the city,[14][17] including the drownings of three due to the resultant flooding.[10] The typhoon's effects caused the cessation of the city's power supply.[18] Damage in Cebu totaled 560\u00a0million Philippine pesos.[16] At least a hundred other people in Cebu City were displaced. Offshore, 28\u00a0ships capsized due to winds caused by Amy, including 7 inter-island vessels. This set a new record for vessels sunk by a typhoon in Cebu, and held until Typhoon Mike sunk 88\u00a0ships in 1990.[15] On Samar, where Amy first struck, reports indicated that 27\u00a0people died, despite initial reports that stated that there were no fatalities.[17] In Iloilo City on Visayas, two people were killed and seventeen\u00a0others were injured.[14] Property damage in Bacolod, Negros was estimated at $250,000,[13] and 52\u00a0people died,[17] with an additional 2,250\u00a0persons rendered homeless.[13] Elsewhere on Negros, 30\u00a0percent of the island's vital sugar crop was destroyed.[19] On the east coast of Leyte, the typhoon was considered the worst in living memory, and ninety percent of homes there were destroyed.[12] In Negros Oriental, schoolhouses in Canlaon, Vallehermoso, Negros Oriental, and Guihulngan were blown down.[20] An aerial survey mission estimated that at least30\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (78\u00a0km2) of coconut plantations were devastated;[18] other coconut plantations throughout the Philippines also suffered considerable damage.[21] Copra crops also suffered sizeable losses, though production was expected to remain at forecast levels.[22] Tacloban's San Jose Airfield was severely damaged by the strong storm surge from Amy.[18] In the Tacloban and Surigao Strait area, an estimated 146\u00a0people were killed.[23] In the Leytenian town of Abuyog, the mayor had announced that 176\u00a0people were killed in the town alone. Another 135\u00a0fatalities were confirmed in Sogod.[24] More than 100\u00a0persons were injured by falling coconuts and other airborne debris.[25] On Leyte alone, damage was estimated at $8\u00a0million.[19] The Red Cross estimated over a thousand homes in 41\u00a0towns on Panay were destroyed by the storm.[26] More than 20\u00a0percent of crops and infrastructure were destroyed.[27] Four people were killed on the island.[17] Upon looping in the South China Sea, Amy brought torrential rainfall to areas of Manila, though no damage was reported.[28] Overall, Amy caused at least an estimated $30\u00a0million in damage throughout the central Philippines.[29][30] However, the total number of fatalities directly associated with the effects of the typhoon remain disputed, and may range anywhere from 569[31] to 991,[32] making Amy one of the deadliest typhoons to strike the island nation in recorded history.[33] An additional 50,000\u00a0people were rendered homeless by the storm.[30] The typhoon was characterized by the Philippine weather bureau to be the worst typhoon to strike the Philippines in at least 70\u00a0years.[34] In the aftermath of Amy, then-president of the Philippines Elpidio Quirino declared a state of public calamity for eleven central Philippine provinces including the island of Camiguin, which was heavily affected by both the typhoon and Mount Hibok-Hibok.[35][36] On December\u00a024, the American Red Cross granted $25,000\u00a0to the Philippine Red Cross.[34]"

Flooding became a major result of the storm, parts of the town and Regina were flooded with 25\u00a0cm of rain within 1 hour of the storm. Golfball and larger hail left drifts 50\u00a0cm deep in several places around the town.[6] The worst damage from the storm was in the west and south ends of the town, where a farmyard and cement plant were demolished, along with many homes and all of the trailer park, the 72-unit trailer park was in total ruin. Almost all trees in the town were damaged and uprooted, resulting in very messy streets full of broken trees and branches. After one month, the town was back to normal and rebuilding started up, about a decade later, the cement plant was fully rebuilt.[7]"

The third tropical depression, storm, and first typhoon of the 1992 Pacific typhoon season, Bobbie developed from a weak area of convection in the monsoon trough. Intensifying as it underwent a binary interaction with nearby Chuck, on 25 June, Bobbie became a typhoon. Further developing as it tracked northwards, two days later, Bobbie peaked as a very strong typhoon. Soon after, Bobbie began weakening as it recurved northeastward, transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on 1 July. It was at this time when Bobbie made its closest approach to Japan, just southeast of Kyushu. The extratropical remnants of the former typhoon persevered until they dissipated on 3 July. As the typhoon passed east of northern Luzon, torrential rains associated with Bobble and Chuck caused widespread flooding and mudslides over the northern Philippine Islands. Despite that, Bobbie primarily had a beneficial effect there. In Japan, intense winds and heavy rainfall in the prefectures of Okinawa, K\u014dchi, Miyazaki, Kagoshima, and Tokyo caused landslides and wave damage. However, due to preparations, no one die. As a weakening Bobbie passed near Kadena Air Base, one trailer was overturned while a woman received head injuries when she was knocked down by Bobbie's strong wind."

Embedded in the monsoon trough, the disturbance's circulation began consolidating, prompting the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), an American military organization, to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on the disturbance.[2] As a result, on 23 June, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) noted that the disturbance had developed into a tropical depression.[3][2] Around that time, the JTWC also upgraded the disturbance into a depression, issuing their first warning on Tropical Depression 02W later that day.[2] Intensifying, early on 24 June, both the JTWC and JMA noted Bobbie intensified into a tropical storm, causing the latter agency to name it Bobbie.[2][3] Just a few hours later, Bobbie began undergoing a binary interaction with nearby Tropical Storm Chuck, which at the time, just formed off the Philippines.[2] As  Bobbie was intensifying, it crossed into the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR), prompting the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGSA) to name it Asiang.[1] Early the next day, Bobbie intensified into a severe tropical storm.[2] At that time, the JTWC claimed that Bobbie had intensified into a typhoon,[2] while the JMA noted that Bobbie had actually became a typhoon several hours later.[3] On 18:00 UTC on 26 June, Bobbie peaked with 1-minute sustained winds of 140\u00a0mph (220\u00a0km/h) as it tracked the western extent of the mid-level subtropical ridge.[2] Several hours later, Bobbie peaked with 10-minute sustained winds of 105\u00a0mph (165\u00a0km/h).[3] As Bobbie began recurving east of Taiwan at 12:00 UTC that day, increasing southwesterly winds caused Bobbie to steadily weaken. Passing over Miyako Jima on 28 June and then just southeast of Okinawa on 29 June, Bobbie began undergoing an extratropical transition on at that time.[2] At that time, Bobbie weakened into a severe tropical storm as it left the PAR, causing PAGASA to stop issuing advisories on the storm.[1] As Bobbie transitioned into an extratropical storm, the JTWC issued their final warning on the system the next day, prior to brushing the southern tip of Honshu.[2] The JMA noted that Bobbie had actually became extratropical early the next day, prior to it dissipating on 3 July.[3]"

The disturbance was classified as a tropical depression the next day. Tracking northward, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Phyllis later on August\u00a012. On the next day, Phyllis, after developing an eye, attained typhoon intensity. The typhoon accelerated north while rapidly intensifying, and on the evening of August\u00a014, Phyllis reached its peak intensity of 225\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph). Typhoon Phyllis turned northwest, making landfall over Shikoku on August\u00a017, with winds of 145\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph). Phyllis weakened to a tropical storm later the same day. Its remnants were last observed on August\u00a020. Phyllis, along with Typhoon Rita, were accountable for the bulk of tropical cyclone casualties in Japan during the 1975 Pacific typhoon season. From Phyllis alone, 60\u00a0people perished while 146\u00a0were injured on the island of Shikoku. There, at least 489\u00a0houses collapsed and 577\u00a0others were damaged.

        "content": "During the first couple weeks of August\u00a01975, the Western Pacific monsoonal trough extended from central China to Guam. Numerous surface circulations appeared in this trough as early as the August\u00a08, and three days later, a tropical disturbance was spotted by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) some 705\u00a0km (440\u00a0mi) west-southwest of Guam. The first warning was issued on the morning of the August\u00a012, with the JTWC designating it Tropical\u00a0Depression\u00a007.[1] Due to the cyclone's proximity to the country, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Etang.[2] Despite a hurricane hunter aircraft finding multiple surface centers and an ill-defined upper-level center, the depression quickly strengthened into a tropical storm. Initially, the storm's low- and upper-level circulation were displaced by 200\u00a0km (125\u00a0mi), but on the morning of August\u00a013, the centers had become vertically stacked. At 08:33\u00a0UTC, a hurricane hunter flight reported a closed eyewall 55\u00a0km (35\u00a0mi) in diameter. Based on aircraft reports of 115\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph) winds to the west-southwest of the center,[1] Phyllis was believed to have obtained typhoon intensity midday on August\u00a013.[3] By August\u00a013, a mid-level ridge over China began to weaken while a ridge\neast of Japan intensified. As a result, Phyllis\u2019 forward speed accelerated[1] as it tracked towards the north.[4] In the 24 hours after being designated a typhoon, Phyllis entered a period of rapid deepening, attaining winds of 200\u00a0km/h (125\u00a0mph) winds at midday on August\u00a014, which would make it an upper-end Category\u00a03 hurricane on the United States-based Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (SSHWS). At 15:00\u00a0UTC, aircraft data measured a minimum barometric pressure of 920\u00a0mbar (27.2\u00a0inHg). Based on this, the JTWC estimated that the typhoon reached its maximum intensity of 225\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph), equal to Category\u00a04 status on the SSHWS. The next day, the storm's forward motion briefly slowed as the ridge extended westward across Japan. After turning to the northwest, Phyllis once again accelerated, and on August\u00a016, passed roughly 320\u00a0km (200\u00a0mi) southeast of Shikoku. The following morning, the typhoon moved onshore near the southwestern edge of Shikoku, with winds of 145\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph).[1] The system weakened to a tropical storm at 06:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a017 over land, and a tropical depression 24 hours later. Late on August\u00a018, Phyllis ceased to exist as a tropical cyclone,[5] although the JMA estimated that Phyllis transitioned into an extratropical cyclone around this time. The agency continued to track the system until August\u00a020 when it was meandering over the Sea of Japan.[nb 1][7]"

At least 489\u00a0houses collapsed, 577\u00a0others were damaged, and thousands of other dwellings were inundated.[1] Most freeways across the island were closed[15] and officials estimated it would take a week to be restored.[18] Island-wide, 315,000\u00a0households lost power,[19] with an additional 18,000 dwellings losing power on western Honshu.[20] K\u014dchi Prefecture sustained the worst effects from the storm,[21] where 21\u00a0people were killed,[22] including one woman who was electrocuted. A 32-year-old man died in Matsuyama City after debris fell on him while driving.[23] More than 1,000\u00a0homes were flooded in Tosa, Suzaki and Sagawa on Shikoku.[22] In addition to the effects on Japan, the outer rainbands of the typhoon dropped heavy rains in Taiwan, causing widespread damage. Three people were killed while seven others were rendered missing. A total of 3,000\u00a0people were displaced from their home. Numerous roads and railways were closed. Half the villages in Chiayi County were flooded with 1.8\u00a0m (6\u00a0ft) deep water.[24] While the typhoon's inner core bypassed South Korea,[24] Phyllis dropped heavy rainfall across the country, peaking at 142\u00a0mm (5.6\u00a0in) in Daegwallyeong-myeon. Winds of 54\u00a0km/h (34\u00a0mph) and gusts of 84\u00a0km/h (52\u00a0mph) were recorded in Ulleungdo.[25] A minimum pressure of 995.9\u00a0mbar (29.41\u00a0inHg) was observed at Busan.

At around 12:00am CST (0600 UTC) a thunderstorm developed and rapidly began to grow over south central Wisconsin. The growing storm caused a downburst near the village of Clyman and then continued towards West Bend. The storm did not appear to be severe and thunderstorm tops were measured to only be 26,000 feet (7,900\u00a0m), and a weak bow echo was observed by a radar in Neenah. Only a few minutes after midnight (local time), while the storm was weakening, the tornado touched down on the north side of West Bend, around the intersection of Jefferson Street and North 18th Avenue and produced F3 and F4 damage only seconds after touching down. All three fatalities occurred within a few blocks of touchdown, as the tornado moved along and north of Green Tree Road before hitting the Moraine Park Technical College campus, destroying the main building at F2-F3 intensity, moving off to the northeast across the Milwaukee River and finally lifting somewhere north of Newark Road. Post storm analysis determined that not only was the tornado an extremely rare occurrence given the storm's strength, but also that it was an anticyclonic tornado. The F4 tornado remains the strongest anticyclonic tornado ever recorded.[1]"

The ninth tropical storm and fifth typhoon of the season, Matsa developed on July 30 to the east of the Philippines. Matsa intensified as it tracked northwestward, and attained peak 10-minute sustained winds of 150\u00a0km/h (93\u00a0mph) near Taiwan before weakening and striking the Chinese province of Zhejiang on August 5. The system continued northward into the Yellow Sea, and on August 7 Matsa became extratropical after again moving ashore along the Liaodong Peninsula. Matsa is a Laotian name for a lady fish.[1] In Taiwan, Matsa dropped torrential rainfall of up to 1,270\u00a0mm (50\u00a0in), which caused mudslides and moderate damage across the island. Flooding from the rainfall contaminated some water supplies, leaving around 80,000\u00a0homes without water at one point; much of Taoyuan County (now Taoyuan City) was without water for at least 5\u00a0days. As in Taiwan, the typhoon dropped heavy precipitation in the People's Republic of China, and in combination with strong winds destroyed about 59,000\u00a0houses and damaged more than 20,000\u00a0km2 (7,700\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of croplands.

        "content": "The origin of Typhoon Matsa is traced to the formation of an area of convection about 185\u00a0km (115\u00a0mi) east of Yap in late July. The convection gradually consolidated over a weak low-level circulation, and at 0300\u00a0UTC on July 30 the system was first mentioned in the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) Significant Tropical Weather Outlook. Located within an area of moderate wind shear, the system continued to slowly organize, and by 1200\u00a0UTC on July 30 it was sufficiently organized for the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) to classify it as a weak tropical depression while located about 65\u00a0km (40\u00a0mi) east of Yap. Shortly thereafter, the JTWC followed suit by issuing a tropical cyclone formation alert. The depression tracked steadily westward, followed by a turn to the northwest on July 31 under the influence of a mid-level ridge to its east. It continued to organize, and at 1200\u00a0UTC on July 31 it intensified into Tropical Storm Matsa; the depression was unofficially classified a tropical storm six\u00a0hours earlier by the JTWC. Additionally, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) named the system Tropical Storm Gorio, due to its location within the administration's area of responsibility.[1][2][3] Tropical Storm Matsa gradually intensified as it tracked steadily northwestward; by late on August 1 it strengthened into a severe tropical storm. Outflow and deep convection to the north remained limited, though the storm was able to intensity further to attain typhoon status on August 2 about 780\u00a0km (480\u00a0mi) south of Okinawa. Intensification slowed, and late on August 3 Matsa reached a peak intensity of 150\u00a0km/h (93\u00a0mph) while located 495\u00a0km (308\u00a0mi) east of the southern tip of Taiwan as reported by the JMA; the JTWC and the National Meteorological Center of China reported the typhoon as strengthening further to attain peak winds of 165\u00a0km/h (103\u00a0mph) on August 4. Shortly after passing over the Japanese island of Ishigaki, Matsa began to weaken steadily as it approached the coast of China, and made landfall as a minimal typhoon late on August 5 near Yuhuan in the southern region of Zhejiang Province. It crossed the Gulf of Yueqing and 40\u00a0minutes after its first landfall it struck Mainland China near Yueqing. It quickly weakened to a tropical storm, and within hours of moving ashore the JTWC issued its last advisory. Matsa turned to the north, weakening to a tropical depression on August 7 shortly before entering the Yellow Sea. The weakening depression continued northward, and became an extratropical cyclone on August 9 after hitting the Liaodong Peninsula.[1][2][3]"

The typhoon also resulted in the cancellation or delay of thousands of flights,[1] with the two main airports in Shanghai closed for 30\u00a0hours.[7] Officials near Matsa's projected landfall were advised to lower the levels in reservoirs to mitigate the threat of flooding.[8] In Zhejiang, officials set up shelters for about 35,000 boats to prevent marine damage.[9] Due to the potential for rough seas, officials closed the port at Ningbo and Shanghai and also canceled some ferry service.[10] Matsa was predicted to be first typhoon to affect Beijing in 11\u00a0years by dropping heavy amounts of rainfall.[11] Local officials advised water operators to lower water levels to prevent flooding.[12] Up to 100\u00a0mm (3.9\u00a0in) of rainfall was forecast for the city, and officials prepared to evacuate 40,000\u00a0residents in the outskirts of the city.[13]"

The rainfall led to flooding and mudslides throughout the island.[1] In response to the flooding, residents placed sandbags around houses and office buildings to prevent flood damage.[4] The mudslides blocked roads across the mountainous region, leaving hundreds stranded, and in combination with flooding the mudslides washed away several bridges and damaged some roadways. Strong winds left 56,211\u00a0houses without power, most of which were quickly repaired. Typhoon Matsa caused moderate crop damage across the island, which was still recovering from the damage caused by Typhoon Haitang a month before.[5] More than 80,000 homes were left without water due to the passage of the typhoon.[5] Subsequent flooding left more than 630,000 homes without water or receiving water at infrequent intervals.[14] About 368 hectares (910 acres) of crop fields were destroyed,[15] and crop damage from Matsa totaled NT$47\u00a0million (2005 TWD, $1.5\u00a0million 2005\u00a0USD).[1] According to the Taiwan Council of\nAgriculture, the banana and pear crops were the worst affected.[15]"

Throughout Zhejiang, Matsa caused $8.9\u00a0billion (2005\u00a0CNY, $1.1\u00a0billion 2005\u00a0USD) in damage and five direct fatalities.[1] Heavy rainfall in Shanghai flooded 84\u00a0city streets; in some locations insufficient water drainage left homes and apartments flooded,[19] with a total of 20,000\u00a0houses reporting flooding.[7] The flooding also closed the city subway system for a few hours.[1] Strong winds downed 2,700 trees and 400 power lines in the city.[7] The typhoon damaged a construction site in the city, leaving three injured and one person killed.[20] Throughout the city an estimated 15,000\u00a0houses were destroyed. Additionally, four people were electrocuted as a result of the flooding.[12] In Shanghai alone, damage totaled $1.33\u00a0billion (2005\u00a0CNY, $164.5\u00a0million 2005\u00a0USD); seven people died in the city.[1] Despite the anticipated effects, Beijing experienced only light rainfall.[13] Throughout China, over 31\u00a0million people were affected in over eight\u00a0provinces. Typhoon Matsa left the agricultural industry severely impacted, with over 20,000\u00a0km2 (7,700\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) damaged.[1] The combination of its winds and flooding damaged around 200,000\u00a0buildings,[21] including a total of 59,000\u00a0destroyed houses. Damage in the country totaled about $18\u00a0billion (2005\u00a0CNY, $2.23\u00a0billion 2005\u00a0USD).[1]"

Water supply in the southern portion of Taoyuan County was restored by five\u00a0days after the storm,[25] with supply restored to the northern portion of the county by ten days after the passage of the typhoon.[23] The same problem had occurred previously after Typhoon Mindulle in July 2004.[14] As a result of the crop damage, the Taiwan Council of Agriculture opened its reserve of frozen vegetables to prevent overharvesting of the existing crops.[5] Despite the measures, crop prices reached record levels, which led to groups calling out for the government to stabilize the price of foods. In reaction, a member of the Council of Agriculture remarked that \"vegetable prices [were] expected to go back to normal gradually ... as supplies increase[d].\"[26] The passage of the typhoon left hundreds of residents in Hsinchu County isolated from the outside world for four days. As a result, officials deployed helicopters with rescue supplies and returned with the injured. Aid from one internal organization totaled $NT300,000 (2005 TWD, $9,500 2005\u00a0USD).[27] Shortly after the effects of the typhoon ended on the island, work began to repair and rebuild the impacted bridges and roads. Electricians quickly began restoring power across northern Taiwan; by the day after the typhoon's passage, the number of houses without power decreased by 90%.[28] In the People's Republic of China, members of the People's Liberation Army assisted in search and rescue operations.[18] Officials called for about 100,000 citizens in Shanghai for work in disaster control and distribution of relief aid,[29] with some providing relief supplies to flooded areas by inflatable rafts.[30] Within a month, Typhoons Talim and Khanun also affected the same area, further compounding the effects of Matsa.[31] During the 38th Session of the World Meteorological Organization in Hanoi, Vietnam, the name Matsa was retired;[32] during the next session, the name Pakhar was nominated as its replacement.[33] It was first used in the 2012 season."

        "content": " Typhoon Longwang, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Maring, was the deadliest tropical cyclone to impact China during the 2005 Pacific typhoon season. Longwang was first identified as a tropical depression on September\u00a025 north of the Mariana Islands. Moving along a general westward track, the system quickly intensified and reached typhoon status on September\u00a027[1]. After reaching Category\u00a04-equivalent intensity on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale, adverse atmospheric conditions along with internal structural changes resulted in temporary weakening. The structural change culminated in Longwang becoming an annular typhoon and prompted re-intensification. The storm attained peak strength with winds of 175\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph)[2][nb 1] and a pressure of 930 mbar (hPa; 27.46\u00a0inHg) on October\u00a01 as it approached Taiwan. Interaction with the mountainous terrain of the island and further structural changes caused some weakening before the typhoon made landfall near Hualien City early on October\u00a02[3]. Crossing the island in six hours, Longwang emerged over the Taiwan Strait before moving onshore again later that day, this time in Fujian Province, China as a minimal typhoon. Once over mainland China, the storm quickly weakened and ultimately dissipated late on October\u00a03. Prior to the storm's arrival, officials in Taiwan activated all emergency operations centers and urged residents to take serious precautions. The storm brought record-breaking winds, peaking at 234\u00a0km/h (145\u00a0mph) in Hualien City, and torrential rains. Despite the intensity of the storm, damage was relatively limited there. Two people died, 73\u00a0were injured, and damage reached NT$570\u00a0million (US$17.7\u00a0million).[nb 2] Large-scale evacuations took place in mainland China, with 730,000\u00a0people relocating[4]. Losses were extensive in Fujian Province where 1-in-100 year rains caused disastrous flooding in Fuzhou, killing 62 people. In Minhou County, 85\u00a0paramilitary police perished when a landslide destroyed their barracks. Throughout China, 147\u00a0people were killed and damage amounted to 7.81\u00a0billion RMB (US$944.6\u00a0million). Due to the severe damage, the name Longwang was later retired and replaced by Haikui[5]."

        "content": "On September\u00a024, 2005, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began monitoring a tropical disturbance north of the Mariana Islands.[nb 3] Convective banding features soon consolidated around a low-pressure area associated with the system, prompting the issuance of a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert the following day.[7] Later on September\u00a025, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) declared the system a tropical depression.[8][nb 4] Situated in a region characterized by low wind shear and favorable upper-level divergence, steady intensification ensued.[7] Early on September\u00a026, the JTWC also classified the system as a tropical depression, designating it as 19W.[10] Hours later, both agencies assessed sustained winds to have reached 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph), indicating tropical storm intensity. As such, the JMA named the storm Longwang.[nb 5] Situated to the southwest of a ridge, the storm tracked slowly west-northwest, while strengthening at an increasing rate. A temporary turn northwest occurred on September\u00a026 as Longwang approached a weakness in the ridge which had previously steered it west-northwestward.[7] In the 24\u00a0hours following the storm's naming, Longwang quickly intensified into a typhoon.[8] Once at typhoon status, the storm resumed a more westerly track as a second ridge extending from eastern Asia became the dominant steering factor.[7] On a westerly course toward Taiwan and eastern China, Longwang underwent a period of rapid intensification from September\u00a027\u201328.[7] At the end of this phase, the JMA assessed peak winds at 155\u00a0km/h (96\u00a0mph) while the JTWC rated it as a Category\u00a04-equivalent typhoon on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale.[8][10] On September\u00a029, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration assigned the typhoon the local name Maring as it entered their area of responsibility.[7] The following day, Longwang underwent a structural change, transitioning from asymmetrical banding to symmetrical, making it an annular tropical cyclone. During the transition, upper-level divergence and outflow significantly decreased, resulting in temporary weakening of the typhoon.[11] Additionally, an increase in westerly wind shear caused the interior structure to become asymmetric, with a southwest to northeast tilt noted by dropsondes released by the Dropwinsonde Observations for Typhoon Surveillance project.[12] Once the transition into an annular cyclone completed,[11] Longwang re-intensified and attained its peak intensity on October\u00a01 while situated 400\u00a0km (250\u00a0mi) south of Okinawa. The JMA assessed winds at 175\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph) along with a barometric pressure of 930 mbar (hPa; 27.46\u00a0inHg).[8] The JTWC estimated Longwang to have been slightly stronger, with one-minute sustained winds of 230\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph).[10][nb 6] At the time of peak intensity, an unmanned weather reconnaissance vehicle, known as Aerosonde, was flown into the typhoon and recorded peak winds of 211\u00a0km/h (131\u00a0mph) at an altitude of 3\u00a0km (1.9\u00a0mi). As the storm approached Taiwan late on October\u00a01, an eyewall replacement cycle began, with a large secondary eyewall forming around the inner one. At 1848\u00a0UTC, Doppler weather radar velocity estimates indicated winds of 240\u00a0km/h (150\u00a0mph) at an altitude of 3\u00a0km (1.9\u00a0mi). An interpolated surface pressure of 924.5\u00a0mbar (924.5\u00a0hPa; 27.30\u00a0inHg) was obtained based on the Aerosonde's data. After flying in the storm for ten hours, the unmanned vehicle encountered severe turbulence and crashed about 80\u00a0km (50\u00a0mi) east of Taitung City.[14] Interaction with the mountainous terrain of Taiwan caused Longwang to weaken somewhat.[7] The system ultimately made landfall near Hualien City at 0500\u00a0UTC on October\u00a02.[12] Just six hours after moving inland, Longwang emerged over the Taiwan Strait with its circulation mostly intact; however, weakening continued as it approached eastern China. Remaining over water for less than 12\u00a0hours, the typhoon made its second and ultimate landfall in Fujian Province around 1800 UTC on October\u00a02 (0200 October\u00a03 local time).[7] The storm quickly degraded over the following day, with winds decreasing below gale-force within 12\u00a0hours. The former typhoon slowed and turned northward over western Fujian before dissipating late on October\u00a03.[8][10]"

Shortly after, the island's Central Emergency Operations Center was activated. Early on October\u00a01, the whole of Taiwan was placed under a storm warning, prompting the Emergency Center to go to its maximum alert level. Daily meetings held by the Emergency Center provided officials with information on the storm and its expected impacts. Details from the meetings prompted the activation of all emergency operation centers in Taiwan. Nine counties were placed under debris flow advisories by the end of October\u00a01.[16] On October\u00a02, then-President Chen Shui-bian urged all residents to take serious precautions. 2,280\u00a0mountain climbers were advised to leave, the majority of whom complied. The Taiwan Railway Administration suspended operations on four rail lines.[17] Rapid transit lines in Taipei maintained operations, though ran on slower schedules. For southern Taiwan, the main risk was fresh water flooding. Fifteen rivers were placed under high alert while 340\u00a0more were under moderate alert. By the time Longwang made landfall, 37\u00a0shelters opened across the island,[18] accommodating nearly 1,000\u00a0people. Additionally, 5,464\u00a0Chinese fishermen temporarily sheltered at Taiwanese ports.[19] All airports were closed on October\u00a02 and sea travel was suspended.[18] With international airports shut down, President Chen, who was returning from a visit to the United Arab Emirates, was forced to land in Indonesia. The landing in Indonesia was seen as a political breakthrough for Taiwan as Indonesia does not recognize them as a separate nation from China.[20] By October\u00a01, officials in Mainland China issued warnings for Fujian Province and urged residents to evacuate.[21] An estimated 537,000\u00a0people heeded these warnings in Fujian and a further 86,000 and 61,860 evacuated in Zhejiang and Guangdong provinces, respectively.[7][22] The majority of evacuees were from the cities of Ningde, Fuzhou, Putian, Quanzhou, Xiamen, and Zhangzhou, with 376,000 evacuating from Xiamen alone.[23][24] Along the coast, roughly 38,000\u00a0seagoing vessels returned to port. Thousands of officials in the province oversaw flood preparations.[21] Public transportation across Fujian Province was temporarily suspended as well.[25] The airport in Xiamen shut down late on October\u00a02 as rain bands from the storm began impacting the area.[26] Throughout Fujian, more than 120\u00a0flights were canceled."

Four people sustained minor injuries in Ishigaki City after being knocked down by the winds. Heavy rains accompanied the winds and accumulations peaked at 84\u00a0mm (3.3\u00a0in) in the Yaeyama District. Significant agricultural damage took place as well, with losses in the sector reaching \u00a51\u00a0billion (US$8.7\u00a0million).[27] Farther south, the Batanes Islands of the Philippines experienced winds of 30 to 60\u00a0km/h (19 to 37\u00a0mph) in relation to the typhoon.[28] Due to the substantial loss of life and damage, the name Longwang was retired and replaced with Haikui (Chinese: \u6d77\u8475) in 2006.[29] The name was first used in the 2012 Pacific typhoon season."

These gusts were the highest ever recorded in the city, surpassing the previous record set during Typhoon Louise in 1959. On the west coast of Taiwan, gusts reached 153\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph) in Wugi. Torrential rains impacted many areas, with a peak 24\u00a0hour accumulations in Hualien County reaching 764.5\u00a0mm (30.10\u00a0in). A one-day total of 576\u00a0mm (22.7\u00a0in) was also measured in Yilan County.[7] At the storm's height, 749,621\u00a0households lost power while 24,817 lost telephone service.[18] In Hualien County, a man was killed after being struck in the head by an iron bar that crashed into his home;[30] 33\u00a0others were injured in the county. At least one home collapsed and six others were damaged in the county. High waves broke a 200\u00a0m (660\u00a0ft) stretch of a levee near ChiAnn, a coastal community in Hualien, and flooded nearby homes.[18][31] Part of the entrance to the Hualien Martyrs Shrine collapsed amid strong winds. Billboards and trees fell across Hualien City, littering the streets with debris.[19] Elsewhere on the island, 13\u00a0others sustained injuries and one person was reported missing.[32] In Chiayi City, a bus and truck collided, injuring 16 and on Provincial Highway 16, 11\u00a0people were injured when their coach bus crashed into a telephone pole. It is unknown how much, if any, of a role the typhoon was in these accidents. In Kaohsiung, a concrete slab was torn off a building and wedged into a high rise apartment.[33] One woman died after being swept away by flash flooding in the central town of Hoping.[34][35] Within the Alishan National Scenic Area 106\u00a0landslides occurred, covering an area of 1.29\u00a0km2 (0.50\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[citation needed]  Along the coast, a 7,000\u00a0ton cargo vessel broke loose from its mooring and drifted for 1\u00a0km (0.62\u00a0mi) before running aground and breaking apart.[36] Overall, 3\u00a0people died,[37][38] and 73\u00a0more were injured across Taiwan. Infrastructural damage was less than feared with losses amounting to NT$70\u00a0million (US$2.2\u00a0million). Then-Premier Frank Hsieh stated that the relative lack of damage \"was some good fortune in the midst of this misfortune.\"[32][33][35] Substantial agricultural took place, with rice, bananas, Chufeng grapes, and leafy vegetables being the hardest hit.[39] Losses in the sector exceeded NT$500\u00a0million (US$15\u00a0million).[7] Though unrelated to the typhoon, a magnitude 5.4\u00a0earthquake struck Taiwan late on October\u00a01, sending residents in Hualien panicking into streets despite the ongoing typhoon.[40][41]"

Off the coast of Lianjiang County, gusts reached 164\u00a0km/h (102\u00a0mph) on Xiayu Island. Gusts onshore peaked at 137\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph) in Changle within Fuzhou City. Though the storm brought typhoon-force winds, they were mostly confined to coastal areas and its greatest impacts resulted from torrential rains. Much of Fuzhou City experienced over 200\u00a0mm (7.9\u00a0in) of rain, with a maxima of 332\u00a0mm (13.1\u00a0in) in Changle. Of that total, 316\u00a0mm (12.4\u00a0in) fell in a 12\u2011hour span. Furthermore, one hour accumulations peaked at 152\u00a0mm (6.0\u00a0in).[7] These rains were described as a 1-in-100 year event.[42] Zhejiang and Jiangxi Provinces also experienced heavy rains; 292\u00a0mm (11.5\u00a0in) fell in Taizhou, Zhejiang while 128\u00a0mm (5.0\u00a0in) was recorded in Nanfeng County, Jiangxi.[7] The greatest damage from Longwang took place in Fujian Province,[25] especially within the city of Fuzhou where torrential rains overwhelmed the Jinan River and its tributaries. The ensuing flood inundated a 13.69\u00a0km2 (5.29\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of the city and resulted in 62\u00a0fatalities and left 24\u00a0people missing. Direct losses from the flood in Fuzhou alone reached 2.2\u00a0billion RMB (US$264\u00a0million).[43] Some areas were submerged by flood waters 2\u00a0m (6.6\u00a0ft) deep and many landslides caused significant damage.[25] A large auto plant owned by the Fujian Motor Industry Corporation, covering 83\u00a0hectares, was completely flooded. Many auto parts sustained heavy damage and losses at the plant reached 330\u00a0million RMB (US$39.9\u00a0million).[44] In Minhou County, Fuzhou, a landslide destroyed a barracks of the Chinese paramilitary police where 142\u00a0officers were staying.[45] Roughly 7,000\u00a0soldiers were deployed to the area for search and rescue.[25] Ultimately, 47\u00a0people were rescued (39\u00a0of whom were hospitalized[46]) and 85\u00a0bodies were recovered.[45][47] Striking during the week-long holiday following Chinese National Day, tourism suffered greatly in the region. Across China, 4.7\u00a0million people were directly affected by the typhoon, 4\u00a0million of whom were in Fujian Province.[7] Preliminary assessments indicated that 9,400\u00a0homes were destroyed, leaving 129,400\u00a0people homeless.[48] Fifty schools were damaged or destroyed as well.[49] A total of 160,000\u00a0hectares (3.9\u00a0million acres) of farmland was damaged and 40,900\u00a0heads of livestock were lost.[7][48] Collectively, 417\u00a0km (259\u00a0mi) of roadways washed away or sustained damage and 103\u00a0km (64\u00a0mi) of river embankments were lost. Total losses reached 7.81\u00a0billion RMB (US$944.6\u00a0million), nearly half of which took place in the industrial sector.[48] Typhoon Longwang was the deadliest storm to strike China in 2005 with 147\u00a0lives lost.[7] Reconstruction and restoration within Fujian Province began shortly after the storm's passage. By October\u00a06, power had been restored to most areas and roads were cleared.[49] On November\u00a013, five officers stationed at the barracks that was destroyed were punished as accountable for the deaths of the 85\u00a0cadets. Following an investigation by the Central Military Commission and State Council, all five were dismissed from their posts while Hou Yongjun, the director of the brigade, was to be prosecuted.[47]"

An upper-level analysis revealed a low to moderate wind shear environment. However, an upper-level low was impinging on the outflow on the northern side of the circulation. Despite this, the potential for development of a significant tropical cyclone was raised to \"good\" at August 25 22:00 UTC and a TCFA issued. The first warning was released at 26/0600 UTC when Tropical Depression 13W was located approximately 100\u00a0nmi west-southwest of Guam. It was upgraded to a 35-kn tropical storm by both JTWC and JMA on August 27 00:00 UTC, the tropical cyclone being assigned the name Talim.[citation needed] Tropical Storm Talim steadily intensified on 27 August as it moved on a general northwestward track along the southwestern periphery of a sub-tropical ridge. The tropical cyclone was raised to typhoon intensity at 0600 UTC 28 August when it was located approximately 690\u00a0nmi south-east of Okinawa. At this time, PAGASA christened the tropical cyclone: Isang after the storm had entered their AOR. Typhoon Talim continued to strengthen on 28 August while moving on a more westward heading and reached a peak intensity of 130\u00a0kn on August 29 18:00 UTC. After maintaining this strength for nearly 24 hours, a weakening trend began late on 30 August as the storm approached the island of Taiwan. Typhoon Talim made landfall near Hualien, Taiwan, on August 31 18:00 UTC with a MSW of 95\u00a0kn. From there, the cyclone crossed the Taiwan Strait and came ashore near Fuzhou, China, around September 1 06:00 UTC, the same time that it was downgraded to a 55-kn tropical storm. JTWC issued the final warning on the same day while JMA continued to maintain the system as a tropical storm, downgrading Talim to a tropical depression at September 2 06:00 UTC. The last statement issued by JMA was later that day.[citation needed]"

While growing considerably in size, Rita strengthened into a typhoon during the afternoon hours of the August\u00a021. Rita then accelerated to the north-northeast in response to a shortwave trough. Midday on August\u00a022, the typhoon reached its peak intensity, with winds of 145\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 965\u00a0mbar (28.5\u00a0inHg).

Quickly crossing central and northern Honshu, Rita veered slightly northward before weakening into a tropical storm early on August\u00a023. On the next day, Rita merged with a cold front before transiting into an extratropical cyclone. Heavy rains caused landslides and flash flooding that was responsible for extensive crop and property damage across Japan. The typhoon contributed to the worst flooding in Hokkaido in ten years.

Drifting first east then westward,[4] Rita was upgraded into a tropical storm the next day by both the JTWC and JMA,[6] based on Hurricane Hunter reports of storm-force winds.

Rita strengthened into a typhoon, the sixth of the season, on the afternoon of the August\u00a021 as the storm grew significantly in size, especially in the eastern semicircle.[4] After becoming a typhoon, Rita accelerated gradually in a north-northeasterly direction as a shortwave trough approached. Around this time, Rita became the second of seven tropical cyclones that season to be observed by Japanese radar. Midday on August\u00a021, the typhoon reached its peak intensity, with winds of 145\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 965\u00a0mbar (28.5\u00a0inHg).

Based on the extreme damage, the tornado was classified as a violent F4 on the Fujita scale by the National Weather Service.[1] The tornado started approximately 1.8 miles (2.9\u00a0km) north of Metamora, located eight miles (13\u00a0km) west of Roanoke, and lifted approximately 2.5 miles (4.0\u00a0km) southeast of Roanoke. The tornado moved roughly southeasterly for a distance of 9.6 miles (15.4 kilometers) over about 25 minutes.[1]"

This was attributed to preparations made during the construction of the plant and spotter training given to some of the workers.[3] Although no tornado sirens were heard at the plant before the tornado struck, an alarm sounded by one of the spotters allowed all the workers to move to storm shelters and ride out the storm.[3] Large steel beams from the Parsons plant were blown approximately 3\u20444-mile (1.2\u00a0km) away, and many of the employees' cars tossed into nearby cornfields. Three neighboring farmsteads were completely swept away, with only debris remaining in the basements. Trees were debarked, and farm machinery was thrown and mangled.[1]"

The plant owner's decision to include storm shelters in the building's design likely saved the lives of many employees.[3] Just as important, the early notice provided by the company storm-spotters allowed employees to reach the shelters before the storm struck.[1] The Parsons plant reopened in April 2005 with seven tornado shelters, five more than the original plant. Two local residents chased the tornado for much of its 23-minute duration. They produced a half-hour-long video that was sold in the Peoria area to help raise funds for employees of the Parsons plant, most of whom had lost their cars and were either underinsured or not insured. The Roanoke tornado was the most significant tornado of a small tornado outbreak which transitioned into a destructive derecho over an extensive area of the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys extending to the Gulf of Mexico. The outbreak produced three other tornadoes, all rated F0. The Roanoke 2004 Tornado was featured on The Weather Channel's Storm Stories and Full Force Nature.[4] The Parsons plant would come very close to being destroyed again during the Washington, IL Tornado on November 17, 2013, however, that tornado passed just northwest of the plant.[5]"

        "content": "Typhoon Mitag, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Mina, was a strong typhoon that caused deadly flooding in the Philippines in November 2007. As the twenty-fourth named storm and the fourteenth typhoon of the 2007 Pacific typhoon season, it originated from an area of atmospheric convection south-southwest of Guam. The area of convection was in a favorable environment for development, so it organized and a low-level circulation was found inside the disturbance. Not too long after, the JMA classified it as a tropical depression. On November 20, rainbands developed along the periphery of the depression as it moved into an area of good divergence. The JMA soon upgraded the depression to a tropical storm, designating it as Mitag. A few hours later, the JTWC issued their first advisory on Mitag, and so did PAGASA, naming it Mina. The storm strengthened significantly early on November 21 and became a further intensified. Later that day, the JTWC upgraded Mitag to a typhoon, and the JMA also upgraded it late that evening. As Mitag remained stationary for a day as a Category\u00a02-equivalent typhoon, it changed its trajectory. Nonetheless, PAGASA announced that there is still a possibility of the typhoon to once again change its course. The storm turned northwest and made landfall late on November 25. It tracked Luzon and was downgraded to a severe tropical storm before emerging back over water on November 26. It turned back to the east before reaching Taiwan, and became extratropical on November 27."

Located within a region of low wind shear and favoring good outflow, development of the system was anticipated over the following few days.[1] Later that day, a low-level circulation was discovered as the disturbance became increasingly organized.[2] Shortly thereafter, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a tropical depression.[3] Early on November\u00a020, convective banding features developed along the periphery of the depression as it moved into an area of good divergence.[4] Around 1200\u00a0UTC, the JMA upgraded the depression to a tropical storm, assigning it the name Mitag.[3] This name was contributed by Micronesia and translates to \"my eyes\" and is also a name for a Yap woman.[5] Several hours later, the JTWC issued their first advisory on Mitag, designating it as Tropical Storm 24W.[6] Around the same time, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) issued their first advisory on the system as it entered their area of responsibility. They dubbed Mitag with the local Philippine name of Mina at this time.[7] The storm strengthened significantly early on November 21 and became a severe tropical storm. Later that day, the JTWC upgraded Mitag to a typhoon, and the JMA also upgraded it late that evening. As Mitag remained stationary in the Philippine Sea for a day as a Category\u00a02-equivalent typhoon, it changed its course and instead of hitting Catanduanes and the Bicol Region, it will make a landfall at the Aurora-Isabela  area. Nonetheless, PAGASA announced that there is still a possibility of the typhoon to once again change its course. The storm turned northwest towards northern Luzon and made landfall late on November 25. It tracked across the island and was downgraded to a severe tropical storm before emerging back over water on November 26. It turned back to the east before reaching Taiwan, and became extratropical on November 27.[citation needed]"

Only a tropical storm at the time, the NDCC ordered the evacuation of nearly 3,000 people and opened at least ten evacuation centers. Immediate standby funds of PHP3.2\u00a0million (US$67,000) and relief goods worth PHP41.1\u00a0million (US$860,700) were placed in the National Resource Operations Center. Trucks supplied with a combined 4,000 packs of clothing and 100 tents were prepped for immediate distribution after the storm.[8] The Armed Forces of the Philippines placed five battalions, consisting of trucks, saws, boats, helicopters and naval ships to respond to reports of missing people and clear debris after the storm.[9] An estimated 300,000 people evacuated ahead of the storm from six provinces in Luzon. Roughly 15,000 people were also evacuated from Palanan. Hospital staff were placed on 24-hour standby to readily assist people injured by the storm.[10] Typhoon Mitag became the most significant storm to threaten the country since Typhoon Durian one year prior. Thousands of residents were evacuated throughout 40 regions. The Government of the United States was on standby in Okinawa to immediately deploy assistance in fear of another major disaster.[11] Roughly 30,000 people evacuated the Bicol Peninsula ahead of the storm. In Isabela province, 54,000 people were evacuated from low-lying areas prone to flooding. Trucks with relief items, such as food and medicine, were stocked and prepped for immediate deployment.[12] Over 2,000 residents were evacuated from Albay Province by November\u00a022.[13] Officials reported that nearly 654,000 people had to be evacuated from the province, especially those near the Mayon Volcano. In Legazpi City, Camalig, Daraga, and Guinobatan towns over 9,000 people were evacuated due to the threat of lahars. Over 6,000 families were evacuated from Polangui town. Officials stated that there were at least 180,000 people in Albay that were at risk of being impacted by storm surge from Typhoon Mitag. More than 200,000 families were evacuated from Camarines Sur Province. Already impacted by Typhoon Hagibis, disaster officials requested PHP67\u00a0million (US$1.4\u00a0million) in funds for both storms.[14] By November\u00a023, officials urged over one\u00a0million people to evacuate threatened areas as Typhoon Mitag was anticipated to become a very powerful typhoon.[15]"

        "content": " Lake-effect snow is produced during cooler atmospheric conditions when a cold air mass moves across long expanses of warmer lake water. The lower layer of air, heated by the lake water, picks up water vapor from the lake and rises through colder air. The vapor then freezes and is deposited on the leeward (downwind) shores.[1] The same effect also occurs over bodies of saline water, when it is termed ocean-effect or bay-effect snow. The effect is enhanced when the moving air mass is uplifted by the orographic influence of higher elevations on the downwind shores. This uplifting can produce narrow but very intense bands of precipitation, which deposit at a rate of many inches of snow each hour, often resulting in a large amount of total snowfall. The areas affected by lake-effect and parallel \"ocean-effect\" phenomena are called snowbelts. These include areas east of the Great Lakes in North America, the west coasts of northern Japan, Lake Baikal in Russia, and areas near the Great Salt Lake, Black Sea, Caspian Sea, Baltic Sea, Adriatic Sea, the North Sea and more. Lake-effect blizzards are the blizzard-like conditions resulting from lake-effect snow. Under certain conditions, strong winds can accompany lake-effect snows creating blizzard-like conditions; however, the duration of the event is often slightly less than that required for a blizzard warning in both the U.S. and Canada.[2] If the air temperature is low enough to keep the precipitation frozen, it falls as lake-effect snow. If not, then it falls as lake-effect rain. For lake-effect rain or snow to form, the air moving across the lake must be significantly cooler than the surface air (which is likely to be near the temperature of the water surface). Specifically, the air temperature at an altitude where the air pressure is 850 millibars (85\u00a0kPa) (roughly 1.5 kilometers or 5,000 feet vertically) should be 13\u00a0\u00b0C (23\u00a0\u00b0F) lower than the temperature of the air at the surface. Lake-effect occurring when the air at 850 millibars (85\u00a0kPa) is much colder than the water surface can produce thundersnow, snow showers accompanied by lightning and thunder (caused by larger amounts of energy available from the increased instability)."

Atmospheric lapse rate and convective depth are directly affected by both the mesoscale lake environment and the synoptic environment; a deeper convective depth with increasingly steep lapse rates and a suitable moisture level allow for thicker, taller lake-effect precipitation clouds and naturally a much greater precipitation rate.[3]"

Because most lakes are irregular in shape, different angular degrees of travel yield different distances; typically, a fetch of at least 100\u00a0km (60\u00a0mi) is required to produce lake-effect precipitation. Generally, the larger the fetch, the more precipitation produced. Larger fetches provide the boundary layer with more time to become saturated with water vapor and for heat energy to move from the water to the air. As the air mass reaches the other side of the lake, the engine of rising and cooling water vapor pans itself out in the form of condensation and falls as snow, usually within 40\u00a0km (25\u00a0mi) of the lake, but sometimes up to about 150\u00a0km (100\u00a0mi).[4]"

If directional shear between the surface and the height in the atmosphere at which the barometric pressure measures 700\u00a0mb (70\u00a0kPa) is greater than 60\u00b0, nothing more than flurries can be expected. If the directional shear between the body of water and the vertical height at which the pressure measures 700\u00a0mb (70\u00a0kPa) is between 30\u00b0 and 60\u00b0, weak lake-effect bands are possible. In environments where the shear is less than 30\u00b0, strong, well organized bands can be expected.[5] Speed shear is less critical but should be relatively uniform. The wind-speed difference between the surface and vertical height at which the pressure reads 700\u00a0mb (70\u00a0kPa) should be no greater than 40 knots (74\u00a0km/h) so as to prevent the upper portions of the band from shearing off. However, assuming the surface to 700\u00a0mb (70\u00a0kPa) winds are uniform, a faster overall velocity works to transport moisture more quickly from the water, and the band then travels much farther inland.[5]"

This reduces fetch distances. Secondly, the water temperature nears freezing, reducing overall latent heat energy available to produce squalls. To end the production of lake-effect precipitation, a complete freeze is often not necessary.[10] Even when precipitation is not produced, cold air passing over warmer water may produce cloud cover. Fast-moving mid-latitude cyclones, known as Alberta clippers, often cross the Great Lakes. After the passage of a cold front, winds tend to switch to the northwest, and a frequent pattern is for a long-lasting low-pressure area to form over the Canadian Maritimes, which may pull cold northwestern air across the Great Lakes for a week or more, commonly identified with the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Since the prevailing winter winds tend to be colder than the water for much of the winter, the southeastern shores of the lakes are almost constantly overcast, leading to the use of the term \"the Great Gray Funk\" as a synonym for winter.[citation needed] These areas allegedly contain populations that suffer from high rates of seasonal affective disorder, a type of psychological depression thought to be caused by lack of light.[11][citation needed]"

        "content": "Cold winds in the winter typically prevail from the northwest in the Great Lakes region, producing the most dramatic lake-effect snowfalls on the southern and eastern shores of the Great Lakes. This lake effect results in much greater snowfall amounts on the southern and eastern shores compared to the northern and western shores of the Great Lakes. The most affected areas include the Upper Peninsula of Michigan; Northern New York and Central New York; particularly the Tug Hill Region, Western New York; Northwestern Pennsylvania; Northeastern Ohio; southwestern Ontario and central Ontario; Northeastern Illinois (along the shoreline of Lake Michigan); northwestern and north central Indiana (mostly between Gary and Elkhart); northern Wisconsin (near Lake Superior); and West Michigan.[12] Lake-effect snows on the Tug Hill plateau (east of Lake Ontario) can frequently set daily records for snowfall in the United States. Tug Hill receives, typically, over 20 feet (240\u00a0in; 610\u00a0cm) of snow each winter.[13] The snowiest portions of the Tug Hill, near the junction of the towns of Montague, Osceola, Redfield, and Worth, average over 300 inches (760\u00a0cm) of snow annually.[14] From February 3\u201312, 2007, a lake-effect snow event left 141 inches (358\u00a0cm) of snow in 10 days at North Redfield on the Tug Hill Plateau.[15][16] Other examples major prolonged lake effect snowstorms on the Tug Hill include December 27, 2001, - January 1, 2002, when 127 inches (320\u00a0cm) of snow fell in six days in Montague, January 10\u201314, 1997, when 110.5 inches (281\u00a0cm) of snow fell in five days in North Redfield, and January 15\u201322, 1940, when over eight feet of snow fell in eight days at Barnes Corners.[16] Syracuse, New York, directly south of the Tug Hill Plateau, receives significant lake-effect snow from Lake Ontario, and averages 115.6 inches (294\u00a0cm) of snow per year, which is enough snowfall to be considered one of the \"snowiest\" large cities in America.[17][18] Lake Erie produces a similar effect for a zone stretching from the eastern suburbs of Cleveland through Erie to Buffalo.[19] Remnants of lake-effect snows from Lake Erie have been observed to reach as far south as Garrett County, Maryland, and as far east as Geneva, New York.[20] Because it is not as deep as the other lakes, Erie warms rapidly in the spring and summer, and is frequently the only Great Lake to freeze over in winter.[21] Once frozen, the resulting ice cover alleviates lake-effect snow downwind of the lake. Based on stable isotope evidence from lake sediment coupled with historical records of increasing lake-effect snow, global warming has been predicted to result in a further increase in lake-effect snow.[22] A very large snowbelt in the United States exists on the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, near the cities of Houghton, Marquette, and Munising. These areas typically receive 250\u2013300 inches (635\u2013762\u00a0cm) of snow each season.[23] For comparison, on the western shore, Duluth, Minnesota receives 78 inches (198\u00a0cm) per season.[24] Western Michigan, western Northern Lower Michigan, and Northern Indiana can get heavy lake-effect snows as winds pass over Lake Michigan and deposit snows over Muskegon, Traverse City, Grand Rapids, Kalamazoo, New Carlisle, South Bend, and Elkhart, but these snows abate significantly before Lansing or Fort Wayne, Indiana. When winds become northerly or aligned between 330 and 390\u00b0, a single band of lake-effect snow may form, which extends down the length of Lake Michigan. This long fetch often produces a very intense, yet localized, area of heavy snowfall, affecting cities such as La Porte and Gary.[25] Lake-effect snow is virtually unheard of in Detroit, Toledo, Milwaukee, Toronto, and Chicago, because the region's dominant winds are from the northwest, making them upwind from their respective Great Lakes, although they, too, have on extremely rare occasion seen small amounts of lake-effect snow during easterly or northeasterly winds. More frequently, the north side of a low-pressure system picks up more moisture over the lake as it travels east, creating a phenomenon called lake-enhanced precipitation.[25] However, a place like Altoona, Pennsylvania or Oakland, Maryland is far more likely to receive lake effect snow than either aforementioned location despite greater distance from the lakes, because of being on the leeward side of the lake. Because Southwestern Ontario is surrounded by water on three sides, many parts of Southwestern and Central Ontario get a large part of their winter snow from lake-effect snow.[26] This region is notorious for the whiteouts that can suddenly reduce highway visibility on North America's busiest highway (Ontario Highway 401)[27] from clear to zero. The region most commonly affected spans from Port Stanley in the west, the Bruce Peninsula in the north, Niagara-on-the-Lake to the east, and Fort Erie to the south. The heaviest accumulations usually happen in the Bruce Peninsula, which is between Lake Huron and Georgian Bay. So long as the Great Lakes are not frozen over, the only time the Bruce Peninsula does not get lake-effect snow is when the wind is directly from the south."

        "content": "The southern and southeastern sides of the Great Salt Lake receive significant lake-effect snow. Since the Great Salt Lake never freezes, the lake effect can influence the weather along the Wasatch Front year-round. The lake effect largely contributes to the 55\u201380 inches (140\u2013203\u00a0cm) annual snowfall amounts recorded south and east of the lake, and in average snowfall reaching 500 inches (13\u00a0m) in the Wasatch Range. The snow, which is often very light and dry because of the semiarid climate, is referred to as the \"Greatest Snow on Earth\" in the mountains. Lake-effect snow contributes to roughly six to eight snowfalls per year in Salt Lake City, with about 10% of the city's precipitation being contributed by the phenomenon.[28] On one occasion in December 2016, lake-effect snow fell in central Mississippi from a lake band off Ross Barnett Reservoir.[29] The West Coast occasionally experiences ocean-effect showers, usually in the form of rain at lower elevations south of about the mouth of the Columbia River. These occur whenever an Arctic air mass from western Canada is drawn westward out over the Pacific Ocean, typically by way of the Fraser Valley, returning shoreward around a center of low pressure. Cold air flowing southwest from the Fraser Valley can also pick up moisture over the Strait of Georgia and Strait of Juan de Fuca, then rise over the northeastern slopes of the Olympic Mountains, producing heavy, localized snow between Port Angeles and Sequim, as well as areas in Kitsap County and the Puget Sound region.[30] While snow of any type is very rare in Florida, the phenomenon of gulf-effect snow has been observed along the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico a few times in history. More recently, \"ocean-effect\" snow occurred on January 24, 2003, when wind off the Atlantic, combined with air temperatures in the 30\u00a0\u00b0F range, brought snow flurries briefly to the Atlantic Coast of northern Florida seen in the air as far south as Cape Canaveral.[31]"

It formed on August\u00a06, 2004, intensifying into a tropical storm on August\u00a08. Rananim gradually intensified, initially moving northward before turning to the northwest and attaining typhoon status. After developing a small eye, the typhoon attained peak winds of 150\u00a0km/h (93\u00a0mph) as it passed between Taiwan and Okinawa. On August\u00a012, Rananim moved ashore in China, and it dissipated three days later. The name Rananim means \"hello\" in the Chuukese language.[1] Impact outside of China was minimal and largely limited to heavy rains, although one death was reported in Taiwan. In the country, strong winds and heavy rainfall left heavy damage near the coast, as well as to farms further inland. Rananim destroyed 64,300\u00a0houses and damaged another 125,000.

        "content": "The origins of Typhoon Rananim were from an area of convection that persisted west-northwest of Guam in early August. The system tracked generally westward in an area of moderate wind shear, maintaining a weak circulation center.[1] On August\u00a06, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) estimated the system developed into a tropical depression.[2] Shortly before that time, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) initiated advisories on the system, giving it the name Karen.[3] Further convective organization occurred as the circulation consolidated, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert late on August\u00a06. The next day, the agency initiated advisories on Tropical Depression 16W about 780\u00a0km (480\u00a0mi) east of the Philippines island of Luzon. Subsequently, the depression maintained a northward track, due to its location along the northwest periphery of a near-equatorial ridge, as well as the presence of a tropical upper tropospheric trough. Although the circulation was broad, the winds intensified enough for the JMA to upgrade the depression to Tropical Storm Rananim on August\u00a08.[1] Upon intensifying into a tropical storm, Rananim had a better-defined circulation than earlier in its duration; however, the convection was displaced from the center. The structure gradually organized, with increasing outflow and convective symmetry. On August\u00a09, the storm turned toward the northwest due to a building ridge the northeast.[1] At 0600\u00a0UTC on August\u00a010, Rananim intensified into a typhoon about 715\u00a0km (444\u00a0mi) east-southeast of Taiwan.[2] Steady strengthening continued, and the storm passed about 365\u00a0km (227\u00a0mi) southwest of Okinawa early on August\u00a011.[1] Shortly thereafter, Rananim left the PAGASA area of warning responsibility.[3] A small eye became evident on satellite imagery, and late on August\u00a011 the JMA estimated the typhoon attained peak winds of 150\u00a0km/h (93\u00a0mph). The JTWC, however, assessed Rananim as intensifying slightly more despite decreased outflow, reaching peak winds of 165\u00a0km/h (103\u00a0mph).[1] After passing north of Taiwan, Rananim made landfall at peak intensity around 1300\u00a0UTC on August\u00a012, near Wenling in Zhejiang province in China. The China Meteorological Administration reported that the typhoon was the strongest to hit Zhejiang since Typhoon Sally in 1956.[1] Moving over land, the typhoon quickly weakened to tropical storm status as it turned toward the west. Early on August\u00a013, the JMA downgraded Rananim to a tropical depression and issued the last warning; by that time, the circulation was over Jiangxi.[1] The depression lasted another two days before dissipating over northwest Hunan.[2]"

It was estimated that about 30% of coastal houses were too weak to withstand the winds from the typhoon. In addition, officials ordered the closure of all restaurants and entertainment venues. Ferry service near Shanghai was disrupted,[7] and 9,900\u00a0ships were moved to safer areas.[1] In addition, several airports across the region were closed, including in Shanghai.[8] As it moved ashore in Zhejiang, Rananim produced widespread rainfall across the country, primarily along its path. 20\u00a0stations reported totals of over 300\u00a0mm (12\u00a0in),[9] including Yueqing where rainfall reached 703.5\u00a0mm (27.70\u00a0in) in 24\u00a0hours, setting a new record. Rananim also produced strong winds as it moved through the region, with a record-breaking gust of 211\u00a0km/h (131\u00a0mph) reported in the offshore Dachen Islands. Wenling City, where the typhoon moved ashore, reported a peak gust of 192\u00a0km/h (119\u00a0mph).[1] High waves were also observed as Rananim made landfall,[7] and a storm tide of 7.42\u00a0m (24.3\u00a0ft) in Haimen.[9] Upon moving ashore, Rananim destroyed hundreds of homes near the coast,[7] with destroyed traffic signs and billboards, as well as widespread flooding.[8] Strong winds caused widespread power outages and uprooted thousands of trees.[6][10] About 64,300\u00a0houses were destroyed,[11] and another 125,000 were damaged,[9] leaving thousands of people homeless.[12] Overall, the typhoon affected 75\u00a0counties,[13] with 302\u00a0villages isolated due to high water. The combination of strong winds and flooding left heavy crop damage,[14] killing 55,000\u00a0livestock, primarily cattle,[11] and affecting 4,000\u00a0km2 (1,500\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of fields;[15] an estimated 230\u00a0km2 (89\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of crops were destroyed.[9] The typhoon severely impacted the infrastructure along its path, with 1,163\u00a0km (723\u00a0mi) of roads damaged.[11] Further inland, the rains produced a landslide in Yueqing, which destroyed 52\u00a0houses and killed 25\u00a0people.[16] In Shanghai, about 145\u00a0km (90\u00a0mi) north of the landfall location, Rananim left little damage, although its rainfall alleviated a heat wave.[5] Across the country, damage was estimated at \u00a520.1\u00a0billion ($2.44\u00a0billion 2004\u00a0USD$, 3.94\u00a0billion 2024\u00a0USD), primarily in Zhejiang.[1] Overall, Rananim affected about 18\u00a0million people in China.[1] A total of 3,321\u00a0people were injured,[14] 185 of them seriously.[6] By the day after Rananim moved ashore, the death toll was estimated at 29,[7] although by the next day the total reached 115.[5] Four days after landfall, there were 147\u00a0known deaths,[15] which increased to 164 the following day.[11] The final death toll was set at 168, although 24\u00a0people were missing as of the last count.[1] Most of the deaths were from collapsed houses, with others due to flooding, landslides, or flying debris.[11]"

They used steel bars, ropes, and their hands to search through rubble for storm survivors. At the same time, utility crews worked to restore power and water in the affected areas.[12] A few weeks after the typhoon, an earthquake and another typhoon struck the same region as Rananim had, creating additional flooding, damage, and deaths.[13] The series of natural disasters stretched the resources of the local agencies,[5] although the local Red Cross was still able to provide food, clothing, and blankets. The agency also launched appeals for additional relief supplies.[13] The affected storm victims collectively received 50\u00a0tons of rice, 500\u00a0kg (1,100\u00a0lb) of pork, and 500\u00a0kg (1,100\u00a0lb) of salt, vegetables, and water.

        "content": "Forming in a similar region as Typhoon Chaba did nine days earlier, Typhoon Songda originated on August\u00a026 from an area of convection, or thunderstorms, east-northeast of Kwajalein in the Marshall Islands.[1] At 06:00\u00a0UTC that day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) assessed that a tropical depression developed.[2] The convection steadily organized and consolidated into rainbands around a well-developed circulation, aided by low wind shear.[1] At 11:30\u00a0UTC on August\u00a028, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center issued a tropical cyclone formation alert, and just 30\u00a0minutes later upgraded the system to Tropical Depression 22W.[3] Favorable conditions allowed the nascent system to quickly intensify.[1] At 00:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a028, the JMA upgraded the depression to a tropical storm,[2] naming it Songda. Moving west-northwestward around the subtropical ridge to the north, the storm passed north of the Marshall Islands. An eye began becoming visible on satellite imagery on August\u00a029,[1] prompting the JTWC to upgrade Songda to typhoon status at 12:00\u00a0UTC that day.[3] A day later, the JMA also upgraded the storm to typhoon status, and the agency estimated an initial peak intensity on August\u00a031 of 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph).[2] That day, the JTWC also estimated peak 1\u00a0minute winds of 230\u00a0km/h (145\u00a0mph), equivalent to a Category\u00a04 on the Saffir-Simpson scale.[3] Operationally, the JTWC estimated slightly higher winds and assessed Songda as a \"super typhoon\",[1] but it was revised downward.[3] The typhoon increased in size as it approached the Northern Marianas Islands (CNMI), which was struck by Typhoon Chaba a week prior. On August\u00a031, Songda turned more to the northwest, which spared the more populated islands of Saipan and Tinian.[1] On September\u00a01, the storm passed about 32\u00a0km (20\u00a0mi) northeast of Agrihan with 1\u00a0minute winds estimated at 233\u00a0km/h (145\u00a0mph).[4] Subsequently, the typhoon turned more to the west-northwest and weakened slightly. However, an increase in northward outflow caused the convection to deepen, resulting in Songda re-intensifying.[1] On September\u00a04, the JTWC again estimated peak 1\u00a0minute winds of 230\u00a0km/h (145\u00a0mph),[3] and the JMA assessed a peak 10\u00a0minute wind peak of 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph).[2] Around that time, Songda had turned to the northwest and had developed a symmetric eyewall.[1] At 08:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a05, the typhoon made landfall on the Japanese island of Okinawa while at peak intensity.[2] A break in the ridge steered Songda northward after the storm struck Okinawa. The storm gradually weakened, partly due to drier air, and accelerated northeastward on September\u00a06 toward western Japan.[1] At 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a07, Songda made landfall on Nagasaki in western Kyushu with 10\u00a0minute winds of 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph).[2] Influenced by an approaching shortwave trough, the storm raced into the Sea of Japan and weakened to tropical storm status. Late on September\u00a07, the JTWC issued their last advisory on Songda, noting that the storm was becoming extratropical.[3] The JMA declared Songda as fully extratropical at 00:00\u00a0UTC the next day while the storm was just west of Hokkaido;[2] at that time, the storm merged with a nearby non-tropical low and a cold front.[5] After a brief turn to the north, the storm moved northeastward over northern Hokkaido and southern Sakhalin and entered the Sea of Okhotsk. On September\u00a09, the remnants of Songda moved across the southern Kamchatka Peninsula before moving into the Bering Sea. Late on September\u00a010, the JMA stopped tracking the storm after Songda crossed the 180th meridian.[2][5] The storm continued eastward, entering the Gulf of Alaska on September\u00a011. Two days later, the system moved inland after weakening further.[5]"

The center passed about 310\u00a0km (190\u00a0mi) of Saipan \u2013 the commonwealth's center of population. On the island, wind gusts peaked at 61\u00a0km/h (38\u00a0mph), and rainfall reached 64\u00a0mm (2.5\u00a0in). Similar conditions occurred on Rota and Tinian to the south, with a peak gust of 79\u00a0km/h (49\u00a0mph) on Rota. On Pagan Island, Songda produced wind gusts of 174\u00a0km/h (108\u00a0mph) as well as 98\u00a0mm (3.84\u00a0in) of rainfall. Typhoon-force winds also affected Agrihan and Alamagan. In the northern islands of the CNMI, Songda destroyed all of the homes while defoliating the coconut and breadfruit trees. Damage was estimated at $500,000 (USD).[4] On September\u00a03, the storm came close enough to the Philippines to warrant monitoring from PAGASA,[nb 1] which named the storm Nina.[1] Monsoon-induced rainfall from Songda, in conjunction with Typhoon Aere in the South China Sea, caused flooding in portions of the Philippines. This led to landslides and traffic accidents, as well as eight deaths.[6] The outskirts of the typhoon dropped heavy rainfall in South Korea, with a peak 24-hour total of 112\u00a0mm (4.4\u00a0in) on the offshore island of Ulleungdo. On the mainland, Pohang recorded 110.5\u00a0mm (4.35\u00a0in) of rainfall over 24\u00a0hours.[1] Damage in the country was estimated at $250\u00a0million (USD).[7]"

In some places, the rains were enhanced by mountains, a process known as orographic lift.[11] The heaviest rainfall from Songda was 905\u00a0mm (35.6\u00a0in) in Morotsuka, Miyazaki on Kyushu, of which 513\u00a0mm (20.2\u00a0in) was reported in 24\u00a0hours. Significant rainfall totals occurred in short periods of time, including 78\u00a0mm (3.1\u00a0in) in Soeda, Fukuoka.[10] The heaviest damage was on Kyushu and western Honshu.[8] The high winds damaged many roofs, including that of newer public buildings, which accounted for a large portion of the damage.[8] Flooding affected 8,360\u00a0houses, and 42,183\u00a0homes sustained damage during the storm, of which 109 were completely destroyed. In addition to housing damage, Songda wrecked 104\u00a0ha (260 acres) of crop fields and damaged 1,592\u00a0ships. Overall, the typhoon killed 47\u00a0people in Japan and injured another 1,364, 205 of them severely. Damage nationwide were about JP\u00a5126.2 billion (US$1.15 billion) .[10] The typhoon first passed near Okinawa Prefecture. Nago recorded a minimum pressure of 924.4\u00a0mbar (27.30\u00a0inHg),[12] which was the lowest recorded during the storm's duration.[2] Minamidait\u014djima to the east of Okinawa registered a peak wind gust of 190\u00a0km/h (118\u00a0mph). Songda also dropped heavy rainfall on the island, peaking at 351\u00a0mm (13.8\u00a0in) on Mount Yonaha. High waves flooded six houses and inundated several roads, and one roof was damaged. Across the prefecture, 152\u00a0people evacuated, while air and sea travel was halted. The storm injured 16\u00a0people, one seriously, and left JP\u00a5880\u00a0million (US$8\u00a0million) in damage, mostly sugar cane losses.[12] In Nagasaki, the winds damaged the roof of a high school. A factory was damaged in \u014cmuta, Fukuoka.[8] Along western Honshu, Songda damaged the Yamaguchi Center for Arts and Media and the Kirara Genki Dome in Yamaguchi Prefecture.[8] Winds and strong waves heavily damaged the Itsukushima Shrine, a structure over water in Hiroshima that dates back to the 14th century.[9][13] The storm restrengthened while over the Sea of Japan, causing additional heavy damage by the time it reached Hokkaido.[8] High wind gusts knocked down trees and sign posts.[13] There, about 0.1% of the houses were damaged. High winds damaged the roof of a high school in Ebetsu.[8]"

Recurvature back to the north-northeast towards Japan ensued while the typhoon slowly weakened. Tokage made its closest approach to Okinawa late on October 19 when it was passed just to the south-southeast. The storm turned to the northeast as continued to accelerate as its extratropical transition began. Tokage made landfall over Tosa-Shimizu, near the southern tip of Shikoku, Japan still at typhoon strength.[2][3] By October 21, the cyclone weakened into a tropical storm 130\u00a0nm west of Tokyo, and later that day, the system completed the transition to a nontropical low.

        "content": " Typhoon Nanmadol, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Yoyong,[1] was the last of four consecutive tropical cyclones to strike the Philippines in 2004. A quickly moving system, Nanmadol brought heavy rainfall and strong winds over the same regions impacted by the previous storms, exacerbating flood conditions in Luzon and surrounding regions. Together Nanmadol and these systems accounted for around 1,000\u00a0deaths in the Philippines. The typhoon later became the first December tropical cyclone to strike Taiwan since record keeping began, bringing along with it heavy rain, which also affected nearby regions of eastern China. As an extratropical storm, Nanmadol brought gusty winds and rain to Japan. Nanmadol developed from an isolated area of convection south-southwest of Pohnpei that became classified as a tropical depression on November\u00a028. Within highly conducive conditions for development, the system reached tropical storm intensity the following day, followed by typhoon intensity on November\u00a030. Quickly pacing towards the north-northwest about the periphery of a nearby subtropical ridge, Nanmadol reached its peak intensity on December\u00a01 with winds of 165\u00a0km/h (103\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 935\u00a0mbar (hPa; 27.61\u00a0inHg).[nb 1] Shortly after, the typhoon made landfall at a similar intensity on Casiguran, Aurora, quickly moving over Luzon before reaching the South China Sea, where it recurved northward into hostile atmospheric conditions. Over the next few days, Nanmadol weakened and later transitioned into an extratropical cyclone near Taiwan on December\u00a04, whereafter it merged with another extratropical system. With the typhoon approaching landfall in an area still recovering from previous storms, relief agencies already servicing the region were forced to allocate additional resources to prepare for Nanmadol. Evacuation efforts assisted in moving almost 100,000\u00a0people into shelters. Effects from Nanmadol were most severe in Cagayan Valley, where 14\u00a0people were killed. Power outages were widespread across several islands. Overall, damage from the typhoon in the Philippines totaled \u20b12.23\u00a0billion (US$39.3\u00a0million).[nb 2][nb 3] Heavy rainfall, peaking at 1,090\u00a0mm (43\u00a0in), was documented in Taiwan. Agricultural damage in Taiwan alone reached NT$670\u00a0million (US$20.8\u00a0million). Similar effects were felt in Japan, where the remnants of Nanmadol produced record-breaking rainfall and wind. Damage was particularly significant in Aichi Prefecture, totaling JP\u00a569.8 million (US$680,000). Overall, Nanmadol resulted in 77\u00a0fatalities and US$60.8\u00a0million in damage across three countries."

With convection consolidating about a potential center of circulation,[1] the Japan Meteorological Agency\u00a0(JMA) classified the broad system as a tropical depression the following day.[2] Rapid development of storms and organization ensued following classification, spurred by favorable conditions. Tracking northwestward due to the presence of a nearby subtropical ridge to its north,[1] the depression continued to strengthen, reaching tropical storm intensity on November\u00a029 while 860\u00a0km (530\u00a0mi) south-southeast of Guam.[2][3] At this point the tropical cyclone was assigned the name Nanmadol.[1] Conducive atmospheric conditions around Nanmadol on November\u00a029 led to the development of a central dense overcast, followed shortly thereafter by the formation of an eye.[1] Nanmadol was upgraded to severe tropical storm intensity at 0000\u00a0UTC on November\u00a030 and became a typhoon twelve hours later,[2] tracking near Satawal, Woleai, and Yap State during this intensification phase.[1] Following the upgrade to typhoon status, intensification briefly slowed but continued soon thereafter. At 0600\u00a0UTC on December\u00a01, Nanmadol reached peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 165\u00a0km/h (103\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 935\u00a0mbar (hPa; 27.61\u00a0inHg), still east of the Philippines. The typhoon maintained this strength for roughly twelve hours before slightly weakening as it neared Luzon.[2] At approximately 1200\u00a0UTC on December\u00a02,[1] Nanmadol made landfall near Casiguran, Aurora with winds of 140\u00a0km/h (87\u00a0mph).[4] Due to the rapid motion of Nanmadol, the typhoon crossed Luzon in under six hours, emerging into the South China Sea before 1800\u00a0UTC on December\u00a02.[2] Though land interaction with the Philippines did not significantly affect the cyclone, a shortwave trough forced Nanmadol to sharply curve northward, bringing it into hostile atmospheric conditions within the Luzon Strait.[4] At 0000\u00a0UTC on December\u00a03, the JMA downgraded Nanmadol to severe tropical storm status.[2] Increased wind shear and the advection of dry air further weakened the tropical cyclone, and by midday on December\u00a03, the storm's center of circulation became decoupled from the rest of the convection.[1] At 2340\u00a0UTC that day, Nanmadol made landfall near Fangliao, Pingtung in Taiwan, becoming the first December tropical cyclone to strike the island in 108\u00a0years of record-keeping.[1][2] Roughly six hours later on December\u00a04, the JMA determined that Nanmadol had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone.[2] These remnants soon merged with another low-pressure area, creating a more powerful system that later tracked over Japan.[1]"

Some commercial flights traversing to and from Luzon were cancelled in addition to ferry service between the eastern Bicol Region and Manila, stranding hundreds of passengers.[5] Flight cancellations were primarily targeted at propeller aircraft as they were more susceptible to typhoon conditions.[6] This impacted ongoing relief efforts, as the Philippine Air Force's fleet of rescue planes were also grounded.[7] The impending storm also delayed the reopening of financial markets in Manila until December\u00a03.[8] President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo ordered for precautionary measures to be undertaken by agencies under the purview of the National Disaster Coordinating Council\u00a0(NDCC).[9] In response, the German Foreign Office allocated \u20ac50,000 (US$67,000) to assist in preparations for Nanmadol.[10] The Spanish Red Cross were forced to maintain relief supplies in the provinces of Aurora and Quezon in addition to managing ongoing relief efforts for regions impacted by Tropical Depression Winnie.[11] Individual Red Cross chapters were tasked with closely monitoring the movement of relief stockpiles during these preparatory measures.[12] The NDCC also called for the evacuation of persons in potentially affected areas.[5] Large-scale evacuations took place in Real, Quezon ahead of the approaching typhoon.[13] According to the NDCC, 97,238\u00a0persons were evacuated in the lead-up to Nanmadol's Luzon landfall, with nearly 40,000 evacuating from the Bicol Region.[14] However, the Office of Civil Defense documented the evacuation of approximately 168,000\u00a0civilians.[6] Government shelters initially made to house displaced residents due to previous storms were adjusted to accommodate additional refugees evacuating due to the typhoon.[15] In Catanduanes, 1,500\u00a0persons evacuated to these shelters.[16] Other evacuees sought refuge in well-constructed buildings, as was the case in Mercedes, Eastern Samar, where 2,000\u00a0civilians stayed inside a school.[6] In Taiwan, the Central Weather Bureau issued a land warning for the island in advance of the typhoon. Potential impacts, which would likely be enhanced by the East Asian Monsoon, prompted Taiwanese president Chen Shui-bian to postpone political marches and campaign rallies intended for the upcoming presidential elections.[17] In anticipation for the typhoon, schools and businesses in southern and eastern Taiwan were closed, along with the delaying of rail and air traffic. Kaohsiung International Airport was closed during the morning of December\u00a04.[18]"

The NDCC, however, noted 70\u00a0fatalities as a result of Nanmadol alone, coupled with 157\u00a0injuries.[1] The majority of deaths were associated with electrocutions or drownings.[20] Approximately 160,000\u00a0people were displaced as well.[17] Overall, the typhoon destroyed 10,457\u00a0households and damaged another 57,435.[1]  Damage was estimated at \u20b12.23\u00a0billion (US$39.3\u00a0million).[19] Precipitation peaked at 228\u00a0mm (9.0\u00a0in) in Daet, Camarines Norte, observed over a 24-hour period.[1] Even prior to the Philippine landfall of Nanmadol, ongoing relief operations were hampered by the storm's overreaching effects. Search and rescue helicopters failed to reach planned destinations, which was also due in part to the country's small helicopter fleet. A navy gunboat refitted as a relief ship headed for Real, Quezon was forced to turn back due to high waves onset by the approaching typhoon which swept potentially hazardous logs into sea.[6][21] The first Philippine provinces to be impacted by the typhoon were Albay and Catanduanes, which suffered power outages after strong winds tore down power lines.[22][23] One person was killed in Virac, Catanduanes after being electrocuted by a felled power line.[24] In order to prevent more widespread outages, electrical service in some locations was deliberately shut down. Landslides triggered by Nanmadol in Aurora killed 25\u00a0people.[25] On the Bicol Peninsula, eight fatalities occurred due to drowning, electrocution, or hypothermia.[26] In the aftermath of the typhoon, the Philippine Red Cross made a full emergency appeal for funding to assist in recovery from Nanmadol and preceding storms.[27] The Philippines government declared a state of calamity for fifteen provinces, cities, and municipalities. Medical personnel were deployed to mitigate potential outbreaks of disease and transport injured persons to hospitals. The NDCC distributed 14,065\u00a0sacks of rice worth roughly \u20b111\u00a0million (US$200,000).[19]"

Heavy precipitation associated with the typhoon was reported, peaking at 1,090\u00a0mm (43\u00a0in) in Pulowan. The highest documented 24-hour rainfall total was at a station in Hualien County, which recorded 907\u00a0mm (35.7\u00a0in) in that timeframe.[1] Power outages disrupted electrical supply to 26,588\u00a0households, and agricultural losses in Taiwan as a result of Nanmadol equated to NT$670\u00a0million (US$20.8\u00a0million). Two people were killed on the island. The typhoon's swath of rainfall also extended to East China, which was also climatologically abnormal. Rainfall in Fuzhou peaked at 52.3\u00a0mm (2.06\u00a0in), almost double the average for the month of December. In Zhejiang, rainfall peaked at 106\u00a0mm (4.2\u00a0in).[1] The extratropical remnants of Nanmadol brought record breaking rainfall and winds to Japan. A station in Shishikui, Tokushima received 269\u00a0mm (10.6\u00a0in) of rain, the highest amount documented in the country. Several other stations recorded rainfall totals in excess of 200\u00a0mm (7.9\u00a0in). Maximum sustained winds clocked at 88\u00a0km/h (55\u00a0mph) in Chiba, Chiba and Ojima, Tokyo, were the strongest ever recorded in December for those locations. The same station in Chiba clocked a wind gust at 176\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph), another record for the month of December and the highest reported wind gust in Japan from Nanmadol's remnants. A 145\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph) wind gust was recorded in Tokyo; this gust broke the record for the strongest gust recorded in the city since record-keeping began.[1] Offshore Kagoshima Prefecture, a ferry capsized in rough waters, killing five.[28] The captain of the ferry was later charged with professional negligence.[29] In Aomori Prefecture, widespread power outages resulted from the strong winds.[30] Heavy rains in Aichi Prefecture flooded several roads and damaged fisheries and agricultural land.

        "content": "Late on September 18, an area of convection was noted 510\u00a0miles east of Guam. On the 20th, Tropical Depression 25W organized out of this mass and was located just 35\u00a0miles southeast of Guam. 25W turned more westward and began to accelerate as it moved along the southern periphery of a warm-core ridge. On the 21st, the system was upgraded to Tropical Storm Meari. It intensified steadily while moving more northwestward. The system was upgraded to typhoon intensity by late on the 22nd. Typhoon Meari possessed a very asymmetric circulation, elongated somewhat to the north and northeast. Meari became a strong 100-kn/115\u00a0mph typhoon by late on the 23rd, and was assigned the name Quinta by PAGASA. After reaching 120\u00a0kn/140\u00a0mph on the 24th, its strength plateaued for the rest of the day. As it passed 70\u00a0miles south of Okinawa early on the 26th, Meari was slowly weakening. The cyclone ceased movement on the 27th about 170\u00a0miles west of Okinawa as it became lodged between two anticyclones. A slow northward drift began later that day and vertical wind shear associated with the subtropical jet stream began to take its toll on Meari. By the 29th, Meari was beginning its approach to the Japanese island of Ky\u016bsh\u016b. Typhoon Meari made landfall over the southern tip of Ky\u016bsh\u016b around midday local time with maximum sustained winds of 70\u00a0kn/80\u00a0mph. Meari weakened back into a tropical storm late on the 29th. The forward motion began to accelerate as Meari increasingly interacted with the westerlies. The system was followed until the 30th, when it became a nontropical low, which continued tracking eastwards through the north Pacific.[2]"

The lowest pressure measured during the passage of Meari was 975.5\u00a0mb, also at Kagoshima on the 29th. Three tornadoes were spawned in Japan, with two touching down in Okinawa Prefecture and one in Aichi Prefecture. The heaviest rains in Japan were saved for Osawe, where 904\u00a0mm fell between late on the 24th and the 30th, with 741\u00a0mm falling between late on the 28th and 29th. Reports indicate that at least 18\u00a0people died with several more reported missing as a result of Typhoon Meari. The worst affected areas were the prefectures of Mie and Ehime in Japan where torrential rains caused widespread flooding and mudslides destroyed several homes. Train and ferry services were suspended, stranding thousands of people.[3] Damages from the storm amounted to $798\u00a0million (2004 USD)."

It developed enough organization to be designated a tropical depression on August 19, about 400\u00a0miles west of Guam. From there, it moved northwest at 12\u00a0mph along the southwestern periphery of a mid-level steering ridge. The system reached tropical storm status on August 20, gaining the name Aere.[2] Aere subsequently crossed into the Philippine Area of Responsibility, and was assigned the name Marce. Tropical Storm Aere was upgraded to typhoon intensity on August 21, and its strength leveled off during August 21 and August 22. On August 23, the typhoon was briefly downgraded to a tropical storm due to vertical wind shear while located 200\u00a0miles south of Naha, Okinawa. Aere quickly regained typhoon status and maintained its intensity for the rest of August 23 and developed a 50-mile wide eye. The tropical cyclone reached its peak intensity of 85\u00a0kts (100\u00a0mph) late on August 24, when the pressure lowered to 955 mb.[citation needed] As the storm crossed the northern tip of Taiwan, it began to weaken. Typhoon Aere turned west-southwestward on August 25 and made its closest approach to Taipei, Taiwan, passing only 30\u00a0miles to the city's north. Aere turned southwestward later that day, a trajectory that carried the storm past Xiamen early the next day and close to Shantou later that day before weakening to tropical storm intensity. The remnants of Typhoon Aere remained a tropical depression until August 31.[citation needed]"

Early on September 25, six villages located in Gaoqiao Town, Yinzhou District, Ningbo City, were struck by a tornado triggered by Typhoon Aere. The tornado did cause some economic losses, but no casualties were reported.[citation needed] Preliminary statistics indicated that the typhoon had caused 2.485\u00a0billion yuan of direct economic losses and was responsible for two deaths in Fujian province. Aere also affected 3,479,900 residents in 421 towns of 48 counties of 6 cities in Fujian, where three cities were flooded, 10,100 houses were toppled, 236 embankments and thousands of water conservancy facilities were damaged.[citation needed] News sources to date indicate that Taiwan took the brunt of Typhoon Aere. Thirty-four people were killed as a result of the storm, and fifteen died as a mudslide buried a remote mountain village in the north of the island. Agricultural losses were estimated at 7.7\u00a0million New Taiwan dollars (US$313,000 in 2004, US$321,451 in 2005). Forty-three deaths in the Philippines were caused by heavy rains induced by the typhoon. Nearly 16,000\u00a0people were evacuated from homes engulfed in floodwaters. A swollen river near the northern province of Nueva Ecija blocked traffic on a main road and stranded hundreds of commuters overnight. Eight provinces in northern and central Luzon were most severely affected with 70% of the provinces under water at one point.[12] Observations over land with Aere were numerous. In the Ry\u016bky\u016b Islands, the lowest pressure observed was 960.9\u00a0mbar (hPa) at Ishigakijima, which received 314.5\u00a0mm of rainfall between the 23rd and 25th. Ishigakijima, Okinawa, spent as long as eight hours within Aere's eye, which was about 110 kilometers (68\u00a0mi) in diameter at the time. In China, the typhoon made four landfalls; one being in the mainland of Fujian Province, and two others were when passed over at least two of the Fujian islands, including Pingtan Dao (Fuzhou City) and Nanri Dao (Putian City). Fuding (located in Ningde City) reported the highest amount in Fujian province with 663\u00a0mm. Xiyang and Nanri received the highest wind gusts, with east-northeast winds of 98\u00a0mph (43.8\u00a0m/s) on August 25 and northwest winds of 98\u00a0mph (43.8\u00a0m/s) early in the morning of the 25th.

        "content": "Typhoon Ma-on originated from a weak low-pressure area accompanied by persistent convection, or thunderstorms, north-northwest of Guam on September\u00a029, 2004. Though environmental conditions featured weak wind shear and modest diffluence, favoring tropical cyclogenesis, the convection was cyclical and the system did not develop much over the following two days. Over the first three days of October, organization fluctuated as semi-persistent convection appeared over the circulation center. On October\u00a03, a QuikScat satellite pass revealed a well-developed circulation while a ship 555\u00a0km (345\u00a0mi) south of the low reported 45\u00a0km/h (28\u00a0mph) winds.[1] The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began monitoring the low as a tropical depression at 06:00\u00a0UTC.[2] Twelve hours later, the depression crossed 135\u00b0E and entered the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration's (PAGASA) area of responsibility, receiving the local name Rolly from the agency.[1] Becoming nearly stationary, the system turned due north late on October\u00a03. At 00:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a04, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified the system as Tropical Depression 26W; the newly designated cyclone was situated over the Philippine Sea roughly 1,145\u00a0km (711\u00a0mi) west-northwest of Guam at this time.[3] Six hours later, both the JMA and JTWC analyzed the depression and concluded it had become a tropical storm; the JMA assigning it the name Ma-on.[1][2][3] Slow organization of Ma-on ensued over the following two days as it moved north and later northwest along the edge of a high-pressure area.[1] The JTWC estimated Ma-on to have reached typhoon status around 06:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a06,[3] with the JMA following suit 12\u00a0hours later.[2] Synoptic patterns changed dramatically on October\u00a07 as a trough emerged off the coast of East China and prompted Ma-on to turn northeast. Simultaneously, it provided a greatly enhanced poleward outflow channel toward Japan. The shift in motion was also accompanied by a period of rapid intensification, with a well-defined eye forming.[1] Over the 24\u00a0hour-period from 18:00 to 18:00\u00a0UTC October\u00a06\u20137, Ma-on's barometric pressure dropped from 965\u00a0mb (hPa; 28.50\u00a0inHg) to 920\u00a0mb (hPa; 27.17\u00a0inHg). The end of this phase marked the peak intensity of the typhoon, with winds reaching 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph).[2] The JTWC estimated Ma-on to have been a significantly stronger storm with one-minute sustained winds topping out at 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph) at 00:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a08. This ranked it as a Category\u00a05-equivalent typhoon on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale. They also assessed the pressure to have decreased to 898\u00a0mb (hPa; 26.52\u00a0inHg).[3] Not long after reaching this intensity, Ma-on's eye began to shrink and become ragged. Acceleration to the northeast, with its forward speed reaching 54\u00a0km/h (34\u00a0mph), ensued throughout the day and weakening ensued. Convection became increasingly asymmetric with dry air impinging on the southwestern semicircle, indicating the beginning of extratropical transition. The typhoon made landfall along the Izu Peninsula of Japan around 07:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a09, with winds of 150\u00a0km/h (93\u00a0mph) and a central pressure of 950\u00a0mb (hPa; 28.06\u00a0inHg).[1][2] The JTWC estimated Ma-on to have been a Category\u00a03-equivalent with one-minute sustained winds of 195\u00a0km/h (121\u00a0mph).[3] Roughly six hours after striking Japan, the rapidly weakening typhoon re-emerged over the Pacific Ocean. The system completed its extratropical transition later on October\u00a09 as it weakened below typhoon intensity.[1][2] After losing a defined low-level circulation early on October\u00a010,[2] Ma-on's the remnant trough continued eastward across the North Pacific. More than a week later, by October\u00a018, the storm moved over the Bering Sea and began to intensify rapidly as conditions favored bombogenesis of the baroclinic system.[4] It is not certain whether this system was predominantly the remnants of Ma-on or another non-tropical system which had its origins near Norway and traversed Eurasia.[5] Regardless of its dominant origin the storm moved across the central Aleutian Islands with a pressure of 978\u00a0mb (hPa; 28.88\u00a0inHg) on October\u00a017 and doubled back to the west throughout the next day. As it moved over the Gulf of Anadyr, it quickly deepened to an exceptionally powerful 941\u00a0mb (hPa; 27.79\u00a0inHg). The intensification resulted from the influx of warm, moist air directly associated with the remnants of Ma-on combining with cold air from an upper-level low over the Russian Far East being entrained into the southeastern portion of the circulation. Winds up to typhoon-force occurred over a large swath of the Bering Sea and portions of western coastal Alaska. Situated 640\u00a0km (400\u00a0mi) west of Nome, Alaska, the powerful storm subsequently weakened and slowed on October\u00a019. By October\u00a020, the system filled to 980\u00a0mb (hPa; 28.95\u00a0inHg) low and reached a position 640\u00a0km (400\u00a0mi) west of Kotzebue, Alaska.[6] Over the subsequent four days, the low meandered in the same general area and was last noted on October\u00a024.[7]"

        "content": "As Typhoon Ma-on began turning to the north on October\u00a08 towards Japan, the JMA warned residents in the T\u014dkai, Kansai, and Shikoku regions of heavy rain.[8] Meteorologists warned it would likely become the strongest storm to strike the Kant\u014d region in at least a decade.[9] Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways cancelled 262\u00a0flights collectively on October\u00a09, affecting 53,000\u00a0passengers.[10] Overall, 380\u00a0domestic and 72\u00a0international flights were cancelled because of Ma-on.[11] The Central Japan Railway Company temporarily suspended service for the entire T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen line, which travels from Tokyo to Shin-\u014csaka. Mandatory evacuation orders were issued for 3,528\u00a0families across five prefectures, while a further 1,600\u00a0families voluntarily evacuated from 13\u00a0others.[10] Voluntary evacuations also took place on Minamidait\u014djima.[12] Practice and qualifying runs for the 2004 Japanese Grand Prix at the Suzuka Circuit, initially scheduled for October\u00a09, were suspended until the following day.[13] Play at the Japan Open was suspended briefly because of the rain from the storm.[14] Typhoon Ma-on was the eighth of a record-breaking ten landfalling typhoons in Japan during the 2004\u00a0season.[15] Of these storms, Ma-on was the only system to strike eastern areas of the nation directly and the second-strongest, with a landfall pressure of 950\u00a0mb (hPa; 28.06\u00a0inHg).[16][17] Collectively, these storms resulted in 214\u00a0fatalities and over 2,000\u00a0injuries. Widespread and extensive damage to housing and infrastructure occurred with well over 200,000\u00a0homes damaged or destroyed and financial losses in excess of \u00a5564\u00a0billion (US$5\u00a0billion).[16] The typhoon produced record-breaking wind across the Izu Peninsula when it made landfall on October\u00a09.[1] The most intense winds of more than 215\u00a0km/h (134\u00a0mph) were confined to areas along Sagami Bay, about 40\u00a0km (25\u00a0mi) southeast of Tokyo. Contrary to most tropical cyclones, which see their strongest winds in the right-front quadrant, these winds occurred along the backside of Typhoon Ma-on. As the storm passed through, a low level jet formed along the east edge of the Kanto Mountains and facilitated an extreme gap flow event.[15][18] A peak gust of 243\u00a0km/h (151\u00a0mph) was measured in Ir\u014dzaki; sustained values reached 142\u00a0km/h (88\u00a0mph) in Ajiro. Record high gusts were observed in Ir\u014dzaki, Ajiro, and Ojima, while record high sustained winds occurred in Ajiro, Haneda, and Ojima.[1] The extreme gap flow event resulted from the warm air associated with Ma-on moving over the relatively cool air over the Kanto Plain. As the backside of the storm moved through, northerly winds pushed the cooler air south and allowed it to extend to higher altitudes as it paralleled the mountains along the west side of the plains. Model simulations of the event indicated that without the mountains, winds would have been no more than 126\u00a0km/h (78\u00a0mph) in the same areas.[15] Torrential rains accompanied the storm, with several areas reporting rainfall rates in excess of 60\u00a0mm (2.4\u00a0in) per hour. A local record of 89\u00a0mm (3.5\u00a0in) per hour was measured in Omaezaki, Shizuoka, which contributed to a 24-hour record of 360\u00a0mm (14\u00a0in) at the same station. Storm total values peaked in Omaezaki at 413\u00a0mm (16.3\u00a0in) over a three-day period;[1] measurements in excess of 300\u00a0mm (12\u00a0in) were confined to Aichi, Chiba, Kanagawa, Shizuoka, and Yamanashi prefectures. Enhanced precipitation affected areas well to the west of Ma-on, such as in Okinawa Prefecture where up to 190\u00a0mm (7.5\u00a0in) fell in Motobu.[19] Landslides triggered by the heavy rains caused widespread disruptions in the nation as well as one fatality in Kamakura, Kanagawa.[20] Chiba and Kanagawa Prefectures were particularly hard-hit. Nearly 500\u00a0collective landslides affected the prefectures, damaging homes and paralyzing traffic.[20][21] Part of National Route 19 was blocked and two buildings were damaged by a slide in Nagano Prefecture.[22] A landslide in Niisato, Iwate, blocked portions of a road and prompted voluntary evacuations.[23] Two landslides and flooding caused a few road closures in Miyagi Prefecture.[24] Slides occurred as far west as Nara and Okinawa. One shut down a 2\u00a0km (1.2\u00a0mi) stretch of road in Hokkejicho while three occurred in Nago.[12][25] Approximately 180,000\u00a0Tokyo Electric customers lost power during the storm.[13] In Minamiizu, Shizuoka, a power pole struck a man downed by high winds and later died at the hospital.[11] Extensive agricultural and infrastructural damage occurred in Fukushima Prefecture, where losses amounted to \u00a53.4\u00a0billion[26] Agricultural losses in Chiba amounted to \u00a51.2\u00a0billion.[21] Widespread disruptions to rail service in eastern Japan resulted from the typhoon. Service along the Tokyo Metro Namboku Line subway suspended due to flooding at the Azabu-J\u016bban Station. Flooding and heavy rains prompted suspensions of the Saiky\u014d, Keiy\u014d, T\u014dhoku Shinkansen, J\u014detsu Shinkansen, Nagano Shinkansen, and Keihin-T\u014dhoku lines. Trains along the Tokyo Monorail and express lines from the Odakyu Electric Railway and Keikyu were also interrupted. Additionally, a landslide struck a portion of the Ch\u016b\u014d Main Line.[11] A train derailed in Yamanashi Prefecture due to debris on the track.[27] In Gunma Prefecture a man was injured after being blown off his roof in \u014cta while trying to repair a gutter. A few homes were flooded and damage in the prefecture amounted to \u00a541.2\u00a0million.[28] One person sustained minor injuries in Tokorozawa. Flooding in Saitama Prefecture affected 1,562\u00a0homes, 159\u00a0severely, and hundreds of roads were left impassible. In Iwatsuki, the Ayase River overflowed its banks and prompted the evacuation of 74\u00a0people. Damage to agriculture and forestry amounted to \u00a5253.5\u00a0million.[29] Six people were injured, one seriously, in Ibaraki Prefecture, by high winds. Numerous landslides occurred, some of which blocked rivers and caused flooding; others blocked rail lines. A total of 191\u00a0homes were affected by floods, 53\u00a0of which sustained damage. In terms of agriculture, 4,606\u00a0ha (11,380 acres) of crops flooded and losses reached \u00a5866\u00a0million.[30] A car carrying four people was swept away by a landslide in Fujikawa; however, the occupants were unharmed. Landslides and flooding caused numerous disruptions to transportation. Damage amounted to \u00a51.5\u00a0billion in Yamanashi Prefecture.[31] Landslides and flooding caused extensive damage in Aichi Prefecture. Damage to agriculture and forestry amounted to \u00a5391\u00a0million.[32] Two people were killed and eighteen others were injured in Chiba Prefecture. Roughly 1,100\u00a0homes were affected by flooding, some of which sustained damage. Evacuations orders were issued for 1,703\u00a0households across 14\u00a0municipalities. Property and infrastructure sustained extensive damage in Shizuoka Prefecture. A total of 165\u00a0homes collapsed while 244\u00a0more were partially destroyed. Four people were killed and one hundred others were injured. Water and power utilities were severely affected, with losses exceeding \u00a51\u00a0billion collectively.[33] In Tokyo Prefecture, on the island of K\u014dzu-shima, 48\u00a0homes were evacuated during the storm. Flooding affected over 1,000\u00a0homes in Tokyo former, with 24\u00a0structures being destroyed. In Kanagawa Prefecture, a landslide killed one person in Kamakura while 43\u00a0others were injured throughout the prefecture. Nearly 200\u00a0landslides across the prefecture shut down large stretches of highway and rail lines, paralyzing public transportation. More than 2,400\u00a0homes were affected by flooding, though only three were destroyed.[34] Additional, though minor, damage occurred in Akita,[35] Aomori,[36] Gifu,[37] Mie,[38] Niigata,[39] Shimane,[40] Tochigi,[41] Wakayama,[42] and Yamagata prefectures.[43]\nAccording to the Fire and Disaster Management Agency (FDMA), 135\u00a0homes were destroyed while 4,796\u00a0sustained damage. Another report from Rika Nenpyo indicated far greater damage: 5,553\u00a0homes destroyed and 7,843\u00a0others damaged. Relative to the intensity of the storm, however, casualties were low with seven-nine fatalities and 169\u00a0injuries.[44] Total damage from the storm amounted to \u00a568.6\u00a0billion (US$603\u00a0million).[45] Insurance payouts amounted to \u00a527.2\u00a0billion (US$241\u00a0million) in the wake of the storm.[44]"

        "content": "The powerful extratropical remnants of Ma-on resulted in extensive damage along the west coast of Alaska in mid-October. Winds of 80 to 129\u00a0km/h (50 to 80\u00a0mph) battered many towns and fueled a damaging storm surge. At the Red Dog mine, a measurement of a 183\u00a0km/h (114\u00a0mph) gust was noted by the observer; however, this value was pegged as questionable and the highest verified gust was 124\u00a0km/h (77\u00a0mph). Other notable measurements include 114\u00a0km/h (71\u00a0mph) at Tin City, 110\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph) in Skookum Pass and Savoonga, 97\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph) in Golovin, and 95\u00a0km/h (59\u00a0mph) in Nome. The greatest storm surge occurred in areas without measuring capabilities, though a peak of 3.0 to 3.7\u00a0m (10 to 12\u00a0ft) was estimated in Shishmaref and 2.4 to 3.0\u00a0m (8 to 10\u00a0ft) in Kivalina. Nome itself was affected by a 3.19\u00a0m (10.45\u00a0ft) surge while Diomede and Teller had estimated values of 1.8 to 2.4\u00a0m (6 to 8\u00a0ft).[6] Record high water rises occurred at Nome and Red Dog Dock, peaking at 4.12 and 3.2\u00a0m (13.5 and 10.5\u00a0ft) respectively. The value in Nome exceeded the previous record of 3.7\u00a0m (12\u00a0ft) in October\u00a01992; however, the measurement at Red Dog Dock was surpassed just over two months later.[46] Little precipitation accompanied the system, with only Coldfoot reporting snow accumulations of 18\u00a0cm (7\u00a0in).[6] Nome suffered the brunt of damage from the cyclone, with most structures along the coast sustaining damage.[47] Forty-five residents had to be evacuated at the height of the storm.[6] Front Street flooded entirely and resembled a \"war zone\" according to residents. Most buildings in the area had their windows blown out from high winds except for those boarded with plywood. Some businesses had up to 0.91\u00a0m (3\u00a0ft) of water in their basement. Valves on three 450\u00a0kg (1,000\u00a0lb) propane tanks broke off during the storm at businesses on Front Street, prompting police to evacuate the area and the adjacent streets. Power was cut as a precautionary measure because of flammable gas.[47] Strong winds in Wales caused a 300-gallon fuel spill when a metal support at the village clinic toppled, rupturing the fuel line.[6] Large waves caused havoc across the Seward Peninsula. Erosion in Elim destroyed a local road and exposed the city's septic tanks and main water line. Shishmaref experienced some loss of sand, though recently constructed ripraps spared the area from significant damage.[47] Most affected areas had damage to power poles, with only coastal regions sustaining structural impacts. Losses throughout the state was conservatively estimated at $20\u00a0million.[6] In the aftermath of the storm, on November\u00a016, President George W. Bush signed a disaster declaration for the Bering Strait Regional Education Attendance Area and the Northwest Arctic Borough. Funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency was made available to residents in these areas as well as the city of Mekoryuk.[48] Public assistance teams were deployed to Nome and Unalakleet on November\u00a019 to establish a base of operations for relief and assess the impact of the storm. Visits to smaller communities throughout the affected region were planned as well.[49] At the end of November, the disaster declaration expanded to include Chevak, the Pribilof Islands Regional Education Attendance Areas, and communities along the Lower Kuskokwim and Lower Yukon rivers.[50]"

The government has insisted that technological upgrades are being instituted to improve the country's virtually non-existent weather-warning system. The tornado originated in Chitwan National Park and followed a path 200\u2013250 metres (220\u2013270\u00a0yd) wide and 30 kilometres (19\u00a0mi) long through several villages in Bara and Parsa districts, accompanied by rain, hail and thunderstorm.[4] The tornado was later determined to have been strong, estimated to have been of EF2 or EF3 strength.[5][3] A humanitarian crisis ensued in the impoverished rural farming communities affected by the disaster. Emergency aid and response began soon after, with the Nepalese Army and Nepal Red Cross Society distributing supplies, while hospitals in the affected areas were overwhelmed with the number of injuries. Relief worth millions of rupees were announced for the victims in the aftermath of the tragedy.[3] The government of Nepal also paid for the health expenses of all injured.[6]"

        "content": "Prior to the 2019 event, no tornado had ever been officially confirmed in Nepal; the lack of such events is reflected by the Nepali language not having a word for \"tornado\".[2] However, elderly residents in the Terai have a Maithili and Hindi word for tornado: chakrawat.[7] Nepal has a limited meteorological network and records of past weather events are sparse. Some parts of the country had no log of data prior to 1956. In that year the India Meteorological Department established weather stations, later turning over responsibility to the Nepalese government in 1966. Concerted efforts to steadily expand the observation network began in the 1980s, with 60\u00a0rain gauges established by 1985.[8] In 2019, the government built a Doppler weather radar in Surkhet and had plans for two more.[9] Usage of weather balloons was also being tested. Hirohiko Ishikawa, a meteorologist at the Disaster Prevention Research Institute of Kyoto University stated there is a possibility of unrecorded tornadoes in the plains of southeastern of Nepal.[2] A plausible tornado was reported in February\u00a01968: a weather observer recalled a 120\u00a0m (390\u00a0ft) diameter \"pillar of dust and rain\" that traveled 0.80\u00a0km (0.5\u00a0mi) and caused extensive crop damage.[8] Kiran Nepal of the Nepali Times asserts that the 2019 tornado was not the first of its kind and that prior events documented in literature and folklore were overlooked by media.[10] The Ganges Basin to the south of Nepal occasionally sees tornadoes.[2] Tornadoes in this region are most common during the pre- and post-monsoon months.[11] The United States' National Centers for Environmental Information highlights an increased likelihood of tornadoes from Ganges Basin northwest along the southern slopes of the Himalayas, through Nepal, and into northeastern Pakistan.[12] Reports of tornadoes in this region are primarily clustered in Bangladesh, with only sporadic events farther northwest.[11] The pre-monsoon months (March to May) display the most favorable conditions for severe weather. During this time, convective available potential energy\u2014an indicator of atmospheric instability whereby higher values denote a greater likelihood of thunderstorms\u2014and wind shear are conducive to the development of rotating thunderstorms.[13] Some of the deadliest tornadoes on record occur in these areas; one such tornado in 1989 killed an estimated 1,300\u00a0people in Bangladesh's Manikganj District.[14] Before the tornado on March 31, the meteorological division of Nepal had issued a general forecast of possible rain for a large region, but it lacks the ability to determine the exact nature, strength or location of an incoming storm.[1] The Indian Department of Meteorology had also issued a warning against strong winds in the neighbouring areas across the border.[15] The rural farming communities hit by the storm live mostly in huts made of mud, grass and bamboo sticks.[16] Electric transmission lines have been built to pass through residential areas or vice versa with little regard for safety and regulations. On the evening of the storm, most of the families were gathered in their homes and getting ready for dinner. Some people were still on the road trying to make it home."

Traveling along a 90\u00a0km (56\u00a0mi) path\u2014 30\u00a0km (19\u00a0mi) of it visible from space[17]\u2014and reaching a maximum width of 200\u00a0m (660\u00a0ft), it ravaged many rural communities in the two districts for a half hour, wreaking havoc.[6] Hardest-hit were the villages of Bharbalia, Parwanipur, and Pheta in Bara.[2] A total of 1,273\u00a0homes were destroyed and a further 1,348 sustained damage. Many of these homes were poorly constructed, though multiple well-built masonry homes were completely destroyed as well. The majority of damage took place in Bara where 1,183\u00a0homes were destroyed.[18] In some instances, concrete slabs were shifted 50\u00a0m (160\u00a0ft) and cars were blown away. Numerous trees were snapped and denuded, and a mosque was leveled.[2] In Pheta rural municipality of Bara district alone, 26 people lost their lives from falling bricks and roofs, being buried under rubble or getting crushed by uprooted trees, electric poles or pylons. Many more were injured on the road when buses and private transports were blown or toppled over.[1] Many families lost their food stock, clothes and other essentials in the rubble when their homes were destroyed.[16] Official figures put the death toll at 28 (27 in Bara and 1 in Parsa)[19] The actual numbers were reported to be as high as 50. The tornado also injured 1,176 people and a total of 3,291 families were reported affected.[20] 1,505 hectares (3,720 acres) of crops were destroyed and 2,231 hectares (5,510 acres) were damaged. Dozens of livestock and 5,000\u00a0hens were killed. Total damage from the tornado and the parent thunderstorm reached Rs.90\u00a0million (US$800,000).

Medical teams from Nepal army, the Red Cross and local hospitals treated the injured.[6] The provincial  government announced cash relief worth 300,000 rupees per casualty to the surviving family members of each dead. It also urged the federal government to announce a state of emergency in the affected areas.[1][6] The prime minister inspected the damage by visiting the affected areas.[6] The Government of Nepal declared a state of emergency on 1\u00a0April 2019.[22] The Nepalese Army placed a helicopter on standby for relief efforts soon after the tornado; however, continued bad weather inhibited its use. Two ground units were deployed with aid and reached affected communities on the morning of 1\u00a0April.[23] The Ministry of Home Affairs provided 468\u00a0sets of tents and tarpaulins and 4,138\u00a0units of clothing.

Floor mattresses were used to accommodate additional victims.[23] Kalaiya Hospital in Bara, which was understaffed and without power, received 354\u00a0patients; two spinal injury victims were transferred to Kathmandu and eight with head injuries were moved to Birganj.[10] Mountain Heart Nepal established a clinic in Kalaiya and treated 160\u00a0people by 4\u00a0April.[26] The Parsa chapter of the NRCS collected 300\u00a0pints of blood from donation centers to support injury treatment.[24] Humanity & Inclusion distributed mobility aid to assist victims with rehabilitation.[27] Doctors at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division noted an increased risk of diseases with people left homeless, a lack of clean water, dead animals out in the open, and an abundance of mosquitos.[19] Numerous irregularities were observed in the distribution of relief materials to the affected villages. Consequently, District Administration Office of Bara had to enforce stringent measures. Many of the victims reported that they never received any relief while the influential people had hogged all the relief materials intended for them.[28] Victims were critical of famous people flying into affected regions to take selfies of themselves distributing relief goods. The Pathlaiya-Birganj road became gridlocked with people bringing in aid and/or coming in to see the damage firsthand.[9] Members of the Canadian Centre for International Studies and Cooperation in Nepal assisted in damage assessment and the needs of victims.[22] With assistance from the Government of Australia and the United Nations Population Fund, WOREC Nepal established psychosocial counseling for women in Devtaal, Parwanipur, Pheta and Suvarna.[20]"

Vertical wind shear was also very low at around 5 knots, which was favorable for intensification.[12] The JMA upgraded Damrey to a typhoon early on November 3.[13] Three hours later, the JTWC followed suit and classified it as a Category 1-equivalent typhoon,[14] after animated satellite imagery depicted a \"strengthening\" system and a well-defined circular eye like feature.[15] At this stage, Damrey was located in conditions of low shear and warm sea-surface temperatures of 27\u201328\u00a0\u00b0C (81\u201382\u00a0\u00b0F) with good outflow.[16] The JMA had already declared that Damrey reached its peak intensity with 10-minute sustained winds of 130\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 970 hPa.[17] Six hours later, microwave images showed the eye becoming well-defined and an improved storm structure with a large centralized convective mass occluding to its center.[18] By 21:00 UTC, the JTWC upgraded Damrey to a Category 2-equivalent typhoon, reaching its peak strength with 1-minute sustained winds of 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph).[19] The JTWC issued their final advisory on the typhoon on 03:00 UTC on November 4, as it made landfall in V\u1ea1n Ninh District, Kh\u00e1nh H\u00f2a Province, Vietnam. While over land, its convective structure began to deteriorate,[20] and three hours later the JMA downgraded Damrey to a severe tropical storm,[21] then to a tropical storm.[22] The JMA issued their final advisory on 12:00 UTC on November 4.[23] The agency continued to track the system as it fully dissipated on 00:00 UTC on November 5.[24]"

        "content": " Typhoon Soudelor, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Egay,[1] was a powerful typhoon that underwent rapid deepening east of Taiwan in the 2003 Pacific typhoon season. It was the sixth named storm by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) of the season, as well as the third typhoon. It formed on June\u00a012 from a disturbance in the monsoon trough, located east of the Philippines. The system moved generally to the northwest after its genesis, gradually intensifying into a tropical storm. While offshore the Philippines, Soudelor dropped heavy rainfall that caused flooding and left thousands homeless. The storm caused $2.46\u00a0million in damage,[nb 1] and 12\u00a0deaths. After affecting the Philippines, Soudelor moved into an area of low wind shear and with favorable outflow. It became a typhoon on June\u00a017, and quickly developed an eye while rapidly intensifying. The storm struck the Japanese island of Iriomote-jima, where wind gusts reached 204\u00a0km/h (127\u00a0mph). It also affected Taiwan, where floods covered highways and caused mudslides. Early on June\u00a018, Soudelor reached peak 10-minute sustained winds of 150\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph).[nb 2] Subsequently, an increase in shear and the passage of a trough weakened the typhoon and caused it to turn to the northeast. Soudelor weakened to a tropical storm on June\u00a019, and subsequently it passed between Japan and South Korea. It became an extratropical cyclone that day, dissipating on June\u00a024. In Japan, the storm caused widespread power outages, although damage was minimal, and there were 21\u00a0injuries. In South Korea, there was $12.1\u00a0million in damage and two deaths."

        "content": "The origins of Soudelor were from a tropical disturbance that persisted a short distance northwest of Pohnpei on June\u00a07. By two days later, it had a large area of convection, and it moved generally westward. Late on June\u00a09, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)[nb 3] issued a tropical cyclone formation alert (TCFA), although the system initially failed to develop due to wind shear in the region.[4] The thunderstorms decreased over the increasingly exposed circulation.[5] On June\u00a011, the shear decreased,[4] and convection became better organized.[5] The JTWC initiated warnings on Tropical Depression 07W late that day,[4] and at 0000\u00a0UTC on June\u00a012, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA)[nb 4] also remarked that a tropical depression had formed to the northeast of Palau.[6] After forming, the depression tracked generally westward due to a subtropical ridge to the north.[4] Around that time, it was still located within the monsoon trough, and it interacted with another circulation to its east-southeast, causing a motion to the west-northwest. As it moved away from the other circulation, the depression was able to intensify,[5] and the wind shear decreased.[4] On June\u00a013 the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Soudelor to the east of Samar Island in the Philippines.[6] That day, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration PAGASA initiated advisories and gave it the local name \"Egay\".[1] Upon becoming a tropical storm, Soudelor developed rainbands to the north and south, although it could not intensify significantly due to a tropical upper tropospheric trough to the east.[5] A mid-latitude trough to the north weakened the ridge, which allowed Soudelor to turn more to the northwest off the northeast coast of the Philippines. The circulation became exposed from the deepest convection,[4] and around that time the storm was located about 160\u00a0km (100\u00a0mi) east of Samar Island. Thunderstorms gradually increased, and the outflow improved.[5] Late on June\u00a016, the JTWC upgraded Soudelor to a typhoon,[4] and the next day the JMA followed suit when the storm was located southeast of Taiwan.[6] Around the time that Soudelor became a typhoon, it began moving toward the north, influenced by an approaching trough, and it passed about 95\u00a0km (60\u00a0mi) northeast of Luzon. A ragged eye developed early on June\u00a017, which quickly became better organized.[5] With its outflow enhanced by the approaching trough, Soudelor rapidly intensified to the east of Taiwan.[4] The typhoon struck the Japanese island of Iriomote-jima at around 2030\u00a0UTC on June\u00a017.[6] At 0600\u00a0UTC on June\u00a018, the JTWC estimated peak 1\u2011minute winds of 215\u00a0km/h (135\u00a0mph).[4] At the same time, JMA estimated peak 10\u2011minute winds of 150\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph) when it was located west of Okinawa.[6] While at its maximum strength, Soudelor had a circular eye 33\u00a0km (21\u00a0mi) in diameter.[5] It turned to the north-northeast, maintaining its peak winds for about 12\u00a0hours before increased shear from the westerlies caused weakening.[4] The eye quickly dissipated, and the system began transitioning into an extratropical cyclone.[5] Early on June\u00a019, the JMA downgraded Soudelor below typhoon status, and the storm later crossed Tsushima Island into the Sea of Japan. At 1500\u00a0UTC that day, the JMA declared the storm as extratropical while it was near the Oki Islands;[6] the JTWC followed suit three hours later.[5] The extratropical remnants of Soudelor continued to the northeast, crossing northern Japan on June\u00a020. The storm slowed and turned to the east, dissipating on June\u00a024.[6]"

All fishermen in the area were urged to return to port before the onset of the typhoon.[7] As the typhoon tracked near Taiwan, the Japan Meteorological Agency began advising residents in Okinawa to closely monitor the storm. One of the major airlines in Japan, All Nippon Airways, cancelled 66 domestic flights the same day, stranding an estimated 6,000 people.[9] During the storm, 257\u00a0domestic flights were canceled, and train and ferry service was canceled.[10] In Nagasaki Prefecture, 732\u00a0schools were closed during the storm.[11] Hundreds of people voluntarily evacuated in Japan.[12] On June\u00a017, the Korean Meteorological Agency issued rain warnings for Jeju Island and coastal areas of South Korea.

Overall damage was estimated at \u20b1131\u00a0million (2003\u00a0Philippine pesos, $2.46\u00a0million 2003\u00a0USD).[nb 5] There were 12\u00a0deaths, with two missing, as well as two people injured.[16] In Taiwan, Soudelor dropped heavy rainfall that resulted in flooding and landslides.[5] One of the mudslides covered a 10\u00a0km (6.2\u00a0mi) section of the Yenhsi Highway between Hsitou and Luku. Road crews were quickly dispatched to the area but had to suspend cleanup efforts due to continuing impacts from Soudelor. Dozens of tour buses carrying tourists who were being evacuated from the mountains were blocked several times by mudslides covering roads. The Sungshan Airport in Taipei was shut down during the morning of June\u00a019 due to unsettled weather produced by the typhoon.[17] The Feitsui Dam increased by 2.5\u00a0m (8.2\u00a0ft) due to the storm's rainfall, raising it to near peak capacity.[18] For eight hours, the Japanese island of Iriomote-jima reported gale-force winds, except for during the eye passage of Soudelor.[5] The island reported sustained winds of 108\u00a0km/h (67\u00a0mph),[19] with gusts to 204\u00a0km/h (127\u00a0mph).[5] On Ishigaki Island, the storm caused \u00a577.9\u00a0million (2003\u00a0JPY, $655,000 2003\u00a0USD)[nb 6] in agriculture damage, mostly from high waves.[20] Soudelor dropped heavy rainfall throughout Japan, peaking at 497\u00a0mm (19.6\u00a0in) in Kagoshima Prefecture; most of the precipitation fell in about 24\u00a0hours.[19] A North Korean cargo ship was stranded off the northwest coast of Japan after being refused entry into the Japanese port of Toyama.[5] During the storm, about 10,000\u00a0houses lost power,[10] including 3,400\u00a0houses in Okinawa Prefecture.[21] Damage was minor, with only 26\u00a0damaged houses, varying from blown off roof tiles to shattered windows. Soudelor injured 21\u00a0people in the country, mostly due to falling objects.[10] There were at least 22\u00a0landslides nationwide.[22] Four bridges along the Yoshino River were flooded during the storm.[23] In South Korea, Soudelor dropped about 500\u00a0mm (20\u00a0in) of rainfall at Hallasan in Jeju Province in South Korea. The storm also caused 4\u00a0m (13\u00a0ft) seas.[24] Typhoon Soudelor killed two people in South Korea and caused $12.1\u00a0million in damages.[25]"

The 9th named storm and 11th tropical cyclone of the 1991 Pacific hurricane season, the system formed from two tropical waves. The pair moved across the Atlantic during the first ten days of September. The second of the two spawned Tropical Storm Erika in the eastern Atlantic. Emerging into the eastern Pacific between the September 10 and September 12, an area of thunderstorms developed southeast of an upper level cyclone off the southern tip of Baja California Sur due to the interaction of the upper cyclone with the pair of tropical waves. By the September 15, the thunderstorm activity organized into bands, indicating the presence of a new tropical depression, the eleventh of the season. The cyclone moved north-northwest due to steering around the upper cyclone, and became a tropical storm by noon on the September 16. Once the upper cyclone moved away from Ignacio, its motion towards the Mexican coast stopped on September 17, and it executed a slow anticyclonic loop that would be completed late on the September 18. Proximity to land and west to southwesterly vertical wind shear weakened the cyclone, and Ignacio regained tropical depression status late on the September 18. The system dissipated as a tropical cyclone that night, and its remnants moved west-southwest into the tropical Pacific, occasionally flaring up new convection over the succeeding couple days.[1]"

It emerged into the eastern Pacific between the September 10 and September 12.[1] An area of thunderstorms developed southeast of an upper level cyclone off the southern tip of Baja California Sur due to the interaction of the upper cyclone with the pair of tropical waves.[1] It had become a broad area of convection located to the east of a quasi-stationary mid-level trough axis along 115\u00b0W. The area of disturbance became a tropical depression on September 16, about 375\u00a0km (233\u00a0mi) southwest of Acapulco.[2] The storm continued to intensify and became a tropical storm later in the day. The tropical cyclone's forward motion was slow, along with a small clockwise loop, a track that was somewhat unexpected.[2] Ignacio was centered around 45\u00a0km (28\u00a0mi) offshore and was near its peak intensity of a minimum central pressure of 994\u00a0mbar (29.4\u00a0inHg) on the evening of September 17. Once the upper cyclone moved away from Ignacio, its motion towards the Mexican coast stopped on September 17, and it executed a slow anticyclonic loop that would be completed late on the September 18.[1] The surface pressure fell to 1,004.7\u00a0mbar (29.67\u00a0inHg) at Zinhuatenejo and 1,006\u00a0mbar (29.7\u00a0inHg) at Manzanillo. Tropical storm warnings were issued for the affected portion of southwest Mexico. The few surface-observing sites reported many hours of rain, some locally heavy, from noon on September 16 to early on September 18. Several ships reported tropical storm-force winds. The OMI Willamette reported the highest surface winds of the event.[2] Ignacio weakened quickly on September 18, probably due to the combined effects of the storm's close proximity to land and persistence of waters likely cooled by upwelling. Strong winds aloft, shearing Ignacio from the southwest, might have contributed to the weakening as well. Ignacio was downgraded to a tropical depression on September 19 and became a remnant low later that day. The remnants of Ignacio, identified on satellite imagery as occasional flare-ups of convection, moved west-southwestwards over the next two days.[2]"

The highest amount recorded was 15.43 inches (392\u00a0mm) at Pasa de San Antonio.[4] The storm also caused street flooding in Acapulco.[5] Ten people died in Guerrero due to flash flooding. In addition, heavy rains and high ways brought widespread damage to nine other Mexican states.[6] The remnants of the storm caused several dams to burst in the state of Chihuahua, leaving 10,000 people homeless and killing another 13.[7] In all, 40 people were injured.[2]"

A large, dry airflow from the northwest caused the storm to drift northeast where it became a tropical storm on 6 September. Nari was stationary near Okinawa due to the subtropical ridge dipping near Japan and became a typhoon on the 7th. On 9 September, at around 7:00(UTC), Nari developed an eye, which collapsed 14 hours later due to dry air inflowing around the storm, associated with an upper-level trough, causing leading to the system's decrease in size while becoming stationary. On 10 September, Nari was pulled slightly to the east by Typhoon Danas. At the same time, it made a small burst of convection as wind shear lowered and rapidly intensified into a Category 3 typhoon, reaching a peak of 115 mph (185 km/h) winds before weakening to a tropical storm on the 14th. It restrengthened to a typhoon, and as it continued southwestward, Nari reached 100 mph (160 km/h) winds before hitting northeastern Taiwan on the 16th. The storm drifted across the island, emerging into the South China Sea on the 18th as a tropical depression.

Businesses were shut down across the island and the stock exchange was closed for several days. Moreover, after it reopened, there was significantly less stock activity as hundreds of thousands of residents were either unable to get to work or hampered by travel issues.[2] The combination of the two events was estimated to have reduced the gross domestic product of Taiwan by 0.2%, roughly NT$19.4 billion (US$560 million).[citation needed]"

Here, dozens of homes were damaged or destroyed, with the worst damage being rated EF3 with winds estimated at 152 miles per hour (245\u00a0km/h).[1] Entering the city of Clay, the tornado to a width of 600 yards (550\u00a0m), continuing at mid-EF3 intensity, as it crossed Old Springville Road and struck Harness Circle in the Northwoods neighborhood.[1] Along Harness Circle, two homes were demolished at EF3 intensity and numerous other homes were damaged.[1] In one of the destroyed homes, Christina Nicole Heichelbech, a 16-year-old girl was killed while in the process of trying to take cover.[1][7]  The National Weather Service rated both of the completely destroyed homes EF3 with winds estimated at 150 miles per hour (240\u00a0km/h).[1][8][9] Continuing northeast, the tornado crossed a ridge, striking the Legacy neighborhood. Numerous homes in the neighborhood sustained moderate to minor damage. As the tornado crossed Plymouth Rock Drive, several homes were completely destroyed at EF3 intensity, with winds estimated to have been at 152 miles per hour (245\u00a0km/h).[1] The tornado began to weaken as it crossed Interstate 59, where several homes sustained high-end EF1 damage and numerous trees were snapped and uprooted.[1][2] The tornado lifted between Hidden Valley Drive and Country Living Circle, after having been on the ground for 22 minutes.[1][10] Officially, the National Weather Service reported that the tornado killed one person, injured 75 others, and damaged or destroyed 231 structures, along a path of 15.69 miles (25.25\u00a0km).[1][2][3] The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration did not list a damage total for this tornado's entire track, but the Alabama Forestry Commission estimated that the merchantable timber losses were at least $132,000 and damage to the Center Point Elementary School was at least $18 million (in 2012 USD).[4][3] The Voss law firm estimated that residential insurance claims would be up to $30 million (2012 USD).[11] A year after the tornado, the Clay City Council named January 23 as Christina Heichelbech Day to commemorate Heichelbech's life.[12]"

Billie developed from a tropical disturbance west of Kiribati on July\u00a012. Situated within favorable conditions, the system quickly reached tropical storm intensity before strengthening further to typhoon status a day after formation. Intensification continued until Billie reached its peak intensity on July\u00a014 east of Taiwan with maximum sustained winds of 165\u00a0km/h (103\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 970\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.64\u00a0inHg).[nb 1] Slight weakening occurred before the typhoon made landfall on Zhejiang in China on July\u00a016. After tracking inland, Billie curved northward and moved over the Yellow Sea before making a final landfall on North Korea on July\u00a017; the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone shortly afterwards before dissipating over the Sea of Japan a day later. The rainbands of Billie brought severe flooding to the Philippines and Japan even while the typhoon's center was well removed from those locations. In the Philippines, one person was killed, and the flood damage totaled US$500,000.[nb 2] Floods were particularly destructive in Japan, where they destroyed 603\u00a0homes in the western portion of the country. Swaths of crops were inundated by the floodwaters, and 44\u00a0people were killed. Extensive flooding occurred in Taiwan and China, and seven deaths occurred in the former. In Busan, South Korea, Billie's effects forced the evacuation of thousands of people through tight corridors from a stadium, causing the indirect deaths of 61\u00a0people."

Upon development, observations indicated that the system was quickly developing in favorable conditions, with initial reconnaissance flights finding a loose eye measuring 160\u00a0km (99\u00a0mi) in diameter shortly after classification as a tropical depression. Twelve hours later, the JTWC upgraded the cyclone to tropical storm status, assigning the name Billie.[1] At 1200\u00a0UTC on July\u00a013, the JTWC upgraded Billie further to typhoon status,[2] making Billie the first tropical cyclone to be monitored by the JTWC since its inception earlier in 1959.[3] Now tracking steadily towards the northwest,[1] the typhoon reached its peak intensity at 1200\u00a0UTC the next day with maximum sustained winds of 165\u00a0km/h (103\u00a0mph) according to the JTWC and a minimum barometric pressure assessed by the Japan Meteorological Agency\u00a0(JMA) at 970\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.64\u00a0inHg).[2] By this time Billie's eye had shrunk to a size roughly 50\u00a0km (31\u00a0mi) in diameter. At 0900\u00a0UTC on July\u00a015, Billie passed just 30\u00a0km (19\u00a0mi) north of Taiwan; fifteen hours later the typhoon made landfall north of Fuzhou, China in Zhejiang with winds estimated at 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph).[1][2][4] Upon tracking inland on July\u00a016, interaction with China's mountainous terrain disrupted the organization of Billie, weakening it down to tropical storm intensity. However, the tropical cyclone's stint over land was short-lived as the system quickly curved northward into the Yellow Sea by July\u00a017.[1] Despite moving back over water, Billie continued to weaken, and made landfall on the western coast of North Korea with winds of 75\u00a0km/h (47\u00a0mph).[1][2] Over the Korean peninsula, Billie began to intake cold air from a polar front, enabling the system to transition into an extratropical cyclone by 1800\u00a0UTC that day.[1] These remnants tracked eastward across the Sea of Japan before they were last noted just off of Hokkaido on July\u00a018.[2][5]"

In the Philippines, the rains triggered floods that led to the death of one person and US$500,000\u00a0in damage.[6] About 100\u00a0people were displaced on the islands due to the rainfall.[7] The Japanese freighter Bansei Maru was grounded on a reef off of Ishigaki Island due to the rough surf and winds caused by the passing typhoon, necessitating a rescue operation by three United States Navy ships.[6] On the island, 16\u00a0homes were destroyed and 49\u00a0were heavily damaged. Inundation of crops was prevalent.[1] Flooding from Billie was highly destructive in areas of Japan west of the Ch\u016bbu region, destroying 603\u00a0homes and inundating 77,288 others. Roughly 325\u00a0km2 (125\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of farmland was impacted by the rains. Across Japan, 44\u00a0people were killed and 77\u00a0were injured.[8] In northern Taiwan, Billie caused widespread flash flooding, displacing thousands of people and resulting in extensive damage.[9] Approximately one-third of Taipei was inundated by floodwaters, and hospital patients were forced to evacuate to Okinawa after a Military Assistance Advisory Group compound was impacted by the heavy rains.[6] Over 10,000\u00a0people were rendered homeless in Taipei alone after the city's shanty-type dwellings along with well-built residences were destroyed.[10][1] In total, the effects of Billie in Taiwan killed seven people. Extensive flooding also occurred in nearby eastern China, inundating rice fields. In order to avoid the storm, thousands of fishermen sought shelter in local harbors.[6] Cleanup and relief operations quickly ensued following the storm's passage.[11] Storms accompanying Billie and its remnants brought heavy rains and strong winds to South Korea, knocking out police telephone lines in Busan. The sudden onslaught of these storms caused a stampede of roughly 70,000\u00a0people out of a stadium,[12][13] resulting in the indirect deaths of 68\u00a0people, including 51\u00a0children. Around 125\u00a0people were injured and 40\u00a0were hospitalized after the mass evacuation.[12][14]"

It was the only time since the American Revolutionary War that a foreign power had captured and occupied a United States capital. Following the defeat of American forces at the Battle of Bladensburg on August 24, 1814, a British army led by Major-General Robert Ross marched on Washington, D.C. That evening, British soldiers and sailors set fire to multiple public buildings,  including the Presidential Mansion, United States Capitol, and Washington Navy Yard.[5] The attack was in part a retaliation for prior American actions in British-held Upper Canada, in which U.S. forces had burned and looted York the previous year and had then burned large portions of Port Dover.[6] Less than four days after the attack began, a heavy thunderstorm, possibly a hurricane and a tornado, extinguished the fires and caused further destruction. The British occupation of Washington, D.C. lasted for roughly 26 hours.[7] President James Madison, along with his administration and several military officials, evacuated and were able to find refuge for the night in Brookeville, a small town in Montgomery County, Maryland; President Madison spent the night in the house of Caleb Bentley, a Quaker who lived and worked in Brookeville. Bentley's house, known today as the Madison House, still exists."

        "content": "The United Kingdom was already at war with France when the United States declared war in 1812. The war against France took up most of Britain's attention and military resources. The initial British strategy against the United States focused on imposing a naval blockade at sea, and maintaining a defensive stance on land. The British Army could not reinforce Canada; instead, the government relied on militia units and indigenous allies to support the British Army units already posted in Canada.[8] With the defeat and exile of Napoleon in April 1814,  Britain was able to use its newly available troops and ships to prosecute its war with the United States. The Earl of Bathurst, serving as Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, dispatched an army brigade and additional naval vessels to the imperial fortress of Bermuda, from where a blockade of the U.S. coast and even the occupation of some coastal islands had been overseen throughout the war. It was decided to use these forces in raids along the Atlantic seaboard to draw American forces away from Canada.[8] The commanders were under strict orders not to carry out operations far inland, or to attempt to hold territory.[why?] Early in 1814, Vice-Admiral Alexander Cochrane had been appointed commander-in-chief of the Royal Navy's North America and West Indies Station, controlling naval forces based at the new Bermuda dockyard and the Halifax Naval Yard, which were used to blockade American ports throughout the war. He planned to carry the war into the United States, by attacks in Virginia and against New Orleans.[9] Rear-Admiral George Cockburn had commanded the squadron in Chesapeake Bay since the previous year. On June 25, he wrote to Cochrane stressing that the defenses there were weak, and he felt that several major cities were vulnerable to attack.[10] Cochrane suggested attacking Baltimore, Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia. Rear Admiral Cockburn accurately predicted that \"within a short period of time, with enough force, we could easily have at our mercy the capital\".[11] He recommended Washington, D.C. as the target, because of the comparative ease of attacking the national capital and \"the greater political effect likely to result\".[12] On July 18, Cochrane ordered Cockburn to \"deter the enemy from a repetition of similar outrages\u00a0... You are hereby required and directed to destroy and lay waste such towns and districts as you may find assailable\".[13] Cochrane further instructed, \"You will spare merely the lives of the unarmed inhabitants of the United States\".[13] Ross was less optimistic. He \"never dreamt for one minute that an army of 3,500 men with 1,000 marines reinforcement, with no cavalry, hardly any artillery, could march 50 miles inland and capture an enemy capital\", according to historian John McCavitt.[14] Ross refused to accept Cockburn's recommendation to burn the entire city. He spared nearly all of the privately owned properties.[15] An added motive was retaliation for the \"wanton destruction of private property along the north shores of Lake Erie\" by American troops under Colonel John Campbell in May, the most notable being the Raid on Port Dover.[16] On June 2, Sir George Prevost, Governor General of British North America, wrote to Cochrane at Admiralty House, in Bailey's Bay, Bermuda, calling for a retaliation against the American destruction of private property in violation of the laws of war. Pr\u00e9vost argued that, in consequence of the late disgraceful conduct of the American troops in the wanton destruction of private property on the north shores of Lake Erie, in order that if the war with the United States continues you may, should you judge it advisable, assist in inflicting that measure of retaliation which shall deter the enemy from a repetition of similar outrages.[16] Many sources also suggest that the attack on Washington was motivated by revenge for the American looting of York in Upper Canada, the provincial capital,[6] after the Battle of York in April 1813. Earlier, the British had filed general complaints about the \"wanton destruction\" along the Niagara region and Lake Erie.[17] Major General Ross commanded the 4,500-man army in Washington, composed of the 1st Battalion, the 4th (King's Own) Regiment of Foot, the 21st (Royal North British Fusilier) Regiment of Foot, the 1st Battalion, the 44th (East Essex) Regiment of Foot, the 85th Regiment of Foot and a battalion of Royal Marines. This force defeated an American army at the Battle of Bladensburg.[18][19]"

President Madison spent the night in the house of Caleb Bentley, a Quaker who lived and worked as a silversmith in Brookeville. Bentley's house, known today as the Madison House, still stands in Brookeville.[20] On August 24, 1814, the British, led by Ross and Cockburn, entered Washington with a force of 4,500 \"battle hardened\" men.[21][22] The plan to attack Washington had been formulated by Rear Admiral Cockburn, who predicted that \"within a short period of time, with enough force, we could easily have at our mercy the capital\".[23] Ross commanded the troops and was less optimistic.[14] While Cockburn recommended burning the entire city, Ross planned to damage only public buildings.[22][24] Ross, who was described by historian John McCavitt as \"an officer and a gentleman\", initially planned for an orderly surrender of Washington. However, as he and his men entered the city under a flag of truce, American soldiers remaining in the city \"treacherously\" opened fire, wounding Ross' horse and killing two of his men. McCavitt argued that this led him to \"reluctantly\" order the burning of the White House and the Capitol building.[25]"

        "content": "The United States Capitol was, according to some contemporary travelers, the only building in Washington \"worthy to be noticed\".[26] Thus, it was a prime target for the British, for both its aesthetic and its symbolic value. Upon arrival into the city via Maryland Avenue, the British targeted the Capitol, first the southern wing, containing the House of Representatives, then the northern wing, containing the Senate.[27] Prior to setting it aflame, the British sacked the building, which at that time housed Congress, the Library of Congress, and the Supreme Court. Items looted by troops led by Rear Admiral Cockburn included a ledger entitled \"An account of the receipts and expenditures of the United States for the year 1810\"; the admiral wrote on the inside leaf that it was \"taken in President's room in the Capitol, at the destruction of that building by the British, on the capture of Washington, 24th August, 1814\". He later gave it to his elder brother Sir James Cockburn, the Governor of Bermuda. The book was returned to the Library of Congress in 1940.[28] The British intended to burn the building to the ground. They set fire to the southern wing first. The flames grew so quickly that the British were prevented from collecting enough wood to burn the stone walls completely. However, the Library of Congress's contents in the northern wing contributed to the flames on that side.[29] Among the items destroyed was the 3,000-volume collection of the Library of Congress[30] and the intricate decorations of the neoclassical columns, pediments, and sculptures[31] designed by William Thornton in 1793 and Benjamin Latrobe in 1803.[32] The wooden ceilings and floors burned and the glass skylights melted from the intense heat.[29] The building was not a complete loss. The House rotunda, the east lobby, the staircases, and Latrobe's famous Corn-Cob Columns in the Senate entrance hall all survived.[29] The Superintendent of the Public Buildings of the City of Washington, Thomas Munroe, concluded that the loss to the Capitol amounted to $787,163.28, with $457,388.36 for the north wing and main building, and $329,774.92 for the south wing.[33]"

After U.S. government officials and President Madison fled the city, First Lady Dolley Madison received a letter from her husband, urging her to be prepared to leave Washington at a moment's notice.[34] Dolley organized the enslaved and other staff to save valuables from the British.[35] James Madison's personal enslaved attendant, the fifteen-year-old boy Paul Jennings, was an eyewitness.[36] After later buying his freedom from the widow Dolley Madison, Jennings published his memoir in 1865, considered the first from the White House: It has often been stated in print, that when Mrs. Madison escaped from the White House, she cut out from the frame the large portrait of Washington (now in one of the parlors there), and carried it off. She had no time for doing it. It would have required a ladder to get it down. All she carried off was the silver in her reticule, as the British were thought to be but a few squares off, and were expected any moment.[37] Jennings said the people who saved the painting and removed the objects actually were: John Sus\u00e9 (Jean Pierre Sioussat, the French door-keeper, and still living at the time of Jennings's memoir) and Magraw [McGraw], the President's gardener, took it down and sent it off on a wagon, with some large silver urns and such other valuables as could be hastily got hold of. When the British did arrive, they ate up the very dinner, and drank the wines, &c., that I had prepared for the President's party.[37][38][39] The sappers and miners of the Corps of Royal Engineers under Captain Blanshard, who were employed in burning the government buildings, entered the White House. Blanshard reported that it seemed that Madison was so sure that the attacking force would be made prisoners of war that a handsome feast had been prepared. Blanshard and his sappers enjoyed it.[40]:\u200a358\u200a The soldiers then burned the president's house, and fuel was added to the fires that night to ensure they would continue burning into the next day.[22]"

However, several women persuaded him not to because they were afraid the fire would spread to their neighboring houses. Cockburn wanted to destroy the newspaper because its reporters had written so negatively about him, branding him the \"Ruffian\". Instead, he ordered his troops to tear the building down brick by brick, and ordered all the \"C\" type destroyed \"so that the rascals can have no further means of abusing my name\".[41] The British sought out the United States Treasury in hopes of finding money or items of worth, but they found only old records.[30] They burned the United States Treasury and other public buildings. The United States Department of War building was also burned. However, the War and State Department files had been removed, so the books and records had been saved; the only records of the War Department lost were recommendations of appointments for the Army and letters received from seven years earlier.[42] The First U.S. Patent Office Building was saved by the efforts of William Thornton, the former architect of the Capitol and then the superintendent of patents, who gained British cooperation to preserve it.[43][A] \"When the smoke cleared from the dreadful attack, the Patent Office was the only Government building\u00a0... left untouched\" in Washington.[44] The Americans had already burned much of the historic Washington Navy Yard, founded by Thomas Jefferson, to prevent capture of stores and ammunition,[45] as well as the 44-gun frigate USS Columbia and the 22-gun USS Argus, both new vessels nearing completion.[46] The Navy Yard's Latrobe Gate, Quarters A, and Quarters B were the only buildings to escape destruction.[47][48] Also spared were the Marine Barracks and Commandant's House, although several private properties were damaged or destroyed.[49] In the afternoon of August 25, General Ross sent two hundred men to secure a fort on Greenleaf's Point. The fort, later known as Fort McNair, had already been destroyed by the Americans, but 150 barrels of gunpowder remained. While the British were trying to dispose of them by dropping them into a well, the powder ignited. As many as thirty British soldiers were killed in the explosion, with several others injured.[50]"

        "content": "Less than four days after the attack began, a sudden, very heavy thunderstorm\u2014possibly a hurricane\u2014put out the fires. It also spun off a tornado that passed through the center of the capital, setting down on Constitution Avenue[7] and lifting two cannons before dropping them several yards away and killing British troops and American civilians alike.[51] Following the storm, the British troops returned to their ships, many of which were badly damaged. There is some debate regarding the effect of this storm on the occupation. While some assert that the storm forced the British to retreat,[7] historians have argued that their intention was only to destroy the city's government buildings, rather than occupy it for an extended period.[52] It is also clear that Ross never intended to damage private buildings as had been recommended by Cockburn and Cochrane.[24] Whatever the case, the British occupation of Washington lasted only about 26 hours. Despite this, the \"Storm that saved Washington\", as it became known, did the opposite according to some. The rains sizzled and cracked the already charred walls of the White House and ripped away at structures the British had no plans to destroy (such as the Patent Office). The storm may have exacerbated an already dire situation for Washington D.C. An encounter was noted between Sir George Cockburn and a female resident of Washington. \"Dear God! Is this the weather to which you are accustomed in this infernal country?\" enquired the Admiral. \"This is a special interposition of Providence to drive our enemies from our city\", the woman allegedly called out to Cockburn. \"Not so, Madam\", Cockburn retorted. \"It is rather to aid your enemies in the destruction of your city\", before riding off on horseback.[53] The Royal Navy reported that it lost one man killed and six wounded in the attack, of whom the fatality and three of the wounded were from the 6th West India Regiment of the Corps of Colonial Marines.[54] The destruction of the Capitol, including the Senate House and the House of Representatives, the Arsenal, Dockyard, Treasury, War Office, President's mansion, bridge over the Potomac, a frigate and a sloop together with all materiel was estimated at \u00a3365,000[40]:\u200a359\u200a or around $40,540,000 in 2021. A separate British force captured Alexandria, Virginia, on the south side of the Potomac River, while Ross's troops were leaving Washington. The mayor of Alexandria made a deal and the British refrained from burning the town.[55] In 2013, an episode of the Weather Channel documentary series When Weather Changed History, entitled \"The Thunderstorm That Saved D.C.\", was devoted to these events.[citation needed]"

Such actions were denounced by most leaders of continental Europe, where capital cities had been repeatedly occupied in the course of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars but always spared destruction, at least on the part of the occupiers\u2014the famous burning of Moscow that occurred less than two years prior had been an act carried out by the defenders. According to The Annual Register, the burning had \"brought a heavy censure on the British character\", with some members of Parliament, including the anti-establishment MP Samuel Whitbread,[62] joining in the criticism, declaring that the government was \"making much of the taking of a few buildings in a non-strategic swamp, as though it had captured Paris\". In contrast, the majority of British public opinion perceived the burnings to be justified following the damage that the U.S. military had inflicted during its incursions into Canada. The British public also pointed to the United States's role in initiating the war, viewing this as an act of aggression.[63] Several commentators regarded the damages as just revenge for the American destruction of the Parliament buildings and other public buildings in York, the provincial capital of Upper Canada, early in 1813. Sir George Pr\u00e9vost wrote that \"as a just retribution, the proud capital at Washington has experienced a similar fate\".[64] The Reverend John Strachan, who as Rector of York had witnessed the American acts there, wrote to Thomas Jefferson that the damage to Washington \"was a small retaliation after redress had been refused for burnings and depredations, not only of public but private property, committed by them in Canada\".[65] When they ultimately returned to Bermuda, the British forces took with them two pairs of portraits of King George III and his wife, Queen Charlotte, which had been discovered in one of the public buildings. One pair currently hangs in the House of Assembly of the Parliament of Bermuda, and the other in the Cabinet Building, both in the city of Hamilton.[66][67][68]"

        "content": "There was a movement in Congress to relocate the capital after the burning. Congressmen from the north pushed for relocation to Philadelphia or some other prominent northern city, while Southern congressmen claimed that moving the capital would degrade the American sense of dignity and strength (however, many Southern congressmen simply did not want to move the capital north of the Mason\u2013Dixon line).[69] On September 21, the House of Representatives voted to strike down a proposal to relocate the capital from Washington, D.C. by a margin of 83 to 54.[70] On February 3, 1815, in an effort to guarantee that the federal government would always remain in the area, Washington property owners funded the building of the Old Brick Capitol,[71] a larger meeting space where the Supreme Court now stands.[72] Construction of the Old Brick Capitol cost $25,000 and was funded primarily through the sale of stocks. The largest donor was Daniel Carroll of Duddington, a rich English property owner in the area.[73] Construction began on July 4, and concluded in December. Congress met in the Old Brick Capitol between December 1815 and December 1819, when the Capitol reopened.[74] The Capitol reconstruction took much longer than anticipated. The Old Brick Capitol took only five months to complete, but the Capitol took twelve years.[32] A committee appointed by Congress to investigate the damage to the district concluded that it was cheaper to rebuild the already existing and damaged buildings than to build an entirely new one.[75] On February 13, President Madison and Congress passed legislation to borrow $500,000 to repair the public buildings, including the Capitol, \"on their present sites in the city of Washington\".[76] Benjamin Latrobe, architect of the Capitol who took over for William Thornton in 1803, was rehired to repair the building on April 18.[77] He immediately requested 60,000 feet (18,288\u00a0m) of boards, 500 tons of stone, 1,000 barrels of lime, and brick.[77] With the $500,000 borrowed from Washington banks,[74] Latrobe was able to rebuild the two wings and the central dome before being fired in 1817 over budgetary conflicts.[78] Charles Bulfinch took over and completed the renovations by 1826.[32] Bulfinch modified Latrobe's design by increasing the height of the Capitol dome to match the diameter of 86\u00a0ft (26.2\u00a0m). With the reconstruction of the public buildings in Washington, the value of land in the area increased dramatically, paving the way for the expansion of the city that developed in the years leading up to the American Civil War.[79]"

(The painting that was saved was a copy Stuart made of the painting, not the original,[80] although it is the same one on display in the East Room.) \"A dozen descendants of Jennings came to Washington, to visit the White House. They looked at the painting their relative helped save.\"[81] In an interview with National Public Radio, Jennings' great-great-grandson, Hugh Alexander, said, \"We were able to take a family portrait in front of the painting, which was for me one of the high points.\"[36] He confirmed that Jennings later purchased his freedom from the widowed Dolley Madison.[36] The 1814 capture of the Capitol of the United States for a second time (after the revolutionary capital of Philadelphia in 1776) remains a sore point with some Americans. The burning of public buildings was retribution (lex talionis) for similar American attacks on Upper Canada. During heated free trade negotiations in 2018, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau asked American president Donald Trump how the United States could justify protective tariffs as a national security issue. Trump retorted, \"Didn\u2019t you guys burn down the White House?\" [82]"

A low pressure system formed in the vicinity of Guam on August 10 which formed Tropical Depression Fran, and a new low-level center formed from a fracture of a trough that split newly formed tropical depression in the midnight of August 12. The newly formed low level center was classified as a tropical storm and was named Georgia hours later by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. The new tropical storm was tracked by Japan Meteorological Agency shortly afterwards and Georgia rapidly intensified into a typhoon. On the next day, Georgia further intensified after passing Chichi Jima and reached peak sustained winds of 110 knots (57\u00a0m/s) while quickly accelerating in the north-northwest direction before striking Ch\u016bbu region in Japan on evening of the same day as a weakening typhoon. After emerging on the Sea of Japan as a tropical storm on August 14, Georgia made landfall in Soviet Union as a tropical storm at the afternoon of the same day, before transforming into an extratropical storm quickly after landfall. Remnants of Georgia was last noted on Heilongjiang, China on August 16. Georgia caused destruction throughout Central Japan. Nagano and Yamanashi prefectures were the hardest hit from the typhoon, as the rains from the typhoon caused enormous damages, which was worsened by Typhoon Ellen from days earlier. Georgia left more than 50,000 families homeless, tore down miles of communication lines, and washed out bridges and roads. Georgia also caused the worst damage on railway transport network in Japan's history at the time. 4,089 houses were destroyed and 10,139 others were damaged. Because of the storm, 188 people were killed, 47 people were reported missing and 1,528 people were injured. Combined with damages from Typhoon Ellen, damages from Typhoon Georgia totaled $50 million (1959 USD)."

A reconnaissance aircraft flew into newly formed Fran on 11 August. On the early next day, Fran split into two low level centers, which was induced by the fracture of an upper-air polar trough. Second reconnaissance aircraft was sent to investigate and in one hour later at 01:00 UTC, the new center was classified as a tropical storm and named the storm Georgia with wind speeds of 45 knots (23\u00a0m/s). The new center became the predominant circulation and caused Fran to quickly dissipate on the next day. In 09:00 UTC, Georgia quickly intensified into a typhoon with 65 knots (33\u00a0m/s) and JMA tracked the newly formed system.[1][2] Georgia assumed the north-western track with an average speed of 14 knots (7.2\u00a0m/s), and passed within 40 miles (64\u00a0km) northeast of Iwo Jima and 50 miles (80\u00a0km) southwest of Chichi Jima which reported winds of 40 knots (21\u00a0m/s) (53 knots (27\u00a0m/s) in gusts) and 30 knots (15\u00a0m/s) (48 knots (25\u00a0m/s) in gusts) on the next day. After passing Chichi Jima, Georgia accelerated and intensified into the peak sustained winds of 110 knots (57\u00a0m/s) and pressure of 960 millibars (28\u00a0inHg). Georgia turned into north-northwesterly direction and reached the speed of 25 knots (13\u00a0m/s).[1][3] In 22:30 UTC of the same day, Typhoon Georgia made landfall in the mouth of Fuji River with sustained winds of 75 knots (39\u00a0m/s). Georgia quickly traversed through the prefectures of Shizuoka, Yamanashi, Nagano and Niigata on the same night. On the midnight of the next day, Georgia emerged in the Sea of Japan through the vicinity of J\u014detsu, Niigata as it weakened into a tropical storm. Wind speeds of 65.9 knots (33.9\u00a0m/s) (84.0 knots (43.2\u00a0m/s) in gusts) and 94.9 knots (48.8\u00a0m/s) (124 knots (64\u00a0m/s) in gusts) were observed in Kofu and Cape Ir\u014dzaki (Minamiizu), respectively.[1][2][4][5][6][7] After crossing the Sea of Japan, Georgia made landfall as a tropical storm near Preobrazheniye, Primorsky Krai, Soviet Union at 15:00 UTC on the same day. After making landfall for the second time in Soviet Union, Georgia quickly transformed into a weak extratropical cyclone.

Two people sheltered in the basement and survived with injuries after the tornado hurled debris, including an entire vehicle, into the suddenly exposed space.[4] Two other vehicles near the house were moved 40 yards (37\u00a0m) and 300 yards (270\u00a0m) northeast respectively. One lost its engine. Nearby trees were denuded, stubbed, snapped, and lofted long distances.[10] The homestead was judged by the National Weather Service to be the tornado's point of maximum intensity, with estimated wind speeds of at least 170 miles per hour (270\u00a0km/h) and a damage rating of EF4.[1][6] As it crossed County Road 117 the tornado produced significant damage to trees and crops, ranging from EF2 to EF3 in intensity.[1] As the tornado began to dissipate, its movement became erratic, turning due north before turning due east and then again turning due north.[1][8] While dissipating, the tornado likely maintained its strong-to-violent intensity, causing deep ground scouring.[1][6] The tornado finally dissipated between 145th Street and County Road 12.[1] In total, the tornado killed one person, injured two others, and caused over $1.8 million (2020 USD) in damage along its nine-mile (14\u00a0km) path.[1][2][11][12] The tornado spawned from a low-precipitation thunderstorm with a high cloud base, making it remarkably visible. Multiple storm chasers captured photographs and footage of the photogenic tornado, which at times dwindled to just 10 feet (3.0\u00a0m) in width.[7][1] A photograph of the Ashby\u2013Dalton tornado was used in the cover for the 2021 disaster film 13 Minutes.[13][14]"

As such, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded it to a tropical depression, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert shortly after.[3] Meanwhile, PAGASA also stated that the system had intensified into Tropical Depression Gorio.[4] Despite having a partially exposed LLCC, the JTWC also upgraded the system to a tropical depression early on July 26, after scatterometer data and the Dvorak technique revealed sufficient organization.[5] Soon after that, the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm and assigned it the international name Nesat while it was located about 600\u00a0km (375\u00a0mi) east-northeast to Naga, Philippines.[6] Later on July 26, JTWC followed suit and upgraded it to a tropical storm.[7] Tropical Storm Nesat began to intensify slowly as it tracked generally northwestward along the western edge of an extension of the subtropical ridge centered to the east, aided by a weak anticyclone over the system and a vigorous equatorward outflow channel. By the morning on July 27, the JMA upgraded Nesat to a severe tropical storm.[8][9] Amid favorable conditions with weakening vertical wind shear and sea surface temperatures of over 31 \u00b0C (88 \u00b0F) in the area southeast of Taiwan, Nesat intensified into a typhoon at around 06:00 UTC on July 28.[10] Despite a new tropical depression to the west of the typhoon restricting outflow to the west,[11] Nesat strengthened further to reach its peak intensity at around 18:00 UTC, with the central pressure at 960 hPa (28.35 inHg) and ten-minute maximum sustained winds at 150\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph). As Nesat continued to approach Taiwan, animated radar imageries from the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) of Taiwan and microwave imagery depicted a developing eye with strong spiral banding.[12][13] Maintaining its peak intensity, Typhoon Nesat made its first landfall over Su'ao, Yilan County in Taiwan at 11:10 UTC and re-emerged over the Taiwan Strait from Zhunan, Miaoli County at 14:30 UTC.[14][15] The mountainous terrain of Taiwan caused Nesat's convective structure to rapidly decay while cloud tops quickly warmed. At around 21:00 UTC, the JMA downgraded it to a severe tropical storm, and the JTWC downgraded it to a tropical storm.[16][17] At around 22:00 UTC on July 29, Nesat made its second landfall over Fuqing, Fujian, China.[18] About five hours later, the JTWC issued their final warning on Nesat.[19]"

        "content": "Typhoon Soulik, known in the Philippines as Super Typhoon Huaning, was a powerful tropical cyclone that caused widespread damage in Taiwan and East China in July 2013. The storm originated from an upper-level cold-core low well to the northeast of Guam on July\u00a06. Gaining tropical characteristics, the system soon developed a surface low and became a tropical depression early on July\u00a07. Tracking generally westward, a motion it would retain for its entire existence, the depression underwent a period of rapid intensification starting on July\u00a08 that culminated in Soulik attaining its peak strength early on July\u00a010. At that time, the system had sustained winds estimated at 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph) and barometric pressure of 925\u00a0mbar (hPa; 27.32\u00a0inHg). Thereafter, an eyewall replacement cycle and cooler waters weakened the system. Though it passed over the warm waters of the Kuroshio Current the following day, dry air soon impinged upon the typhoon. Soulik later made landfall late on July\u00a012 in northern Taiwan before degrading to a tropical storm. Briefly emerging over the Taiwan Strait, the storm moved onshore for a second time in Fujian on July\u00a013. The system was last noted as a tropical depression early on July\u00a014. Striking Taiwan as a strong typhoon, Soulik brought gusts up to 220\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph) and torrential rains. Numerous trees and power lines fell, leaving roughly 800,000\u00a0without electricity. Severe flooding prompted thousands to evacuate as well. Four people lost their lives on the island while 123\u00a0more were injured. In East China, more than 162\u00a0million people were affected by the storm. Heavy rains and typhoon-force winds caused extensive damage and killed 11 people."

        "content": "On July\u00a06, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began monitoring a mid- to upper-level low associated with an easterly wave roughly 1,390\u00a0km (860\u00a0mi) northeast of Guam.[nb 1] Though satellite analysis indicated no low-level circulation, atmospheric conditions favoured development over the following days.[2] Early the next day, a broad surface low developed and scatterometer passes revealed strong easterly winds to the northeast of the center, which were expected to wrap into the system as it intensified. Despite still being a mostly cold-core system and considered subtropical by the JTWC,[3][4] the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a tropical depression.[5][nb 2] Over the following hours, rapid consolidation of the low took place with deep convective banding features wrapping around the low and a distinct transition into a tropical cyclone. In light of this, the JTWC commenced advisories on Tropical Depression 07W. Situated to the south of a subtropical ridge, the depression tracked steadily west to west-northwest over a region of high sea surface temperatures and low wind shear.[4] Rapid deepening began on July\u00a08 with an eye-like feature developing over the center. Additionally, the storm's westerly motion mitigated the negative effects of wind shear and its upper-level outflow greatly improved. The rate of strengthening surpassed constraints implemented within the Dvorak Technique, a tool used by meteorologists to estimate a cyclone's intensity based on satellite appearance. Both the JTWC and JMA estimated the system to have attained tropical storm status that morning,[7] with the latter assigning it the name Soulik.[8][nb 3] Throughout the day, the storm's eye became increasingly defined on SSMIS satellite images and the system attained typhoon status within 24\u00a0hours of being named.[5][10] Three tropical upper tropospheric troughs, two located to the northwest and one to the east of Soulik, greatly enhanced the typhoon's outflow and allowed for the development of a clear, 85\u00a0km (53\u00a0mi) wide eye which soon contracted to 40\u00a0km (25\u00a0mi) in diameter.[11][12] Due to the cyclone's proximity to the Philippines, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration also monitored the storm and assigned it the local name Huaning.[13] Soulik ultimately attained its peak intensity early on July\u00a010 with winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph) and a barometric pressure of 925\u00a0mbar (hPa; 27.32\u00a0inHg).[5] At this time, the JTWC estimated the storm to have been a Category\u00a04-equivalent on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale with one-minute sustained winds of 230\u00a0km/h (145\u00a0mph).[14] A substantially larger secondary eye, estimated to be 315\u00a0km (196\u00a0mi) wide, began forming shortly after Soulik attained its peak on July\u00a010. By this time, the deep convection was no longer symmetrical around the storm and was mostly located over the southern and eastern areas of the circulation.[15] This formation of a secondary eye indicated an eyewall replacement cycle was in progress; however, it coincided with the typhoon passing over a small area of very low oceanic heat content and prompted a weakening trend. Convection around Soulik's core gradually weakened, though it retained a well-defined inner eye.[16] The simultaneous occurrence of these two factors greatly hindered reorganization of the system and the weakening trend continued as the typhoon tracked west-northwest toward Taiwan.[17] On July\u00a011, this trend temporarily abated as Soulik moved over the warm waters of the Kuroshio Current, allowing for structural improvement.[18] Early on July\u00a012, dry air began to entrain into the northwestern portion of the circulation, suppressing thunderstorm development. Along the southeastern side of the storm, a large band of convection maintained itself and wrapped around a poorly defined eye.[19] Throughout July\u00a012, dry air compromised the structure of Soulik as it worked into the system's center between bands of convection. Despite this, the storm's eye cleared somewhat, though remained ragged.[20] Later that day, the typhoon accelerated on its approach to Taiwan. Interaction with the mountainous terrain of the island soon had adverse effects on the storm and caused its eye to fill.[21] Soulik made landfall near Yilan City northern Taiwan, with estimated winds of 150\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph) between 1800 and 2100\u00a0UTC. Once onshore, the system quickly weakened below typhoon intensity;[5] however, the JTWC estimated that it retained typhoon strength during its crossing of the island. A phenomenon known as a lee side jump caused the circulation center to move abruptly west and Soulik emerged over the Taiwan Strait within six hours of landfall.[22] Once back over water, the storm failed to reorganize and its center became devoid of convection.[23] Remaining over water for less than 12\u00a0hours, Soulik made its final landfall near Fuzhou, Fujian with winds of 95\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph).[5][24] Once onshore, the storm quickly weakened to a tropical depression before it was last noted by the JMA later that day as it dissipated over land.[5]"

Usagi (\u30a6\u30b5\u30ae, \"Rabbit\"), which refers to the constellation Lepus in Japanese, was the fourth typhoon and the nineteenth tropical storm in the basin. Developing into a tropical storm east of the Philippines late on September 16, Usagi began explosive intensification on September 19 and ultimately became a violent and large typhoon. Afterwards, the system weakened slowly, crossed the Bashi Channel on September 21, and made landfall over Guangdong, China on September 22."

        "content": "Early on September 16, 2013, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started to monitor a tropical depression, that had developed within an area of low-moderate vertical windshear about 1,300\u00a0km (810\u00a0mi) to the east of Manila in the Philippines.[1][2] During that day as the systems low level circulation centre became better defined, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the system while the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) named the system Odette.[3][4] Late on the same day, JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm and named it Usagi; at the same time, The JTWC upgraded it to a tropical depression 17W, owing to a tropical upper tropospheric trough cell located to the east in association with an anticyclone enhancing the outflow in the eastern and southern quadrants.[5] On September 17, The JTWC upgraded Usagi to a tropical storm, as the system continued to consolidate and wrap tighter when slowly tracking westward along the extreme southern periphery of the subtropical ridge.[6] Early on September 18, JMA upgraded Usagi to a severe tropical storm; at noon, both JMA and The JTWC upgraded Usagi to a typhoon, as deep convection had completely wrapped around a developing eye with radial outflow and low vertical wind shear.[7] On September 19, Usagi began explosive intensification and formed a 28\u00a0km (17\u00a0mi) round eye; as the result, The JTWC upgraded Usagi to a category\u00a05 equivalent-super typhoon on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale at noon.[8] However, in a post season reanalysis, it was concluded that Usagi peaked with winds at 155\u00a0mph, making it a strong category four on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale.[9] At 18Z, Usagi reached its peak intensity with 10-minute maximum sustained winds at 205\u00a0km/h (125\u00a0mph) and the atmospheric pressure at 910\u00a0hPa (26.87\u00a0inHg) On September 20, Usagi began an eyewall replacement cycle with a 75\u00a0km (47\u00a0mi) inner eyewall and a 190\u00a0km (120\u00a0mi) outer eyewall separated by a clearly defined moat, as well as the system began to weaken late on the same day due to land interaction between Taiwan and Luzon.[10] When Usagi had ventured into the Bashi Channel early on September 21, the JTWC downgraded it to a typhoon for convection becoming more shallow.[11] However, sustained winds up to 180\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph) and the atmospheric pressure at 923\u00a0hPa (27.26\u00a0inHg) were recorded on Basco, Batanes when the eyewall passed the municipality. Later on, PAGASA recorded peak gust of 85\u00a0m/s (306\u00a0km/h) at Basco.[12] Later, as the eyewall replacement cycle had completed, the eye became cloud-filled, although the environment remained favourable with excellent radial outflow and low vertical wind shear.[13] On September 22, Usagi's eye resurged, allowing the typhoon to maintain its intensity while approaching the coast of China.[14] At 11:40 UTC (19:40 CST), Typhoon Usagi made landfall over Shanwei, Guangdong, China with 10-minute maximum sustained winds at 85 knots (155\u00a0km/h, 100\u00a0mph) and the atmospheric pressure at 935\u00a0hPa (27.61\u00a0inHg).[15] Soon, the JTWC issued its final warning on Usagi, while the JMA downgraded it to a severe tropical storm at 18Z.[16] On September 23, the JMA downgraded the Usagi to a tropical storm and later a tropical depression in Guangxi. The system subsequently dissipated during September 24.[17]"

Later that day as Usagi approached Northern Luzon and the JTWC reported that the system had become a super typhoon signal 4 was raised for the Batanes island group while signal 3 was hoisted for the Calayan and Babuyan Island groups and various other areas were placed under signals 1 and 2.[citation needed] Cathay Pacific Airways and Dragonair said flights on September 21 were unaffected, but for one canceled flight. However, both airlines announced that flights to and from Hong Kong International Airport would be cancelled starting 6 p.m. September 22 and resume the next day if conditions allow.[21] In Taiwan, more than 3,000 people were evacuated from flood-prone areas and mountainous regions. Some mountain roads were blocked by landslides, and power outages suspended some train service.[22] A total of 4 people were killed by Usagi, and the damage nationwide reached \u20b1340\u00a0million (US$7.88\u00a0million).[23]"

As the typhoon moved away from Hong Kong, the HKO lowered the typhoon signal to the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 at 9:20AM on September 23. Usagi dissipated on September 24.[citation needed] As Usagi neared to Hong Kong, news and media began rapidly reporting on \"the strongest storm in 34 years\" that would hit Hong Kong. However, in the afternoon of September 22, Usagi's course veered northwest, and Hong Kong was subsequently spared from the impact of Usagi's eye wall, only being covered by Usagi's storm area. Usagi made landfall at 130 kilometers (80 miles) to the east-northeast, and continued further northward that expected. Even though Usagi caused a direct hit as it skirted at 80\u00a0km north of the Hong Kong Observatory Headquarters, the city faced only faced the strongest storm of the year, with northwest gales affecting many places including Victoria Harbour, Airport, Lau Fau Shan and Tai Mei Tuk, as well as occasional storm-force winds that were limited to Cheung Chau and some offshore areas. Hurricane was recorded only on high grounds like Ngong Ping and Tai Mo Shan. West to southwest gales took place later on as Usagi passed through Shenzhen. The most recent tropical cyclone that necessitated the issuance of Hurricane Signal No. 10 -- Typhoon Vicente from the previous year, was still more damaging in Hong Kong. Nevertheless, Usagi caused 17 injuries and prompted the Hong Kong Observatory to issue the No. 8 Gale or Storm Wind signal, keeping it in force for almost 15 hours.[citation needed]"

The Macao Meteorological and Geophysical Bureau originally stated to consider hoisting the Signal No.8 before 7:00PM local time (UTC+8) on September 22, but the sudden change of Usagi's track ruled out the possibility of hoisting higher signals. Usagi only required the Bureau to hoist the Signal No. 3, as the wind speed recorded in Macau reached the level of strong wind only. Usagi's closest point of approach to Macau is 100\u00a0km to the north-northeast, at 4:00AM on September 23, which means that it was barely a direct hit.[citation needed]"

The typhoon originated from an area of disturbed weather that formed far from land towards the end of July. Late on July\u00a022, Wayne developed gale-force winds while moving west. The next day, it was estimated to have become a typhoon, and Wayne subsequently entered a period of rapid deepening.

By the time it moved ashore in southern China on July\u00a025, Wayne had weakened considerably. After moving inland, Wayne weakened rapidly. The following day, Wayne was no longer a tropical cyclone. Typhoon Wayne became the second typhoon to strike the Philippines within nine days. Furthermore, 42\u00a0people lost their lives in flood waters while attempting to cross a temporary bridge. A total of 28\u00a0persons were hurt and 39 were rescued, and there were initially reports of up to 200\u00a0people missing. Although Wayne passed south of Taiwan, moderate flooding was reported due to rough seas. Elsewhere, in China, Wayne was the fifth most intense typhoon on record to impact Fujian between 1960 and 2005. Throughout China, 440 persons were injured, 105\u00a0people died, and 30,000\u00a0dwellings collapsed. Overall, 147\u00a0people were killed due to Typhoon Wayne."

        "content": "Typhoon Wayne originated from an elongated surface trough west of Truk. Initially, the trough was poorly organized, but after 1200\u00a0UTC on July\u00a021, satellite imagery indicated an increase in the  organization and convective activity of the system. Based on this, a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) was issued late on July\u00a021 by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). Early the next day, Hurricane Hunters estimated that the system developed into a tropical depression, and the JTWC subsequently initialized warnings.[1] Around this time, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started monitoring the system.[2][nb 1] During the next 24\u00a0hours, Wayne began to intensify and was soon upgraded into a tropical storm by the JTWC.[1] The JMA first classified the low as a tropical storm at 1800\u00a0UTC on July\u00a022 while the system generally moved west.[2] By early July\u00a023, the JTWC upgraded the storm into a typhoon[1] while the JMA upgraded the system to a severe tropical storm.[2] Around this time, aircraft reconnaissance revealed an eyewall and a small inner core.[1] Six hours later, the JMA upgraded Wayne to a typhoon. Later that day, the JMA announced that Wayne attained winds of 160\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph).[2] The storm continued to rapidly deepen, and within 24\u00a0hours, Typhoon Wayne had more than doubled in intensity according to the JTWC. Meanwhile, the cyclone moved westward along the southern periphery of the subtropical ridge in a low wind shear environment.[1] At 0600\u00a0UTC on July\u00a024, the JTWC estimated that the storm attained peak intensity of 250\u00a0km/h (155\u00a0mph), a Category 4 hurricane-equivalent on the United States Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (SSHWS). According to the JTWC, Wayne was also a super typhoon.[1] Early on July\u00a024, the JMA reported that Typhoon Wayne attained peak intensity of 200\u00a0km/h (125\u00a0mph) (equivalent to a Category\u00a03 on the SSHWS), which it maintained for 12\u00a0hours before weakening slightly.[2] As Super Typhoon Wayne passed north of Luzon, the low-level atmospheric circulation was disrupted north of the storm by the high terrain of Taiwan and thus Wayne weakened. Wayne then began a more northwestward track and made landfall approximately 560\u00a0km (350\u00a0mi) east of Hong Kong.[1] At the time of landfall on July\u00a025, the JMA estimated winds of 170\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph), equivalent to a mid-level Category\u00a02 system on the SSHWS.[2] Wayne struck the coast of China at typhoon strength according to JTWC, but rapidly dissipated as it moved inland over the mountainous terrain of southeastern China.[1] By 0000\u00a0UTC on July\u00a026, the JMA ceased monitoring Typhoon Wayne.[2]"

The bridge was 150\u00a0ft (45\u00a0m) long and 1\u00a0yd (0.91\u00a0m) wide[8] and was responsible for connecting Talisay and Cebu. Many of the deceased were swept downstream the Mananga River, which was situated 2\u00a0ft (0.61\u00a0m) below the bridge.[8] Additionally, 28\u00a0people were injured[9] and 39\u00a0were rescued.[10] Initially, an estimated 100 to 200\u00a0people were listed as missing,[11] many of which were believed to have drowned in floodwaters.[8] Many motorists were stranded due to flooding.[12] Despite veering south of Taiwan, Wayne generated high waves, which flooded farmland. A total of 1,482 acres (600\u00a0ha) of banana crops were flooded.[13] Typhoon Wayne was the fifth most intense tropical cyclone to impact Fujian between 1960 and 2005.[14] Heavy rainfall led to severe flooding in Fujian and Guangdong.

Initially, the system was not well-organized; however, it had a sufficient amount of convection. Hurricane hunters investigated the system four times from September 17\u201320, though none of them were able to identify a closed atmospheric circulation. Despite this, a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) was issued on September\u00a018. This alert was issued again on September\u00a019;[1] meanwhile, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started to monitor the system. By early on September\u00a020, the JMA upgraded the system into a tropical storm as it moved west-northwest.[2][nb 1] During the evening hours of September\u00a020, the JTWC started issuing warnings on the system after the low developed a central dense overcast. At this time, the storm was located about 330\u00a0km (205\u00a0mi) south of Guam. Initially, only gradually strengthening was expected by the JTWC, but this did not occur and by the morning hours of September\u00a021, Hurricane Hunters measured winds of 95 to 115\u00a0km/h (60 to 70\u00a0mph). Based on this, the JTWC classified the system as a tropical storm and named it Forrest.[1] Around this time, JMA upgraded Forrest into a severe tropical storm.[2] By 1800\u00a0UTC that day, both the JTWC and the JMA upgraded Forrest to typhoon status as the storm developed an eye.[1][2] After moving away from Guam, Forrest continued deepening;[2] by the evening hours of September\u00a021, Hurricane Hunter data indicated a minimum barometric pressure of 976\u00a0mbar (28.8\u00a0inHg). A mere 11 hours later, however, the aircraft reported a pressure of 926\u00a0mbar (27.3\u00a0inHg), which prompted the JTWC to increase the intensity of the cyclone to 225\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph). At 18:00 UTC on September\u00a022, the JTWC assessed the intensity of the storm at 280\u00a0km/h (175\u00a0mph), equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.[1] Just under three hours later, a Hurricane Hunter aircraft investigated the typhoon and based on extrapolation from heights measured at 700\u00a0mbar (21\u00a0inHg), reported a sea level pressure of 876\u00a0mbar (25.9\u00a0inHg).[4] This marked the end of the fastest pressure drop ever recorded by a tropical cyclone\u2014100\u00a0mb (3.0\u00a0inHg) in just under 24\u00a0hours.[5] By this time, the temperature within the eye, as recorded by Hurricane Hunter aircraft, had reached 27\u00a0\u00b0C (80\u00a0\u00b0F).[4] After a brief turn towards the west-northwest, the JMA reported that Forrest attained its peak intensity at 0000\u00a0UTC on September\u00a023, with winds of 205\u00a0km/h (125\u00a0mph) and a minimum central pressure of 885\u00a0mbar (26.1\u00a0inHg).[2] After attaining peak intensity, the storm weakened slightly on September\u00a024 according to the JMA, though the storm briefly restrengthened to its peak wind speed at noon on September\u00a025.[2] By this time, Forrest was moving northwest, and the JTWC expected the storm to re-curve due to a weak spot in the subtropical ridge. However, the re-curvature took longer than expected.[1] The JMA suggested that the storm maintained its intensity of 200\u00a0km/h (125\u00a0mph) for several days. On September\u00a027, however, the JMA estimated that Forrest finally began to weaken.[2] The storm quickly weakened thereafter, and by midday, the JMA downgraded the system into a severe tropical storm. During September 28, the system completed its extratropical transition, with the JTWC issuing their final advisory on the system early on the next day.[1] After becoming an extratropical cyclone the system recurved and started to accelerate towards the east-northeast, before the JMA stopped monitoring the system during September 30, as it moved into the East Pacific basin.[1][2] Thereafter, several ships reported storm and gale force winds while the system moved towards the east-northeast as it approached southwest Alaska.[8] The system subsequently stalled and gradually dissipated over the open waters of the Gulf of Alaska, with the system being last identifiable on October 4, about 1,415\u00a0km (880\u00a0mi) northwest of Vancouver.[8]"

At the Kadena Air Base, winds of 95\u00a0km/h (59\u00a0mph) and gusts of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) were measured. Rainfall of 296\u00a0mm (11.7\u00a0in) was recorded, resulting in minor flooding. A few people were hurt due to high winds, but according to the JTWC, the residents of Okinwana weathered the storm \"well\". Numerous funnel clouds were spotted, but no tornadoes were recorded. Northwest of Okinwana, on Inaka Island, a tornado was reported, which cleared a 91\u00a0m (299\u00a0ft) wide swath.[1] Throughout the island of Okinawa, 30\u00a0sustained minor injuries and 20\u00a0homes would either damaged or destroyed,[9] including seven homes that were destroyed. About 160,000\u00a0customers lost power.[9] When the storm posed a threat to Kyushu, five ships were evacuated to an air force base that was considered \"safe typhoon haven\" by the JTWC.[1] In Motoyama, 540\u00a0mm (21\u00a0in) of rain fell, including 415\u00a0mm (16.3\u00a0in) in 24\u00a0hours and 102\u00a0mm (4.0\u00a0in) in one hour.[10] In Nagoya, five children were washed away by rising floodwaters while they were walking home from school. Four of the children were confirmed dead, and one 5-year-old child was reported missing. In Nishinomiya, near the western city of Kyoto, twelve construction workers were swept away by a downpour-triggered mudslide. Four of the construction workers were rescued, but the remaining eight of the construction workers were missing.[11] Elsewhere in the city, a landslide destroyed two homes, resulting in the deaths of a 71-year-old and a 77-year-old farmer.[12] Around 60\u00a0mi (95\u00a0km) south of Tokyo, in Shizuoka, three construction workers were swept along the Nishi River.[13] In Hyogo, on Honshu, 12\u00a0people were buried alive when a hut collapsed due to a mudslide.[14] In all, Forrest killed at least 21\u00a0people, left 17\u00a0missing, and injured 86.[15] Due to overflowing rivers and dikes, 46,000\u00a0houses were flooded, including 141 \"seriously\".[16] Around 7,700\u00a0homes were under water, and over 100\u00a0were destroyed.[17] In addition, 67\u00a0bridges and 818\u00a0roads were damaged.[18] A total of 2,560\u00a0people were homeless.

        "content": " Typhoon Abby, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Diding, was an extremely powerful tropical cyclone which was the second typhoon to strike Japan within a span of a few days in August 1983. First noted southeast of Guam on July\u00a031, development of this system was initially slow to occur; it was first classified on August\u00a05, and was upgraded into a tropical storm the next day. Intensification was rapid as Abby slowly recurved northward on August\u00a07 and 8. After reaching peak intensity with winds of 140\u00a0mph (225\u00a0km/h) early on August\u00a09, Abby slowly weakened, though the storm briefly re-intensified on August\u00a011. By August\u00a014, winds had diminished to 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h). Abby finally weakened back into a tropical storm on August\u00a017 not long after making landfall in Japan. The following day, Abby completed the transition to an extratropical cyclone after moving through central Japan. However, meteorologists continued monitoring the storm for six more days. In the Philippines, heavy rainfall resulted in a landslide that crushed a house in Manila, killing three people. Two others drowned due to rough seas. Typhoon Abby also brought several consecutive days of rain to southern and central Japan, resulting in widespread damage. Commercial traffic by land, sea, and air was also paralyzed by the cyclone, stranding 25,900. Moreover, over 10,000\u00a0fishing boats took refuge in harbors. Around 3,400\u00a0homes were flooded and 24\u00a0homes were either damaged or destroyed. Additionally, 89\u00a0roads were also damaged. About a dozen people were injured during a flash flood that destroyed three houses. Three more dwellings were washed away when a river overflowed its banks. Nationwide, 27 people were hurt and two persons were killed. One person was listed as missing."

        "content": "Typhoon Abby originated from an area of enhanced convective activity southeast of Guam on July\u00a031. While moving south of Guam, the area failed to organized significantly until August\u00a03, when thunderstorm activity increased in coverage. Based on this, a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert was issued at 2300\u00a0UTC. Initially, the system struggled to develop a closed atmospheric circulation. However, a Hurricane Hunter aircraft investigated the system early on August\u00a05 and was able to locate a closed surface circulation. Based on this, both the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)[1] and the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the system into a tropical depression.[2][nb 1] Following an increase in organization,[1] both agencies upgraded the system into a tropical storm.[1][2] Although forecast by the JTWC to move west, Abby instead veered west-northwest while slowly deepening.[1] At 1800\u00a0UTC on August\u00a06, both the JMA and the JTWC upgraded Abby to typhoon status when an eye began to form within the central dense overcast, a large mass of deep convection.[1][2] On August\u00a07, the storm began to intensify at a much faster rate than expected by the JTWC.[1] Later that day, the JMA estimated 10-minute sustained winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph). After briefly leveling off in intensity,[2] the JTWC reported winds of 230\u00a0km/h (145\u00a0mph). Twelve hours later, the JTWC estimated maximum winds of 245\u00a0km/h (150\u00a0mph), making Abby a super typhoon. Even though a Hurricane Hunter aircraft measured a pressure of 888\u00a0mbar (26.2\u00a0inHg),[1] the JMA estimated peak winds of 230\u00a0km/h (145\u00a0mph) and a minimum pressure of 895\u00a0mbar (26.4\u00a0inHg) early on August 9.[2] After maintaining peak intensity for several hours, Abby began to weaken as its forward speed slowed. Meanwhile, the JTWC forecast the storm to a turn to the northwest around a subtropical ridge.[1] On August\u00a011, JMA reduced the intensity of the storm to 180\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph), but several hours later, the storm suddenly restrengthened, attaining winds of 200\u00a0km/h (125\u00a0mph). However, this trend was short lived[2] and Abby steadily weakened as it made the long anticipated turn to the northeast in the general direction of Japan.[1] On August\u00a012, two tropical cyclones developed in the South China Sea, but due to the massive size of Abby, this had little effect on the typhoon. On August\u00a014, however, the eye of Abby began to become less defined. Based on this, the JTWC decreased the intensity of the storm to 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph)[1] while the JMA reported winds of 160\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph). According to the JMA, the storm maintained its intensity for a day, but on the following day, the storm weakened slightly.[2] By August\u00a016, wind estimates from both agencies were equivalent to Category\u00a01 intensity.[1][2] Continuing to trek north-northwest, the JTWC downgraded into a tropical storm at 0000\u00a0UTC on August\u00a017,. Shortly thereafter, Abby moved ashore Hamamatsu and began to turn northeast, encountering rugged terrain near Tokyo.[1] At noon, the JMA downgraded Abby into a severe tropical storm; simultaneously,[2] the JTWC classified Abby as an extratropical cyclone.[1] However, the JMA did not follow suit until 1800\u00a0UTC on August\u00a018. Despite being extratropical, the JMA kept monitoring the system until August 24.[2]"

Three teenagers were killed and two others were injured. Furthermore, two women also drowned due to rough seas.[14] On August 12, although far offshore Japan at that time, high waves were reported along the Pacific coast of Okinawa.[15] Two days later, heavy rains began to drench the nation and continued through August 17.[16][17] Throughout the storm, three weather stations recorded more than 1,000\u00a0mm (39\u00a0in) of rain, Amagisan measured a peak total of 1,138\u00a0mm (44.8\u00a0in), Hakone saw 1,103\u00a0mm (43.4\u00a0in), and 1,035\u00a0mm (40.7\u00a0in) fell in Lake Yamanaka.

Some local air services were also suspended,[14] stranding 4,000\u00a0tourists. Typhoon alerts were necessitated for  Shikoku, Kyushu, and Honshu. At least 10,300\u00a0fishing boats took refuge in harbors. A swimmer drowned in the lake on the western tip of Honshu;[21] a fisherman was swept away by high waves off Kamogawa.[22] A dozen people were injured during a flash flood that destroyed three houses just west of Tokyo.[23] Three houses were washed away and two people injured when a river 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km) west of Tokyo overflowed its banks.[24] Major railway lines halted operations throughout central Japan while many other trains arrived late,[25] leaving 18,000\u00a0individuals stranded.[26] Throughout the nation, 24 homes were damaged or destroyed while 3,400 others were flooded, displacing 2,700\u00a0persons[27] in eight provinces.[28] In all, 19 bridges[1] and two breakwaters were washed away, which resulted in 83\u00a0landslides.[25] Eighty-nine roads were damaged,[29] of which 50 were closed,[25] trapping thousands of travelers.[30] Nationwide, 29 people were hurt.[29] However, only two deaths were attributed from the storm, though one person was missing.[27]"

The eighteenth named storm and the sixth typhoon of the 2017 Pacific typhoon season, Talim's origins can be traced back to an area of low-pressure that the Joint Typhoon Warning Center first monitored on September 6. The disturbance was upgraded to a tropical depression by the Japan Meteorological Agency only two days later, and it became a tropical storm on September 9, earning the name Talim. Talim grew stronger over the next few days, eventually becoming a typhoon the next day. Within a favorable environment, the typhoon rapidly intensified after passing through the Ryukyu Islands. However, as it moved eastward, Talim started to weaken due to wind shear, and on September 16, it was downgraded to a tropical storm. The storm passed over Japan, near Kyushu the next day, before becoming extratropical on September 18. The extratropical remnants were last noted by the JMA four days later, before dissipating fully on September 22. In preparations for the typhoon, more than a half a million individuals evacuated in the Japanese islands, and tropical cyclone alerts were raised in the country itself, Taiwan and the eastern portion of China. The NDRRMC in the Philippines also issued bulletins on the system, depicting a possibility of flash floods and landslides in Luzon; however, the typhoon passed safely to the east of the country. 5 deaths were attributed from Talim, all in Japan and caused over $750 million worth of damages over the country.[1]"

The highest risk of tornadoes was in eastern Pennsylvania where low-level wind shear and high Convective available potential energy (CAPE) values were present. However, a less thermodynamic environment in southern New York led to a lower risk around New York City.[2] Around 11:00\u00a0a.m. EDT, thunderstorms began developing along the cold front over central Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. These storms tracked generally towards the east-southeast and were noted as having a chance to develop into bow echo, leading to a high risk of damaging winds.[4] This prompted the SPC to issue a severe thunderstorm watch for all of southern Pennsylvania, the entire state of New Jersey and parts of northern West Virginia, Maryland, Delaware and Virginia.[5] Around the time the watch was issued, wind shear values began to decrease over the region; however, moderately strong winds persisted over a large area, fueling further development of thunderstorms.[6] Ahead of these storms, surface heating from days of above-average temperatures (exceeding 90\u00a0\u00b0F (32\u00a0\u00b0C)) and a moist air mass provided significant instability, another factor favoring thunderstorm formation.[7] Over the following hours, an isolated thunderstorm developed just outside the watch area and intensified. At 2:46\u00a0p.m. EDT, the National Weather Service (NWS) office in Upton, New York issued a severe thunderstorm warning for much of the Tri-State Region. The storm was noted as having winds in excess of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) as it tracked east at 30\u00a0mph (48\u00a0km/h).[8] Beginning in Bergen County, New Jersey, a line of wind damage took shape due to the storm as it moved ever closer to New York City. The storm continued to produce damage north of the city but the core entered the Bronx just before 3:00\u00a0p.m. EDT.[9] At 2:55\u00a0p.m. EDT,[1] a tornado touched down around 5901 Palisades Avenue along the east bank of the Hudson River.[10] According to a resident who lived near where the tornado began, the funnel cloud preceding the tornado developed over the river.[11] Tracking southeast, the tornado impacted a few structures, shattering windows and damaging roofs.[10] The scale of damage to these structures was consistent with an EF1 tornado with winds around 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) on the Enhanced Fujita Scale. The system continued through the Bronx for roughly five\u00a0minutes before it lifted near the intersection of Riverdale Avenue and 254th Street,[10][11] about 1\u00a0mi (1.6\u00a0km) from where it began.[1] Continuing across southern New York, the thunderstorm continued to produce wind damage through Suffolk County before moving offshore around 4:05\u00a0p.m. EDT.[9]"

        "content": "The thunderstorm that spawned the tornado left a trail of wind damage from northeastern New Jersey through Long Island along its nearly two-hour existence. Strong wind gusts, reaching 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) in some areas, downed numerous trees and power lines across Bergen County. Several roads were also blocked after large trees toppled onto them.[12] In Pedricktown, a large tree fell on a home and broke through the roof, allowing heavy rain to fall inside the structure.[13] Similar damage took place in the Bronx where trees fell on cars, streets and power lines. Along the northern edge of the storm, strong winds in Yonkers also downed trees and power lines. In Nassau and Suffolk Counties, winds reached 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) before the storm finally moved offshore.[12] The tornado itself caused relatively little damage in comparison with the thunderstorm that spawned it. Several trees were destroyed by 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) winds produced by the system and branches were snapped and littered across streets. A few of the downed trees struck the first floor windows of buildings, shattering the glass and leaving seven people with minor injuries. One tree was uprooted and \"became a projectile\" and was wedged within another tree nearby. One home also sustained significant roof damage along the tornado's track.[11] Dozens of cars were totaled by downed trees along its path and thousands were left without power.[14] According to Consolidated Edison (ConEd), 1,700 customers in Riverdale and 3,000 in Bronxside were without power due to the tornado.[15] Additionally, there was also a microburst during the thunderstorm, associated with straight-line wind damage.[11] Non-tornadic damage was estimated at $46,000.[16] Total losses from the tornado were estimated at $150,000.[1] Offshore, the storm left one sailing student missing after he fell overboard during a sailing lesson. Coast Guard teams continue to search for the man; however, there have been no signs of him as of July\u00a028.[14] The search was later called off and the sailor has been presumed dead.[17] Although the storm brought significant damage, rains from it also helped end a growing drought issue and a significant heat wave in the region. Prior to the storm's passage, temperatures in New Jersey had reached the mid-90s\u00b0F (mid-30s\u00b0C), but fell into the 70\u201379\u00a0\u00b0F (21\u201326\u00a0\u00b0C) range by 4:00\u00a0p.m. EDT.[18] The heavy rains led to street flooding, creating widespread traffic jams, especially on the Henry Hudson Parkway.[19] Following the severe damage caused by the storm, the NWS deployed a storm survey team on July\u00a026 to the hardest hit area to determine if a tornado had struck.[20] Their assessment was complete the following day and it was concluded that it was in fact a tornado that caused the most significant damage.[11] Throughout the day on July\u00a026, ConEd deployed crews throughout the Bronx to repair broken power poles and downed lines.[20] By the evening of July\u00a025, only 100 of the original 4,700 customers were still without power; it was fully restored to all residents the following day.[15] Along Palisade Avenue, nearly half a dozen companies provided assistance in tree removal with wood chippers, cherry pickers and dump trucks to clear the streets. Due to the large amount of downed wires, residents living along Ladd Road north to Sigma Place were urged to remain in their homes for their own safety until ConEd crews had cleared the area.[20]"

It then began to strengthen, as well as slowing its movement down, resulting in heavy, wind-driven snow for prolonged periods of time in the Ohio Valley. It also triggered a major lake-effect snow event from December 1\u20132 as the system stalled over Lake Ontario, resulting in additional heavy snowfall. The storm system was also responsible for a severe thunderstorm outbreak in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions, causing 22 severe thunderstorms and 5 tornadoes.

The eighth tropical disturbance of the season, Ernest formed from a persistent area of thunderstorms in the central Indian Ocean. It initially moved southwestward, intensifying into Tropical Storm Ernest on January\u00a020 while moving into the Mozambique Channel. After hitting Mayotte, the storm quickly intensified to reach peak winds of 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph 10\u00a0minute winds) off the western coast of Madagascar. Ernest weakened slightly before striking the southwest portion of that country on January\u00a023, producing widespread flooding and gusty winds. The next day the cyclone became extratropical before dissipating on January\u00a025. On Mayotte, Ernest produced peak wind gusts of 98\u00a0km/h (61\u00a0mph). The storm drew moisture away from Malawi, causing a nine-day period of dry conditions. A few days after Ernest struck Madagascar, Tropical Storm Felapi affected the same region and produced further flooding. The combined effects of the storms killed 78\u00a0people and left over 32,000 homeless. Widespread crop damage sparked food protests, although the World Food Programme provided an emergency supply of rice to affected residents."

It developed outflow and gradually organized, prompting the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to issue a tropical cyclone formation alert on January\u00a017. That day, the MF discontinued advisories after the system briefly halted its development trend. The disturbance continued its movement to the west-southwest, and on January\u00a019 began intensifying.[1] That day, the JTWC classified it as Tropical Cyclone 12S to the north of the northern coast of Madagascar.[3] After continued development, MF upgraded the system to Tropical Storm Ernest on January\u00a020.[1] After attaining tropical storm status, Ernest entered the Mozambique Channel and turned to the southwest.[4] It developed outflow on opposite sides of the storm, and an eye gradually became evident.[1] While strengthening, Ernest moved over Mayotte and passed southeast of Comoros.[4] By late on January\u00a020, the storm rapidly intensified over warm waters into a tropical cyclone \u2013 the equivalent of a 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph) hurricane. Around that time, Ernest had turned to the south, along the western periphery of a ridge.[1] On January\u00a022, MF upgraded the storm into an intense tropical cyclone with peak winds of 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph 10\u00a0minute winds) when it was located off the west coast of Madagascar.[2] At around the same time, the JTWC estimated Ernest attained peak winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph 1\u00a0minute sustained).[3] While at peak intensity, Ernest was a small cyclone with gales extending 130\u00a0km (80\u00a0mi) outward from the well-defined eye.[1] After maintaining peak winds for about 12\u00a0hours, the cyclone began weakening while turning to the southeast.[2] On January\u00a023, Ernest made landfall on the southwest coast of Madagascar at Itampolo,[4] with winds estimated at 130\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph). The cyclone accelerated to the southeast across the island and quickly weakened into a tropical storm. Late on January\u00a023, the JTWC issued its last advisory after Ernest began transitioning into an extratropical cyclone.[1] Early the next day, MF declared Ernest extratropical, and continued tracking it until the storm dissipated on January\u00a025 in the southern Indian Ocean.[2][4]"

Cyclone Ernest indirectly affected Malawi, located inland in southeast Africa. The storm's circulation removed moisture from the country and prevented any rainfall from occurring in the southern part of the country during a nine-day period.[4] In southern Madagascar, the cyclone produced high winds and heavy rainfall. The highest rainfall was a 24\u2011hour total of 237.2\u00a0mm (9.34\u00a0in), and the highest wind gust was 180\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph), both of which observed in Toliara. Many fishermen in the area were not aware of the storm's approach, and several of them died as a result. About five days after Cyclone Ernest struck Madagascar, Tropical Storm Felapi struck the same general area, causing additional flooding. The combined effects of Ernest and Felapi killed 39\u00a0people, injured 104, and left 214\u00a0people missing as of February\u00a025, 2005.[4] Later, the death toll was finalized at 78 in the International Disaster Database.[5] The storms damaged 5,792\u00a0buildings, and there were 32,191\u00a0people left homeless. The floods damaged about 4,483\u00a0hectares (11,078\u00a0acres) of crop fields in southern Madagascar.[4] Portions of the country faced shortages of rice due to crop damage from Ernest, as well as from Cyclone Gafilo in the previous year. This caused prices to increase, resulting in street protests.[6] As a result, the World Food Programme provided 45\u00a0tons of rice to affected residents, although persistent flooding disrupted relief work. In general, damage from Ernest and Felapi were less than that from Gafilo in the previous year.[7] Madagascar's National Emergency Centre deployed workers to do search and rescue missions and provide water to storm victims.[8]"

Violet took an unusual track, moving in a southern direction after formation. This was due to its location west of a high-pressure system, which the storm struggled to move around. After completing a curve to the south of the ridge, Violet quickly intensified into a typhoon. The movement of the subtropical ridge to the east resulted in Violet turning abruptly to the northwest. Violet continued to intensify and soon reached its peak intensity, on October 7, with sustained winds of 205\u00a0mph (330\u00a0km/h) and a minimal surface pressure of 886\u00a0hPa (26.2\u00a0inHg);[1] however, the wind readings during this era of reconnaissance were erroneously high.

Uncertainties remained over the instability of airmass and the development of low-level flow conducive to tornado-inducing thunderstorms.[12] By the next day, the slight risk was maintained for the same general area, and a 5% risk corridor for tornadoes was introduced for all of the northern sections of the main risk area, extending from extreme eastern Texas, south and southeastern Arkansas, northern Mississippi, northwestern Alabama, western and central Tennessee, and southwestern Kentucky.[13] In this outlook, the SPC described the atmosphere and conditions as favorable for severe weather, as convective available potential energy (CAPE) values reached 500 J/kg in the main risk area, favorable low-level wind shear ahead of the expected upper-level trough, and moderate instability were all present to allow for sustained thunderstorm development.[13] On December 9, the outlook was maintained at slight risk up until 1630 UTC. In this last outlook, the main 5% corridor was enlarged to include portions of extreme northwestern Georgia, most of northern Alabama, and central portions of Tennessee, all the way to the Knoxville vicinity. Elevated dew points reaching 60\u00a0\u00b0F were expected to be present ahead of the passing of an advancing cold front, which, in combination with the aforementioned factors, created a very favorable atmosphere for severe weather. However, uncertainties in the extent of the tornado threat were still sufficient to avoid a categorical upgrade.[14] The first area of concern that the SPC identified extended from southeastern Arkansas northeastward through portions of Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee into southwestern Kentucky. Within this area, tornadoes and large hail were expected to be the primary hazards with isolated supercells before the damaging wind potential increased as storm coverage increased.[15] The first of what would be eight tornado watches during this event was issued shortly before this outlook, mentioning a moderate (60%) chance for tornadoes, and a low (20%) probability for strong (EF2+) tornadoes.[16]"

        "content": "This intense tornado formed approximately five miles (eight kilometers) south of Fort Campbell North, Kentucky in Montgomery County, Tennessee and moved northeast.[49][51][8] After initially causing minor EF0 tree damage, the tornado quickly intensified to high-end EF1 intensity, completely destroying the Clarksville School of Fine Arts, inflicting heavy roof damage to homes and a church, and snapping several large trees.[52][53][49][51] The damage to the school was rated high-end EF1, with winds estimated at 110\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h).[54] The tornado reached EF2 intensity as it passed just north of SR 374 and through multiple neighborhoods in the northwestern city limits of Clarksville. Numerous poorly anchored homes in this area were shifted off their foundations and leveled; many other homes had their roofs partially or completely removed; and hundreds of trees were snapped. One woman was fatally injured when her mobile home was destroyed, dying of her injuries a week later. The tornado then further intensified to high-end EF2 intensity, crested a hill, and entered a heavily wooded area where dozens of mobile and manufactured homes south of Britton Springs Road were obliterated, including some that were swept away with no debris left behind.[49][51] Three more people were killed here, including a ten-year-old boy.[49][55][56] Additional homes suffered partial to total roof removal, another poorly anchored home was shifted off its foundations and leveled, and hundreds more trees were snapped.[49][51] As it crossed US 41A in the community of Ringgold, the tornado briefly intensified to low-end EF3 strength with wind speeds up to 140\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h) and destroyed a strip mall with only interior walls left standing.[49] Vehicles in the strip mall parking lot were flipped over, several other businesses were also destroyed, a church lost its roof, and more trees were snapped.[51][49] The tornado slightly weakened but remained strong at high-end EF2 intensity, flipping multiple 18-wheelers at a post office, inflicting significant roof and exterior wall damage to multiple well-built apartment townhouses, shifting and leveling more poorly anchored homes while inflicting severe roof and exterior damage to others, and snapping more trees.[49][51] Continuing northeastward, the tornado crossed a wooded area surrounding Little West Fork Creek before strengthening to its peak intensity as it struck a subdivision just south of the West Creek High School.[49][51] Four two-story brick and vinyl homes in this subdivision were completely leveled, with debris from the homes scattered 200 yards (180\u00a0m) towards the northeast.[49][51] All of these homes received ratings of EF3, with winds estimated at 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h).[57] The National Weather Service noted that at this time, the tornado was \"very narrow and intense,\" and they also noted that the homes were partially screwed and anchor bolted to the foundation, with mostly nails being used as the foundation anchoring.[51] Other two-story homes in the area had their roofs partially or completely removed, with exterior walls knocked down, including multiple homes that had their entire second floor removed. The nearby West Creek Elementary School sustained roof damage, and hundreds of trees were snapped as well.[49] The tornado then weakened slightly, but remained intense as it crossed Peachers Mill Road, where it struck an apartment complex at low-end EF3 intensity.[57] Two dozen brand new, two-story apartment buildings were severely damaged, with at least a dozen of them having their roofs entirely torn off. Winds in this area were estimated to be at 140\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h).[49][51][57] As the tornado continued towards the Tennessee-Kentucky border, it slightly weakened again, but remained strong, inflicting severe EF2 roof damage to dozens of homes in neighborhoods along Needmore Road and SR 236, and leaving behind cycloidal ground scouring in the fields between the two areas. The latter area also had several apartment or condo buildings sustaining high-end EF2 damage, along with at least two dozen steel electrical poles being bent.[49][51] As the tornado crossed I-24 at the SR 48 exit, it uprooted numerous cedar trees and collapsed a portion of a warehouse. Northeast of the interstate, the tornado impacted several neighborhoods and subdivisions, producing widespread EF1 to EF2 damage to over 100 homes, many of which had roofs partially or totally removed along with some exterior wall collapse. Some additional tree damage also occurred before the tornado crossed into Kentucky[51] In all, the tornado struck at least 1,000 homes and dozens of businesses in the Clarksville, Tennessee, area with at least 114 homes being destroyed, and 268 others sustaining major damage.[49] The tornado then moved northeastward into Todd County, Kentucky and over US 41 to the north of Guthrie at EF1 to EF2 intensity, snapping and uprooting hundreds of trees in rural areas.[49] At least a dozen outbuildings were damaged or destroyed in the county, including a silo that was blown over and barns that were leveled, and homes suffered generally minor to moderate roof and garage door damage, although at least one home suffered severe roof and exterior damage.[49] Just before crossing into Logan County, the tornado crossed US 79 and moved through the southern part of Allensville at EF2 intensity. At least 51 structures were struck by the tornado. Outbuildings were destroyed and homes suffered moderate roof damage up to partial removal. Debris from the structures was blown into farm fields as the tornado continued into Logan County.[58][49][51] The tornado weakened to EF1 intensity after crossing into Logan County, damaging crops, trees, and outbuildings. It strengthened again to low-end EF2 intensity as it struck the community of Lickskillet, where every structure was damaged. A well-built two-story house in the town sustained extensive roof damage, had its foundation shifted, windows blown out, and three vehicles thrown and severely damaged. Two barns were also destroyed, with the impalement of barn boards into the home noted.[51] The tornado then weakened back to EF1 strength as it moved further northeast, but continued to inflict severe roof damage to homes, damage or destroy outbuildings, and snap or uproot trees for several more miles. The tornado then struck the community of Williams Store along KY 96 at EF1 intensity, damaging multiple homes and outbuildings, including one home that had parts of its middle section blown out.[51] The tornado then continued moving northeastward at EF0\u2013EF1 intensity, causing additional damage to homes and trees and damaging or destroying more outbuildings as it crossed US 431 and KY 100 south of Russellville. It then continued south of Auburn, where an outbuilding had its roof collapsed, and additional outbuilding, residence, and tree damage was noted. The tornado crossed into Simpson County, where it damaged the siding from an outbuilding roof before finally dissipating.[51] In total, the tornado killed four people and injured 61 others along its path of 47.76 miles (76.86\u00a0km) while reaching a maximum width of 600 yards (550\u00a0m).[8][59][9] 114 homes were destroyed (all of which were in Clarksville) while another 857 were damaged,[49][60] and at least 20,000 people were without power after the tornado in Clarksville alone.[61] The tornado also caused $45,000 in uninsured damage to the Clarksville School of Fine Arts.[62] The school had been set to host a Christmas play on December 9 at 1:00 p.m. However, the play had been moved up to December 2, with 300 people in attendance. The director of the school later said \"If we would have had 300 people in the building on the ninth instead of the second, we would be talking about the destruction of possibly hundreds of lives because there's nothing left of the theater.\"[62]"

        "content": "This strong tornado was first observed by numerous storm spotters and residents at 4:39\u00a0p.m. CST (21:39 UTC) before tracking through areas of the Nashville metropolitan area.[6][63][64] The tornado initially formed near Trail Hollow Lane, just to the east of I-24. It tracked east-northeast, causing minor EF0 damage to trees and residences.[51] The tornado then quickly reached high-end EF1 intensity as it approached and crossed US 31W/US 41. Multiple outbuildings, a motel, and warehouses were heavily damaged or destroyed and multiple trees were snapped. Further to the northeast, additional damage occurred to residences, trees, and power lines as the tornado crossed Old Hickory Boulevard (SR 45), and I-65. As the tornado entered the north side of Madison, dozens of trees and power poles were snapped or uprooted, and numerous buildings, including businesses, warehouses, churches, and residences were damaged or destroyed at EF2 intensity. Three fatalities occurred when multiple mobile homes were destroyed in this area along Nesbitt Lane. Before crossing US 31E, the tornado impacted an electrical substation, triggering multiple large power flashes and then an explosion when it impacted an oil reservoir. The explosion, as well as direct heat from the substation, caused a drop in relative humidity inside the tornado's condensation funnel, which, in turn, significantly reduced the tornado's visibility. The explosion was seen and captured on video by numerous residents inside the Nashville metro; it was also streamed live by a public live camera in Hendersonville.[65][66] This was the first time a tornado had directly struck a Nashville Electric Service power substation since the 1974 Super Outbreak.[67] The tornado continued past the substation and crossed US 31E while maintaining EF2 intensity, heavily damaging or destroying homes and warehouses, and snapping or uprooting trees and power poles. The tornado continued northeastward and reached its peak intensity of high-end EF2 as it moved along and over the Cumberland River and Old Hickory Lake into the western part of Hendersonville in Sumner County. Hundreds of trees were blown down at the Old Hickory Dam, multiple buildings and warehouses at the dam site and a nearby marina were heavily damaged or destroyed; and a 75-foot (23\u00a0m) microwave tower was crumpled to the ground. The tornado then weakened to high-end EF1 intensity as it approached and moved through the center of Hendersonville along US 31E. Heavy damage occurred throughout the town with multiple businesses at a strip mall reporting heavy roof damage with exterior wall collapses, several warehouses, other businesses, and outbuildings being heavily damaged or collapsed, homes suffering severe roof, siding, and exterior wall damage, and dozens of trees and power poles being snapped or uprooted. One two-story home in the area also had its entire roof removed, causing severe damage to the second floor's exterior walls. Past Hendersonville, the tornado caused more sporadic damage, mainly in the form of fallen trees and snapped power poles. Some homes and businesses suffered roof and siding damage, and a barn was heavily damaged with debris from the structure damaging a home. Two homes near the SR 386/US 31E interchange suffered heavy roof damage, with one of them also having its garage cave in. As the tornado approached Station Camp Creek, more homes, apartments, and condos were damaged, including another two-story home that had the second-floor roof removed, a gas station canopy was blown over, and more trees were snapped.[51] After crossing the creek, the tornado intensified as it moved into neighborhoods to the southwest of Gallatin from the southwest. Multiple well-built homes in the area suffered partial to complete roof removal; other homes suffered minor to moderate roof damage; trees were snapped (including at least one that fell on a home); and a metal truss tower was collapsed. Damage in this area was rated high-end EF1 to EF2. The tornado weakened to EF1 intensity again, but continued to cause heavy damage to homes as it moved through the southern part of Gallatin and crossed SR 109. Several homes had their roofs partially or totally removed, and many trees and power poles were knocked down. Warehouses at the nearby Music City Executive Airport were also heavily damaged, and more homes northeast of there had varying degrees of roof damage, with another home having its roof removed, along with more down trees. The tornado then passed just south of Cairo, heavily damaging an old barn country store along SR 25, knocking down trees, and inflicting minor damage to outbuildings. It passed north of Castalian Springs. It then continued into Trousdale County, inflicting one last area of EF1 damage to trees near Templow before it dissipated northwest of Hartsville.[51] The tornado killed three people and injured another three along its 35.27-mile (56.76\u00a0km) path that reached a peak width of 600 yards (550\u00a0m). The substation in Madison supplied 161,000 volts to a DuPont Plant in Old Hickory,[68][69] while the one in Hendersonville served power to customers, though it was in need of repairs.[70][71]"

The heaviest rain in the New York metropolitan area was on Long Island, where over 4\u00a0in (100\u00a0mm) of rain fell in certain areas. High winds were also reported, with gusts reaching 48\u00a0mph (77\u00a0km/h) in Kew Gardens and 46\u00a0mph (74\u00a0km/h) in Orient. Light backend snow was observed in Sullivan County.[73] Nearby, the highest snowfall of 13.7\u00a0in (35\u00a0cm) was in Roxbury, New York.[74] The storm resulted in ground delay programs at LaGuardia Airport and John F. Kennedy International Airport.[75] Parts of New York State Route 25 closed during the floods, as did the eastbound lands of the Belt Parkway.[76][77] Parts of Connecticut saw rainfall exceed 5\u00a0in (130\u00a0mm).[78] On December 10, daily rainfall records were set in Philadelphia, Atlantic City and Wilmington.[79] The storm resulted in a brief stretch of I-76 shutting down in Montgomery County following a downed tree and a 3-way car crash.[80] Further south, light snow at Dulles International Airport accumulated 0.4\u00a0in (1.0\u00a0cm), but that was more snow then what fell during the entirety of the previous winter. 0.1\u00a0in (0.25\u00a0cm) of snow was recorded at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.[81] Richmond, Virginia received their first measurable snow since March 12, 2022.[82]"

        "content": " The January 2022 North American blizzard caused widespread and disruptive impacts to the Atlantic coast of North America from northern Delaware to Nova Scotia with as much as 2.5 feet (30\u00a0in) of snowfall, blizzard conditions and coastal flooding at the end of January 2022. Forming from the energy of a strong mid- to upper-level trough, the system developed into a low-pressure area off the Southeast United States on January 28. The system then quickly intensified that night as it traveled northeast parallel to the coast on January 29, bringing heavy snowfall blown by high winds to the upper East Coast of the continent. Further north, it also moved inland in Maine and its width meant it strongly impacted all three of Canada's Maritime provinces. In some areas, mainly the coastal regions due to the wind (not the snow), areas of New Jersey, Long Island and Massachusetts, it was the first blizzard since a storm in January 2018.[3] The storm was considered a \"bomb cyclone\" as it rapidly intensified and barometric pressure dropped at least 24 millibars over a 24-hour period.[4] The storm was given names such as Blizzard of 2022 and Winter Storm Kenan.[5][6] Several states in the Mid-Atlantic area and New England declared states of emergency ahead of the storm as it developed. In most areas, some transportation services, such as rail, buses, ferries and highway bridges, were closed or postponed, including thousands of flights being cancelled. Strong winds created snow drifts as high as 3 feet in some areas of South Jersey. Road conditions were dangerous in all areas with many roads unable to be traveled on due to the depth of snow. Strong wind gusts as high as 99\u00a0mph (159\u00a0km/h) knocked out power to over 130,000 residents in the affected regions. At least 4 people died as a result of the blizzard, all on Long Island, with two occurring indirectly from shoveling snow. The impact of the storm was reduced because it occurred on Friday night and Saturday when schools were closed and few people were commuting.[7] The blizzard caused at least $50 million in damages.[2]"

        "content": "Beginning in mid-to-late January 2022, computer models began to suggest the potential for a powerful storm to form in the western Atlantic Ocean at the end of the month \u00e2\u20ac\u201c although the exact track was uncertain and thus snowfall estimates were not in agreement. By January 25, models such as the GFS and the European model (ECMWF) indicated the storm would track closer and stronger to the coast.[8] A deep upper-level trough ejected from the High Plains and Rocky Mountains on January 27 and moved eastwards towards the Atlantic. As the trough began to tilt negative, the Weather Prediction Center (WPC) reported that a surface low-pressure area had developed off the Southeast coast near Florida on January 28 as a result of the upper-level interactions.[9] The system began intensifying as it moved north as snow and wintry precipitation blossomed over the Mid-Atlantic states later that night as a result.[10] Rapid deepening began due to favorable conditions aloft \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with the pressure dropping from 1,001\u00a0mb (29.6\u00a0inHg) at 00:00 UTC on January 29 to 972\u00a0mb (28.7\u00a0inHg) at 18:00 UTC later that day, a 29\u00a0mb (0.86\u00a0inHg) drop in only 18 hours, more than enough to meet the required criteria.[11][12] The cyclone also attained hurricane-force winds around this time as well. The WPC began issuing storm summary bulletins on the powerful system at 15:00 UTC as mesoscale banding features developed and pivoted northwest towards the coastal regions of Long Island, New England and parts of New Jersey, producing near-blizzard to actual blizzard conditions in areas.[13] Following its quick intensification, the storm thereafter only slowly intensified until it reached its peak intensity with a minimum pressure of 969\u00a0mb (28.6\u00a0inHg) at 03:00 UTC early on January 30.[14] By this time, snow and wind was gradually winding down along New England except closest to the shoreline, ending soon after. Throughout the day of January 30, the low quickly moved northeastwards and weakened as it moved into Nova Scotia and eastern Canada,[15] leading to the WPC to terminate summary bulletins at 15:00 UTC that day.[16] The system then moved into the northern Atlantic Ocean where it continued to weaken until dissipating the following day."

The system was first tracked near the Marshall Islands on October 11 by the Fleet Weather Central (FWC) as a tropical storm, and the Central Meteorological Observatory (CMO) as a tropical depression. The CMO upgraded Alice to a tropical storm east of Guam on October 14. One day later, and the FWC reported that the storm had intensified to 65 knots (75\u00a0mph; 120\u00a0km/h), equivalent to a Category 1 typhoon on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale. Near Iwo Jima, the typhoon traveled northeastwards, reaching its peak of 100\u00a0kn (115\u00a0mph; 185\u00a0km/h) late on October 18. Alice then steadily weakened down to a tropical storm on October 20. The storm became extratropical on October 23 near the International Date Line, and both agencies ceased tracking the cyclone. As the typhoon moved near Guam from October 14 to October 16, 18.33 inches (46.6\u00a0cm) of rain fell within 24 hours, at the time a record for the territory. Villages on the island had homes and businesses flooded, causing thousands of dollars of damage. Several bridges were washed away, causing of three of the deaths. Andersen Air Force Base suffered from flooding, but military installations were not heavily damaged. Damage totals on the island exceed $100,000 (1953 USD). Little damage was reported in Iwo Jima, where Alice moved to the east of the island."

Floodwaters at Tamuning reached 3 to 4 feet (0.91 to 1.22\u00a0m) high. Electricity was shut off in areas with flooding issues, and a boil-water advisory was in effect.[10] Multiple roads, including Highways 4 and 8, were rendered impassable, and Marine Drive had debris floating and stalled cars alongside it.[11] Many homes and businesses across the island were damaged by the floods. Thousands of dollars of merchandise and properties were ruined, causing stores to close down for repairs. Government offices were also closed or on stand-by except public works and the police departments. Access to the Navy commissary was blocked by waters that were up to 5 to 7 feet (1.5 to 2.1\u00a0m) high. Water leaked into the Guam Memorial Hospital, prompting doctors and nurses to move patients and supplies to dryer areas.[11] Residents in Yigo, Tamuning, and Asan had floodwaters damage their homes, causing some to evacuate.[10] Much of Andersen Air Force Base was flooded,[11] and two airmen were electrocuted when they were leaning against a metal doorknob at The Airman's Club.[10] Naval installations at the base had minor water damage,[11] and operations returned to normal one day later.[13] Four deaths were reported during the storm. Two of them were airmen attempting to cross the Talofofo River when the bridge washed away. A search party was initiated, but it was later called off as no bodies were found.[12] One of the bodies was found near Dealy Beach and Togcha on October 19.[14] The third casualty was a Filipino firefighter who had also attempted to cross the river, with his body found 500 yards (460\u00a0m) from the bridge.[12] The fourth death was a farmer dying from a heart attack in his pasture during the storm; he had been previously reported as drowned.[13] Property damage totals exceeded $100,000 (equivalent to $1,138,806 in 2023).[7] Ford Quint Elvidge, the Governor of Guam, toured the island and inspected the damage, praising the government agencies for their efforts.[11] As Alice passed 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km) east of Iwo Jima on October 19, light rainfall of 1.5\u00a0in (38\u00a0mm) and winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) were reported on the island.[8]"

The cold front once again joined the Canadian low pressure system.[7] Dry line activity held steady and a number of more tornadoes formed across the Great Plains.[8] Many meteorologists believed that Monday, May 24 would be one of the most active tornado days. Dr. Greg Forbes of the Weather Channel issued an 8/10 risk of tornadoes for spots in the Great Plains. A front was stationed over South Dakota, bringing fast moving supercells and tornadoes from North Dakota to Texas.[9][10]  The next day, more severe thunderstorms fired up, but severe activity shifted east and south. VORTEX2 was able to get valuable information when tracking a supercell that produced 3 tornadoes, each weak and short-lived."

Immediately at EF2 intensity, several outbuildings were severely damaged with the residence sustaining siding and roof damage. A stock trailer was thrown about 75\u00a0yd (69\u00a0m) from its original location. Tree damage was sustained on the west side of the property. The tornado continued moving northeast crossing into Edmunds County, where it then briefly weakened to EF1 strength. At the first farm, several large cottonwood trees were uprooted along with damage to several trailers. Three grain bins were also destroyed. The residence suffered some shingle and antenna damage. The tornado then tracked northeast, quickly intensifying into an EF3 where it slammed into a second farm 1.5\u00a0mi (2.4\u00a0km) northwest of Bowdle. At this farmstead, several outbuildings were damaged or destroyed along with widespread tree damage. The main residence at this location suffered no damage. Several grain cars were also rolled about 100\u00a0yd (91\u00a0m) into the trees behind the house. As the tornado exited this farmstead, it intensified to EF4 strength, before tearing through a third farmstead. At this farm, the main residence suffered major damage to walls with part of the roof removed. Widespread tree damage was sustained with many of the trees completely debarked with only the stumps of the largest branches remaining. Two large garages were completely destroyed with the concrete slab wiped clean. The vehicles in one garage were rolled or tossed from 25\u00a0yd (23\u00a0m) to 100\u00a0yd (91\u00a0m) yards away. Another vehicle flew through the air before resting in a tree shelter belt to the north of the residence. Several other outbuildings were completely destroyed.The tornado then toppled six to eight metal power transmission towers as it moved to the north of the farm. One tower was sheared off from the concrete footings and was thrown an estimated 400\u00a0yd (370\u00a0m). Ground scouring was visible along the path of these towers. The large tornado began to track east, declining to EF2 intensity before crossing over SD-47 where a state radio tower was toppled. The tornado lifted shortly thereafter.[93][94]"

The fifth typhoon and first super typhoon of the 1979 Pacific typhoon season, it formed as a tropical depression southeast of Guam on July 24.[1] It headed to the west-northwest, but upper-level shear from the TUTT caused the depression to dissipate on the 27th. It turned northward then westward, where it regenerated on the 28th. Intensification became more steady, with the depression reaching storm strength on the 28th and typhoon strength on the 29th. On the 31st, Hope reached a peak of 150\u00a0mph winds, but land interaction with Taiwan to the north weakened the storm. On August 2, Typhoon Hope struck southern China, only 10\u00a0miles east of Hong Kong. It weakened over the country while moving westward, but retained its satellite signature. Upon reaching the Bay of Bengal on the 7th, Hope restrengthened to a severe tropical storm, but moved over India and dissipated on the 8th. In Guangdong Province in China, the typhoon was responsible for around 100 deaths or missing people. Twelve people died along with 260 injured in Hong Kong. Typhoon Hope was the most intense typhoon to hit Hong Kong since Typhoon Rose of the 1971 season."

It started moving westwards for a day and then moved northwest without much development for the next two days. The maximum sustained winds were only about 25\u00a0mph (40\u00a0km/h) during that period. On the morning of July 28, it intensified to a tropical depression. While the system slowly moved west, the storm intensified to a tropical storm in the early hours of July 29, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) assigned the system the name Hope.[2] At 6:20 in the evening on July 29, a reconnaissance aircraft reported that the minimum central pressure had dropped to 972\u00a0millibars (hPa; 28.7\u00a0inHg) and maximum sustained winds reached 80 miles per hour (130\u00a0km/h). The system continued to rapidly intensify and became a typhoon on the JMA scale. Hope gradually accelerated and by early morning of July 31. On that day the minimum central pressure dropped to 925 millibars. The eye became well-organized and continued to go under explosive deepening. By the evening of July 31, the maximum sustained winds had risen to 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h), equivalent to a Category 4 super typhoon.[2] On August 1, Typhoon Hope reached maximum intensity with maximum sustained winds of 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure reading of 900\u00a0millibars by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). [nb 1] At 1:00 pm that day, the system passed within 15\u00a0nautical miles of Batan. Hope was closest to the Republic of China in the afternoon. Gales and heavy rain associated with the typhoon caused much damage there. In the eastern part of the island, numerous houses were destroyed and many houses were completely wiped out. Farmlands and ponds suffered much devastation. In the city of Hengchun, hundreds of houses were flooded with water and one person drowned. Tremendous devastation was caused to vegetation, crops and other goods. Then, Hope passed through the Bashi Channel. While passing there, Hope took a west-northwest course and accelerated to enter the South China Sea.[2] At 6:06 PM on August 1, the minimum pressure dropped to about 920\u00a0millibars. Hope reached the eastern parts of Hong Kong at around 2:00 PM on August 2 and made landfall about a few miles east of Hong Kong. While it moved across the area, it slowed down to an average speed of only 20\u00a0mph (32\u00a0km/h). Hope then continued to move westward across the Pearl River estuary and swept through Guangdong. Macau survived the storm with only minor damages and minor disruption to public services. No deaths were reported.[2] Hope gradually weakened to a tropical storm in the midnight of August 3 while turning to move west-southwest. On August 3 that same day, Hope passed over the northern coast of the Gulf of Tonkin and dissipated about 110\u00a0nautical miles (200\u00a0kilometers) west of Hanoi.[2]"

Waves of up to 20 feet (6.1 meters) washed out 150 miles (240 kilometers) of railroad track in one incident.[4] The typhoon caused gale-force winds and heavy rains which caused great property damage there. In the eastern part of Taiwan, 38 houses were collapsed and 132 housed were seriously damaged or completely destroyed. Farmland and fish ponds were devastated. A number of bridges were broken. In Hengchun, southern Taiwan, 500 houses were flooded and one person died. Widespread flooding was also reported in other places over southern Taiwan. Tremendous damage was caused to crops and vegetation.[2] Two people also drowned in fishing towns in the Philippines as Hope brushed the northern part of the archipelago.[4] On August 2, Typhoon Hope slammed into Hong Kong bringing 145\u00a0mph (233\u00a0km/h) winds, tossing freighters about in the harbour and hurling debris through the streets of one of the world's most populated places. The storm flooded low-lying areas and killed at least one person and injured at least 18 other people. Other debris rocketed through the streets and ricocheted off buildings. Parked cars were crushed by snapped trees. A three-year-old girl died when she was swept off the deck of her family's fishing junk by a wind-whipped wave and drowned. Hope sucked windows away from buildings and flooded the interior of many homes. Flimsy shacks that served as homes from immigrants from China were completely blown away. Several freighters in the Victoria Harbour flew in the air as a result of the high winds. The high winds and giant waves also sent some ships, dragging their anchors and out of control, crashing into one another.[4] The typhoon also triggered mudslides.[5] The typhoon injured at least 260 people. Trees were uprooted, huge glass advertising signs were destroyed, streets flooded and sheet metal from construction sites were scattered.[6] Public transportation, such as domestic flights, were halted. The typhoon also destroyed 200 cylinders of dangerous cyanide.[7] Several Vietnamese refugees who were crammed into wooden boats were feared lost.[5] Most of the 66,000 Vietnamese refugees had already moved ashore before Typhoon Hope struck Hong Kong.[8] 400 refugees in Macao were forced to move away from city. A few days after Typhoon Hope, public transportation resumed, and Hong Kong's international airport resumed regular flight operations.[9] Typhoon Hope was the worst typhoon to hit Hong Kong since Typhoon Rose in 1971.[citation needed]"

It lies between the Central Luzon and Calabarzon regions, with the province of Bulacan to the north, Rizal to the east, and Laguna and Cavite to the south. Metro Manila comprises 16 cities and municipalities, including the capital city, Manila. Although Metro Manila was formed only in 1975, Manila itself dates back to 1571, with the establishment of the Province of Manila during the Spanish colonial period. The earliest evidence of human life in and around the area of Manila was dated to around 3000 BC. With a population of 12,877,253 in 2015, Metro Manila is the largest metropolitan area in the Philippines, and the tenth most populous metropolitan area in Asia. Its total area is 619.57 square kilometres (239.22\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), smaller than Philippine cities Davao City, Puerto Princesa, Zamboanga City and Butuan, and Southeast Asian city propers Bangkok, Jakarta, Hanoi and Taipei."

        "content": " The 2010 Western Australian storms were a series of storms that travelled over southwestern Western Australia on 21 and 22 March 2010. One of the more intense storm cells passed directly over the capital city of Perth between 3:30\u00a0pm and 5:00\u00a0pm on Monday 22 March 2010. As of 2024[update], it is still the costliest natural disaster in Western Australian history, with the damage bill estimated at A$1.08\u00a0billion.[1] The storms brought extensive hail, strong winds and heavy rain, causing extensive damage to vehicles, property and trees, and flash flooding, as well as the first significant rainfall in Perth since 20 November 2009.[2]\nThe hail stones are the largest ever known to have occurred in Perth and were around 3\u20136 centimetres (1.2\u20132.4\u00a0in) in diameter,[3] which caused extensive damage to property across the city,[4] including schools, hospitals, universities and power infrastructure. Wind gusts were recorded at around 120 kilometres per hour (75\u00a0mph).[2] At the peak, around 158,000 homes in Perth, Mandurah and Bunbury lost electric power.[2][5] Fixed-line telephone services to thousands of homes were interrupted until the next day, and the storms led to an estimated $200\u00a0million worth of insurance claims within three days, with $70\u00a0million within the first 24 hours.[6] It was identified as the most expensive natural disaster in Western Australia's history,[7] and was declared a natural disaster by the Premier, Colin Barnett, allowing federal and state funds to be used for disaster relief.[8][9] The storm brought an end to a lengthy dry spell in Perth, with 40.2 millimetres (1.58\u00a0in) of rain falling at Mount Lawley\u00a0\u2013 the fifth highest daily rainfall recorded for a March day in Perth. Over half of this fell in just 10 minutes.[3] This was the first significant rainfall since 20 November 2009; only 0.2 millimetres (0.01\u00a0in) had fallen in the entire period. It was similar to storms which struck Melbourne on 6 March 2010."

        "content": "During the warmer summer months, low-level surface troughs normally cross over the west coast of Australia, which often leads to isolated thunderstorm development in inland Western Australia, only occasionally reaching the coast (such as on 20 December 2009, when a storm developed south of Perth and gave the city of Mandurah 2.8 millimetres (0.11\u00a0in) of rain for the month). However, on 21 and 22 March 2010, high surface dew points and temperatures combined with a low to the west of Western Australia to cause rare northerly winds to occur. This meant any storms that formed would be pushed southwards instead of the normal easterly pattern. 21 March 2010\nStorms formed in the Geraldton region during the afternoon, putting an end to the city's fourth-longest dry spell, with 14.6 millimetres (0.57\u00a0in) of rainfall recorded at Geraldton. The township of Badgingarra (halfway between Perth and Geraldton) bore the brunt of storms on both days, receiving 27.6 millimetres (1.09\u00a0in). Storms also developed in inland parts of the Gascoyne, where Cue got over 80 millimetres (3.1\u00a0in) of rainfall and Mount Magnet received 57 millimetres (2.2\u00a0in). 22 March 2010\nThe Geraldton storm moved out towards the coast during the morning, skipping Perth, but not before putting an end to nearby Mandurah's dry spell with 2.4 millimetres (0.09\u00a0in) of rainfall and later Bunbury where 9 millimetres (0.35\u00a0in) fell. Seven pole-top fires cut power to 1,200 homes across both cities.[10] A severe thunderstorm warning was later declared for the central west (around Geraldton), lower west (including the cities Perth and Mandurah), central Wheatbelt, Great Southern and southern Gascoyne regions of Western Australia at 9.45\u00a0am. It was amended at 2.30\u00a0pm to indicate the threat to Perth. As predicted, storms began to develop in the Jurien Bay area around 2\u00a0pm, bringing another 36.2 millimetres (1.43\u00a0in) to an already sodden Badgingarra. At 3\u00a0pm, the main storm moved over Gingin, dropping the temperature from 26.3\u00a0\u00b0C (79.3\u00a0\u00b0F) at 3:06\u00a0pm to 21.4\u00a0\u00b0C (70.5\u00a0\u00b0F) at 3:33\u00a0pm, and delivering 18.2 millimetres (0.72\u00a0in) to the township. Perth was next in line for the storms, which first hit the northern suburbs around the local government areas of Joondalup and Wanneroo, where 62.8 millimetres (2.47\u00a0in) fell in two hours at the suburb itself. Hailstones with diameters of 3\u20135 centimetres (1.2\u20132.0\u00a0in) were reported around suburbs like Osborne Park, Nollamara and Craigie, while 6 centimetres (2.4\u00a0in) hailstones were measured in the inner Perth suburb of Wembley. By 4\u00a0pm, the Perth storm had reached the southern suburbs and damaging wind gusts had been reported at the suburb of Jandakot (96 kilometres per hour or 60 miles per hour). Jarrahdale, to the southeast of Perth, received 44.2 millimetres (1.74\u00a0in) in half an hour, exceeding the conditions required for a 1-in-100-year flood in terms of a period from 15 to 30 minutes. However, the storm began to lessen in intensity and become larger, forming a multi-squall line as it moved further south. A second wave of storm activity developed behind the first set, delivering further falls to northern Perth. Around 4.30\u00a0pm, a severe thunderstorm warning was issued for Mandurah and surrounding areas. However, the storm had begun to move further inland, resulting in no hail reported in Mandurah or Rockingham, and 17.4 millimetres (0.69\u00a0in) at Garden Island and 13.4 millimetres (0.53\u00a0in) Mandurah respectively while inland towns such as Dwellingup and Waroona received 30.2 millimetres (1.19\u00a0in) and 26.8 millimetres (1.06\u00a0in) respectively."

According to the Education Department there was damage to about 70 per cent of classrooms at Ocean Reef High School.

However his bravery is recognised by a Roman General and he is commissioned as a Roman Centurion. Black Hawk took his name from a Hawk that he adopted and assembled a crack platoon from hardened prisoners and other slaves. As with other Finley-Day war stories the basic plot was borrowed from The Dirty Dozen with Black Hawk's squad being singled out for the hardest missions. In 2000 AD he is taken from his Roman captors by an alien species only to be entered into their own intergalactic gladiatorial events against other alien species. Black Hawk adopts a Wookiee type alien as a sidekick (ironically the Hawk that gave him his name was left behind on earth). Black Hawk manages to escape but ends up stranded on a planet orbiting a black hole.  Here a creature called \"The SoulSucker\" removes Black Hawks soul and he pursues the SoulSucker relentlessly, eventually regaining it shortly before the end of the series run. Eventually, Tharg the Mighty's race were written in, as a robotic \"Kwark\" created by the \"Thargians\", and the whole cast were sucked into a black hole. They are later seen in Tharg's desk drawer, full of other dead or discarded characters, where Black Hawk complains how long they have been waiting as Ace Garp is selected for a revival.[2] In the 2000 AD Yearbook 1994 it was acknowledged by the editor that this was a poor series, and Alan Grant had written himself into a corner."

        "content": " On March 24, 2023, a severe weather and tornado outbreak began across portions of the lower Mississippi River Valley in the United States. A slow-moving trough moved eastward across the United States and interacted with a moist and unstable airmass originating from the Gulf of Mexico, resulting in widespread heavy rainfall, severe thunderstorms, and significant tornadoes over a four-day period. A violent high-end EF4 tornado moved through the towns of Rolling Fork, Midnight, and Silver City in western Mississippi, causing catastrophic damage and many fatalities.[1] Multiple tornado emergencies were issued for that tornado and two subsequent EF3 tornadoes from the same supercell that struck Winona and Amory.[7] Severe weather and tornadic activity continued into the early morning hours of March 25, as a squall line of severe storms with embedded circulations moved eastward across Tennessee and Alabama. A low-end EF2 tornado within the line killed a person in the northern part of Hartselle, Alabama. The slow-moving storm system then stalled the following day, producing more severe weather and tornadoes across portions of Alabama and Georgia from March 26 to March 27, including a couple of strong tornadoes. The outbreak also resulted in numerous reports of damaging straight-line winds, hail, and flooding.[8]"

        "content": "On March 18, the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) first indicated the potential for organized severe weather across the Southern Plains in advance of an upper-level trough across the Western United States.[9] Additional risk areas were issued to the east in later outlooks, concurrent with the eastward-moving trough.[10] By March 23, a level 2/Slight risk was hoisted from Texas northeastward into Missouri, primarily for the threat of large hail.[11] Scattered reports of large hail and damaging wind gusts were received from Texas across into the Mid-Atlantic states.[12] In addition, two EF1 tornadoes occurred in Parker County, Texas, during the early morning hours of March 24.[13] Farther to the east across the lower Mississippi River Valley, a more substantial threat for severe weather unfolded. On March 22, the SPC issued a level 3/Enhanced risk of severe weather across portions of Louisiana, Arkansas, and Mississippi, for supercell thunderstorms capable of large hail, damaging winds, and strong (EF2+) tornadoes.[14] The Enhanced risk was expanded northward the following day, and the original outlined area was upgraded to a level 4/Moderate risk.[15] On the morning of March 24, water vapor imagery depicted a potent mid-level trough over northern portions of the Baja California peninsula. The trough was expected to move quickly eastward, accompanied by strong mid-level winds between the trough and strong high-pressure area across the Southeastern United States. Meanwhile, a rapidly deepening low-pressure area was expected to drag a warm front northward, leading to a broad, unstable air mass to its south. Although some reduction in moisture was expected across Mississippi due to drier air aloft and warm surface temperatures into the 80s \u00b0F, continued advection of moist air from the Gulf of Mexico seemed supportive of dewpoints in the upper 60's and lower 70's across Louisiana, Arkansas, and Mississippi by the evening hours. Thus, mixed-layer convective available potential energy was expected to rise into the 1,500\u20132,000\u00a0J/kg range. Initial forecaster thinking was that strong forcing for ascent across Arkansas would lead to an organized squall line capable of both tornadoes and damaging winds, whereas more discrete supercells would be possible farther south,[16] particularly along north\u2013south oriented confluence bands in the open warm sector.[17] A tornado watch was issued shortly thereafter at 5:15\u00a0p.m. CDT for portions of eastern Arkansas, northeastern Louisiana, central and northern Mississippi, and western Tennessee. The watch mentioned the possibility of several strong to intense tornadoes with any persistent supercells.[18] Clusters of storms evolved along these bands in conjunction with improving wind shear profiles. However, given their displacement from the surface low and better forcing, there was some uncertainty as to whether they would become better organized.[19] A strengthening low-level jet and surface moisture increased confidence in the maturation of these cells,[20] but tornadic development had not yet begun in the area as of 0000 UTC. At their 0100 UTC outlook, the SPC lowered the probability of tornadoes to a 10% hatched tornado area, thus downgrading the moderate risk to an enhanced risk, citing that instability in the area was weaker than expected and that there was increased confidence in only limited buoyancy developing.[21] However, as the update was being issued, a significant supercell evolved across western Mississippi, producing a violent, long-tracked, and deadly high-end EF4 tornado that struck Rolling Fork, Midnight, and Silver City, inflicting catastrophic damage, and causing over a dozen fatalities.[22][23] Although this supercell became embedded within a line segment,[24] it soon produced another deadly tornado of EF3 strength that impacted Black Hawk and Winona, followed by another deadly EF3 tornado that struck New Wren and Amory.[25][26] To the north, an organized line of convection with embedded supercells moved across Tennessee and Alabama, and although its strength was inhibited by lower moisture and a lack of robust instability, it still produced damaging winds and several additional tornadoes into the early morning hours of March 25, including a low-end EF2 tornado that caused a fatality in the northern part of Hartselle, Alabama. A few lingering severe storms continued into the afternoon hours, resulting in two more weak EF0 tornadoes that occurred in southern Alabama and Georgia.[citation needed]"

        "content": "After the weather system responsible for the outbreak became stalled within the atmospheric region centered around central Mississippi and Alabama throughout March 25, the focus shifted to a new corridor for severe weather potential setting up across many of the same areas on March 26. In this corridor, which extended from Louisiana into western Georgia, CAPE values reaching into the 1500\u20132000 J/kg range, effective 50-knot wind shear, and elevated dew points were present, allowing for a favorable environment for the re-intensification of the system, and its segmentation into individual supercells. As such, the SPC issued a 4/5 moderate risk for this corridor at their 1630 UTC outlook, driven by both a 15%, hatched contour for strong (EF2+) tornadoes for the strongest cells and a 45%, hatched contour for very large (2+ inch diameter) hail. A 30% risk of damaging winds was specified in this outlook.[27] On the morning of March 26, supercells quickly developed, one of which produced an EF3 tornado that caused major damage in North West Point, Georgia. Additional significant tornadoes were expected to occur across portions of the threat area farther west, though mostly isolated weak tornadoes occurred. One EF2 tornado caused significant tree damage as it passed near Catherine, Alabama. However, these storms did produce widespread large to very large hail up to the size of baseballs (2.75\u00a0in (7.0\u00a0cm)) along with dozens of damaging wind reports.[28] A few additional isolated supercells continued into the early morning hours of March 27, one of which produced an EF2 tornado that struck Milstead, Alabama. A couple of additional weak tornadoes touched down before the outbreak came to an end.[citation needed]"

        "header": "Rolling Fork\u2013Midnight\u2013Silver City, Mississippi",
        "content": "This violent, deadly high-end EF4 tornado first touched down in Issaquena County southeast of Mayersville near the Mississippi River. It tracked northeastward over the Steele Bayou Canal and into Sharkey County, producing EF0 to EF1 damage to trees, power poles, and some outbuildings. The tornado then rapidly grew in size and reached EF2 strength as it approached Rolling Fork from the southwest, prompting the issuance of a tornado emergency. The tornado then became violent and reached EF4 intensity as it entered Rolling Fork, producing catastrophic damage throughout much of the town. Frame homes and duplexes were completely leveled or swept from their foundations, approximately 30 manufactured homes were obliterated, and copious amounts of structural debris was scattered throughout the community.[41] Several structures at an agriculture business, were completely flattened, the local library was completely destroyed, the Rolling Fork Police Department was nearly destroyed, while the fire station, post office, city hall, Rolling Fork Elementary School, South Delta High School were significantly damaged.[41] Multiple older brick buildings in downtown Rolling Fork also had major structural damage, with some well-built businesses and structures completely leveled with only piles of debris remaining. One of the town's water towers was toppled when flying debris compromised its base, leaving a crater where it impacted the ground. Some of the most violent damage occurred in the northeastern part of town, where a flower shop housed in a well-built brick building was completely leveled at high-end EF4 strength, with its concrete foundation slab being partially swept clean of debris. The survey team also noted that the tornado may have reached EF5 intensity here based on the damage to the shop, but the neighboring building was only leveled and not swept away, so there was not enough confidence in upgrading the tornado to EF5.[60] Several nearby homes were also obliterated and large metal-framed buildings, including a Family Dollar store, were completely flattened as well. Many vehicles were also thrown through the air and mangled, and numerous large trees in and around Rolling Fork were denuded and debarked, and a few of them were completely stripped clean of all bark.[61][62] After exiting Rolling Fork, the tornado remained violent as it moved across several open fields, where severe ground scouring occurred and debris from the town was scattered long distances to the northeast. Several utility poles were snapped off at the base or pulled out of the ground, and some were left covered in up to 1\u20132\u00a0in (2.5\u20135.1\u00a0cm) of mud. A few of the missing power poles were never found. Southeast of Anguilla, the tornado inflicted EF4-strength damage again to hardwood trees, with most completely mangled or debarked.[63] A mobile home was swept away and obliterated with very little debris remaining, and a bus on the property was tossed into trees. Aerial imagery of this area also revealed ground scouring and the presence of cycloidal marks in open fields. Beyond this point, the tornado caused widespread EF2 tree damage in wooded areas. It also destroyed a small frame home and a mobile home before regaining low-end EF3 intensity and mowing down large swaths of trees.[41] Maintaining low-end EF3 strength, the tornado then crossed into Humphreys County. The tornado briefly strengthened to high-end EF3 strength as it completely leveled a small brick home, and overturned a nearby grain loader. Grain bins were heavily damaged in this area as well, debris was scattered for hundreds of yards into a field, and a grain cart was thrown into the field as well. Passing through the small community of Midnight, the tornado produced EF2 damage as a home, a brick building sustained damage and trees and power poles were snapped. The tornado then moved northeast as it approached Silver City from the southwest. A mobile home was completely destroyed after being thrown 75\u00a0ft (23\u00a0m) into a nearby field, with only the porch being left behind. A portion of the roof was blown off a school, and two metal buildings were destroyed with large support beams bent and debris scattered across fields. Large areas of hardwood trees were snapped and uprooted.[41] The tornado then weakened some but continued causing significant damage as it moved into Silver City, where multiple apartment buildings suffered heavy roof damage, including some that had portions of their roofs removed and one that had its walls partially collapsed. Many homes throughout the town had extensive roof damage, some were completely unroofed, and a few sustained collapse of one or more exterior walls. Four manufactured homes were completely destroyed in the center of town, a church sustained roof damage, a large number of old hardwood trees were also snapped or uprooted, and power lines were downed as well. Damage in Silver City was rated EF1 to EF2 in intensity. After passing through Silver City, the tornado weakened and dissipated while causing EF1 to EF0 damage. In total, it traveled 59.4 miles (95.6\u00a0km) at an average forward speed of 50.19\u00a0mph (80.77\u00a0km/h), killing 17 people and injuring 165 others.[41][64][65][1]"

        "header": "Black Hawk\u2013Winona, Mississippi",
        "content": "Another intense, long-tracked, and extremely fast-moving tornado quickly formed after the Rolling Fork EF4 tornado dissipated, first touching down in Carroll County in a wooded area southwest of Black Hawk. It quickly intensified to low-end EF2 intensity shortly afterward, snapping or uprooting many trees as it moved to the northeast. The tornado then struck Black Hawk at mid-range EF3 intensity, crossing MS 430, County Road 235, and MS 17. Multiple residences in town sustained major structural damage, including a few homes that had their roofs torn off and exterior walls collapsed, while several other homes had extensive roof damage. The historic Blackhawk School was completely destroyed, and the nearby Black Hawk Independent Church was also destroyed, which had only portions of a few exterior walls left intact. The church's steeple was blown away, with the bell being thrown and not found, and a parsonage on the property was partially destroyed as well. A nearby well-built cinder block masonry building also suffered minor roof and doorway damage. A shed and an equipment trailer were rolled, and many trees were snapped or uprooted.[41] The tornado then exited Black Hawk and continued northeastward through densely forested areas for about 11 miles (18\u00a0km) passing southeast of Coila, causing widespread EF2 to EF3 tree damage. A few mobile homes, sheds, and camp houses were damaged or destroyed, including one home that was shifted off its piers and destroyed at mid-range EF3 intensity. Some other structures were damaged in areas that were inaccessible to survey teams due to downed trees.[67] The tornado then caused low-end EF2 damage to another home along Enon Road before producing another swath of EF3-level tree damage as it approached and crossed MS 35. Several mobile homes in this area suffered extensive roof damage or were shifted off their foundations with at least two mobile homes being destroyed. One of the destroyed mobile homes received a high-end EF2 rating after being ripped off its blocks and thrown 50 yards (46\u00a0m) into a nearby wooded area, obliterating it and killing the three occupants inside. An 18-wheeler tractor-trailer was blown over onto its side, and EF2 damage to trees occurred after the tornado crossed MS 35. Another structure northeast of this area was also destroyed, although it was only viewable through satellite imagery. Beyond this point, the tornado again caused EF2 to EF3 tree damage as it approached Montgomery County line. At some point in Carroll County, the tornado reached a peak intensity of high-end EF3, but an exact location for where this occurred was not specified.[41][67] Continuing northeastward, the tornado moved into Montgomery County and crossed I-55, again causing widespread EF2 to EF3 tree damage, although the most intense damage occurred in areas inaccessible to survey teams and could only be seen through satellite imagery.[41][67] The tornado then weakened slightly but remained strong as it approached Winona, where a tornado emergency was issued. It then impacted the southern outskirts of town and crossed US 51 and Stafford Wells Road at EF2 intensity. Many large trees were snapped or uprooted in this area and some metal buildings were heavily damaged. The tornado then reached EF3 intensity again along MS 407, where a well-built two-story home had its second floor mostly destroyed, its roof removed, and all of its exterior south-facing walls destroyed. Other homes in the area suffered extensive EF2 roof damage as well.[41][67] East of the town, the tornado continued to cause EF2 tree damage as it approached US 82. The tornado briefly reached mid-range EF3 intensity just before crossing the highway, destroying a home before knocking down numerous power lines along US 82 at EF2 intensity.[41][67] The tornado then briefly reached low-end EF3 intensity for the final time as it crossed the intersection of Bethlehem Community Road and Bethlehem Church Road where numerous trees were uprooted and snapped with some denuding and debarking observed in this area. It also inflicted major roof damage to a home, shifted another home off its foundation, and destroyed three outbuildings, one of which had its concrete foundation lifted upward and pivoted 15 to 20\u00a0ft (4.6 to 6.1\u00a0m); this damage was rated EF2.[41][67] The tornado then steadily weakened to EF1 intensity as it continued northeastward, causing considerable tree damage in wooded areas. As it approached Robinson-Thompson Road at a slightly stronger low-end EF2 intensity, the tornado destroyed an outbuilding and inflicted minor to moderate roof and siding damage to a 100-year-old home. It then abruptly weakened and dissipated as it crossed the road well southwest of Lodi after traveling for 29.43 miles (47.36\u00a0km) at an average forward speed of 58.9\u00a0mph (94.7\u00a0km/h). Along with the three deaths, five other people were injured.[41][67][68][69][70] According to the Mississippi Forestry Commission, more than 4,100 acres of forest were damaged or destroyed by this tornado.[67]"

        "header": "Egypt\u2013New Wren\u2013Amory\u2013Smithville, Mississippi",
        "content": "An intense, long-tracked, and extremely fast-moving EF3 tornado, which came from the same storm that produced the Rolling Fork EF4 and Black Hawk EF3 tornadoes, caused major damage in or near the communities of Egypt, New Wren, and Amory in Mississippi. The tornado first touched down southwest of Egypt in far eastern Chickasaw County. As the tornado travelled northeast across County Road 179 and US 45 Alternate, it produced EF0 to EF1 damage, snapping and uprooting numerous trees and overturning a metal carport. The tornado entered Monroe County and intensified to EF2 strength as it passed east of Egypt, destroying several single-wide mobile homes. Numerous utility poles and trees were snapped, cars were overturned, and a few other homes also suffered roof damage as well. Several injuries occurred in this area. The tornado remained at EF2 strength while continuing northeast of Egypt, snapping numerous additional trees and power poles, destroying an outbuilding, and inflicting roof damage to several homes. The tornado then began to intensify further, attaining high-end EF2 intensity as it reached McAllister Road and Herndon Lane, where several homes suffered significant damage, including a few that had roofs ripped off and some exterior walls collapsed. Multiple single and double-wide manufactured homes in this area were obliterated, with two people inside one of them being killed, and several people suffered significant injuries as well. In addition, many hardwood trees were snapped or uprooted in this area. As the tornado continued toward US 45 at high-end EF2 strength, it reached its peak width of 1,600 yards (1,500\u00a0m) and caused widespread damage to trees and homes along the west side of Whatley Road, including a mobile home that was destroyed and a frame home that was shifted off its foundation. Around this time, a tornado emergency was issued for New Wren and Amory.[41][67] As the tornado crossed US 45 at the intersection with Whatley Road and passed just south of New Wren, it reached low-end EF3 intensity, inflicting significant damage to numerous structures. One manufactured home was completely destroyed with debris thrown 200 yards (180\u00a0m) away, a nearby church was demolished, and some other homes sustained significant damage. In addition, power poles were snapped, some barns were heavily damaged, and residences along the outer edge of the damage path had more minor damage. Just beyond this point along Little Coontail Road, low-end EF3 damage continued as a house had its roof torn off and exterior walls collapsed, another home was largely leveled, and multiple manufactured homes were obliterated. A boat was tossed over 50 yards (46\u00a0m) and an SUV was thrown into a tree as well. The tornado then weakened slightly but remained strong, continuing northeastward at EF2 intensity and approaching the city of Amory. Severe tree damage continued to occur along this segment of the path, and some homes also sustained mainly minor roof damage as well.[41][67] The tornado then crossed over US 278 near where it intersected the Tennessee Tombigbee Waterway and entered Amory, intensifying to its peak intensity of mid-range EF3 as it crossed over the BNSF Railway Amory Subdivision line and MS 25. WTVA chief meteorologist Matt Laubhan prayed for the city in the name of Jesus live on TV as the debris signature moved into town.[72][73] Widespread significant damage was inflicted to homes, businesses, and trees throughout Amory, especially in the northern part of town. An Exxon gas station, Jack's restaurant, multiple churches, and a Piggly Wiggly grocery store all suffered major structural damage or were destroyed, along with other commercial buildings and businesses in town. Homes had roofs and exterior walls torn off, mobile homes were completely destroyed, apartment buildings were partially unroofed, a cell tower was blown over, and many trees and power poles were snapped. Some self-storage garages and metal industrial buildings were damaged or destroyed as well, and Amory High School had significant damage to its athletic fields. In all, about 115 businesses in Amory were damaged or destroyed. The tornado then weakened slightly but remained strong as it continued northeastward at EF2 strength, causing severe damage to a few homes and a National Guard armory near the Amory Golf Course as it exited town. Continuing to the northeast at EF2 strength, the tornado impacted trees, a few homes, and some other structures as it moved though rural areas. Near Parham Store Road, a trailer was thrown 250 yards (230\u00a0m) into a field, and a few homes sustained significant roof damage. Just beyond this point, the tornado weakened to EF1 intensity as it passed to the southeast of Smithville, inflicting roof damage to a couple of homes, damaging some outbuildings, and downing trees. The tornado continued to weaken and narrow as it approached and entered Itawamba County, causing only intermittent EF0 to EF1 tree damage before dissipating as it approached Wilson Road just west of the Alabama state line.[41] In total, two people were killed and 55 others were injured; all the casualties occurred in Monroe County.[74] The tornado traveled 36.91 miles (59.40\u00a0km) at an average forward speed of 71.4\u00a0mph (114.9\u00a0km/h). According to the Mississippi Forestry Commission, 975 acres of forest were damaged or destroyed by the tornado.[67]"

        "content": "This intense tornado touched down just east of the Alabama-Georgia border in Troup County northwest of West Point, Georgia and moved eastward, damaging trees at EF0 strength. After crossing the Chattahoochee River, the tornado rapidly intensified, producing major damage as it moved into the community of North West Point, and quickly reaching its peak intensity as it crossed US 29/SR 14. Four homes in this area were completely leveled, although they were anchored with nails rather than bolts, earning only a mid-range EF3 rating. Other homes in the area also sustained major structural damage, some of which had their roofs torn off or were left with only interior walls standing, and a manufactured home was completely destroyed. Numerous large trees in North West Point were uprooted, snapped, or sustained partial debarking, Bethel Baptist Church was partially destroyed, a small motel and several vehicles were heavily damaged, and debris was scattered throughout the area.[76][77] Still continuing eastward, the tornado exited North West Point and crossed over a CSX railway line into forested areas, snapping or uprooting a large swath of trees. After crossing Kia Parkway and I-85, the tornado weakened to EF1 strength as it moved along Lower Lovelace Road and crossed Johns Road, with damage in this area consisting of trees that were snapped or uprooted, and damage to an outbuilding. The tornado began to strengthen again as it crossed nearby Billings Road, causing up to EF2 damage as a home suffered major roof damage, and a masonry building sustained total destruction of its second floor. A manufactured home in this area also had its roof heavily damaged and was shifted off its foundation. The tornado strengthened further as it crossed Shoemaker Road, where three homes were largely destroyed with all of their exterior walls knocked down. One of the homes received a low-end EF3 rating while the other two were rated high-end EF2. The tornado then weakened and crossed Adams Road and Jarrell Hogg Road at EF1 intensity. Along this portion of the path, several homes and outbuildings were damaged, and many trees were snapped or uprooted.[41] Still continuing eastward, the tornado reached EF2 intensity again as it crossed Whitesville Road near its intersection of Ely Callaway Road. A house was completely unroofed, another house had extensive roof damage, and a more concentrated area of snapped and uprooted trees was noted. To the east, the tornado weakened back to EF1 strength as it passed south of the Smiths Mill community and moved across I-185. Damage along this segment of the path consisted almost entirely of downed trees, though there was minor damage to a few homes and outbuildings. Briefly strengthening back to EF2 intensity, the tornado snapped large tree trunks as it crossed Oak Grove Road, and also caused EF1 damage to two residences. It also caused damage at the Pine Mountain Wild Animal Safari in this area, where several animal enclosures were breached. Two tigers briefly escaped from one of the enclosures, but they were quickly found, tranquilized, and safely returned.[78] Additional trees were snapped or uprooted an EF1 intensity as it crossed over US 27 and Old Chipley Road. As the tornado neared the Meriwether County line, it produced one last area of EF2 damage at the Cherokee Resort Club, where more than 40 cabins sustained damage, and several were destroyed. After moving into Meriwether County, the tornado began a rapid weakening trend, causing only EF0 tree damage. The last area of damage that was found was at Robert Williams Road northeast of Pine Mountain, where a couple of trees were snapped. The tornado dissipated at this point just before crossing SR 18 west-southwest of Durand. In all, 146 homes were impacted by this tornado in Troup County; 23 of them were destroyed, 26 sustained major damage and 41 sustained minor damage. Additionally, several businesses were also heavily damaged or destroyed. The tornado remained on the ground for 21.7\u00a0mi (34.9\u00a0km) at an average forward speed of 43.4\u00a0mph (69.84\u00a0km/h), injuring five people.[41][79]"

        "content": "Typhoon Ivan, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Narsing, was an intense tropical cyclone that existed simultaneously with another storm of the same intensity, Typhoon Joan, in October 1997. Forming out of an area of disturbed weather on October\u00a013, Ivan gradually intensified into a typhoon as it tracked steadily to the west-northwest. On October\u00a015, the storm underwent rapid intensification and reached an intensity corresponding to Category 5 status on the Saffir\u2013Simpson Hurricane Scale. Late on October\u00a017, Ivan reached its peak strength with winds of 295\u00a0km/h (183\u00a0mph) and a barometric pressure of 905\u00a0hPa (mbar). Shortly thereafter, the typhoon began to weaken as it approached the Philippines. Ivan eventually made landfall in northern Luzon with winds of 220\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph) on October\u00a020 before weakening to a tropical storm the next day. The storm then curved northeastward and became extratropical on October\u00a025 and dissipating the following day. Although Ivan was a powerful storm at landfall, its effects were relatively minor compared to the storms' intensity; however, 14 people were killed during the storm and two others were listed as missing. Agricultural industries sustained the most severe damage, as thousands of animals drowned in the storm. Total damage was estimated at $9.6\u00a0million (1997 USD; $13.1\u00a0million 2009 USD). A total of 1,779 homes were destroyed, 13,771 others were damaged and 4,600 hectares of farmland were flooded by the storm."

        "content": "Typhoon Ivan originated from an area of disturbed weather near the equator during the first week of October 1997. Two equatorial troughs, one in the Northern Hemisphere and one in the Southern Hemisphere developed from this system. Three resultant areas of low pressure formed; one in the Southern Hemisphere developed into Tropical Cyclone Lusi on October\u00a08, and two north of the equator steadily tracked westward. The eastern low developed into Typhoon Joan, while the western cyclone became the system that would intensify into Typhoon Ivan. Situated in an environment without significant convective activity, this system initially struggled to become organized.[1] However, the disturbance began to mature, and by October\u00a011, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) discovered a low-level circulation center, prompting the issuance of a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert the following day.[1] The system quickly tracked toward the west-northwest at a forward speed of 33\u00a0km/h (21\u00a0mph). The JTWC issued their first advisory on the storm early on October\u00a013, designating it Tropical Depression 27W.[1] Around this time, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) also classified the cyclone as a tropical depression.[2] Convective banding features developed late on October\u00a013. The JTWC upgraded the depression to a tropical storm and gave it the name Ivan.[1] Early the next day, the JMA also upgraded Ivan to a tropical storm.[2] Later on October\u00a014, Ivan passed roughly 100\u00a0km (62\u00a0mi) south of Guam and subsequently intensified.[1] Several hours afterwards, the JMA upgraded Ivan to a typhoon.[2] During a 24-hour span, Ivan's winds increased from 120 to 270\u00a0km/h (75 to 168\u00a0mph), making it a Category 5 super typhoon, the eighth of the season, as well as being a twin Category 5 with Joan. Late on October\u00a017, Ivan attained its peak intensity with winds of 295\u00a0km/h (183\u00a0mph) and an official barometric pressure of 905\u00a0hPa (mbar).[1][2] However, the JTWC reported an unofficial pressure of 872\u00a0hPa (mbar), which would tie Ivan for the second strongest tropical cyclone worldwide with Typhoons Gay, Angela, Joan, Keith, Zeb and Hurricane Patricia.[1] Due to the storm's proximity to Typhoon Joan, forecast models anticipated Ivan to re-curve before reaching the Philippines; however, the storm maintained its track and did not take the northward turn until impacting the country. The typhoon began to slow and weaken, and on October\u00a020, its center made landfall in extreme northern Luzon with winds of 220\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph). After emerging into the Luzon Strait, Ivan turned to the north-northeast and weakened to a tropical storm. On October\u00a022, the storm briefly re-attained typhoon status before accelerating in forward speed. The system steadily weakened and the JTWC issued their final advisory on the storm on October\u00a024.[1] The JMA continued to monitor Ivan as a tropical cyclone for another day before classifying it as extratropical. The remnants of the powerful typhoon eventually dissipated on October\u00a026.[2]"

Disaster agencies were put on high alert; relief supplies were then stockpiled, the navy was placed on standby, and military search and rescue vehicles were prepped.[5] On October\u00a020, Ivan made landfall in the northern Philippines, producing torrential rains that triggered waist-deep flooding in localized areas. Severe crop losses were reported throughout northern Luzon. One person drowned in floodwaters in Cagayan.[3] Elsewhere in the country, two other people drowned in floodwaters. Numerous power lines and trees were downed throughout the region, rain-triggered landslides blocked several roads.[7] Throughout the country, a total of 14 people were killed and two others were listed as missing.[8] Poultry farms and fisheries sustained significant damage; an estimated $3.6\u00a0million in losses resulted from lost stocks in the two businesses.[7] Several thousand animals drowned during the storm.[9] Total damage was estimated at $9.6\u00a0million (1997 USD; $13.1\u00a0million 2009 USD). A total of 1,779 homes were destroyed, 13,771 others were damaged[8] and 4,600 hectares of croplands were inundated by Typhoon Ivan.[10] Rainfall from the storm was considered to be helpful as the area impacted had been suffering from below average rainfall for several months.[11] Minor damage was also reported in the Marshall Islands. The island of Tiyan recorded 5.26\u00a0in (134\u00a0mm) of precipitation,[12] contributing to above-average rainfall during the month of October.[13]"

It formed on October 31, 1997, in the South China Sea, between Indochina and the Philippines. Strengthening as it moved westward, Linda struck extreme southern Vietnam on November 2 with winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h), dropping heavy rainfall. Once in the Gulf of Thailand it strengthened further to minimal typhoon status, but weakened to tropical storm strength before crossing the Malay Peninsula into the Bay of Bengal, the first storm to do so in five years. It restrengthened in the Indian Ocean to typhoon status, but increasing wind shear and weakened steering currents caused Linda to dissipate on November 9. The worst of Linda's impact was in Vietnam, where 3,111 people were killed, and damage totaled $385 million (USD). Heavy rainfall caused flooding, which damaged or destroyed about 200,000 houses and left about 383,000 people homeless. Widespread crop and transportation damage also occurred, the latter which impeded relief efforts. Several countries around the world sent relief aid, including medical teams, food, and clothing. However, the food supply and health status of the storm victims proved not as bad as originally feared. Linda later struck Thailand, causing flash flooding and at least 164 deaths. The storm also affected Burma (Myanmar), Indonesia, Malaysia, and Cambodia to a lesser degree."

        "content": "The origins of Typhoon Linda were from an area of convection that were first noted east of the Philippines on October 26. A subtropical ridge persisted to the north, which caused the disturbance to move generally westward. On October 29, the system crossed the Philippines and entered the South China Sea. It subsequently began to organize, and late on October 31, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) initiated advisories on Tropical Depression 30W. At that time, the system was located off the northwest coast of Borneo.[1] The PAGASA organization named it \"Openg\".[2] Shortly after developing, the depression intensified into a tropical storm, and was named \"Linda\" by the JTWC. It continued to intensify, reaching winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) as it approached southern Vietnam. At 0900 UTC on November 2, Linda made landfall in the Vietnamese province of C\u00e0 Mau. It maintained its strength over land, and the storm quickly reached typhoon status after entering the Gulf of Thailand; a typhoon is a tropical cyclone with winds of at least 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h), although Linda did not intensify beyond minimal typhoon status. Turning northwestward, Linda deteriorated to tropical storm strength, and struck Thailand late on November 3 with winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h).[1] Linda weakened further over the mountainous terrain of the Malay Peninsula, and the storm emerged into the Andaman Sea with winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h). This made Linda the first tropical cyclone since Tropical Storm Forrest in 1992 to cross from the western Pacific Ocean into the Indian Ocean.[1] Additionally, upon reaching the Indian Ocean, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) classified the storm as Cyclonic Storm BOB 08, with winds of 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h).[3] With warm waters, Tropical Storm Linda gradually re-intensified as it slowed down, due to a weakness in the subtropical ridge. On November 6, it again attained typhoon status while located off the southwest coast of Burma (Myanmar).[1] Initially, it was expected to cross the Bay of Bengal and make landfall near the India/Bangladesh border.[4] The cyclone only maintained peak strength for 18\u00a0hours, due to an increase in wind shear from a mid-latitude trough. Linda's motion became nearly stationary, and it gradually weakened for several days. On November 9, Linda dissipated about 375 miles (604\u00a0km) southwest of Yangon, Burma.[1] That day, the IMD also terminated advisories.[3]"

Tropical Storm Linda dropped heavy rainfall across southern Vietnam, peaking at 9.17 inches (23.3\u00a0cm) in C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1.[5] The storm caused heavy damage in the country, particularly in the southernmost province of C\u00e0 Mau where it struck,[1] but also in B\u1ea1c Li\u00eau, S\u00f3c Tr\u0103ng, and Ki\u00ean Giang.[6] The most severely affected regions were poor fishing communities.[7] Overall, the storm damaged 139,445\u00a0houses and wrecked 76,609 more,[8] which left 383,045 people homeless.[9] Thousands of schools were damaged, and 130,815\u00a0dykes were breached.[5] Additionally, the storm destroyed at least 3,122\u00a0boats.[8] The rainfall also flooded 1,750 square miles (4,500\u00a0km2) of rice paddy crop, about half of which in C\u00e0 Mau.[10] A preliminary damage total was estimated at 7.18 trillion dongs (US$385 million).[11] Typhoon Linda caused considerable deaths in Vietnam. Many fishermen and sailors were caught at sea in the path of the storm,[1] unable to escape its path.[5] Within three days, the death toll in Vietnam was set at over 150, with thousands missing,[4] many of them fishermen.[10] By the fourth day after the storm, the toll reached 390,[6] and on November 14, eight days after the storm, the death toll reached 464.[8] Ultimately, the death toll was set at 3,111.[11] Eight days after Linda's passage, a United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA) report indicated 857\u00a0people were injured by the storm.[8] The government quickly established search and rescue teams, particularly for missing fishermen, and a total of 3,513 people were rescued after the storm.[5] In the weeks after the storm, hundreds of dead bodies washed ashore in Vietnam and Thailand.[12] The Vietnamese government identified basic supplies that it needed in response to the storm; those included various foods, clothing, medicine, shelter supplies, and sanitation equipment.[6] The country made a formal request for international assistance, noting that the storm was the worst in 100\u00a0years, and officials had limited resources due to the unexpected destruction.[5] Prior to the request, the government of Switzerland sent about 500,000 Swiss francs (US$360,000) for immediate relief assistance.[10] Subsequently, ten other countries sent cash or relief supplies worth $2.6 million, including medical shelters from the United States, clothing from the United Kingdom, tents from Russia, and transport goods from Japan.[5] Red Cross workers had to travel by riverboat to bring aid to the most affected communities,[7] due to the poor state of the roads.[12] After two months, the Red Cross distributed 65,401 roofing sheets, 390 metric tons of rice, 11,990 mosquito nets, 6,871 blankets, 3,664 medical kits, and abundant clothing supplies to about 150,000 affected people; the supplies were purchased in Ho Chi Minh City. Eventually, the food supply and health status of the storm victims proved not as bad as originally feared. After the assistance was distributed, the Red Cross shifted focus toward reconstruction. Reconstruction was slow, partly due to a slowdown in economic activity from the Vietnamese New Year. Additionally, the two primary factories responsible for making iron and construction frames were only intermittently open, due to machines failing.[13][14] Elsewhere, moderate damage was also reported in Thailand,[1] where at least 12 casualties were reported on land,[12] and at least 152 fishermen were killed at sea.[15] Flash flooding occurred in six districts, which damaged about 88 square miles (230\u00a0km2) of croplands and destroyed 12 houses. Land transportation was affected, with 184 roads and 14 bridges damaged. The government of Thailand sent 20 medical teams to the most affected areas.[16] Following the storm, about 10,600\u00a0people became sick from flood related diseases.[17] Heavy rains fell in Tanintharyi Division in southeastern Burma (Myanmar), although because the winds were not strong, there was little damage. The typhoon increased smog and haze in Indonesia and Malaysia, which had been occurring for weeks. In Indonesia, the typhoon also removed atmospheric moisture, which lowered the chance for rain in areas affected by wildfires.[4] Cambodia was also affected by the outskirts of the storm.[10]"

Nearer suburbs of Lyublino and Karacharovo were completely demolished too. Many witnesses in Moscow, including the journalist Vladimir Gilyarovsky, report the same picture of the advancing storm: an unusual black cloud, 15\u201320 kilometers wide, advanced from south-east at estimated 25 meters per second (no instrumental wind readings were made). The tornado was preceded by a hailstorm and a sudden drop in temperature. Two black funnels, one from the sky, the other from the ground, merged into a wide tornado with a yellow fire-like light in the middle. Witnesses mistook this light for an explosion at some oil tanks that, indeed, were close to the path of tornado, but were spared from destruction. The tornado broke into the city proper in Lefortovo District, destroying the freight yard of the Kursk railroad, then shaving off the Annenhof Forest \u2013 an old, neglected park in Lefortovo (north of the present-day Aviamotornaya subway station). It passed through the Lefortovo barracks, tearing roofs from masonry buildings, passed over the Basmanny District into Sokolniki Park and left the city in a northward direction. Apparently, the tornado faded away, thus destruction in the densely populated Basmanny was far less than in Lefortovo."

As Pabuk continued to move to the northwest, it gained some organisation as it slowly developed outflow.[4] It was upgraded by the JMA to a severe tropical storm on August 6. Moving westwards towards Taiwan, an area of convection south of Pabuk separated and formed its own low-level circulation. Pabuk's upper-level outflow inhibited this new area of convection. Strengthening slightly, Pabuk was upgraded to a typhoon on the morning of August 7. The JTWC downgraded Pabuk to a tropical storm later that day, with the JMA downgrading Pabuk shortly before landfall. It made landfall in southern Taiwan around 1630 UTC according to Taiwan radar and crossed the southern tip of the Hengchun Peninsula in Pingtung County. The JTWC re-upgraded Pabuk to a typhoon at its next advisory, however, citing a small eye at landfall,[5] before downgrading it to a tropical storm again three hours later.[6] After passing over Taiwan, Pabuk took aim at Hong Kong.[7] On August 9 as the system passed to the south of Hong Kong JMA downgraded the storm to a tropical depression later that day and issued its final public advisory, with the JTWC following suit shortly after. The tropical depression then turned back to the east-northeast on August 10,[8] intensifying while taking aim at Hong Kong. It skirted to the west of Hong Kong and dissipated while heading northeast into the mainland."

Typhoon Ellen was first noted as a tropical disturbance east of the International Date Line on August 26, 1983, and became a tropical storm soon after crossing the dateline on the morning of August 29. Initially, strong wind shear inhibited development over the next five days, and the cyclone began to track south of west. On September 2, conditions aloft finally improved and the cyclone strengthened into a typhoon on September 4 as it tracked west-northwest. Approaching Luzon late on September 5, Ellen intensified rapidly into a strong typhoon with winds of 200\u00a0km/h (125\u00a0mph) before interaction with Luzon began to weaken the cyclone. Its final landfall was at Portuguese Macau on the morning of September 9 as a minimal typhoon. The next day, Ellen ceased to exist. Despite passing north of the Philippines, the storm killed three and left 15 persons injured. Damage in the country totaled $680,000 (1983 USD). While passing near British Hong Kong, 50,000 people lost electrical services. Around 200 homes were destroyed; a total 2,000 people lost their homes, 1,600 of whom sought shelter. Throughout the city, eight people perished and 339 were hurt, including 120 seriously. Ellen spawned the second tornado ever recorded in Hong Kong, and the first ever recorded during a typhoon. Elsewhere, in Portuguese Macau, little damage was reported. Offshore, 40 crew members were rescued in a shipwreck. In a separate incident, eight people were lost at sea. Furthermore, ten Taiwan fishing boats capsized in the South China Sea, resulting in 48 fishermen missing, though 103 persons also survived. Overall, damage totaled $79 million and 23 people died."

        "content": "Typhoon Ellen originated from a tropical disturbance located 500\u00a0km (310\u00a0mi) south-southwest of the Johnston Atoll on August 26. Based on the development of rainbands, satellite intensity estimates via the Dvorak technique indicated winds of 55\u00a0km/h (35\u00a0mph). The disturbance crossed the dateline two days later and a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) was subsequently issued. At 0000 UTC on August 29, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) first classified the system. Initially, the storm did not develop significantly due to strong wind shear caused by an intense high pressure area north of the cyclone. This also caused Ellen to turn west-southwest.[1] On August 31, however, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started warning on the system, declaring it a tropical storm.[2][nb 1] The next day, the JTWC briefly downgraded the system into a tropical depression;[1] however, the JMA held the storm's intensity to 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph) for several days.[2] On September 2, the storm began to turn west-northwest and environmental conditions became much more favorable for development.[1] The JMA upgraded Ellen into a severe tropical storm early the following morning.[2] Later on September 3, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PASAGA) started tracking the storm and assigned it with the local name Herming.[4] At 1200 UTC, the JTWC upgraded Ellen into a typhoon,[1] though the JMA did not follow suit until early on September 4.[2] After maintaining this intensity for 12 hours, Ellen deepened slightly that evening,[2] though the JTWC suggests that the storm intensified into a Category 2 hurricane on the United States Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.[1] By midday on September 5, data from both agencies indicated that Ellen developed winds 110\u00a0mph (175\u00a0km/h) while located 370\u00a0km (230\u00a0mi) west of Luzon.[1][2] Thereafter, Ellen began to rapidly intensify and according to the JTWC, the pressure decreased by 28\u00a0mbar (0.83\u00a0inHg).[1] At 0600 UTC on September 6, Ellen reached peak intensity, with the JMA estimating winds of 120\u00a0mph (195\u00a0km/h) and a pressure of 925\u00a0mbar (27.3\u00a0inHg).[2] Meanwhile, the JTWC suggests that Ellen reached a peak intensity of 125\u00a0mph (200\u00a0km/h) and a slightly higher pressure of 928\u00a0mbar (27.4\u00a0inHg).[1] Ellen's peak intensity was short-lived; Typhoon Ellen soon began to weaken steadily as it moved through the Luzon Straits while interacting with Luzon.[1] After turning northwest, the JMA reported the winds had reduced to 90\u00a0mph (145\u00a0km/h) at 0000 UTC on September 7.[2] At that time, the JTWC noted that Ellen's winds were equivalent to a Category 2 hurricane.[1] However, the JMA suggests that the weakening trend leveled off late on September 7.[2] The next day, PASAGA ceased monitoring the system as it was no longer a threat to the Philippines.[4] According to the JMA, the system moved ashore near Macao at 0000 UTC on September 9 as an 85\u00a0mph (135\u00a0km/h) typhoon,[2] though the JTWC estimates that the storm was a little weaker at landfall. Ellen dissipated rapidly overland, and the JTWC downgraded Ellen into a tropical depression 12 hours later.[1] However, the JMA kept watching the system until 0600 UTC on September 10.[2]"

Damage in the country totaled $680,000. A total of 605 dwellings were damaged, excluding 105 that were destroyed.[4][nb 2] Upon making landfall in present-day China[clarify], winds gusted to 154\u00a0km/h (96\u00a0mph) at Stanley. Rainfall totaled 231.8\u00a0mm (9.13\u00a0in) at Hong Kong's Royal Observatory (RO or ROHK, now HKO).[8] Twenty-two ships were wrecked, including a 21,000-ton freighter,[9] forcing the rescue of all 40 crew members.[10] A 185\u00a0ft (56\u00a0m) yacht Osprey carried nine people, eight of which were lost[11] and presumed dead.[12] Several minor collisions were reported between ships.[13] Along the coastal province Guandong in southern China, communications and public services were disrupted.[9] Ferry services from Hong Kong to Macao were suspended.[14] On September 8, ten Taiwan fishing boats capsized in the South China Sea; consequently, 48 fishermen were missing,[15] though 103 persons survived and later took refuge at Pratas Island, Taiwan (ROC).[16][17] In Hong Kong, 50,000 people lost power.[18] About 200 houses were destroyed.[19] More than 2,000 people were left homeless;[20] 1,600 of the homeless sought emergency shelter. Flights to the Kai Tak Airport were cancelled[5] as the airport was closed for 12 hours.[21] Large areas of farmland were damaged.[22] Throughout the city, eight people perished, including a girl that was crushed by a falling cabinet.[18] Two sisters were killed via a landslide while a fireman died when trying to rescue someone.[23] Additionally, 339 people were injured,[24] including 120 seriously.[25] Forty-five people were injured due to flying glass and failing objects.[26] Typhoon Ellen also spawned the second tornado ever recorded in Hong Kong, and the first ever recorded during the passage of a typhoon. According to the HKO, Ellen was Hong Kong's worst typhoon since Typhoon Hope of 1979.[8] In nearby Macao, minor property damage was reported[5] and 15 people were initially rendered as missing.[27] However, by October 13, 10 people remained missing and were then presumed dead.[12] In all, damage totaled $79 million (1983 USD)[20] and 20 people were killed due to Typhoon Ellen in mainland China.[28]"

On December 13, a high-end EF1 tornado was caught on video from multiple angles as it caused considerable damage in Grapevine, Texas, where five people were injured, and multiple EF2 tornadoes caused significant damage in other parts of Texas and Oklahoma that morning. Two large EF2 tornadoes occurred near DeBerry, Texas and Keachi, Louisiana to the southwest of Shreveport, Louisiana, with the second one causing severe damage and two fatalities.[4][5] An EF3 tornado struck the northern fringes of Farmerville, causing major structural damage and 14 injuries. Multiple strong tornadoes occurred across parts of the Gulf Coast region on December 14, and another fatality was confirmed in St. Charles Parish, Louisiana as a result of an EF2 tornado that struck Killona.[6] Another damaging EF2 tornado impacted the New Orleans metro, following a path similar to a high-end EF3 tornado from March 22, 2022. A total of 77 tornadoes were confirmed, making this the second largest outbreak on record for the month of December, with the first being recorded in December 2021.[7] In addition, this tornado outbreak gave Oklahoma their most active December for tornadoes on record.[8]"

        "content": "On December 12, the Storm Prediction Center outlined a level 2/Slight risk of severe weather for parts of Southwestern Kansas, Western Oklahoma, and Northern Texas. A brief window for discrete supercells was forecasted, with a risk for all hazards (tornadoes, damaging winds, and large hail) before a transition to a linear mode with a risk for embedded tornadoes and damaging winds.[9] A few supercells developed, producing two weak tornadoes in Oklahoma, neither of which caused any damage. On December\u00a013, as the associated longwave trough ejected eastwards, the Storm Prediction Center outlined a level 3/Enhanced risk of severe weather across eastern Texas, much of Louisiana, and southwestern sections of Mississippi. Environmental conditions were expected to favor the development of semi-discrete supercell thunderstorm structures, with an attendant risk for strong (EF2+) tornadoes. A broader level 2/Slight risk encompassed a larger share of the South Plains, particularly around the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex where some questions about the level of instability existed but wind shear profiles were conducive for severe weather.[10] During the pre-dawn hours, a broken line of atmospheric convection with embedded supercell structures progressed eastward across North Texas. Here, temperatures in the mid- to upper 60s Fahrenheit overlapped with dewpoints in the low to mid-60s, contributing to modest surface convective available potential energy of 500\u20131,000\u00a0J/kg. Combined with strong shear profiles,[11] atmospheric conditions led to the development of several tornadoes across the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex throughout the morning hours.[12] By the early afternoon hours, a surface low-pressure area moved into northeastern Texas, supporting a cold front to the southwest and a warm front to the southeast.[13] In the warm sector of this low, temperatures climbed to upwards of the mid-70s while dewpoints reached the upper 60s; this contributed to mid-level CAPE around 1,000\u00a0J/kg. Discrete supercells developed within this environment, tracking northeastward with time.[14] As these storms overspread northern and central Louisiana into the afternoon hours, forecasters warned of the potential for renewed supercell development given the approach of the upper-level trough,[15] both in Louisiana as well as Mississippi.[16] All the while, the SPC renewed a level 3/Enhanced risk valid for December\u00a014 across the Gulf Coast, continuing to highlight a large area for the potential of long-lived supercells capable of producing strong tornadoes.[17] With time, discrete activity across the region congealed into an eastward-moving line of convection across portions of Louisiana and Mississippi.[18] However, as the shortwave trough progressed eastward, strengthening wind fields in a warm sector increasingly destabilized by daytime heating, the SPC became increasingly concerned about the potential for this line to break down into discrete cells.[19] The potential for numerous tornadic supercells to develop prompted the issuance of a level 4/Moderate risk across southeastern Louisiana, southern Mississippi, and western/southern Alabama.[20] As expected, numerous discrete supercells developed across the open warm sector in eastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi,[21] where forecasters outlined a Particularly Dangerous Situation tornado watch and warned of the potential for a few intense tornadoes.[22] These cells eventually congealed into a line of five or six dominant supercells.[23] As the threat area shifted eastward with time, additional supercells developed in the northern Gulf of Mexico. These thunderstorms progressed northeastward into the Florida Panhandle, southern Alabama, and southwestern Georgia.[24]"

        "content": "This intense low-end EF3 tornado touched down west of Farmerville, initially snapping or uprooting numerous trees at EF1 strength, some of which ended up falling on multiple homes. Moving northeast, the tornado then began to intensify as it crossed LA 2 and Lake D'Arbonne. A two-story home sustained high-end EF2 damage at this location, sustaining loss of its roof and destruction of most of its second story. Two injuries occurred inside the two-story home. EF1 damage occurred nearby, as some outbuildings and shop buildings were destroyed as well.[119] The tornado then tracked back across Lake D'Arbonne before coming ashore at Corney Creek Drive and Dozier Road. Several residences were damaged by falling trees in this area, a cabin was destroyed by a combination of falling trees and wind from the tornado, and damage in this area was rated EF1 to EF2. The tornado then moved through a forested area and caused 2\u00a0mi (3.2\u00a0km) of tree damage that was unable to be surveyed by the National Weather Service damage survey team.[119] While in this unsurveyable stretch, the tornado grew to its peak width of 500 yards (460\u00a0m).[119] Continuing at EF2 intensity, the tornado crossed Denton Road where multiple outbuildings and mobile homes were demolished, including one double-wide mobile home that was thrown and completely destroyed, with five injuries reported. Two frame homes had their roofs torn off, and also sustained some damage to their exterior walls.[119] Additionally, power poles were snapped and major tree damage occurred, with some debarking observed. The tornado continued causing significant tree damage as it continued northeast towards the Union Village Apartments, located along the northern outskirts of Farmerville.[note 2][119] As the tornado entered the apartment complex, it reached its peak intensity and maintained a width of 400 to 500 yards (370 to 460\u00a0m).[119] Dozens of one-story brick apartment buildings were severely damaged and had large portions of their roofs torn off, and vehicles were flipped as well. One apartment building sustained total roof loss and collapse of multiple exterior walls, earning a rating of EF3 with winds estimated at 140 miles per hour (230\u00a0km/h).[119] Despite the intense damage, it was believed the strongest core of the tornadic winds only clipped the south end of the apartment complex, where the EF3 damage occurred.[119] Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards later said out of the 74 units at this apartment complex, only 12 of them were habitable following the tornado. Adjacent to the Union Village Apartments, 7 out of the 9 mobile homes at a mobile home park were thrown and destroyed.[119] After exiting the apartment complex and mobile home park, the tornado then entered another heavily forested area, most of which the not accessible to the National Weather Service damage survey team. However, numerous trees were snapped along this segment of the path, and an EF2 rating was applied at this location.[119] After exiting the forested area, the tornado then significantly weakened, with only EF1 and EF0 tree and structural damage being observed for the remaining mile of the tornado's track. After that, the tornado dissipated. In total, at least fourteen people were injured by the tornado.[119][120]"

        "content": " Typhoon Holly, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Isang,[1] affected South Korea, Japan, and the Soviet Union during August\u00a01984. Holly originated from the monsoon trough that extended eastward from its original position in mid-August\u00a01984. Over a period of several days, the system slowly became better organized as it tracked westward, although the system did not initially develop a well-defined center. On August\u00a015, a tropical depression was declared, and on the next day, the depression was upgraded into Tropical Storm Holly. Holly slowly gained strength, becoming a typhoon on August\u00a017 as it passed near Okinawa. The typhoon turned northwest and then north as it rounded a subtropical ridge. At noon on August\u00a019, Holly attained its peak intensity of 130\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph). Shortly after its peak, Holly accelerated northeast due to the westerlies in the general direction of the Korean Peninsula. Land interaction with South Korea triggered a weakening trend, and after entering the Sea of Japan, Holly began to transition into an extratropical cyclone. Thunderstorm activity quickly decreased near the center, and by August\u00a021, Holly had completed its extratropical transition. In advance of the typhoon, ferry service between Jeju and mainland South Korea was called off, prompting 800\u00a0fishing\u00a0boats to seek shelter. Throughout South Korea, nine people were killed or missing and hundreds lost their homes. At least 10\u00a0fishing\u00a0boats were destroyed and hundreds of hectares of farmland were inundated. Across the Ryukyu Islands, 15,000\u00a0air\u00a0travelers were stranded, including 14,000 from Okinawa when 23\u00a0flights were canceled. Between the Ryukyu Islands and the rest of Japan, ferry service was discontinued for two days, which resulted in 21,000\u00a0stranded\u00a0passengers. Overall, one person was killed due to high waves in Nagasaki Prefecture, nine were listed as missing, and eleven were wounded. In all, damage was estimated at US$1\u00a0million. The extratropical remnants caused significant flooding in the Russian Far East. Water levels around Khabarovsk rose 10\u00a0m (33\u00a0ft) along the Amur River, resulting in the evacuation of 64\u00a0families, although 2,000 cows and pigs remain stranded. Elsewhere, in Arkhara, a dam along the Amur River burst, which caused the worst flooding in the region since 1928 and resulted in the evacuation of many isolated children by helicopter."

        "content": "While Tropical Storm Gerald was forming in the South China Sea, the Western Pacific monsoon trough extended eastward in the middle of August\u00a01984. By noon on August\u00a013, the monsoon trough extended from Tropical Depression 9W to just northwest of Guam, and within 36\u00a0hours, this trough moved northwest and became sharper, with surface barometric pressures of 1000\u00a0mbar (30\u00a0inHg) and winds of 40 to 50\u00a0km/h (25 to 30\u00a0mph). Organization of the convection gradually improved and satellite imagery indicated that a surface low was forming. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) at 15:15\u00a0UTC on August\u00a014. At 00:00\u00a0UTC on the next day, a Hurricane Hunter aircraft investigated the system, measuring a pressure of 998\u00a0mbar (29.5\u00a0inHg).[2] This prompted the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) to upgrade the low into a tropical depression.[3][nb 1] At noon on August\u00a015, synoptic data suggested that the system did not have a closed circulation; however, ship reports suggested that it was producing gale-force winds at the time. Early on August\u00a016, a second aircraft investigated the system, finding a pressure of 992\u00a0mbar (29.3\u00a0inHg) and a closed circulation.[2] This promoted the JTWC to classify the system as Tropical Storm Holly while the JMA upgraded Holly directly to severe tropical storm.[5][nb 2] Despite its large size, Holly slowly deepened,[2] and  was upgraded to a typhoon by the JMA at noon on August\u00a017.[3] Nevertheless, Holly remained fairly disorganized, with aircraft observing light winds near the center and the strongest winds located in a rainband 110 to 280\u00a0km (70 to 175\u00a0mi) northeast from the center. It was not until August\u00a018 that aircraft observed surface wind gusts of over 95\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph).[2] At 00:00\u00a0UTC that day, the JTWC upgraded Holly into a typhoon while the storm was located near Okinawa.[7] After initially tracking westward under the influence of a subtropical ridge, Holly turned northwest for about a 30\u00a0hour period before turning north as it rounded the western side of the ridge.[2] At noon on August\u00a019, the JTWC reported that Holly attained its peak intensity of 135\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph) while the JMA reported that Holly reached its highest winds of 130\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph) and a minimum pressure of 960\u00a0mbar (28\u00a0inHg). Shortly after its peak, Holly turned northeast while also accelerating in response to the westerlies, which sent the storm across the Korean Straits on a collision course with the Korean Peninsula. Land interaction with South Korea resulted in a weakening trend, with both the JTWC and JMA downgrading Holly to a tropical storm. Upon entering the Sea of Japan, Holly began to transition into an extratropical cyclone. The low-level circulation quickly became exposed from the center, and what little convection remained was far removed from the center, and attached to a cold front.[2] At 06:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a021, Holly was declared extratropical by the JMA,[3] with the JTWC following suit 12 hours later.[2] Two days later, the JMA had ceased tracking the cyclone altogether.[3]"

Ferry service between Cheju and the mainland was canceled due to the impeding threat of rough seas,[8] prompting 800\u00a0fishing\u00a0boats to seek shelter.[8] Throughout South Korea, nine people were killed or missing and hundreds lost their homes. At least 10\u00a0fishing\u00a0boats were demolished, hundreds of hectares of farmland were flooded, and several homes were damaged.[7] In some places of the southern portion of the island of Kyushu, forecasters anticipated that up to 280\u00a0mm (11\u00a0in) of rain could fall.[9] Across the Ryukyu Islands, 15,000\u00a0air\u00a0travelers were stranded.[10] In Naha, the main city in Okinawa, an estimated 14,000\u00a0tourists were stranded when all 23\u00a0scheduled\u00a0flights to Japanese main islands were canceled.[9] Between the Ryukyu Islands and the Japanese mainland, ferry service was called off for two days, resulting in 21,000\u00a0stranded\u00a0passengers.[8] Further north, in Itsuki, 31\u00a0people lost their homes. Forty-one flights were cancelled in Miyazaki Prefecture, which caused an additional 4,200\u00a0stranded travelers.[11] Overall, the storm dropped heavy rainfall across much of Japan.[12] A peak rainfall total of 708\u00a0mm (27.9\u00a0in) occurred at Ebino, including 338\u00a0mm (13.3\u00a0in) in a day.[13] Within 24\u00a0hours, 433\u00a0mm (17.0\u00a0in) of rain fell in Mount Yonaha, including 48\u00a0mm (1.9\u00a0in) an hour.[14] Moreover, a wind gust of 108\u00a0km/h (67\u00a0mph) was recorded in Mount Yonaha[15] while further south, wind gusts of 95\u00a0mph (153\u00a0km/h) were recorded in Okinawa.[9] Nation-wide, one person was killed due to high waves in Nagasaki,[16] nine were listed as missing,[2] and eleven were wounded, including nine in Okinawa and the western prefectures of Kumamoto, Nagaski, Yamaguchi, and Hiroshima while two in Aichi Province sustained injuries after strong winds toppled a tree. Property damage was estimated at US$1\u00a0million.[16] The extratropical remnants caused significant flooding in the Russian Far East. Water levels around Khabarovsk along the Amur River rose 10\u00a0m (33\u00a0ft) to 51\u00a0m (167\u00a0ft), marking one of the few times the river reached that high since records began in the area in 1895.[17][18] Due to the subsequent flooding, 64\u00a0families were evacuated, although 2,000 cows and pigs were left stranded. Further west, in Arkhara, a dam along the Amur River burst its banks along a 20.1\u00a0km (12.5\u00a0mi) stretch, resulting in the river's worst flooding since 1928 and the evacuation of many stranded children in helicopters.[17]"

On September 12, a U.S. reconnaissance plane detected a hurricane nearby and upgraded it to a typhoon. Due to the storm entering Chinese airspace, the US military stopped reconnaissance shortly after September 13. The final reconnaissance recorded wind speeds at 80 knots. According to reconnaissance aircraft and ship data, the circulation was quite small, no more than 150 miles wide.[1] It made landfall in Boao in Qionghai, Hainan on September 13, and it soon crossed the Beibu Gulf. Marge made its final landfall in Tam Diep Mountains (border of Ninh Binh and Thanh Hoa provinces) Vietnam in late September 14, 1973 and dissipated in the Upper Laos soon after.[2][3][4]"

The weather forecast in a local newspaper, the Hainan Daily, only showed that the wind force would be 7 to 8 on the Beaufort scale on September 14, providing an insufficient warning. By evening, there was still no sign of an impending typhoon. According to data from the Central Meteorological Observatory, Marge landed on Boao in Qionghai, Hainan District at 4:40\u00a0am on September 14. The wind at the center of the storm reached 60 meters per second and the pressure was 925 hPa.[5] During the landing, Qionghai's houses were almost completely destroyed. In Qionghai alone, there were 771 deaths. The disaster report by the Revolutionary Committee of the Hainan Administrative Region to the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee showed that 90% of the houses collapsed, and some communes in Ding'an, Tunchang, and Changjiang also suffered varying degrees of damage.[6] According to data in the Qionghai Archives, the typhoon destroyed a total of 206,610 residential houses. 90,632 were completely destroyed, 29,946 suffered a partial collapse, and 86,03 were damaged. Almost 400 cattle died. More than 535 pigs were lost. Approximately 40% of the rice harvest was destroyed, and Qiuci lost 40,000 mu, accounting for 56% of the county's planting area that year. Sugarcane lost 16,000 mu, accounting for 40% of the planting area in Hui County that year. Rubber loss was about 2.32\u00a0million plants of 70,000 mu, accounting for 70% of the county's planting area that year. 80% of the rubber trees passed by the typhoon center were broken, and the losses were particularly heavy. The area's pepper trees suffered about 17,000 mu or about 997,000 plants. Forestry loss 12, ten thousand acres. The loss of Hainan Island in Rmb cannot be calculated.[7] Data from the Qionghai Meteorological Station on the north side of the landing site showed that it recorded a 10-minute average wind speed of 48 meters per second from 4:12 to 4:22 on September 14. The anemometer was destroyed later and the maximum wind speed could not be obtained. A sea-level pressure of 937.8 hPa was recorded at 4:40. The Central Meteorological Observatory evaluated that the central wind reached 60 meters per second and the pressure was 925 hPa when Marge landed.[8] Typhoon Marge killed 903 people and injured 5,759 in Hainan Province.[6]"

Just east of Leota, two farmsteads were completely destroyed at F5 intensity.[2] At approximately 5:18\u00a0pm, the tornado, which had intensified even further, struck Chandler, where it caused extreme damage, leaving half of the town leveled.[1][2] In Chandler, 36 people were injured, with one person dying from their injuries two months later.[1] The National Weather Service referred to the tornado as a \"maxi-tornado\" as it struck Chandler.[2] It was documented that in the towns of Chandler and Lake Wilson, the tornado caused at least $27\u00a0million (1992 USD), with another $17\u00a0million (1992 USD) in damage occurring in rural parts of Murray County.[1] In total, the tornado killed one person, injured over 40 others, and caused at least $50\u00a0million (1992 USD) in damage along its 35 miles (56\u00a0km) track.[2][1][4] The tornado had a maximum width of .75 miles (1.21\u00a0km) around the Chandler-Lake Wilson area.[5][6] This was the only F5\u00a0tornado to occur in the United States in 1992.[5][7] In 2019, meteorologist Jen Narramore, who previously worked for The Weather Channel, found several discrepancies with the official publications and records from NOAA, with the National Climatic Data Center and Storm Prediction Center stating the tornado's path length was only 16 miles (26\u00a0km), while the local National Weather Service office states the official path length was 35 miles (56\u00a0km).[8] In Narramore's assessment, it was stated the path length was most likely to be approximately 16 miles (26\u00a0km), but slightly different than what was listed by the Storm Prediction Center.[8]"

It then crossed over the Little Red River, moving over mountainous terrain before moving into Independence County. Throughout Cleburne County, one person was injured, seven homes and four buildings were destroyed, 107\u00a0homes and 40\u00a0other buildings were damaged, and there was $250,000 in damage.[2][7] Moving into Independence County, the tornado caused catastrophic damage as it hit the town of Floral. Multiple structures in several areas were destroyed and one person was injured.[8] It moved back over mountainous terrain before causing more destruction in Hutchinson, which saw $250,000 in damage when multiple areas were destroyed. The lone fatality from the entire outbreak, as well as two injuries, occurred here.[9] The tornado then turned east-northeast and reached its peak intensity, causing heavy damage in Huff and near Rosie. The tornado then moved into Magness, damaging 20\u00a0homes, a church, a feed mill, and other buildings. The tornado was last spotted in Wycough Township north of Newark, where a home was destroyed and three houses and a church were damaged. Shortly afterwards, the tornado dissipated south of Mt.

Overnight in Centerville, Ohio, straight-line winds and heavy rains damaged farm buildings and flooded basements, injuring three. High-tension lines were also downed, killing one person that came in contact with it. The event was unofficially referred to as a tornado, although a through investigation determined that it was straight-line winds. Early the next morning in Franklin, Arkansas, very heavy rain forced the Sugar Creek and Youngs Creek out of their banks, necessitating evacuation of 45-50\u00a0families and causing damage to household furnishings, some commercial establishments, warehouses, and basements, closed the main highway in town, and undermined some sections of pavement. Straight-line winds on November\u00a016 destroyed a cinder block house in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, injuring three while five others were injured in Chicago due to winds breaking out a store window. Chicago also saw broken trees, downed power lines, and more shattered windows.[2] The storm system transitioned when it got into Iowa on November\u00a015, producing blizzard conditions in Wisconsin while also generating snow and high winds over Iowa, Michigan and New York. This was the deadliest part of the event, killing nine and injuring over 20, including one 12-year-old boy in Washburn County, Wisconsin that suffocated in heavy snow on November 17.[2]"

        "content": "Rita originated from a tropical depression that originated east of the Marshall Islands, near the International Date Line, on October 17. It rapidly intensified while moving westward and became a typhoon on October 20, about 500\u00a0mi (800\u00a0km) south-southwest of Wake Island. Rita continued rapid intensification and became a Category 4-equivalent super typhoon on October 23.[1] At 6:22 A.M., local time, on October 24, a reconnaissance aircraft reported a minimum pressure reading of 888\u00a0mbar (26.2\u00a0inHg) and maximum surface winds of 130 knots (150\u00a0mph). Rita continued to move westward and late in the evening of the same day, Rita passed 60\u00a0mi (97\u00a0km) of Guam, where heavy damages to banana plantations were reported. Rita continued moving rapidly westward towards Luzon at a speed of 23 knots (26\u00a0mph). Rita's central pressure fell to a minimum of 878\u00a0mbar (25.9\u00a0inHg)[nb 1] when it was about 650\u00a0mi (1,050\u00a0km) east of Manila at noon on October 25. Satellite pictures received later in the afternoon revealed a distinct eye and good cirrus outflow associated with the circulation of Rita. During the following night, on October 26, Rita made landfall over Luzon, causing disastrous damage and leaving 200,000 homeless. Baler, located on the east coast of Luzon, reported gusts of 50 knots (58\u00a0mph) when the storm passed just to the south of it. Infanta, located 60 miles (97\u00a0km) south of Baler, reported a minimum sea-level pressure of 971.5\u00a0mbar (28.69\u00a0inHg).[1] Rita entered the South China Sea on October 27 and gradually accelerated in speed as it moved west-northwest towards Hainan. Its circulation remained intense with a large area of strong winds even though it weakened significantly after striking the Philippines. A fishing boat called the San Jose II went aground on a reef about 400\u00a0mi (640\u00a0km) southwest of Manila during the evening of October 27. In Hong Kong, the Stand By Signal, No. 1, was hoisted at 11:45 A.M. on October 27, when Rita was situated about 430\u00a0mi (690\u00a0km) to the southeast. Since an intense surge of winter monsoon was expected to reach the Southern Chinese coast. The combinations of the effects of Rita and the monsoon were forecast to cause strong winds in Hong Kong overnight. The Strong Wind Signal, No. 3, was hoisted at 4:30 PM although Rita was still situated 390\u00a0mi (630\u00a0km) south-southwest of Hong Kong and was moving west-northwest at 8 knots (9.2\u00a0mph) towards Hainan. At 5:00 A.M., Shangchuandao reported winds of 58 knots (67\u00a0mph) with gusts of 72 knots (83\u00a0mph).[1] Due to the influx of cold and dry air because the winter monsoon, the typhoon weakened rapidly and moved slowly southwestwards away from Hong Kong. during daytime on October 28. The system was closest to Hong Kong at 8:00 A.M. The central pressure was estimated to be about 990 millibars (29\u00a0inHg). On October 29, satellites received unveiled that the system became disorganized and the center of the system ill-defined. The monsoon still caused gale-forced winds over the South China Sea even though Rita had moved away from Hong Kong and weakened into a weak tropical storm. A cargo ship, the M.V. Toubkal went aground on the Scarborough Shoal, 460\u00a0mi (740\u00a0km) south-southeast of Hong Kong, and broke in two. Rita continued to weaken and degenerated into an area of low pressure, off the coast of South Vietnam, on October 29.[1]"

However, Luzon was pounded by Rita's violent 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) wind gusts and extremely torrential rains. Widespread power outages in Manila and Southern Luzon were reported when Rita passed 36 miles (58\u00a0km) north of the city, cutting off satellite communications links. Red Cross and national disaster officials reported that more than 4,000 people were moved to safer ground and evacuation continued.[6] A youth was reported to be electrocuted by a falling wire near the capital and a Luzon couple was seriously injured when a tree fell on their house.[7] Power lines in many provinces were toppled. Some areas experienced wind gusts as much as 125 miles per hour (201\u00a0km/h).[8] Death toll from the storm was reported to have risen to more than 200 on October 31.[9] A reported 354 other Filipinos were missing. The storm cut across rice-rich fields of the Central Luzon plains with 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) winds. More than 50,000 homes were destroyed and displaced 291,610 families, a total of 1,444,465 people. Damage to infrastructure and agricultural crops was placed at more than $100\u00a0million (1979 USD) and about 750,000\u00a0acres of rice was damaged. President Ferdinand E. Marcos declared 5 provinces calamity zones.[9] He later ordered the suspension of the exporting of rice as a result of the extensive damage. Some areas experienced flooding that was waist-deep.[10] It was reported that a Red Cross team sent to check reported that a dam had overflown and drowned 30 villagers outside the town of Norzagaray. In the Norzagaray area, 18 people were reported dead and 24 others missing. In the Angat area, where the Angat Dam is located, 6 people were dead and 20 were missing.[11] U.S. Navy planes and helicopters saved 40 crewmen from a wrecked Moroccan ship that sunk in the South China Sea. The ship hit shoals 210\u00a0mi (340\u00a0km) northwest of Manila. It was blown there by the typhoon's powerful winds and high seas.[12] The flood waters and the extremely powerful wind gusts of the storm caused 14,474 houses to be partly or seriously damaged; Manila reported gusts of up to 93\u00a0mph (150\u00a0km/h).  Super Typhoon Rita was the worst typhoon to strike the Philippines in 8 years since Super Typhoon Joan in 1970.[13]"

The depression continued to intensify, and the JMA upgraded it to Tropical Storm Nari later that morning. The storm then underwent rapid intensification that afternoon and evening, strengthening from a tropical depression to a typhoon in just 18 hours. The JMA upgraded Nari to a severe tropical storm late that afternoon, and by late that evening, Nari was upgraded to a typhoon. Nari reached its peak on September 14, and began weakening soon afterwards. It turned extratropical right after landfall in South Korea at tropical storm strength.[1]"

The twelfth tropical cyclone, fourth typhoon and first super typhoon of the 1995 season,[2] Kent formed on August 24 in the western north Pacific and moved westwards where it reached typhoon status on August 26 east of the Philippines. Kent then rapidly strengthened into a super typhoon with winds reaching peak intensity of 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h) as it brushed past the northern Philippines and southern Taiwan before making landfall in eastern People's Republic of China on August 31. After making landfall, Kent weakened and dissipated the following day.[3] A strong and destructive typhoon, Kent left 52 fatalities and $418.9\u00a0million (1995\u00a0USD, $555\u00a0million 2006\u00a0USD) in damage in the Philippines, Taiwan and China.[3][4]"

The system, however, regenerated on January 29 as it re-emerged over water and became a tropical depression once again.[76] However, Fame did not strengthen further due to interaction with Cyclone Gula, and after being declared extratropical,[77] M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France redeclared the system tropical and issued its last advisory.[78] Strong winds from the storm damaged numerous mobile homes, shrubbery, and trees.[79] At least 13 people were killed[65] and about 20,000 people were left homeless. Maximum sustained winds were recorded up to 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph) and rainfall peaked at 146.7 millimetres (0.28\u00a0in) in Besalampy.[80] Total damages from the storm were estimated at 100\u00a0million Malagasy ariary ($51,000\u00a0USD).[81] After regenerating in the southern Indian Ocean, Fame produced torrential rains over Reunion, peaking at 875\u00a0mm (34.4\u00a0in) over a three-day span, 731\u00a0mm (28.8\u00a0in) of which fell in 48\u00a0hours. The system, in combination with Gula, produced high waves, peaking at 8\u00a0m (26\u00a0ft) along the coasts of Reunion. A peak wind gust of 112\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph) was recorded at Gros Piton Ste-Rose[47]"

Initially the MFR forecast that the depression would intensify further before striking Madagascar.[6] The cyclone tracked generally westward along the northern periphery of a ridge. The circulation became better defined, though convection was displaced to the west of the center due to persistent wind shear. Intensification was favored, though, due to warm water temperatures and good outflow. Early on 5 March, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center  (JTWC) classified the system as Tropical Cyclone 22S.[7] Shortly thereafter, the MFR upgraded the depression to Moderate Tropical Storm Jokwe about 675\u00a0km (419\u00a0mi) southwest of the Agalega Islands, or about 230\u00a0km (140\u00a0mi) northeast of the northern tip of Madagascar. At first, the storm was smaller than usual, with gale-force winds extending 37\u00a0km (23\u00a0mi) from the center.[8] Jokwe turned to the west-southwest in response to the development of a trough of low pressure in the Mozambique Channel,[9] and late on 5 March the storm crossed over northern Madagascar. The low-level circulation became disorganized due to land interaction, though its mid and upper-level circulation remained well-organized.[10] Subsequently, the storm encountered more favorable conditions, and an eye developed; Jokwe underwent rapid deepening and intensified to tropical cyclone status, or the equivalence of a minimal hurricane, midday on 6 March off the northwest coast of Madagascar.[11] Shortly after attaining tropical cyclone status, Jokwe began weakening as its eye disappeared, and it weakened back to a severe tropical storm.[12] The weakening trend was short-lived, and after turning westward the storm re-developed a 13\u00a0km (8.1\u00a0mi) eye.[13] Jokwe again underwent rapid intensification as it approached the coast of Mozambique, becoming an intense \"midget cyclone\" with winds of 175\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph) late on 7 March; the MFR explained its rapid intensity changes due to its small size.[14] Excellent upper-level outflow and warm waters contributed to the intensification.[15] At 0000\u00a0UTC on 8 March, Jokwe attained peak winds of 195\u00a0km/h (121\u00a0mph) about 75\u00a0km (47\u00a0mi) east of the Island of Mozambique in Nampula Province; at the same time, its gusts reached about 275\u00a0km/h (171\u00a0mph).[3] It weakened slightly while paralleling the coastline just offshore,[16] and at 1015\u00a0UTC Jokwe made landfall between the Island of Mozambique and Angoche.[17] Cyclone Jokwe remained over land for about 18\u00a0hours before emerging into the Mozambique Channel,[18] weakening quickly to tropical storm status. Upon reaching open waters, convection increased over the center,[19] and late on 9 March Jokwe re-intensified to a tropical cyclone as an eye reappeared on satellite imagery.[20] The cyclone turned to the south-southeast, around the periphery of a ridge to its east. An upper-level low to its south produced good outflow which, in combination with warm waters, allowed Jokwe to re-intensify.[21] Late on 10 March, the storm passed about 35\u00a0km (22\u00a0mi) east of Europa Island, and shortly thereafter the MFR upgraded Jokwe to intense tropical cyclone status with winds of 170\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph).[22] Subsequently, an increase in wind shear caused a steady weakening trend,[23] and by 12 March Jokwe weakened to tropical storm status as its center became partially exposed from the deep convection; at the same time, the storm turned to the southwest.[24] Later on 12 March, thunderstorms reformed over the center,[25] as its movement became nearly stationary due to a ridge to its south and northwest.[26] Early on 13 March, it began a steady movement to the northwest, and its organization increased with an eye re-appearing;[27] after briefly re-attaining tropical cyclone status,[28] Jokwe again weakened to tropical storm status due to persistent wind shear.[29] Convection continued to diminish, and on 14 March Jokwe weakened to tropical depression status as the center became almost fully exposed.[30] Early the following day, the MFR issued its last advisory on the system.[31] The remnants accelerated southeastward and dissipated on 16 March to the southwest of Madagascar.[3]"

The storm passed just offshore Shanghai before curving sharply towards the northeast into the Yellow Sea on August\u00a021. Marge weakened to a tropical storm the next day after spending 11\u00a0continuous days as a typhoon. The cyclone made landfall near Boryeong, South Korea on August\u00a023 and accelerated northeastwards across the Korean peninsula, transitioning into an extratropical cyclone over far-northeastern Manchuria before dissipating after August\u00a024.[1]"

The aurora borealis over the Rocky Mountains in the United States was so bright that the glow woke gold miners, who were reported to have begun to prepare breakfast because they thought it was morning. It was also reported that people in the north-eastern United States could read a newspaper by the aurora's light.[8][14] The aurora was also visible from the poles to low latitude areas such as south-central Mexico,[15][16] Cuba, Hawaii, Queensland,[17] southern Japan and China,[18] and even at lower latitudes very close to the equator, such as in Colombia.[19] On Saturday 3 September 1859, the Baltimore American and Commercial Advertiser reported that Those who happened to be out late on Thursday night had an opportunity of witnessing another magnificent display of the auroral lights. The phenomenon was very similar to the display on Sunday night, though at times the light was, if possible, more brilliant, and the prismatic hues more varied and gorgeous. The light appeared to cover the whole firmament, apparently like a luminous cloud, through which the stars of the larger magnitude indistinctly shone. The light was greater than that of the moon at its full, but had an indescribable softness and delicacy that seemed to envelop everything upon which it rested. Between 12\u00a0and 1\u00a0o'clock, when the display was at its full brilliancy, the quiet streets of the city resting under this strange light, presented a beautiful as well as singular appearance.[20] In 1909, an Australian gold miner named C. F. Herbert retold his observations in a letter to the Daily News in Perth, I was gold-digging at Rokewood, about four miles [6\u00a0km] from Rokewood township (Victoria). Myself and two mates looking out of the tent saw a great reflection in the southern heavens at about 7\u00a0o'clock\u00a0p.m., and in about half an hour, a scene of almost unspeakable beauty presented itself: Lights of every imaginable color were issuing from the southern heavens, one color fading away only to give place to another if possible more beautiful than the last, the streams mounting to the zenith, but always becoming a rich purple when reaching there, and always curling round, leaving a clear strip of sky, which may be described as four fingers held at arm's length. The northern side from the zenith was also illuminated with beautiful colors, always curling round at the zenith, but were considered to be merely a reproduction of the southern display, as all colors south and north always corresponded. It was a sight never to be forgotten, and was considered at the time to be the greatest aurora recorded [...]. The rationalist and pantheist saw nature in her most exquisite robes, recognising, the divine immanence, immutable law, cause, and effect. The superstitious and the fanatical had dire forebodings, and thought it a foreshadowing of Armageddon and final dissolution.[21]"

It is now disconnected.\" Boston: \"Mine is disconnected, and we are working with the auroral current. How do you receive my writing?\" Portland: \"Better than with our batteries on. \u2013 Current comes and goes gradually.\" Boston: \"My current is very strong at times, and we can work better without the batteries, as the aurora seems to neutralize and augment our batteries alternately, making current too strong at times for our relay magnets. Suppose we work without batteries while we are affected by this trouble.\" Portland: \"Very well. Shall I go ahead with business?\" Boston: \"Yes. Go ahead.\" The conversation was carried on for around two hours using no battery power at all and working solely with the current induced by the aurora, the first time on record that more than a word or two was transmitted in such manner.[26]"

The flares and CMEs of the August 1972 solar storms were similar to the Carrington event in size and magnitude; however, unlike the 1859 storms, they did not cause an extreme geomagnetic storm. The March 1989 geomagnetic storm knocked out power across large sections of Quebec, while the 2003 Halloween solar storms registered the most powerful solar explosions ever recorded. On 23 July 2012, a \"Carrington-class\" solar superstorm (solar flare, CME, solar electromagnetic pulse) was observed, but its trajectory narrowly missed Earth.[5][28] During the May 2024 solar storms, the Aurora Borealis was sighted as far south as Puerto Rico.[29] In June 2013, a joint venture from researchers at Lloyd's of London and Atmospheric and Environmental Research (AER) in the US used data from the Carrington Event to estimate the cost of a similar event in the present to the US alone at US$600\u00a0billion to $2.6\u00a0trillion (equivalent to $774\u00a0billion to $3.35\u00a0trillion in 2023[30]),[3] which, at the time, equated to roughly 3.6 to 15.5\u00a0percent of annual GDP. Other research has looked for signatures of large solar flares and CMEs in carbon-14 in tree rings and beryllium-10 (among other isotopes) in ice cores. The signature of a large solar storm has been found for the years 774\u2013775 and 993\u2013994.[31][32] Carbon-14 levels stored in 775 suggest an event about 20 times the normal variation of the Sun's activity, and 10 or more times the size of the Carrington Event.[33] An event in 7176 BCE may have exceeded even the 774\u2013775 event based on this proxy data.[34] Whether the physics of solar flares is similar to that of even larger superflares is still unclear. The Sun may differ in important ways such as size and speed of rotation from the types of stars that are known to produce superflares.[32]"

This was based on the hypothesis that solar energetic particles would ionize nitrogen, leading to the production of nitric oxide and other oxidised nitrogen compounds, which would not be too diluted in the atmosphere before being deposited along with snow.[35] Beginning in 1986, some researchers claimed that data from Greenland ice cores showed evidence of individual solar particle events, including the Carrington Event.[36] More recent ice core work, however, casts significant doubt on this interpretation and shows that nitrate spikes are likely not a result of solar energetic particle events but can be due to terrestrial events such as forest fires, and correlate with other chemical signatures of known forest fire plumes. Nitrate events in cores from Greenland and Antarctica do not align, so the hypothesis that they reflect proton events is now in significant doubt.[35][37][38] A 2024 study analysed digitized magnetogram readings from magnetic observatories at Kew and Greenwich. \"Initial analysis suggests the rates of change of the field of over 700 nT/min exceeded the 1-in-100 years extreme value of 350\u2013400 nT/min at this latitude based on digital-era records\",[39] indicating a far greater change rate than modern digital measurements.[40]"

An area of disturbed weather developed southwest of Pohnpei on August\u00a06, 1987. The system initially remained disorganized, but by August\u00a014, Cary had attained tropical storm intensity. After initially moving north-northwest, Cary turned west-northwest, although intensification was slow to occur. On August\u00a015, Cary was upgraded into a typhoon, and on August\u00a017, the typhoon peaked in intensity. Typhoon Cary then made landfall in northern Luzon while at peak intensity.

The storm weakened over land, but re-intensified into a typhoon over the South China Sea. On August\u00a021, Typhoon Cary passed just south of Hainan, where hundreds of homes were damaged but no fatalities occurred, and subsequently entered the Gulf of Tonkin. The storm weakened as it approached Vietnam, and on August\u00a023, the storm dissipated inland over Laos. Across Vietnam, almost 40,000\u00a0ha (98,840 acres) of land were flooded or destroyed.

        "content": "The origins of Typhoon Cary can be traced back to an area of disturbed weather that first developed within the monsoon trough on August\u00a06  about 370\u00a0km (230\u00a0mi) southwest of Pohnpei, which is located in the eastern Caroline Islands. The next day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started watching the system.[1] On August 8, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) followed suit.[2][nb 1][4] Over the ensuing four days, the storm's circulation remained broad and its convection was poorly organized. On August\u00a012, upper-level outflow improved in all four quadrants, which resulted in the JTWC issuing a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA). At 23:02 UTC, Hurricane Hunters measured flight level winds of 105\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 996\u00a0mbar (29.4\u00a0inHg). Based on this and satellite intensity estimates of 80\u00a0km/h (50\u00a0mph), the JTWC upgraded the disturbance into Tropical Storm Cary[1] while the storm was located around 1,580\u00a0km (980\u00a0mi) east-southeast of Manila.[5] However, post-season analysis by the JTWC revealed that this occurred at 12:00 UTC on August 12.[1] Following behind Typhoon Betty,[1] Cary initially moved north-northwest, only to turn west-northwest[5] under the influence of a subtropical ridge to the storm's north. Initially, Betty's outflow inhibited development, but conditions aloft became more favorable once Betty weakened and passed over the Philippines. Dvorak intensity estimates suggested that the typhoon began to rapidly intensify. However, a Hurricane Hunter aircraft fix around midday on August\u00a014 revealed that the storm was actually weakening and its center was becoming difficult to locate.[1] Despite these developments, the JMA upgraded Cary into a tropical storm at noon that day.[6][nb 2] Around this time, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also started tracking the storm and assigned it with the name Ising.[8] Early on August\u00a015, the JTWC reported that Cary attained typhoon intensity,[4] while the JMA upgraded Cary into a severe tropical storm.[2] The final Western Pacific Hurricane Hunter mission \u2013 associated with the 54th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron \u2013 was flown through Cary later that day, reporting winds of 115\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph) and a barometric pressure of 990\u00a0mbar (29\u00a0inHg). This was significantly lower than the Dvorak-based 170\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph) operational estimate from the JTWC.[1] At around 12:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a016, the JMA classified Cary as a typhoon.[2] Shortly thereafter, a ragged eye appeared on satellite imagery.[5] At 06:00\u00a0UTC on August 17, the JTWC also estimated Cary reached its peak intensity, with winds of 160\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph).[1] Six hours later, the JMA estimated that Cary attained winds of 135\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph), its peak intensity.[2] Shortly after attaining maximum intensity, Typhoon Cary turned slightly south of west[5] and made landfall on eastern Luzon. Cary weakened steadily over land,[1] and both the JMA and JTWC estimated that Cary weakened below typhoon intensity.[6] After entering the South China Sea, however, Cary turned west and began to re-intensify.[5] On the morning of August\u00a019, the JMA re-upgraded Cary into a typhoon,[2] with the JTWC following suit 36\u00a0hours later.[4] At 18:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a021, Cary passed less than 30\u00a0km (19\u00a0mi) south of Hainan as a minimal typhoon. Accelerating towards the west, Typhoon Cary emerged into the Gulf of Tonkin before making landfall at noon on August\u00a012 in northern Vietnam.[1] At the time of landfall, the JTWC and JMA estimated winds of 70\u00a0mph (115\u00a0km/h) and 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h) respectively.[6] the JTWC stopped tracking the system immediately after landfall,[1] but the JMA continued to follow the system through the day of August\u00a023[2] as the cyclone moved into northern Laos.[5] The remnants of Cary eventually tracked into Burma before losing its identity.[1]"

It was the 59th disturbance in the record-breaking 1962 Pacific typhoon season, forming in August east of the Philippines. Typhoon Wanda reached peak winds of 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph) in the South China Sea, and it made landfall on Hong Kong on September\u00a01, producing gusts of 261\u00a0km/h (161\u00a0mph) which, in combination with a high storm surge, damaged thousands of huts and left 72,000\u00a0people homeless. Wanda left a total of 434\u00a0deaths, and it is estimated that an identical typhoon striking today would cause HK$2.6\u00a0billion ($335\u00a0million USD) in losses."

        "content": "The precursor disturbance to Typhoon Wanda was first observed on August\u00a023 near Pohnpei in the Federated States of Micronesia. That day, a circulation formed in the interaction between the Mid-Pacific trough and an easterly wave, with energy from a surge in the Easterlies in the Southern Hemisphere. Initially winds were very weak, and it tracked west-northwestward while slowly gaining intensity.[1] The official track from the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) indicated the system first developed into a tropical cyclone on August\u00a025,[2] whereas the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) initiated advisories two days later, after it was observed by the Hurricane Hunters. It was designated Tropical Depression 59 while located about 1120\u00a0km (700\u00a0mi) northeast of the Philippines.[1] Throughout most of its duration, the cyclone maintained a general west-northwest track, although initial forecasts had a northward bias that anticipated a track into Taiwan. On August\u00a028, reconnaissance aircraft reported winds of 75\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph), or tropical storm status; as such, the JTWC named the system Wanda. Throughout the day, Wanda quickly intensified, with the pressure dropping to 992\u00a0mbar and the winds reaching 110\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph) by the end of the day. The next day, Wanda attained typhoon status, and on August\u00a030 it traversed the Luzon Strait between the Philippines and Taiwan.[1] By that time, the typhoon was about 1600\u00a0km (1000\u00a0mi) wide, and the next day rainbands began affecting southeastern China and Hong Kong.[3] While approaching southeastern China, Wanda reached its peak strength of 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph) in 1-minute winds, with the JTWC estimating a minimum pressure of 949\u00a0mbar.[1] The typhoon weakened slightly before making landfall on Hong Kong at 0000\u00a0UTC on September\u00a01, with winds of 150\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph).[1] A combination of cold air and land interaction caused Wanda to weaken rapidly, and the JTWC discontinued advisories about 18\u00a0hours after Wanda moved ashore.[1] According to the JMA track, the system turned southwest into the Gulf of Tonkin, intensifying slightly before shifting southeastward and dissipating over Hainan on September\u00a04.[2] Typhoon Wanda was fairly well-forecasted, compared to other storms during the year. The average forecast error for 24\u00a0hours was about 260\u00a0km (160\u00a0mi), whereas for 48\u00a0hours, it was 415\u00a0km (255\u00a0mi); both values were less than the seasonal average.[4]"

        "content": "During its passage of Hong Kong, Wanda produced 263\u00a0mm (10.4\u00a0in) of rainfall. The typhoon moved ashore during the daily high tide, resulting in a storm surge of at least 5\u00a0m (17\u00a0feet) above normal, especially around Tolo Harbour, which caused widespread flooding and damaged or destroyed thousands of huts and houses in Sha Tin and Tai Po.[3] The strong winds and waves blew fishing vessels from the water onto the streets.[1] Storm surge also destroyed Sha Tin Airfield. Maximum sustained winds were 145\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph 10-minute sustained), while gusts reached 260\u00a0km/h (161\u00a0mph), stronger than any previous typhoon on record. Additionally, the lowest pressure during its passage was 953.2\u00a0mbar, which was the lowest on record at the RHKO.[3] Overall, the typhoon caused 434\u00a0deaths and left 72,000\u00a0people homeless. There was never a finalized damage total, although it was estimated in the millions of dollars.[1][3] Over 2,000\u00a0boats in the colony were either wrecked or damaged.[3] As damage was so severe in Hong Kong, there were little reports of impact elsewhere, although the storm did move across portions of southern China.[1] The typhoon Wanda is routed in Hong Kong near Cheung Chau, most parts of Hong Kong was in the right side of it, so the strong wind blew the wave into Tolo Harbour made the sea level rose, therefore Sha Tin (area near Tolo Harbour) became the hardest hit.[5][6] Since a large number of people settled in squatter huts on low-lying coastal areas or precarious slopes and fishermen lived in fishing boats, it caused large casualties when the typhoon hit Hong Kong. Some of survivors claim that the huge waves covered up their homes, sweeping the squatter huts and the home is dumped in front of them. They had to run to the railway station in a higher sea level, but the flood was also deep in the knees.[7][8] It is estimated that every 5 squatter huts had 1 was destroyed or damaged by the typhoon in Sha Tin, which is one of the gathering place of squatter huts in Hong Kong at that time, approximately 3,000 squatter huts damaged in total.[3] The road was blocked by a large number of damaged squatter huts and needed the British army to help to rescue the residents and clean up the road.[9] The heavy flooding increased the hardness of the rescue and clean up, there were 869 acres of farm land were flooded with sea water, over 30 percent (277 acres) were in Sha Tin, almost 65 percent (179 acres) of the low lying farm in Sha Tin were still affected two months later.[3] The shops and store were also heavily damaged by the flood, many goods from the store were drifting on the street and it was difficult for them to reopen in short term.[10]"

An eastward-moving shortwave trough tracked across the continental United States through that two-day period, combining with abundant moisture, instability, and wind shear to promote the formation of a long-lived squall line. Hundreds of damaging wind reports were received, and 80\u00a0tornadoes occurred within this line, making it the third largest January tornado outbreak on record.[citation needed] Three tornadoes\u2014an EF1 in eastern Texas, an EF2 in northern Louisiana, and an EF2 in western Alabama\u2014led to a total of seven deaths, all in mobile homes. There were five other storm related deaths, including two due to icy roads in Lubbock, Texas, one due to drowning in Oklahoma, and one due to icy roads in Iowa.[2] The system also brought a monthly record high temperature to Boston and Bridgeport.[4][5] Extensive damage and several other injuries occurred as well. The severe weather event was notable in that it was forecast well in advance, with the Storm Prediction Center first highlighting the risk area a full week beforehand. Total damage from the event reached $1.1\u00a0billion according to the National Centers for Environmental Information.[6]"

        "content": "Beginning on January\u00a05, the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) highlighted the potential for organized severe weather across central Texas eastward into far western Georgia valid for January 10\u201311.[7] The day\u00a07 outlook issued that day constituted only the fourth time a severe weather risk had been delineated a week in advance in January, alongside January 23, 2013, January 18, 2010, and January 1, 2008.[8] Despite the unusually high confidence at a long lead time, the threat region aligned well with climatologically favored areas for severe weather during the month.[9] On January\u00a06, the day\u00a06 outlook for January\u00a010 raised portions of northeastern Texas, northwestern Louisiana, southeastern Oklahoma, and southern Arkansas to a 30% probability of severe weather, equivalent to an Enhanced risk.[10] Much of Alabama and Mississippi, in addition to a small section of both Louisiana and Florida, were upgraded to an Enhanced risk in the following day's outlook as well.[11] On January\u00a09, after days of refining the risk area, the SPC elevated northeastern Texas, northern Louisiana, and far southern Arkansas to a Moderate risk.[12] Although the Moderate risk was initially issued given high confidence in a widespread damaging wind event, including the potential for a derecho, the morning outlook on January\u00a010 raised the potential for strong, long-tracked tornadoes across eastern Texas, northern Louisiana, southern Arkansas, and extreme western Mississippi.[13] At the start of the day, a cold front was analyzed from south-central Kansas southwestward into an area of low pressure across the Texas Panhandle. In advance of this front, persistent warm-air advection led to quickly-rising dewpoints across western Oklahoma and far south-central Kansas. Aloft, a deep shortwave trough across the Southwestern United States pushed eastward, resulting in cold mid-level temperatures and the development of a modestly unstable environment. In the presence of strong wind shear, and given the impetus for convective development, thunderstorms mainly capable of a severe hail threat began to form throughout the morning hours.[14][15] Intensifying thunderstorms farther east across central and eastern Oklahoma led to the day's first tornado watch at 16:40\u00a0UTC.[16] Numerous other tornado and severe thunderstorm watches were issued as the day progressed.[17] As the cold front shifted eastward, a line of thunderstorms developed along this boundary from southern Missouri down into central Texas.[18] Despite the expectation that supercells capable of strong tornadoes would precede this line, convection instead failed to organize in an unstable but slightly capped environment.[18][19] The SPC ultimately decided to downgrade tornado probabilities and remove the hatched area denoting the potential for strong tornadoes in their 01:00\u00a0UTC outlook.[20] Throughout the overnight hours, the southern edge of the convective line surged eastward at an increasing rate, leading to interaction with pre-frontal thunderstorms that increased rotation in an already volatile environment. Numerous embedded rotations and semi-discrete supercell structures formed within the line, producing many tornadoes.[21] An EF1 tornado west-southwest of Nacogdoches, Texas, led to the death of one person, while a long-tracked EF2 tornado that tracked from southeast of Bossier City to north of Arcadia, Louisiana, led to three more fatalities. All four deaths from these two tornadoes were in mobile homes.[22] By the afternoon hours of January\u00a011, the already intense line of convection consolidated further as instability increased and an upper-level trough approached from the west.[23] A high-end EF2 tornado caused severe damage near Carrollton, Alabama, causing three deaths between two manufactured homes that were demolished.[24] Numerous other tornadoes and hundreds of damaging wind reports were recorded throughout the afternoon, but the squall line began to weaken late on January\u00a011 as the forcing mechanism lifted northeast into the Ohio River Valley and as daytime heating waned.[25]"

More trees were downed as the tornado clipped the southeast side of the Barksdale Air Force Base, before it reached its peak intensity south of Haughton. Two mobile homes, one double-wide and one single wide, were completely destroyed at high-end EF2 strength as the tornado crossed Davis Road. Two people were killed in the double wide mobile home and one was killed in the single-wide. The tornado continued to cause EF2\u00a0damage as it crossed LA 158 in Eastern Bossier Parish, snapping and uprooting hundreds of trees, some of which fell on homes, while other homes suffered roof damage. The tornado then weakened to high-end EF1\u00a0strength as it crossed Oliver Road and Camp Zion Road, where numerous trees were snapped and uprooted, siding was ripped off of a single-wide manufactured home. A portion of the metal exterior and doors on the Bossier Parish Fire District 1 Station 6 building was ripped off, along with some vinyl siding to a mobile home living quarters located next door.[49][50] The tornado, still at high-end EF1 strength, then moved into Webster Parish, crossing Pilgrim Rest Road, and tracking northeast into the south side of Doyline, downing hundreds of trees as it crossed LA 163 and 164. After clipping the southeast corner of Camp Minden, the tornado ripped through the north side of Sibley along US 371/LA 7 and the northern fringes of Dubberly, where it downed trees and power lines, damaged a metal barn, the roof of a home, and destroyed a shed on Wallraven Road near LA 531. At the South Webster Industrial Park in Sibley, an 18-wheeler trailer was overturned, and a building, fencing, and equipment were damaged at an oil field service company. Significant damage was also done to the major power distribution lines that feed the town of Sibley and the South Webster Industrial District. Just before the tornado crossed I-20 between exits\u00a049 and 52, the rear flank downdraft near and just south of the tornado track grew and intensified, blowing down a large sign onto another 18-wheeler at Love's Truckstop at I-20 Exit 49 (LA 531). After crossing the interstate southeast of Minden, the tornado moved through Nine Forks at the intersection of US 80 and LA 532, rolling a single-wide mobile home on Fuller Cemetery Road and damaging the roofs of two structures. At least 120\u00a0broken power poles and over 250\u00a0spans of downed wire were the result of this tornado and associated widespread damaging winds near Doyline, Sibley, Dubberly, and Minden.[49][51] The tornado then moved into Southwestern Claiborne Parish, causing intermittent damage. Numerous trees were snapped or uprooted as it crossed Harris Road, Old Arcadia Road, Faulk Road, Sherrill Road, and LA 154 in Darley south of Old Athens and Athens. The tornado then turned due east and crossed LA 9, producing partial roof damage to approximately a half dozen chicken houses and shingle and partial roof damage to several other structures, especially off of Buckner Road, Cook Road, and LA 519 in the rural community of Hurricane before finally dissipating.[49][52] The tornado was on the ground for 41\u00a0minutes, traveled 42.06 miles (67.69\u00a0km), and was 300 yards (270\u00a0m) wide. Three people were killed, and damage was estimated at $1.325\u00a0million.[49][50][51][52]"

        "content": " Typhoon Charlotte was a damaging typhoon that struck Okinawa during the 1959 Pacific typhoon season. An area of low pressure developed in early October, and it became a tropical depression on October 9. The depression strengthened to a tropical storm one day later, and it received the name Charlotte from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). The system strengthened quickly and became a typhoon eighteen hours later. Charlotte continued to rapidly strengthen to its peak of 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph) on October 13. The typhoon began to weaken afterwards, and it traveled south of Okinawa on October 16. The typhoon weakened to a tropical storm on October 19 as it began its extratropical transition. The storm became extratropical later that day, and the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) ceased tracking the system on October 20. During October 16 and 17, Charlotte caused heavy damage to the Okinawa Islands. Large amounts of rainfall caused landslides across the islands and many rice and sugar cane crops were destroyed by floods. Multiple public buildings and 800 homes were damaged or destroyed, leaving over 1,000 people homeless. Damage done to military bases on the island amounted to $300,000 (equivalent to $3,135,616 in 2023). 46 people died during the storm in the islands. Minor damage was also reported in Philippines, Taiwan, and Japan, mostly due to flooding and strong winds."

The low pressure intensified and contracted by October 8, and a closed circulation was found later that day by a reconnaissance aircraft.[1] Both Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began tracking the system as a tropical depression on October 9,[2][3][nb 1] with winds of 50\u00a0km/h (30\u00a0mph),[3] and a surface pressure of 1,008 hectopascals (29.8\u00a0inHg).[2] JTWC upgraded the depression to a tropical storm one day later, and it was given the name Charlotte by the warning center. The system intensified steadily and traveled northwestward at 6\u20139 knots (11\u201317\u00a0km/h).[1] JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm at 1200 UTC,[2] when the JTWC assessed it at 110\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph). JTWC upgraded Charlotte to a typhoon six hours later, with winds of 150\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph). The typhoon continued to rapidly intensify, reaching 200\u00a0km/h (125\u00a0mph) by October 12.[3] Charlotte began to travel around the North Pacific High,[1] decreasing in speed east of Luzon.[5] The storm reached peak strength at 1200 UTC on October 13, with winds of 265\u00a0km/h (165\u00a0mph) and a pressure of 905\u00a0hPa (26.7\u00a0inHg) recorded by a reconnaissance aircraft.[1][2] Charlotte weakened slightly to 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph) six hours after peak strength.[3] The typhoon's movement soon slowed down to 3\u20134 knots (5.6\u20137.4\u00a0km/h),[5] and began its turn northeastward near Taiwan.[1] It continued to gradually weaken as it traveled toward to Ryukyu Islands. Charlotte was located 64 kilometers (40\u00a0mi) south of Okinawa at 1200 UTC on October 16,[1] with winds of 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph).[3] Colder air temperatures caused more weakening on October 18, and westerlies caused the storm to accelerate to the northeast. A secondary upper level center north of Charlotte was found by a reconnaissance aircraft, which used it for fixes during that day.[1] By 1800 UTC, the typhoon had weakened to a tropical storm south of Honshu, with winds of 110\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph).[3] On October 19, JTWC issued the last warning on the system,[1] and JMA declared the storm extratropical six hours later.[2] The cyclone was embedded in the polar front hours later,[1] and JTWC ceased tracking the system after it weakened past tropical storm strength at 55\u00a0km/h (35\u00a0mph) at 1800 UTC.[3] JMA continued to track the cyclone until 0600 UTC of October 20.[2]"

Marines, including the ones in the 3rd division at Camp Sukiran and Camp Schwab, were moved to storm shelters from their tents and Quonset huts. Only security guards in tanks and amphibious tractors remained outside of the shelters.[6] On October 17, twelve freighters sought shelter in the harbor at Kagoshima, and seventy small craft moved to other protected areas within Japan.[7] In northern Luzon and the Batanes of the Philippines, heavy rain and strong winds were reported.[8] Similar conditions happened in Taiwan, where little damage happened.[7] In Tokyo, 72\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph) winds were reported, and several streets and 31 homes were flooded.[9] A large fleet of British ships, led by HMS Alert, arrived at Yokohama after being delayed by typhoons Charlotte and Dinah.[10] The area of low pressure that absorbed Charlotte later caused an increase in surf in Hawaii.[11] Charlotte caused significant damage to Okinawa during October 16 and 17.[12]\nWinds of 90\u2013150 miles per hour (140\u2013240\u00a0km/h) and rainfall of 24 inches (61\u00a0cm) were reported on the island,[13][1] This resulted in landslides, exacerbated by deforestation, to happen across northern Okinawa.[12] The landslide in \u014cgimi killed seven people and injured four, and eighteen people were killed and four were injured when thirty feet (9.1\u00a0m) of debris buried their houses in Tagazako. Three people were killed and three were injured in Taiho. In Tsuda, nine people were killed and five people were injured.[14] 70 percent of the rice crops and 16 percent of the sugar cane and others in the territory were destroyed.[15] Flooding occurred at Naha, where some parts of the city were flooded under five feet (1.5\u00a0m) of water.[1] Twenty American families were evacuated from a low-lying area to a schoolhouse in Awase.[13] Electricity, telephone, and utilities were down after the storm,[13] and were restored one day later.[14] Highways, 11 public buildings,[1] and military installations were also severely damaged.[13] 275 homes were destroyed, and 618 homes were damaged, leaving 1,038 people homeless.[1] The total cost for the damage of the military installations was $300,000 (equivalent to $3,135,616 in 2023). The official total casualty count was 46 people killed and 24 injured,[1] with no American casualties. Lieutenant General Donald Prentice Booth issued a statement of condolence to the Okinawan families after the storm.[13]"

        "content": " Severe Tropical Storm York (or Typhoon York),[1] also known in the Philippines as Tropical Depression Neneng, was a tropical cyclone that formed in September 1999. It brought severe impacts to the Philippines and southeastern China, causing 35 deaths. York is considered the worst tropical cyclone to hit Hong Kong since 1983. York was first noted as a tropical disturbance over the Philippine Sea on September 9, 1999, and became a tropical depression three days later on September 12. Initially, the intensity of the system was that of a weak tropical depression; however, it formed a new center while in the northern South China Sea west of Luzon soon after. York intensified into a tropical storm on September 13 and its track was erratic and remained stationary for a while, until it landfalled near Hong Kong as a minimal typhoon on September 16.[1] York then weakened to a tropical storm and quickly degenerated into a remnant area of low pressure soon after on the following day. York generated heavy rainfall and flooding when it crossed over the Philippines, which claimed the lives of 18 people. York is particularly noted for leading to the Hong Kong Observatory issuing the highest No. 10 warning for the first time since 1983 as well as killing two people in Hong Kong when it passed near the city. A cargo ship reportedly sunk, 18,000 homes lost power in the wake of the storm and 4,000 trees were uprooted in Hong Kong. In Macau, one person was injured and 120 incidents related to the storm were reported. In the Chinese province of Guangdong, fifteen people lost their lives and from the heavy rainfall. Overall, total damages were estimated to be at least $34 million (USD)."

        "content": "On September 5, 1999, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began monitoring an area of convection southeast of Guam.[2] Slow development for the low pressure area ensued over the next few days as it steadily headed west. The low pressure area slowly developed, however the organization of the wave was insufficient to be considered a tropical cyclone until September 10, when the JTWC issued a formation alert at 0300 UTC.[3] PAGASA was first to upgrade the invest to a tropical depression and gave the storm the name of Neneng,[4] with JTWC soon following suit and initiating warnings on the tropical depression. The depression did not initially significantly intensify due to land interaction with Luzon. However, good outflow was present in the depression, and deep convection began to wrap around the center.[2] The depression relocated to the west of Luzon on September 12. The former convection quickly dissipated and was absorbed by the new circulation center. Upper-level outflow, benefited by minimal vertical shear then became favourable. The depression subsequently reconsolidated and intensified into a tropical storm, receiving the name York.[2][3] York's track was relatively erratic,[5] and it remained nearly stationary on September 13, with the slow movement due to the weakening of a mid-level ridge over southern China.[6] Several circulation centers were present at the time.[2] York began to move on a northwesterly course guided by a strengthening yet weak subtropical ridge over southern China on September 14. However, the movement of York was slow and once almost stationary due to a weak steering flow.[2][6] On other hand, conditions were relatively conducive at the time, allowing gradual and steady intensification of York. Both the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) assessed it as a severe tropical storm.[5][7] York once again briefly stalled on September 15.[5] However, it continued to strengthen with a broad, ragged eye developing.[2] Consequently, the JTWC upgraded York to a typhoon at noon UTC, with the HKO following suit later with support of ground observations.[3][5] The JMA, however, never recognized it as a typhoon.[7] The ridge re-strengthened which caused York to move west-northwesterly as it headed near Hong Kong. Pressure at Waglan Island reached 971\u00a0hPa (28.7\u00a0inHg) around 0000 UTC on September 16.[5] Maximum sustained winds of York peaked at 130 kilometres per hour (81\u00a0mph; 70\u00a0kn).[3][2] Ultimately, York passed near Lantau Island of Hong Kong and eventually made landfall in Zhuhai. Once over land, York deteriorated rapidly and dissipated into a low pressure area over China the next day."

Sustained hurricane-force winds were also recorded in Cheung Chau and Sai Kung, with storm-force sustained winds also recorded in Tsing Yi, North Point and Tsim Sha Tsui Ferry Pier, making York one of the strongest storms to affect Hong Kong after World War II, with impacts rivaling Typhoon Wanda of 1962 and Typhoon Mangkhut of 2018.[9] Overall in Hong Kong, strong storm to hurricane-force winds were recorded. Both the HKO and Macao Meteorological and Geophysical Bureau (SMG) issued the No.10 hurricane signal, which lasted 11 and 8.5 hours respectively, both post-WWII records in terms of length. In Hong Kong, a man was found dead in Cheung Chau 64 hours after being swept away by waves. Another man was killed by debris blown by high winds in Tseung Kwan O. Injuries reached to 500 in the city in which 11 were severely injured, making York the storm that led to most injuries in the city since World War II. In Wan Chai, more than 400 pieces of glass were blown off from several buildings. A tower crane collapsed and hit a nearby building in the same region, forcing 25 people to evacuate due to a suspected gas leak. 64 reported flooding cases were reported during York, with over 340 hectares of farmland flooded, forcing over 300 people to evacuate. A total of more than 800 signboards and more than 4,000 trees collapsed, with a large number of roads blocked by fallen trees, and tattered signboards seen everywhere on the streets.[10] Electrical shortages were reported in several places in Hong Kong, with water shortages also reported in Sai Kung and Cheung Chau. Transportation came to a halt with at least 470 flights delayed or cancelled due to bad weather, affecting 80 thousand passengers. Damages could total to as high as several billion Hong Kong dollars.[5] In Macao, York led to violent winds, with sustained winds of 108\u00a0km/h (67\u00a0mph) and gusts as high as 181\u00a0km/h (112\u00a0mph) recorded in Taipa Grande. 120 incidents were reported during the storm, with a chimney collapsing in Zona Norte.[11] At least one injury was reported during the storm.

        "content": " Hurricane Ismael was responsible for significant flooding throughout the Inland Empire of the United States in August 1983. The cyclone was the tenth depression, ninth named storm, and fifth hurricane of the 1983 Pacific hurricane season. The origins of Hurricane Ismael were from a northward bulge of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) in early August, which resulted in the formation of a tropical depression on August\u00a08. Six hours later, it was upgraded into Tropical storm Ismael. Continuing to intensify, Ismael was upgraded into a hurricane late on August\u00a010 and subsequently developed an eye. After bypassing the Revillagigedo Islands, the storm reached its peak wind speed of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h). Late on August\u00a011, Hurricane Ismael began to weaken as it encountered cooler waters. The following day, Ismael was downgraded into a tropical storm. On August\u00a014, the storm was downgraded into a tropical depression approximately 250\u00a0mi (400\u00a0km) west of Point Ensenada. After turning north, Ismael dissipated later that day near Guadalupe Island. While still out at sea, Ismael brought 6\u20139\u00a0ft (1.8\u20132.7\u00a0m) waves to Southern California, though waves from the storm were less than expected. One person was swept away at a beach. The remnants of the storm later moved over the region, resulting in moderate rainfall. The Yucca Valley was the worst hit by the storm, where nearly every road was washed out. Almost 50,000\u00a0residents were isolated due to rains. A tornado was spotted near Los Angeles, causing minor damage. In San Bernardino, many buildings were destroyed. Around 80,000\u00a0homes were left without power across the Inland Empire. Moreover, three interstates were closed. In all, minor injuries were reported, three people died in San Bernardino when their car swept into a channel, and an engineer was killed returning to China Lake when her car was swept into a wash. Damage in the region totaled $19\u00a0million (1983\u00a0USD). After affecting California, the remnants of the hurricane moved into Nevada. Many parking lots in Laughlin were flooded; two small towns in Clark County were also isolated. Furthermore, several major streets along the outskirts of Las Vegas were closed because of flooding."

        "content": "Hurricane Ismael originated from a northward bulge of the ITCZ in early August. On August\u00a07, the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center (EPHC) reported that this bulge had resulted in the formation of a tropical disturbance centered 500\u00a0mi (800\u00a0km) south of Acapulco. Late on August\u00a08, the system was upgraded into a tropical depression.[1] Initially, the storm was expected to turn west and remain at sea;[2] however, the depression turned northwest instead. Six hours after becoming a tropical cyclone, the low was upgraded into Tropical Storm Ismael.[1] After remaining a marginal tropical storm for 18\u00a0hours, Ismael began to deepen and by August\u00a010, it was approaching hurricane intensity.[3] By this time, the storm was forecast to accelerate and approach Guadalupe Island in three days.[2] At 1800\u00a0UTC on August\u00a010, Ismael was upgraded into a hurricane. At 0245\u00a0UTC the next day, an eye began to form as the system passed east of the outer Revillagigedo Islands.[1] Nine hours later, the EPHC upgraded the storm into a Category\u00a02 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (SSHWS); simultaneously, the storm reached its peak of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h). At the time of its peak, Hurricane Ismael was located about 400\u00a0mi (640\u00a0km) west of Cabo San Lucas.[3] Sandwiched between a ridge to the west of the hurricane and a trough off the coast of California, Ismael turned west-northwest and accelerated.[1] Late on August\u00a011, Hurricane Ismael began to weaken as it encountered cooler waters.[1] According to the EPHC, the storm was downgraded to a Category\u00a01 on the SSHWS late on August\u00a011. The following day, Ismael was downgraded into a tropical storm about 380\u00a0mi (610\u00a0km) west of the Baja California Peninsula.[3] On August 13, Hurricane Hunters flew through the storm, penetrating the center of circulation twice.[1] During its first penetration, the aircraft reported winds of 40\u00a0mph (65\u00a0km/h) just east of the center and also noted that the weakening system had a poorly defined eye. Two hours later, the aircraft made its second pass through Tropical Storm Ismael, with the aircraft reporting winds of 35\u00a0mph (55\u00a0km/h). Based on this, the storm was downgraded into a tropical depression while centered about 250\u00a0mi (400\u00a0km) west of Point Ensenada. After turning north and entering even cooler waters,[1] the storm made landfall on Guadalupe. The depression dissipated later on August 14 about 20\u00a0mi (30\u00a0km) southwest of Guadalupe Island[3] which is not normally affected by tropical cyclones.[4]"

In Malibu, one home was damaged due to the increased surf.[7] In Laguna Beach, in southern Orange County, a 20-year-old woman was swept off rocks and later died.[8][9] Overall, Hurricane Ismael was one of six tropical cyclones to bring high waves to the state within a span of a month.[10] On August\u00a011, the outer rainbands of Hurricane Ismael brought unseasonably high humidity and thunderstorms to Southern California.[11] Subsequently, flash flood watches were posted for much of Southern California. The remnants of the storm eventually moved over the area, resulting in significant flooding.[12] Some areas sustained 2\u00a0in (50\u00a0mm) of rain,[13] leading to water depths of 2 to 4\u00a0ft (61 to 122\u00a0cm) on roadways.[14] The towns of Joshua Tree, Yucca Valley, Twentynine Palms, California, and Landers were the hardest hit.[14] Nearly every road was washed out in the Yucca Valley.[15] Almost 50,000\u00a0residents in Palm Springs were isolated due to brief, but heavy rains.[14] In addition, a tornado damaged two homes and over seven chimneys near Los Angeles. Heavy rains also drenched the cities of Riverside and San Bernardino while flooding several homes.[14] In the latter, many buildings were destroyed, forcing widespread evacuations.[16] In Rancho Mirage, 24\u00a0homes were damaged.[17][18] One woman had to be rescued after she was swept 3\u00a0mi (4.8\u00a0km) downstream a river in Los Angeles.[19] Around 80,000\u00a0homes were left without power across the Inland Empire, though within 24 hours after the outage, power was restored to all but 4,000\u00a0residents.[20] Moreover, portions of Interstate\u00a010, Interstate\u00a015, and 215 were closed. The highway the lead into Palm Springs was closed as well, resulting in major traffic jams.[17] In all, minor injuries were reported.[16] However, three people died in San Bernardino when their car swept into a channel.[17] Damage from the storm totaled $19\u00a0million (1983\u00a0USD).[21]"

        "content": " Hurricane Tico is one of four major hurricanes to ever strike Mazatlan and one of the strongest landfalling Pacific hurricanes on record. Tico was the twenty-third tropical cyclone, nineteenth named storm, eleventh hurricane, and eighth major hurricane of the 1983 Pacific hurricane season. The origins of Hurricane Tico were a weak tropical disturbance that crossed Costa Rica into the Pacific Ocean on October\u00a07, 1983. Over warm waters, the system was sufficiently organized to be declared Tropical Depression Twenty-One on October 11, about 575\u00a0mi (925\u00a0km) south of Acapulco. On October\u00a012 it turned sharply northward; the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Tico on October\u00a013. Tropical Storm Tico continued to intensify. Two days after becoming a tropical storm, Tico strengthened further to attain hurricane status. Early on October\u00a019, it reached peak winds of 130\u00a0mph (210\u00a0km/h). It weakened slightly as it approached the coast, and at about 1500\u00a0UTC that day Tico made landfall near Mazatl\u00e1n with winds of 125\u00a0mph (205\u00a0km/h). The remains were tracked into the Mid-Atlantic States for five more days. Tico was the deadliest and most destructive tropical cyclone of the season. Overall, the hurricane sank nine small ships, and nine fishermen were killed. Hurricane Tico was responsible severe flooding and heavy damage due to strong winds. Throughout the state of Sinaloa, the hurricane destroyed nearly 19,000\u00a0acres (77\u00a0km2) of bean and corn, although most of the agricultural damage occurred south of Mazatl\u00e1n. In addition, the hurricane disrupted the flow of drinking water. A total of 13 hotels received extensive damage and 14 people were hurt. Twenty-five thousand people were homeless and damage throughout the country was estimated at $200\u00a0million (1983\u00a0 USD). Hurricane Tico caused a total of 135\u00a0deaths in Mexico. Although most of its impact occurred in Mexico, Tico's remnants moved into the United States, where they caused heavy rains and flooding. A total of 141\u00a0people were killed and the damage amounted to $284\u00a0million (1983\u00a0USD)."

        "content": "The origins of Hurricane Tico were from a weak tropical disturbance that crossed Costa Rica into the Pacific Ocean on October\u00a07. It tracked westward through an area of progressively warmer water temperatures, and by October\u00a011 the system was sufficiently organized to be declared Tropical Depression Twenty-One, about 575\u00a0mi (930\u00a0km) south of the Mexican port of Acapulco. The depression initially maintained a west-northwest motion, although on October\u00a012 it turned sharply northward, due to the influence of a strong trough moving eastward through Mexico. Gradually organizing, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Tico on October\u00a013 by the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center (EPHC).[1] Tropical Storm Tico continued to intensify as it progressed toward the southwest Mexican coastline. A Hurricane Hunters flight late on October\u00a013 indicated the beginnings of an eyewall, 14\u00a0miles (22\u00a0km) in diameter, although the eye was open and incomplete. The next day, Tico strengthened further to attain hurricane status, about 190\u00a0mi (310\u00a0km) off the Guerrero coast. Around that time, a building ridge to the north of Tico turned the hurricane northwestward away from land. The intensity fluctuated by about 20\u00a0mph (35\u00a0km/h) for two days, during which it curved more to the west. By October\u00a016, its strengthening rate quickened, and Tico reached major hurricane status (Category\u00a03 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale).[1] After briefly weakening into a Category\u00a02 hurricane, Hurricane Tico again attained major hurricane strength. Meanwhile, another trough moved eastward across northwestern Mexico; as a result, the hurricane turned northwestward and began accelerating while maintaining a well-defined eye. Early on October\u00a019, it reached peak winds of 135\u00a0mph (215\u00a0km/h), equivalent to a powerful Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS), while located about 200\u00a0mi (320\u00a0km) south-southeast of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula. It weakened slightly as it approached the coast, and at about 1500\u00a0UTC that day Tico made landfall very near Mazatl\u00e1n with winds of 125\u00a0mph (205\u00a0km/h).[1] It rapidly weakened over land and merged with a cold front, although significant moisture from the hurricane persisted into the South Central United States. After dropping heavy rainfall in Oklahoma, the former low associated with Tico continued northeastward to near Lake Michigan. Precipitation spread across the Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic States as the low turned southeastward, and the remnants of Tico were last observed on October\u00a024 over Ohio.[2]"

Moderate rainfall was reported around the landfall location, peaking at 8.98\u00a0inches (228\u00a0mm) in Pueblo Nuevo, Durango; lighter precipitation of 1\u20133\u00a0inches (25\u201375\u00a0mm) occurred further inland toward the Mexico/United States border.[2] Two 328\u00a0ft (100\u00a0m) anchored ships were washed aground by strong waves and swells,[4] with a total of seven ships reported missing.[5] Overall, the hurricane sank nine small ships, and nine fishermen were killed.[1] In Mazatl\u00e1n and 22\u00a0other nearby towns, power service was cut off[6] but was restored the next day.[3] The surge and strong winds of Hurricane Tico were responsible for severe flooding and heavy damage. Throughout the state of Sinaloa, the hurricane destroyed nearly 19,000\u00a0acres (77\u00a0km2) of bean and corn, although most of the agricultural damage occurred south of Mazatl\u00e1n.[1] Many roofs of homes received damage. In addition, the hurricane disrupted the flow of drinking water. A total of 13 hotels received extensive damage and 14 people were hurt.[7] Throughout Durango, many bridges collapsed due to flooding.[8] Twenty-five thousand people were homeless and damage throughout the country was estimated at $200\u00a0million (1983\u00a0USD).[9] However, the death toll was initially uncertain. Local reports from a few days after the storm indicated 105\u00a0people were missing.[1] According to a report from the United States Agency for International Development indicated that Hurricane Tico caused a total of 135\u00a0deaths in Mexico.[10] Due to destruction from Hurricane Tico, President Miguel De La Madrid declared a state of emergency and also ordered the department of health, defense, and Interior to rush to provide assistance to the devastated state.[7]"

Precipitation from Tico continued northeastward and eastward, with rainfall totals of 3\u20137\u00a0inches (75\u2013175\u00a0mm) extending across the Ohio Valley and into the Mid-Atlantic.[2] Flooding was reported in parts of southern Kansas, Texas, and especially Oklahoma,[1] with serious flooding reported along the lower Washita River.[12]\nThe Oklahoma Highway Patrol asked for volunteers with motorboats 16\u00a0ft (4.9\u00a0m) or longer to help rescue 50-100\u00a0trapped people. The patrol also asked the Oklahoma City police to help find victims in the floodwaters, but plans for this were held off late on October 20\u00a0due to poor weather conditions. Across Guthire, 500\u00a0people, or 5% of the town's population, had sought three emergency shelters.

The Cottonwood Creek, also near Guthire, reached flood stage. The nearby Cimarron river was rising 2\u00a0ft (0.61\u00a0m) an hour. In Lexington, Oklahoma guardsmen were called out to help police. Across Lubbock, Texas, sewer pipes were backed up due to 7\u00a0in (180\u00a0mm) inches of rain. Throughout Oklahoma and Texas, 200\u00a0people were homeless and six people were killed and one person was missing. According to Kansas officials, one person was killed in the state. In the aftermath of the storm, residents cleaned up debris on streets.[3][7][13][14] By October\u00a023, people living in Guthire were given permission to return to their homes because floodwaters started to recede.[15] A total of $77\u00a0million in crop damage occurred in Oklahoma. Total damage in the state was estimated at $84\u00a0million (1983\u00a0USD, $182\u00a0million 2009\u00a0USD).[16]"

However, in 1960, there were five hurricane, but only two in 1961. Although there were an abnormally high number of tropical cyclones for its time, 1961 fell below the 1995-2008 average number of tropical cyclones, which is 15 tropical cyclones, 9 hurricanes, and 4 major hurricanes.[2] In addition, there were eleven tropical cyclones, two hurricanes, but no major hurricanes. However, in post-analysis, it was noted that \"Tropical Storm Madeline\" was only a tropical depression, and shouldn't have been named. Tropical cyclone activity first began about a month after the official start of the season, with Iva developed on June 9. After Iva dissipated on June 11, there was another period of lack of tropical cyclogenesis for almost a month, ending after Tropical Storm Joanne developed on July 10. July was an active month, with four tropical cyclones developing. However, the month of August and September combined featured only two tropical cyclones. After September, there were two tropical cyclones in October, both existing only on October 3 and October 4. Two more tropical cyclones developed in November,[1] which was the first time on record, and would not occur again until 2006.[3] Operationally, the San Francisco Weather Bureau issued advisories for Tropical Storm Simone, which existed in early November south of Mexico. The system originated from the remnants of Atlantic Hurricane Hattie, crossing into the basin on November\u00a01; on the same day, the system was named Simone. The system consisted of a broad circulation with gale force winds, which the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis committee referred as a Central American gyre; as it lacked a well-defined center, the system was removed as a tropical cyclone in 2019. The gyre intensified before moving ashore Mexico on November\u00a03, whereupon it dissipated.[4]"

Originating from an area of low pressure over the western Pacific, Nora was first identified as a tropical depression on October\u00a02, 1973. Tracking generally westward, the system gradually intensified, attaining typhoon status the following evening. After turning northwestward, the typhoon underwent a period of rapid intensification, during which its central pressure decreased by 77\u00a0mb (hPa; 2.27\u00a0inHg) in 24\u00a0hours. At the end of this phase, Nora peaked with winds of 295\u00a0km/h (185\u00a0mph) and a pressure of 875\u00a0mb (hPa; 25.91\u00a0inHg), making it the most-intense tropical cyclone on record (alongside Typhoon Ida in 1958) at the time; however, this pressure has since been surpassed by Typhoon June, Typhoon Tip and Hurricane Patricia. The typhoon subsequently weakened and turned northwestward as it approached the Philippines. After brushing Luzon on October\u00a07, the system passed south of Taiwan and ultimately made landfall in China on October\u00a010. Once onshore, Nora quickly weakened and dissipated the following day. The Philippines and Taiwan sustained the most extensive losses from Typhoon Nora, with 36\u00a0people losing their lives collectively. In the former, more than 1\u00a0million residents were left homeless as high winds and flooding wrecked homes. Damage in the country reached $2\u00a0million (1973\u00a0USD, $14.1\u00a0million in 2024\u00a0USD). In Taiwan, more than 1,000\u00a0homes were destroyed and 8,000\u00a0people were left homeless. The typhoon was also responsible for several maritime incidents that killed at least four people."

Drifting northwestward, the system gradually organized into a tropical depression by October\u00a02. Later that day, aircraft reconnaissance revealed the system to have intensified into a tropical storm, at which time it was assigned the name Nora.[1] The system's movement soon became slow and erratic, with Nora executing a counter-clockwise loop on October\u00a03.[1][2] After completing the loop, it attained typhoon status and acquired a temporary northward trajectory.[1] Due to the cyclone's proximity to the Philippines, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Luming.[3] Late on October\u00a04, Nora began to undergo a period of rapid intensification.[2] Several aircraft reconnaissance missions were flown by the U.S. Air Force 54th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron into the storm between October\u00a05 and 6, documenting the typhoon's dramatic strengthening.[4] By the evening of October\u00a05, Nora had attained winds in excess of 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph), ranking it as a Category\u00a05-equivalent super typhoon on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale.[1] A recon mission into the storm at this time revealed concentric eyewalls, measured at 14\u00a0km (9\u00a0mi) and 32\u00a0km (20\u00a0mi). Initially, the aircraft was unable to penetrate into the core of the eye due to severe turbulence; however, they were successful after a second attempt. Once inside the eye, they discovered an almost cloud-free center with \"an amphitheater or bowl-like appearance.\" Stratocumulus clouds were suppressed to an unusually low altitude of 1.2\u00a0km (0.75\u00a0mi). The core of Nora was exceptionally warm, with temperatures reaching a near-record 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F) at the 700\u00a0mb level. At 0020\u00a0UTC on October\u00a06, a dropsonde released by the reconnaissance team recorded a surface pressure of 877\u00a0mb (hPa; 25.91\u00a0inHg) just inside the eyewall of the typhoon.[4] At this time, maximum winds were estimated to have peaked at 295\u00a0km/h (185\u00a0mph).[1] This intensity ranked Nora as the most-intense tropical cyclone on record in the world, alongside Typhoon Ida in 1958. However, in post-storm analysis, it was noted that since the dropsonde did not record a pressure at the storm's center, Nora was likely slightly stronger than indicated.[4] Since then, Nora's intensity has been surpassed by three other storms: Typhoon June in 1975, Typhoon Tip in 1979, and Hurricane Patricia in 2015.[5][6] Despite the storm's extreme intensity, it quickly began to weaken as it approached the Philippines on October\u00a06. Within ten\u00a0hours, the pressure rose to 894\u00a0mb (hPa; 26.40\u00a0inHg) and later dropped below Category\u00a05 status.[1][4] That morning, Nora turned more northwesterly in response to a weakening in a subtropical ridge and an approaching shortwave trough over China.[1] Steady weakening continued over the following days, with the storm brushing the northeastern tip of Luzon, Philippines, with winds of 175\u2013185\u00a0km/h (110\u2013115\u00a0mph) on October\u00a07.[1][2] Nora's intensity leveled out around 130\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph) on October\u00a08 as it tracked between the Philippines and Taiwan.[1] After passing within 95\u00a0km (60\u00a0mi) of Taiwan, Nora turned more northerly before making landfall near Xiamen, Fujian as a minimal typhoon early on October\u00a010. Once onshore, the storm rapidly degenerated into an area of low pressure before dissipating the following day.[1][7]"

The United States Air Force also moved its planes from Clark Air Base to other bases in Asia. Additionally, all schools in Manila were closed.[10] Brushing the coast of Luzon in the Philippines as a Category\u00a03-equivalent typhoon, Nora caused considerable damage in the region.[1] Gale-force winds were measured across much of western Luzon, with a peak reading of 126\u00a0km/h (78\u00a0mph) at Manila port.[2] These winds caused scattered power and communication losses throughout the Peninsula.[11] The city of Baguio (population 100,000) lost power for approximately six hours.[10] Crop losses were extensive, with the storm striking close to harvest time.[11] Heavy rains from the storm, peaking at 338\u00a0mm (13.3\u00a0in) in Baguio,[2] triggered significant flooding and caused a breach in the Arnedo Dike in Apalit, Pampanga. Eight towns along a 45\u00a0km (30\u00a0mi) stretch downstream were flooded; however, roads remained passable. Flooding in Manila also prompted the evacuation of 400\u00a0residents.[10] In Caloocan, a child died after being electrocuted by downed wires.[11] Across the Philippines, 24\u00a0people were killed and over 1\u00a0million were left homeless.[12] Damage to crops and property reached $2\u00a0million (1973\u00a0USD, $14.1 million in 2024\u00a0USD).[1] Nora was the first of three typhoons to impact the Philippines in the span of a week, with Patsy and Ruth striking the country on October\u00a012 and 15 respectively.[12] While passing south of Taiwan, rough seas spawned by the typhoon were responsible for several maritime incidents over the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea. The Philippine Freighter Asian Mariner, though all 38\u00a0crewmen were rescued. The Greek freighter Baltic Klif capsized about 150\u00a0km (90\u00a0mi) southwest of the Penghu Islands, with three crewmen confirmed dead and several others missing and presumed dead. Additionally, the Taiwanese fishing vessel Jai Tai NR3 became stranded amid 9.1\u00a0m (30\u00a0ft) seas, with its bow split open. One of the crew perished; however, the frigate USS Worden was able to rescue seven fishermen despite the dangerous seas.[1] As the storm neared landfall in China, two ships became stranded over the South China Sea and sent out distress signals.[13] Passing within 95\u00a0km (60\u00a0mi) of Taiwan, the storm brought gale-force winds and torrential rain to the island. A peak gust of 126\u00a0km/h (78\u00a0mph) was measured in Tungchi, Penghu Islands. The most significant impacts came from the rains, which amounted to 523\u00a0mm (20.6\u00a0in) in Sinkong over a 20\u2011hour span. Widespread flooding and many landslides destroyed at least 1,000\u00a0homes, and washed out bridges, roads, and railroads.[1][2] Twelve people lost their lives and twenty-eight others were reported missing. Additionally, 8,000\u00a0people were left homeless.[1] In Hong Kong, the typhoon produced gusty winds, peaking at 95\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph), though no rainfall was recorded.[14] Although Nora struck China as a typhoon, there were no reports of damage received.[1]"

The first named storm in the 2008 Pacific typhoon season, named after the Korean word for raccoon dog, it formed from a low pressure area on April 13 to the east of the Philippine island of Mindanao, and after crossing the island it intensified into a tropical storm in the South China Sea. Environmental conditions allowed for quick strengthening, with Neoguri attaining typhoon status on April 16. The typhoon reached its peak intensity on April 18 as it approached the island of Hainan, and subsequently it turned northward. Due to increased wind shear and cooler waters, Neoguri rapidly weakened and made landfall as a minimal tropical storm in southern China on April 19. In the southern Philippines, the storm brought heavy rainfall, which left a person missing when a boat capsized. The typhoon left 40\u00a0fishermen missing in the South China Sea. Neoguri brought heavy rainfall as it made its final landfall on China, causing moderate damage totaling over \u00a5296\u00a0million (2008\u00a0RMB, $42\u00a0million 2008\u00a0USD).

        "content": "An area of disorganized convection persisted east-northeast of Palau on April 11 in association with a sharp easterly wave, and within the system, a low pressure area was evident between Palau and Yap. Located beneath a developing anticyclone, with limited wind shear and enhanced diffluence, the system encountered favorable conditions for development.[1] By April 13, a low-level circulation had formed and started consolidating about 260\u00a0km (160\u00a0mi) southeast of Bislig on Mindanao island in the Philippines. At around the same time, weak rainbands began wrapping into the center.[2] At 1200\u00a0UTC on April 13, the JMA classified it as a weak tropical depression.[3] Its development was impeded somewhat as it crossed Mindanao and Negros island, though the circulation consolidated while convective banding features increased.[4] Later that day, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) classified the system as Tropical Depression Ambo,[5] and early on April 14 the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified it as Tropical Depression 02W about 300\u00a0km (185\u00a0mi north of the Zamboanga Peninsula).[6] Also, PAGASA declared \"Ambo\" at 0300 UTC April 14 to be within Dumaguete.[7] The depression continued westward, along the southern periphery of a strong subtropical ridge extending from southeastern Asia to north of Luzon. After it entered the Sulu Sea, the convection and circulation continued to consolidate, while its anticyclone aloft provided excellent outflow. Based on satellite intensity estimates using the Dvorak technique, the JTWC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm 02W midday on April 14.[8] At 0000\u00a0UTC on April 15, the JMA classified the system as a full tropical depression,[9] and six hours later the agency upgraded it to Tropical Storm Neoguri after it crossed Palawan island into the South China Sea.[10] Shortly thereafter, the PAGASA issued its last advisory on the cyclone as the storm moved out of their area of warning responsibility.[11] After attaining tropical storm status, significant intensification was limited due to a slight increase in wind shear as well as impeded outflow.[12] The slowing of the strengthening trend was temporary, and by early on April 16 the organization had rapidly improved.[13] As a result, the JMA upgraded Neoguri to a severe tropical storm.[14] Warm water temperatures contributed to further intensification, and an eye formed in the center of the convection.[15] At 1200\u00a0UTC on April 16, the JMA classified Neoguri as a typhoon about 350\u00a0km (220\u00a0mi) east of Qui Nhon, Vietnam.[16] An approaching mid-level trough turned the typhoon northwestward,[15] which enhanced outflow and contributed to further intensification.[17] Late on April 17, the JTWC assessed Neoguri as attaining peak winds of 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph), averaged over a duration of one minute, near the Paracel Islands.[18] Early the next day, the JMA estimated Neoguri reached its peak intensity with ten-minute sustained winds of 150\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph), about 190\u00a0km (120\u00a0mi) east of Sanya on the southern tip of Hainan.[19] Typhoon Neoguri underwent an eyewall replacement cycle around the time it reached peak intensity; the inner eyewall collapsed, and the outer eyewall contracted to a diameter of 65\u00a0km (40\u00a0mi). Upon attaining peak winds, the typhoon had turned northward,[20] and the China Meteorological Administration assessed Neoguri as moving ashore along Hainan island near Wenchang.[21] However, other agencies assessed the typhoon as tracking parallel to the eastern coastline just offshore. Land interaction and wind shear weakened the typhoon,[22] and by April 19 it had weakened to a tropical storm. Cooler waters contributed to further weakening, causing its convection to diminish significantly and for its circulation to become elongated.[23] After turning to the north-northeast, Neoguri made landfall on Guangdong province in southern China, a short distance west of Macau as a weak tropical storm.[24] Neoguri made landfall on China earlier than any other tropical cyclone on record, about two weeks prior to the previous record set by Typhoon Wanda in 1971.[25] Shortly after moving ashore, the JTWC issued its final warning as the cyclone began dissipating.[26]"

Signal number one was issued for southern Negros, Siquijor and Camiguin.[27] This storm signal was later scaled back up until the storm reached Palawan and the South China Sea.[28] As a tropical depression, Neoguri (Ambo) brought heavy rainfall to many portions of the Philippines, including even Metro Manila.[29] In Cebu City, the precipitation caused flooding, which forced 62\u00a0people to evacuate their houses.[30] In the Camotes Islands, rough waves capsized a motorboat with six passengers; five were rescued, with the other reported missing.[31] But the storm at least alleviated for a few days the heat that has been experienced over Luzon from the past weeks.[32] However, the storm did not stop the Palarong Pambansa (National Games in the Philippines) which was held in Puerto Princesa City in Palawan, one of the areas said by PAGASA to see stormy weather.[33] In preparation for the storm, about 21,800\u00a0fishing boats in the Chinese province of Hainan returned to port,[34] and about 120,000\u00a0people evacuated from fish farms and low-lying areas on the island. Officials halted ferry service between Hainan and the Leizhou Peninsula in Guangdong province.[35] Offshore, 56\u00a0fishermen rode out the storm in a shelter on the Paracel Islands; 38\u00a0people were rescued shortly after the storm, and initially eighteen people were reported missing.[36] The eighteen missing fishermen were found thirty hours after Neoguri struck. The ship they were on had sunk, and the crew clung to debris and made makeshift rafts to survive in the waters. However, another 18 Chinese fisherman and 22 Vietnamese fisherman remain missing.[37] On Hainan island, the storm left the city of Wenchang without power.[36] Along the mainland, ferry service was temporarily stopped between Hong Kong and Macau. At the Hong Kong International Airport, over 200 flights were delayed due to the threat of the storm; additionally, around 30 were canceled, and 66 others were deviated elsewhere.[38] The Hong Kong Observatory issued a standby warning signal on April 17, which was the second earliest standby signal on record.[39]  One day later, the No. 3 strong wind signal was issued, the earliest in record.[40] As it moved ashore, the storm brought heavy rainfall, with one station reporting 237\u00a0mm (9.35\u00a0in) in one day.[41] Strong winds downed coconut and banana trees, with agricultural damage totaling over \u00a5200\u00a0million (2008\u00a0RMB, $28\u00a0million 2008\u00a0USD).[42] Structural damage amounted to \u00a596\u00a0million (2008\u00a0RMB, $14\u00a0million 2008\u00a0USD). Three fatalities were confirmed in China, two due to a road being covered in a mud flow, and another due to winds blowing a sheet of aluminum into a person, throwing them off the roof of a stadium.[43]"

It has no official bounds; it ran year-round in 1973, but most tropical cyclones tend to form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean between June and December.

The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean, north of the equator and west of the International Date Line. Storms that form east of the date line and north of the equator are called hurricanes; see 1973 Pacific hurricane season. Tropical Storms formed in the entire west pacific basin were assigned a name by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. Tropical depressions in this basin have the \"W\" suffix added to their number. Tropical depressions that enter or form in the Philippine area of responsibility are assigned a name by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration or PAGASA.

        "content": "The tornado touched down roughly two miles north of Russell Springs just past the Adair and Russell County border around 9:53 PM EST.[3] For the next few miles east-southeast from touching down, the tornado skipped, lifting and dropping multiple times. Around 8 miles (13\u00a0km) east of Russell Springs, aerial surveys showed two distinct paths approximately 0.25 miles (0.40\u00a0km) apart through a roadside park.[3] The paths indicated a possible twin or satellite tornado, or a single, large, multiple vortex tornado. The path farthest to the east contained the most severe damage in this area. After the damage paths merged, the tornado turned due east and briefly lifted and touched down again where it damaged several homes. The tornado then grew to a width of 300 yards (270\u00a0m) as it struck Salem School, where several people were injured.[3] Numerous homes around the school were destroyed and the school was severely damaged, with at least US$150,000 worth of damage to the school.[3] The tornado continued on its eastward track as it entered the community of Gosser Ridge.[3] In Gosser Ridge, the tornado destroyed a farmhouse, killing two people and destroying nearly every building.[3][6] Several other homes were destroyed and multiple injuries occurred in Gosser Ridge. In Gosser Ridge, \"questionable F5\" damage occurred, which led the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to rate the tornado F5 on the Fujita scale.[4] In August 2000, the tornado was still rated F5, however, it was later downgraded to F4. The tornado then continued into Pulaski County, where it struck the community of Faubush. In Faubush, two people were injured, several structures were damaged or destroyed and a mobile home was destroyed. In Russell County, the tornado injured a total of 70 people, destroyed 174 structures and damaged 105 others. At an unspecified farm in Russell County, it was reported that the tornado struck a chicken farm, where it plucked chickens of all their feathers, but left them alive.[3] In total, the tornado caused anywhere from US$2.5 million to US$5 million in property damage along its path of 14 miles (23\u00a0km).[3]"

On August\u00a016, a weak tropical disturbance was moving towards the southern Philippines. Initially, land interaction with the Philippines with prevented significant development. After crossing the Philippines, the disturbance emerged into the South China Sea and increased in organization. It was upgraded into a tropical storm by midday on August\u00a022. Thereafter, Faye began to steadily strengthen, and attained typhoon intensity later that day. On August\u00a023, Typhoon Faye reached its peak intensity, which the storm would maintain for approximately 12\u00a0hours. A small cyclone, Faye moved northward on August\u00a024 due to the weakening of a ridge over China. Thereafter, its center was disrupted by land interaction with the Philippines. As such, the storm weakened slightly before striking Luzon on the morning of August\u00a025. Severe flooding and strong winds were recorded. More than 5,000\u00a0houses were damaged while 220,000\u00a0were homeless. Furthermore, around 7,000\u00a0people sought shelter. There were 18\u00a0injuries and 41\u00a0deaths in the Philippines. Overall, damage amounted to $9.6\u00a0million (1982\u00a0USD).[nb 1] Across Japan, two people perished. Recurving to the northeast, Faye continued weakening due to strong wind shear, with dissipation as a tropical cyclone occurring on the afternoon of August\u00a027. The remnants of the typhoon initially continued moving east-northeast before stalling that evening. Faye began to reorganize, and was estimated to have re-attained typical storm strength on August\u00a028. Faye intensified slightly, nearly attaining typhoon intensity on August\u00a029, but this trend was short-lived due to increased wind shear. By August\u00a031, a building ridge to Faye's north led to a southwest motion as the system steadily weakened. However, Faye managed to maintain its identity as a weak tropical cyclone for several days, before finally dissipating on September\u00a03."

        "content": "Typhoon Faye originated from a westward-moving weak area of disturbed weather located within the Philippine Sea in the middle of August. On August\u00a016, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started monitoring the disturbance for possible development. Initially, little development was expected due to its close proximity to land and Typhoon Ellis. The disturbance was poorly organized and the atmospheric circulation was exposed from the deep convection despite being located near an anticyclone, which tends to favor tropical cyclogenesis.[1][nb 2] On August\u00a020, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started tracking the disturbance.[3][nb 3] Later that day, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also started monitoring the storm, assigning it with the local name Norming.[5] After emerging into the South China Sea, the storm began to intensify. Later on the morning of August\u00a020, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) for the disturbance. At 0000 UTC on August\u00a021, the JTWC upgraded the system into a tropical depression.[1] Six hours later, the agency determined that the depression attained tropical storm status,[6] naming it Faye.[1] Tropical Storm Faye slowly tracked west-northwest since a subtropical ridge was situated near Hong Kong; however, the presence of a cold front and Ellis prevented the ridge for strengthening. Despite moderate wind shear, Faye gradually intensified.[1] Midday on August\u00a022, the JMA classified Faye as a tropical storm.[3] Meanwhile, the JTWC estimated that Faye reached typhoon status.[1] Over the south China Sea, Faye continued to intensify,[6] and according to the JMA, Faye also attained typhoon intensity on August\u00a023. That afternoon, the JMA estimated that Faye reached peak intensity of 145\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph); it would maintain this intensity for about twelve hours.[3] Around this time, the JTWC expected Faye to move westward since the ridge atop of southern China was expected to build. Instead, the typhoon turned north as the ridge over southern China weakened, and a trough was noted between Ellis and Faye. On the morning of August\u00a024, the JTWC assessed the peak intensity of the storm at 170\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph). This intensity is equivalent to a moderate Category\u00a02 hurricane on the United States-based Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Shortly after its peak, the typhoon started to weaken as its circulation interacted with the Philippines. At 1800\u00a0UTC that day, the storm made landfall in Luzon.[1] At that time, the JMA estimated winds of 130\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph).[3] Due to a combination of land interaction and strong wind shear from Typhoon Ellis, Faye became less organized.[1] At 0000\u00a0UTC on August\u00a025, the JMA downgraded Faye to a severe tropical storm[3] while the JTWC reduced it to tropical storm status.[6] After re-emerging into open water, Faye turned northeast under the influence of Typhoon Ellis. Initially, re-intensification was expected to occur; however, the shear did not relent.[1] Late on August\u00a026, the JMA estimated that Faye was no longer a tropical storm.[3] By August\u00a027, Faye began to turn east despite the JTWC forecasting the storm to continue northeast and pass west of Japan. Additionally, Faye continued to weaken, and by that time, all the thunderstorm activity was displaced from the center. At 0600 UTC on August\u00a027, the JTWC discontinued warnings on the system as only a few areas of thunderstorm activity remained present.[1] Despite this, the JMA continued to track the cyclone.[3] The remnants of Faye continued on an east-northeasterly track, despite indications from tropical cyclone forecast models that the cyclone would move northeast. Late on August\u00a027, Faye stalled between a trough and Typhoon Gordon. Thus, environmental conditions became considerably more conductive, and Faye began to rapidly intensify again.[1] At 0000 UTC on August\u00a028, data from both the JTWC and the JMA suggested that Faye regenerated into a tropical storm.[6] Operationally, the JTWC did not resume watching the cyclone until six hours later.[1] At 0900 UTC, the JTWC upgraded Faye back to a typhoon, just a mere 27 hours after the agency discontinued watching the system for the first time.[1] However, data from the JMA indicates that only slight intensification occurred during this time.[3] Shortly thereafter, a Hurricane Hunter aircraft measured winds of 130\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph). Early on August\u00a029, the JMA estimated that Faye attained winds of 105\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph), its secondary peak intensity.[3] At 1500\u00a0UTC, the JTWC demoted Faye to a tropical storm. Subsequently, Faye began to gradually weaken due to increased wind shear caused by a trough, which resulted in all of the deep convection to become displaced from the center. On August\u00a031, Faye slowly began drifting westward as a ridge deepened south of Japan. At 0600\u00a0UTC on August\u00a031, the JTWC downgraded Faye to a tropical depression under the anticipation that Tropical Depression Faye would dissipate within 24 to 48 hours. Accelerating, Faye managed to maintain its circulation for much longer than anticipated.[1] On the morning of September\u00a03, the JMA stopped watching Faye;[3] the JTWC followed suit around this time as the surface circulation had dissipated within the Sea of Japan. The remnants of the system became absorbed into the monsoon trough, which eventually spawned Typhoon Hope off the west coast of China.[1]"

Numerous roads and bridges were washed out. Coconut trees were uprooted, while sugarcane and rice suffered severe damage.[8] There, damage to crops, school buildings, and fish ponds totaled $1.5\u00a0million.[9] When the typhoon veered toward the island nation for the second time, school classes were briefly halted and six flights of the Philippine Airlines were called off.[7] Typhoon warnings were posted for much of the northern portion of the country.[10] Due to its second landfall, Faye brought significant destruction.[9] Forty-one people were killed,[11] at least 19\u00a0of which died due to flying debris, drownings or shipwrecks.[9] Offshore Palawan, Faye capsized a boat, killing seven of the 54\u00a0aboard; the remaining were rescued.[12] In Iba, the typhoon de-roofed 80% of the city's homes,[8] where 200,000 out of 500,000\u00a0residents were rendered homeless, which is 40% of the city's population.[9] Around 40% of the city's crops were wiped out.[10] In the La Union, Pangasinan, and Iloilo provinces, 1,286\u00a0residences were destroyed, sending 7,608\u00a0people to seek shelter in churches, schools and town halls.[9] Overall, damage amounted to $9.6\u00a0million;[5] including $4\u00a0million in property damage.[13] Moreover, 18\u00a0individuals were injured.[14] Around 220,000\u00a0were homeless.[15] In all, 5,365\u00a0homes were damaged due to Typhoon Faye.[16] Although the typhoon passed well to the south of Japan,[1] Faye killed two people there, including one due to a landslide.[17]"

At 1630\u00a0UTC on August\u00a05, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the developing system while it was located about 740\u00a0km (460\u00a0mi) east-northeast of the northern Mariana Islands. Deep convection was present around the center of circulation but the overall structure of the storm resembled a subtropical cyclone. However, the storm was likely to intensify as it was located within an area of low to moderate vertical wind shear with favorable diffulence aloft.[2] Later that day, the JMA upgraded the depression to a tropical storm and gave it the name Maria;[1] a name submitted by the United States and a common Chamorro feminine name.[2] Maria continued towards the west-northwest along the edge of a broad subtropical ridge located east of Japan.[2] As the JMA issued their first advisory, the JTWC designated the system as Tropical Depression 09W while located about 280\u00a0km (175\u00a0mi) east-northeast of Iwo Jima.[3][4] Early the next day, the JMA classified Maria as a severe tropical storm with winds of 95\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph 10-minute winds)[1] while the JTWC reported that Maria had just become a tropical storm with winds reaching 75\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph 1-minute winds). The storm also had a slight northward relocation.[5] Tracking towards the northwest, the storm intensified into a typhoon and reached its peak intensity with winds of 130\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph 10-minute winds) and minimum pressure of 975\u00a0hPa (mbar) at 0900\u00a0UTC.[1] Around the same time, the JTWC assessed the storm to have reached its peak intensity with winds of 110\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph 1-minute winds).[4] However, the JTWC operationally classified Maria as a minimal typhoon with winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph 1-minute winds) on August\u00a07.[6] On August\u00a07, a banding eye feature developed with deep convection around the eastern portion of the storm.[2] Later that day, the storm sharply recurved towards the northeast and paralleled the southern coastline of Honshu.[1] As Maria made the turn, dry air began to enter the system, causing it to weaken. Along with the dry air, wind shear began to increase[2] and the JMA downgraded Maria to a severe tropical storm early on August\u00a08.[1] The storm continued to weaken[2] as it came very close to landfall near Tokyo, Japan on August\u00a09.[1][4] Both agencies downgraded Maria to a tropical depression early on August\u00a09, with the JTWC issuing their final advisory at that time.[2] Maria remained a tropical depression for another 24\u00a0hours before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on August\u00a010[1] while located about 835\u00a0km (520\u00a0mi) east-northeast of Tokyo.[2] The extratropical remnants turned towards the north and dissipated late on August\u00a014 over the Sea of Okhotsk.[1]"

The JR Ito Line, an express train line, was temporarily shut down as a result of rain.[8] As Maria brushed Japan, it produced heavy rains over the southeastern areas of the country. Yokota Air Base recorded 38.1\u00a0mm (1.5\u00a0in) of rainfall and winds up to 34\u00a0km/h (21\u00a0mph).[9] Parts of the Izu Peninsula recorded rainfall in excess of 400\u00a0mm (15.7\u00a0in) over a two-day span,[10] peaking at 458\u00a0mm (18.0\u00a0in) in Tokyo.[11] In Gifu Prefecture, thunderstorms associated with the typhoon resulted in a landslide that knocked out power to 510 residences.[12] One man was injured and two cows died after a small farm was severely damaged by high winds.[13] Flooding and landslides affected dozens of homes in Ch\u014dshi, Chiba, prompting the evacuation of 63 families.[14] One person was killed in Tokyo after being struck by lightning.[15] Five people were injured when a plane headed for Tokyo encountered turbulence produced by Maria.[2]"

The fourth and the last tropical cyclone to be formed in June of the 1990 Pacific typhoon season,[1] Typhoon Percy originated from an area of disturbed weather spawned by the Western Pacific monsoon trough on June\u00a020. That same day, the disturbance was classified as a tropical depression as it slowly organized and on June\u00a021, the depression obtained tropical storm intensity. After initially tracking westward, Percy turned towards the southwest while slowly deepening. During this time, Percy affected several of the Carolina Islands. Thirty homes were damaged and airline services were halted in and out of Yap. Farther south-southwest, seven homes were destroyed on the Ngulu Atoll. Furthermore, one boy was killed on Koror, where numerous homes lost their roofs and communication lines were downed. Percy then turned back to the west-northwest and became a typhoon on June\u00a023. It then began to deepen at a faster rate, with Percy attaining its maximum intensity of 145\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph) on June\u00a025. Two days later, on June\u00a027, increased wind shear began to induce a weakening trend and the typhoon brushed Luzon, where eight people were killed and over 30,000 lost their homes. Despite that however, damages in the country was minor. After tracking through the South China Sea, Percy made landfall southwest of Xiamen on June\u00a029, and on the next day, dissipated inland. In the province of Quanzhou, four people were killed while 100,000\u00a0trees were damaged along with 1,000\u00a0power\u00a0lines. One person was killed in Zhangzhou.

Satellite imagery showed signs of a well-defined low-level circulation and the disturbance was situated in a weakly divergent environment aloft along with persistent convection.[1] On the same day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the system into a tropical depression.[2][nb 1] The system gradually became more organized as its outflow expanded, and following a marked increase in convection, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the system at 03:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a021. Following a ship report of 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph) winds,[1] both the JTWC and JMA upgraded the system into Tropical Storm Percy.[4][nb 2] After initially tracking westward, Percy turned and tracked southwestward for 36\u00a0hours, a move predicted by tropical cyclone forecast models but not foreseen by the JTWC. Meanwhile, the storm slowly intensified, aided by the development of an anticyclone caused aloft.[1] As Percy continued to intensify, Percy began to track west-northwestward around another upper-level anticyclone that was formed in the southeast of Typhoon Ofelia which would later merge with a subtropical ridge to its north.[1] By June\u00a022, Percy was upgraded into a severe tropical storm by the JMA.[4] Following the development of an outflow channel to its south, hints of an eye became visible on satellite imagery. Based on a Dvorak classification of T4.0/120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph), the JTWC upgraded Percy into a typhoon on the evening of June\u00a023,[1] with the JMA subsequently following suit in the morning of June\u00a024.[2] After moving away from the Caroline Islands, the typhoon began to intensify at a faster clip as an outflow channel to its north opened,[1] even though the eye was initially ragged. On the evening of June\u00a024, the JTWC raised the intensity of the system to 200\u00a0km/h (125\u00a0mph).[4] Early on the next day, the JTWC estimated that Percy obtained its peak intensity based on the Dvorak estimate of T6.0/210\u00a0km/h (130\u00a0mph) and a clear eye.[1] Meanwhile, the JMA reported that Percy attained its maximum intensity of 145\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 960\u00a0mbar (28.3\u00a0inHg).[4] Increased vertical wind shear took toll on the storm,[1] and by June 27, the JTWC dropped the intensity of the storm to 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph)[4] as the storm passed over northeastern Luzon.[6] Overland, the storm weakened  slightly, but remained a typhoon upon entering the South China Sea.[6] Both computer models and the JTWC expected Percy to begin recurvature; however, the subtropical ridge did not weaken as expected and Percy continued west-northwest instead.[1] At 00:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a029, the JMA downgraded Percy to a severe tropical storm,[2] although the JTWC suggested that Percy was still a typhoon at the time.[4] Shortly thereafter, Percy moved onshore around 130\u00a0km (80\u00a0mi) southwest of Xiamen.[6]  At 06:00\u00a0UTC, the JTWC downgraded Percy into a tropical storm, noting that the storm had become less organized.[1] By June 30, both the JTWC and JMA had ceased tracking the system, which had dissipated inland.[1][2]"

The typhoon passed 230\u00a0km (145\u00a0mi) north of Koror,[1] where a boy perished when he was swept by rain into mangrove trees near his home.[9] Meanwhile, radio towers, power lines and television lines were downed as several houses lost their roofs.[1] Typhoon Percy was the third typhoon of 1990, and second within a week, after Typhoon Ofelia, to threaten the Philippines.[10] In the province of La Union, landslides killed six people. In suburban Quezon City, police reported that a woman fell into a creek and drowned. The Philippine Red Cross indicated that a baby girl drowned and two other individuals were listed as missing in floods in the Ilocos Region. According to the social welfare department, 31,206\u00a0people in 6,143\u00a0families lost their homes.[11] Overall, damage in the country was light.[12] The typhoon posed enough of a threat to Hong Kong to warrant a No 1. hurricane signal briefly, but it was dropped within 24 hours. Nevertheless, a pressure of 999.4\u00a0mbar (29.51\u00a0inHg) was measured at the Hong Kong Royal Observatory early on June 29. Waglan Island recorded a mean hourly wind of 31\u00a0km/h (19\u00a0mph), with a gust of 45\u00a0km/h (28\u00a0mph). High Island received 245\u00a0mm (9.6\u00a0in) of rain during the passage of the storm, the highest in the region, 193\u00a0mm (7.6\u00a0in) fell in a 24-hour period. These rains resulted in flooding, especially in the New Territories, where there was slight damage to crops. In Kwai Chung, floodwaters were 0.6\u00a0m (2.0\u00a0ft) deep, sweeping away a ten-year-old boy. Two other villages lost power and eleven people had to be evacuated.[6] In the provinces of Fujian and Guangdong of China, power lines were downed. Farm production was reduced by 400 million catties in Fujian. In Nan'ao, gales persisted for about 10\u00a0hours and more than 410\u00a0mm (15\u00a0in) of rainfall was recorded, the heaviest in 300\u00a0years. Floodwaters there were up to 2\u00a0m (6.6\u00a0ft) deep. In Quanzhou, four people were killed, another was injured, and 100,000\u00a0ha (250,000 acres) of crops were damaged. There, 100,000\u00a0trees were damaged along with 1,000\u00a0power lines. One person was killed and tens of millions in damage was reported in Zhangzhou. In Dongshan, one individual died and four others suffered injuries. A total of 30,000\u00a0ha (74,000 acres) of asparagus were damaged. One vessel was sunk and seven more were damaged. One third of the trees there were downed. Damage in Dongshan was estimated at \u00a527\u00a0million (US$5.7\u00a0million).[nb 3] Elsewhere, 270,000\u00a0ha (670,000 acres) of farmland was flooded, including 174,000\u00a0ha (430,000 acres) of rice in Shantou. Ninety-five structures were destroyed and two hundred and one were damaged. Roughly 20\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi) of a highway was destroyed. Damage totaled \u00a549\u00a0million (US$10\u00a0million). Overall, greater than 6,650\u00a0homes were damaged and numerous fishing boats sunk. Sixteen people were killed throughout southeastern China[13] and more than 100 others sustained injuries.[6] Damage was estimated at US$28\u00a0million.[13] The remnants of Percy would interact with a frontal low and stagnate along the Korea Strait, causing heavy rainfall in Japan on July 2. As a result of this, flooding was recorded in many parts of Saga Prefecture. This flooding event caused fifteen buildings to be partially destroyed, over 250 roads to be damaged in some way, seventeen levee collapses, four bridges to be washed away, five injuries, and two deaths in the prefecture. In total, in Saga Prefecture, Percy's remnants caused 57.976 billion yen (USD$397.65 million) in damage.[14][15]"

        "content": "  Typhoon Yancy, known as Typhoon Gading in the Philippines, was an erratic tropical cyclone that delivered significant impacts in Taiwan and southeastern China in 1990. Originating from an area of disturbed weather within the monsoon trough, it organized into Tropical Storm Yancy on August\u00a014. The system moved westward for several days and slowly gathered strength, becoming a typhoon on August\u00a016 and reaching one-minute peak winds of 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph) the next day. Yancy moved erratically as it skirted along the northern coastline of Taiwan and made a subsequent landfall in southeastern China, where it lingered for several days before dissipating on August\u00a023. The storm capsized two ships offshore the Philippines. In Taiwan, torrential rainfall ruined 9,900\u00a0ha (24,400 acres) of crops, caused landslides that disrupted travel, damaged houses, downed trees, and cut power to 525,000\u00a0families. In the Fujian, Zhejiang, and Guangdong provinces of China, the cyclone damaged tens of thousands of homes, razed crops, and damaged seawalls. About 400,000\u00a0residents were left homeless throughout those locales. Along Yancy's path, 284\u00a0people were killed, 74\u00a0more were left missing, and over 927\u00a0others were injured. Total damage was estimated to be around $384\u00a0million (1990 USD)."

        "content": "At 06:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a09, Yancy was first noted by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) in a Significant Tropical Weather Advisory as an area of persistent convection.[nb 1] What would eventually develop into Typhoon Yancy initially began as a low-level convective center on the eastern side of a monsoon depression.[2] For a period lasting four\u00a0days, multiple vortices persisted at low latitudes prior to their ultimate consolidation into Yancy. During its early stages of formation, Yancy moved in an inconsistent manner as mesoscale convective elements developed and decayed, and up until August\u00a013, Yancy adopted a steady westward track. During this period, the JTWC issued three Tropical Cyclone Formation Alerts (TCFAs).[2] The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), meanwhile, began monitoring the system on August\u00a011.[3][nb 2] Of the aforementioned TCFAs, the first was issued at 21:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a011 based on the improving state of the disturbance's central convection and upper-level outflow coupled with decreasing barometric pressure at multiple nearby stations on land. A second alert was issued at 14:00\u00a0UTC the following day in response to a northward shift of a low-level center and further decreases in surface pressure. The third and final TCFA was issued at 14:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a013 as the system continued to organize. Four hours later, the JTWC issued its first warning on the newly upgraded tropical depression. It was upgraded to Tropical Storm Yancy at 12:00\u00a0UTC August\u00a014 based on increased curvature of convection and consolidation of the cyclonic center,[2] though the JMA assessed this upgrade twelve hours sooner.[3] Beyond August\u00a013, Yancy continued to follow a westward track, but it did so at a quicker pace. This period of rapid movement lasted for two days as the storm moved under the influence of an intensifying subtropical ridge to the north. At 12:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a016, the JTWC determined that Yancy had strengthened into a typhoon.[2][5] Yancy's trajectory shifted from westward to north-northwestward after the subtropical ridge weakened in response to a shortwave trough moving off the coast of China. The typhoon continued to move in this direction for eighteen hours; beyond this point, the subtropical ridge re-strengthened and Yancy continued its westward trajectory. According to JTWC data, Yancy intensified into the equivalent of a Category\u00a02 on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale at 18:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a017, peaking in intensity six hours later with one-minute sustained winds of 90\u00a0knots (165\u00a0km/h; 105\u00a0mph).[2][5] JMA data, however, placed Yancy's peak intensity eighteen hours later, with ten-minute sustained winds of 80\u00a0knots (150\u00a0km/h; 90\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 28.05\u00a0inHg (950\u00a0mbar).[3] On August\u00a018, just as the cyclone was peaking in intensity, it developed an eye. Yancy then proceeded to carry out a trochoidal oscillation,[2] tracking across Taiwan the next day.[3] Yancy's interaction with mountainous terrain on the island, and later the Chinese mainland, caused it to weaken.[2] JMA data reflects this weakening, with Yancy's winds decreasing to severe tropical storm intensity at 18:00\u00a0UTC August\u00a019 and tropical storm intensity twelve hours later.[3] The JTWC downgraded Yancy to a tropical storm at 00:00\u00a0UTC August\u00a020; thirty hours later, the agency downgraded the storm to a tropical depression, simultaneously issuing its final warning and declaring Yancy dissipated.[2] The JMA similarly found that Yancy had weakened to a tropical depression on August\u00a022, and it stopped tracking the system the next day.[3]"

Over 60,000\u00a0residents fled to evacuation centers.[2] Offshore, two ships capsized in rough seas generated by the storm's large circulation. Six people were killed, four people were reported missing, and eight people were injured in the marine accidents.[8] To the north in Taiwan, heavy rains up to 1,194\u00a0mm (47.0\u00a0in) in the Alishan Range and 718.5\u00a0mm (28.29\u00a0in) on Yu Shan were recorded.[9] These rains caused extensive flooding that washed away 9,900\u00a0ha (24,400 acres) of rice, vegetable, and fruit plantations.[10] The combination of floods and landslides caused many railways and roads to be blocked with hundreds of trees being uprooted. One house was collapsed and seven other homes were damaged by the storm. In Taipei alone, about 525,000\u00a0families lost power. In the Port of Keelung, one fishing vessel capsized and a 31,600\u00a0ton ship Livi was run aground.[8] The severe weather shut down Taoyuan International Airport for two days.[11] In total, thirteen people were killed across the island,[8] with seven people being reported missing after being washed away by floods,[10] and fourteen others were injured from falling objects.[8][12] Five of these deaths occurred when five cars were swept off a bridge;[12] additional fatalities occurred either by flying signs and debris or as a result of electrocution by downed power lines.[13] Total damage across Taiwan was estimated at NT$2.7\u00a0billion.[8] Yancy delivered significant impact to southeastern China. In Fujian, where the cyclone meandered for days and contributed to more than 610\u00a0mm (24\u00a0in),[14] more than 4\u00a0million residents were directly affected.[15] More than 40,000\u00a0houses were damaged or destroyed, and 157\u00a0boats were swept away. About 171,300\u00a0ha (423,000 acres) of farmland were inundated by flooding,[8] of which 40,000\u00a0ha (100,000 acres) occurred in Fuqing County alone.[16] Up to 237\u00a0km (147\u00a0mi) of communication lines were damaged. Additional damage was inflicted to 447\u00a0bridges and 20,000\u00a0sites of irrigation works. The total cost was estimated at $900\u00a0million RMB. The storm killed 161 people and injured 468\u00a0more in that province,[8] many of whom died in collapsed buildings.[17] In neighboring Zhejiang, about 20,700\u00a0homes were damaged. The hardest hit locale was Wenzhou, where approximately 99,000\u00a0ha (240,000 acres) of land suffered extensive flooding,[8] and where grain losses amounted to 20,000\u00a0tons.[18] Total damage was estimated at $450\u00a0million RMB. A total of 96\u00a0people were killed, 63\u00a0others were reported missing, and more than 400 more were injured. An additional 7,800\u00a0heads of livestock were killed as well.[8] Throughout both the Fujian and Zhejiang provinces, seawalls and dikes were damaged.[19] In the two months leading up to Yancy's impact, the region had been struck by four typhoons.[20] In eastern Guangdong, the effects of the storm, chiefly from heavy rainfall, collapsed 4,800\u00a0homes and inundated about 89,000\u00a0ha (220,000 acres) of farmland. Eight people were killed and another thirty-seven people were injured.[8] Throughout the entirety of southeastern China, 400,000\u00a0residents were left homeless.[21]"

Heavy rains from Chebi resulted in steep, slippery mountainsides. This unconsolidated soil broke loose and began heading for the valleys of Dawu. During its path, the mudslide destroyed at least 4 mountainside homes, killing 14. The mudslide later smashed into a business district, with many people sheltering there to escape the floods. The impact of the mudslide caused the destruction of a three-story office building, sheltering 11 at the time of impact.

Early on April\u00a027, it pushed back northward against a warm front to the east, due to a vigorous upper-atmospheric trough approaching from the west. The warm front was noted to have moved from the southeast on April\u00a027 to the northeast on April\u00a028; this movement of warm air against the cold front, in proximity to a low-pressure area over western Oklahoma, provided sufficient atmospheric lift, thereby fuelling the storms that provided the tornado activity.[1]"

Developing in tandem with Typhoon Atsani to its east, Goni formed on August\u00a013, and passed through the Mariana Islands two days later. By that time, radar imagery showed a formative eye, signaling an rapidly intensifying storm. Goni evolved into an intense typhoon in the Philippine Sea before weakening and stalling north of Luzon. The typhoon re-intensified and attained peak winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph) on August\u00a023 while moving through the southern Ryukyu Islands. Goni weakened slightly and moved across the Japanese island of Kyushu. The tropical cyclone transitioned into an extratropical cyclone in the Sea of Japan on August\u00a025, crossed into eastern Russia and China a day later, and dissipated on August\u00a030. Along its path, Goni killed 74\u00a0people and left $1.05\u00a0billion (USD) in damage.[nb 1] On Guam, one of the first landmasses affected, heavy rainfall caused flooding and power outages. Across northern Luzon in the Philippines, Goni also dropped intense precipitation. This resulted in deadly landslides, flooded fields, and the destruction of thousands of houses. The typhoon also brought heavy rainfall and rough seas to Taiwan and the east coast of China. In the southern Ryukyu Islands and Kyushu, high wind overturned vehicles, damaged buildings, and left over 490,000\u00a0homes without power. Off the coast of Kyushu, a man drowned amid high waves. Flooding killed 40\u00a0people in North Korea. The extratropical remnants of Goni damaged crops and flooded a zoo in eastern Russia."

        "content": "In the middle of August 2015, a strong westerly wind burst along the equator produced two areas of convection, or thunderstorm activity, near the Marshall Islands in the western Pacific Ocean. The westernmost disturbance became associated with a circulation center near Ujelang Atoll. With low wind shear and favorable sea surface temperatures, tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated further development of both convective systems.[1] The westernmost system developed a banding pattern by August\u00a013, indicative of increased organization.[2] At 18:00\u00a0UTC that day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified it as a tropical depression, centered about 700\u00a0km (430\u00a0mi) east-southeast of Guam.[3] Early on August\u00a014, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) initiated advisories on the system with the designation Tropical Depression 16W.[4] The nascent system tracked generally west-northwestward around a subtropical ridge to its north.[4] Favorable outflow to the south counteracted moderate wind shear, though a tropical upper tropospheric trough to the northeast disrupted the thunderstorm structure.[5] Late on August\u00a014, the JMA upgraded the depression to a tropical storm, naming it Goni.[3] The storm slowly intensified and organized as it approached the Marianas Islands on August\u00a015. With diminished wind shear, rainbands were able to wrap tightly around the center.[6] When Goni passed just north of Rota on August\u00a015, radar on Guam indicated a developing eyewall in the storm's core.[7][8] At 18:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a015, the JMA upgraded Goni to a severe tropical storm, and further to typhoon status by the next day.[3] The previously disruptive trough to the north soon aided the storm's intensification by enhancing its outflow, and other environmental conditions remained favorable. Consequently, Goni began a period of rapid deepening on August\u00a016.[9] By early on August\u00a017, Goni reached an initial peak intensity; the JMA estimated 10-minute maximum sustained winds of 175\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph),[3] and the JTWC assessed higher 1-minute winds of 215\u00a0km/h (134\u00a0mph), derived from satellite intensity estimates using the Dvorak technique. At the time, the typhoon had a small eye just 9\u00a0km (5.6\u00a0mi) in diameter.[10][11] While the typhoon was moving westward toward the Philippine island of Luzon, thunderstorms in the northern eyewall deteriorated as a result of unfavorable subsidence from a high pressure system to the north.[11][12] Early on August\u00a018, the Philippine warning center PAGASA began national advisories on the typhoon, giving Goni the local name Ineng.[13] On the next day, the typhoon rounded the subtropical ridge, co-existing with Typhoon Atsani, which developed concurrently over the western Pacific Ocean to the east.[14][15] On August\u00a021, Goni's movement became nearly stationary about 100\u00a0km (62\u00a0mi) off the northern coast of Luzon. Land interaction weakened the typhoon's convective core until a building ridge to the southeast drove Goni northeastward and allowed convection to redevelop.[3][16][17] A new eye developed on August\u00a023 as Goni passed east of Taiwan. The eye crossed over Iriomote-jima and Ishigaki, both part of the southern Ryukyu Islands.[18][19] Late on August\u00a023, Goni attained its peak intensity with JMA-estimated peak winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph).[3] Goni maintained much of its strength while traversing the East China Sea, as low wind shear allowed convection to persist around the eyewall.[18] Goni made landfall on southwestern Japan near Uki, Kumamoto, at 19:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a019, and shortly thereafter it struck Arao.[20] The convection diminished while interacting with Japan's mountainous terrain, leaving the storm's center exposed once it entered the much cooler Sea of Japan. Around 12:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a025, Goni transitioned into an extratropical cyclone.[20][21] The remnants turned northward and moved ashore near Vladivostok in the Russian Far East on August\u00a026. Former Typhoon Goni turned westward and entered northeastern China in the province of Heilongjiang. The storm stalled over northeastern China for several days, before dissipating on August\u00a030.[3][22]"

Increased water flow along the Ugum River shut down the Ugum Water Treatment Plant, leaving some residents without water access.[8]"

The next day, the agency issued the lowest tropical cyclone warning signal for the Batanes and Cagayan provinces, later upgrading the warning to signal #3; lower-level warnings were posted for most of the Cagayan Valley, Cordillera Administrative Region, and the Ilocos Region. The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) was placed on red alert in preparation for the typhoon, meaning that the agency would issue 24-hour public weather forecasts and general flood advisories. The Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) pre-stocked funds, food packs, and other emergency items to be utilized in the aftermath of the typhoon. In response to the storm threat, Philippine Airlines, SKYJET Airlines, and Cebu Pacific canceled flights throughout the Philippines, 67\u00a0boats were confined to port, and most schools closed in northern Luzon. Initially, 8,426\u00a0people evacuated to emergency shelters in advance of the cyclone, drastically increasing to 397,154\u00a0people seeking shelter during the height of the storm.[27] While stalling north of Luzon, Goni enhanced the southwest monsoon across the Philippines, resulting in rainfall and gusty winds across the western portion of the nation.[28] The storm spawned seven tornadoes, one of which damaged or destroyed ten houses in Carranglan, Nueva Ecija. Rough seas swamped a motor boat near Banton Island, forcing the crew of seven to swim ashore. Across Luzon, flooding caused landslides in 13\u00a0locations,[27] including a mountain slope in Mankayan, Benguet, that buried three mining camps, killing 13\u00a0miners. More than 100\u00a0policemen and miners searched through the mud for survivors.[29][30] Water levels quickly rose in rivers across Luzon, washing away 14\u00a0flood control systems, including one dyke. Swollen rivers also inundated several bridges and washed away one in Santa, Ilocos Sur, that left 5,100\u00a0people isolated. At three dams, water gates were opened after flood levels reached critical heights. Across Luzon, trees were knocked down and the power supply was disrupted; all electrical service was restored by September\u00a01, or 11\u00a0days after the storm's closest approach. In total, Typhoon Goni damaged 5,742\u00a0houses, of which 188 were completely destroyed. Total damages amounted to \u20b14.55\u00a0billion (US$97.6\u00a0million), split roughly evenly between agricultural and infrastructural impacts.[27] In Ilocos Norte province in northwestern Luzon, damage was estimated at \u20b11.8\u00a0billion (US$38.6\u00a0million).[31] Overall, Typhoon Goni killed 33\u00a0people and left 9\u00a0missing in the Philippines, mostly due to landslides or drownings, and injured 24\u00a0others.[28][27] A state of calamity was declared in nine provinces. In response, the Philippine Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), in conjunction with local governments, provided \u20b115.5\u00a0million (US$332,000) toward relief funds. Various agencies, including the NDRM and the Philippine Red Cross, distributed water, meals, medicine, and blankets to affected families.[27] The provincial government of Ilocos Norte provided seeds to farmers whose crops were damaged during the storm.[31] The Government Service Insurance System provided \u20b1197\u00a0million (US$4.22\u00a0million) to pension fund holders in Abra province.[32]"

Two locations recorded rainfall totals in excess of 150\u00a0mm (5.9\u00a0in).[34] Along the coast of China's Fujian province, about 5,000\u00a0people evacuated and 10,490\u00a0boats returned to port.[35]\nHeavy rainfall affected eastern China while Goni was moving through the East China Sea. Pudong, near Shanghai, recorded 337\u00a0mm (13.3\u00a0in) of rainfall over three days. The remnants of Goni also brought rainfall to southeastern China, reaching 109\u00a0mm (4.3\u00a0in) in Jiaohe, Jilin.[22] Floodwaters covered expressways and parts of Shanghai's Hongqiao Airport, delaying or halting 400\u00a0flights.[citation needed] Nationwide, the storm caused flooding along 15\u00a0small to medium-sized rivers in Zhejiang and Heilongjiang provinces. In Northeast China, storm rainfall increased water levels in 57\u00a0large reservoirs. Overall economic losses in the country totaled \u00a5204\u00a0million (US$31.9\u00a0million).[22] The Korea Meteorological Administration warned for the potential of heavy rainfall for the provinces of Jeju, Gangwon, and North and South Gyeongsang.[36] Rainfall was heaviest along the east coast of South Korea, peaking at 327\u00a0mm (12.9\u00a0in) in Gangwon Province and helping to ease drought conditions there. On the island of Ulleungdo off the country's east coast, wind gusts reached 130\u00a0km/h (81\u00a0mph). Along the shores of the mainland, winds reached around 90\u00a0km/h (56\u00a0mph). The stormy weather caused flights to be canceled in Ulsan and Busan.[37] Rough seas from the storm prompted a temporary ban on swimming along beaches in Busan.[38] The cyclone halted salvage operations of the passenger ferry MV Sewol, which capsized a year prior.[39] In North Korea, rainfall from Goni exceeded 300\u00a0mm (12\u00a0in) in Kangwon Province.[40] The rains caused flash flooding in Rason near the country's borders with China and Russia, killing 40\u00a0people in the town.[41] The floods wrecked 1,070\u00a0houses and 99\u00a0public buildings, including schools, hospitals, and nurseries. Floodwaters inundated 1.24\u00a0km2 (0.48\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of farmlands, while bridges and railroads were washed out.[30][42][43] One road to the Chinese border was damaged, leaving 484\u00a0Chinese tourists stranded in North Korea; officials from the two countries worked to restore road access.[44] With the 70th annual Foundation Day of the Workers' Party of Korea looming, Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un ordered troops to promptly repair the flood damage by building 1,800\u00a0new apartment houses and restoring 4,000\u00a0impacted homes.[30][42][43] The Red Cross Society of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea provided tarps, water purification tablets, and other emergency supplies to affected residents.[41] On September\u00a08, the agency set up two water treatment units to provide Rason residents with clean water for a month.[43] To prepare for the storm in the Russian Far East, local officials advised people living along rivers and the coastline to seek shelter and to remove livestock from low-lying areas.[45] Goni's remnants brought damaging winds and heavy rains to Primorsky Krai. Some areas received more than the average rain of two months during the storm's passage, resulting in widespread flooding.[46] About 1,100\u00a0houses, mostly in Ussuriysk, were inundated, directly affecting 9,500\u00a0people.[47][48] More than 300\u00a0buildings in Ussuriysk sustained damage.[48] The zoo in Ussuriysk was flooded with waters 1.5\u00a0m (4.9\u00a0ft) deep after the nearby Rakovka River overflowed its banks; the animals had to be evacuated after their cages were submerged,[49] and one bear drowned.[50] With 88,300 hectares (218,000 acres) of crops damaged or destroyed, Goni took a heavy toll on the agriculture industry, with losses estimated at \u20bd2.4\u00a0billion (US$35\u00a0million).[46] Total damage from the storm in Russia amounted to \u20bd8\u00a0billion (US$116.6\u00a0million).[48] A state of emergency was declared in 10\u00a0districts, and the government provided compensation for people who lost their house or farms.[47]"

Three of the tornadoes were rated F4, and one\u00a0officially was recorded as an F5 near Broken Bow, Oklahoma, all on April\u00a02. Beginning on April\u00a02, a series of tornado-producing supercells formed across portions of northeastern Texas and southeastern Oklahoma. One\u00a0produced an F5 tornado, the first since April\u00a04, 1977, which crossed mostly rural areas near Speer and Broken Bow, and deposited a motel sign from Broken Bow 30 miles (48\u00a0km) away in Arkansas. However, reanalysis a decade later found the rating to be lower, owing to unsound construction practices.[note 2] The F5 tornado resulted in no fatalities, but an F4 tornado in Paris, Texas, resulted in 10\u00a0fatalities and 170\u00a0injuries.[4] Additionally, the Storm Prediction Center, known then as the Severe Local Storms Unit, issued its first officially documented high risk on April\u00a02, as well as the first tornado watch to contain the wording Particularly Dangerous Situation (PDS).[5][note 3]"

The total count of tornadoes and ratings differs from various agencies accordingly.

        "content": "This powerful, multiple-vortex tornado touched down near Speer, tracked east-southeastward through the rural community of Messer, and traversed the Hugo Reservoir. A newly constructed home near Messer was obliterated, with only strips of carpet tacking left on its foundation. Surveyed by Ted Fujita, the tornado was assigned a rating of F5\u00a0based on this damage and is still listed as an F5\u00a0in official records. Photographs of the bare concrete slab suggested, however, that the home was improperly anchored: only F3-level winds may have been needed to produce the observable effects on the structure. A reanalysis by Thomas P. Grazulis in 1993 concluded that the tornado did not attain F5 intensity. Further on, the tornado attained a peak width of 1+1\u20442\u00a0mi (2.4\u00a0km; 2,600\u00a0yd; 2,400\u00a0m) and produced F4-level damage to ranch-style homes near Golden. In all, the tornado destroyed approximately 35\u00a0homes and yielded losses of $8\u00a0million, though it missed densely populated areas. The tornado also destroyed chicken coops, mobile homes, and a church, along with agricultural implements, electrical lines, and tracts of timber. Up to 40\u00a0barns were wrecked as well. As it passed just south of Broken Bow, the tornado struck the Tri-A-Nite Motel; signage from the motel was later found 30\u00a0mi (48\u00a0km) distant, in Arkansas. Near Messer, the tornado hurled a 2-by-4-inch (51 by 102\u00a0mm) board into and pierced a tree. 29\u00a0injuries occurred along the path. The NCEI incorrectly list the path as extending from south-southwest of Hamden to south of Eagletown.[115]"

Developing near the intersection of Campbell Street and Loop 286, it extensively damaged or destroyed more than 465\u00a0residences and left approximately 1,000\u00a0people homeless in town. Of the 10\u00a0deaths in Paris, two\u00a0occurred at a trailer park; the rest of the fatalities were mainly in unsheltered locations. Debris from the trailer park was dispersed for hundreds of yards. Most of the damage in Paris was rated F2\u00a0or F3\u00a0on the Fujita scale, but a few CBS homes were leveled at low-end F4\u00a0intensity. These homes, however, were dubiously constructed, so the official rating may have been too high. Large, well-built apartments with numerous interior walls were unroofed as the \"ragged funnel cloud\" left behind $50\u00a0million in losses at Paris. 92\u00a0homes and other structures were heavily damaged or destroyed in the neighbouring communities of Reno and Blossom. That more casualties did not occur was attributable to the fact that residents of Paris received ample warning, up to half an hour in advance, in part via NOAA Weather Radio.[116]"

Upon crossing the river, it damaged a 4-mile-long (6.4\u00a0km) swath of trees across McCurtain County, Oklahoma. Some outbuildings were also damaged as the tornado passed through southeastern Oklahoma. In Arkansas, the tornado destroyed 17\u00a0homes, a paper mill, a granary, and an orchard. One\u00a0of the homes dated to the early nineteenth\u00a0century. One\u00a0person died and two\u00a0others were injured near Ashdown before the tornado dissipated.

        "content": "The first phase of the storm came on March 2, as a vigorous area of low pressure formed along an arctic cold front. Drawing some moisture from the so-called \"Pineapple Express\" from the Pacific, snowfall began to develop in the Upper Midwest, spreading a swath of accumulating snow ranging from 3\u20136 inches (7.6\u201315.2\u00a0cm) into March 3.[4] Snow began to push into the Northeast by the evening, with generally light accumulations, before tapering off and changing to rain showers later that night. As the initial area of low pressure moved into the northeastern parts of Canada, its cold front lingered, stretching from Maine to western Texas. Because of the \"Pineapple Express\" pumping moisture into just about the same area where this arctic front was set up, snow began to break out as a plume of precipitation began to take shape by mid-day on March 4. This was the start of the final phase of the winter storm.[5] An icing threat also loomed ahead as well, stretching into the southwestern part of the Mid-Atlantic. A new area of low pressure then formed near the Arkansas\u2013Louisiana border and began to track eastward. Rain changed to moderate snowfall by 1 a.m EDT March 5, as cold air began to sink in. A long swath of snow then began to stretch from the southeastern tip of Massachusetts, into New York City, all the way down to the northern parts of Mississippi.[6] Snow from this system was that of the dry, fluffy kind, which was one reason power outages weren't so severe in the Northeast, however there was more in the ice portion of the storm. The storm continued to dump snow, ice and sleet across the eastern half of the United States, before moving off the coast late on March 5, leaving snow accumulations of 6\u201312 inches (15\u201330\u00a0cm) into the Northeast,[4] and record cold in its wake, with some areas, like Jackson, Mississippi, experiencing a near 50\u00a0\u00b0F (28\u00a0\u00b0C) drop in 24 hours as the arctic front moved through.

The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean, north of the equator and west of the International Date Line. Storms that form east of the date line and north of the equator are called hurricanes; see 1939 Pacific hurricane season. Storms in the season were tracked by the United States Weather Bureau and released in the Monthly Weather Review under the header \"Typhoons and Depressions over the Far East\". The Monthly Weather Review only covers tropical cyclones west of 150\u00b0 E. Due to lack of satellites and ship reports due to the Pacific Theatre of World War II, it is possible other tropical cyclones existed, especially if they were short-lived or of minor intensity. There were 29\u00a0known tropical cyclones, including 24 of typhoon status, of which several of the storms were deadly. A typhoon in November was the deadliest cyclone of the season, causing 49\u00a0deaths as it crossed the Philippines. The same typhoon later struck Hong Kong, where the Hong Kong Observatory recorded the first period of calm during the eye of a cyclone. At least 151\u00a0people were killed during the season, with 12\u00a0missing and unconfirmed of their status during some point during the season."

It tracked steadily westward until February 7 when it stalled about 200 miles (320\u00a0km) east of the Philippine island of Mindanao. The depression remained nearly stationary for two days until turning to a steady northwest motion. It approached the island of Samar Island on February 12, where a pressure of 1,006.0 hectopascals (29.71\u00a0inHg) was reported, and subsequently turned to the north and later to the northeast. The depression was last observed on February 16 accelerating towards the Aleutian Islands. The system produced heavy rainfall in the Philippines, with extensive flooding reported in Surigao del Norte.[2] On April 29, an area of low pressure was located about 300 miles (480\u00a0km) south of Yap. It moved westward, northward, and ultimately to the west-northwest before developing into a tropical depression on May 2 to the east of the Philippines. Early on May 3, after intensifying into a tropical storm the system struck Samar Island, and the next day it hit Masbate before turning northward. After passing over northern Luzon on May 5, the storm accelerated northeastward as it moved through the Luzon Strait, and intensified into a typhoon on May 7. While the typhoon was off the southern coast of Japan, a ship located 290 miles (470\u00a0km) south of Nagoya reported a minimum central pressure of 986.0 hectopascals (29.12\u00a0inHg). The typhoon weakened as it paralleled about 100 miles (160\u00a0km) off the coast of Japan, and was last observed on May 9 accelerating northeastward.[3] The storm produced strong winds throughout the eastern portions of the Philippine archipelago. 90\u00a0fishermen were caught in the storm, with one person drowning and eleven missing at one estimate made one month after the storm passed the area. Winds reached tropical storm force in southern Japan.[3] A tropical depression developed on May 26 in the northern portion of the South China Sea. After initially moving to the northwest, the depression later turned to the northeast and quickly intensified to attain typhoon status by May 28 while located to the east of Hainan Island. The typhoon stalled on May 30 before turning to the west, and moved inland on southern China on May 31. Several ships reported strong winds, rough seas, and heavy rainfall in conjunction with the storm, with one ship reporting a minimum central pressure of 994.0 hectopascals (29.35\u00a0inHg). On land, a station in Hong Kong recorded a pressure of about 1,000.0 hectopascals (29.53\u00a0inHg) as well as minor winds.[4]"

It moved to the northwest, and the next day a station in \u014cshima reported winds in excess of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) and a pressure of 978.0 hectopascals (28.88\u00a0inHg) when the storm was nearby. Based on the report, it is estimated it intensified into a typhoon, and after turning northeastward upon entering the Yellow Sea it struck North Korea. The storm turned to the east, and was last observed on July 12 in the open Pacific Ocean. Rainfall and flooding from the typhoon and several other storms during the month resulted in two deaths and considerable damage to private and public property in the Philippines.[5] A tropical depression developed roughly 250 miles (400\u00a0km) of the eastern Philippines on July 7. The depression tracked northwestward initially, and after intensifying into a typhoon its motion turned to the north-northeast, followed by a turn back to the northwest on July 10. The typhoon crossed the East China Sea and made landfall on eastern China near Shanghai on July 12, where 80-mph (130-km/h) winds and a pressure of 992.0 hectopascals (29.29\u00a0inHg) were recorded. The storm weakened as it continued its motion while roughly paralleling the northern coastline, and dissipated on July 13. The passage of the typhoon killed at least six people in Shanghai.[5] A typhoon quickly developed about 120 miles (190\u00a0km) west of northern Luzon on July 10. It initially moved northwestward, then a day later turned to the northeast. After passing through the Luzon Strait, the typhoon changed its motion to the northwest, resulting in a landfall on northern Taiwan. The typhoon struck southeastern China, and dissipated about 500 miles (800\u00a0km) inland on July 17. A ship en route to Hong Kong reported a pressure of 997.0 hectopascals (29.44\u00a0inHg) and winds of over 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h). A station on western Luzon recorded minor winds and slightly below normal pressures in association with the system.[5] On July 22, a low pressure area formed into a tropical depression while located about halfway between the Philippines and the Marianas Islands. The depression steadily intensified as it tracked to the northwest, and attained typhoon status on July 18. After a brief turn to the north-northeast, the storm changed its motion to the northwest, and made landfall on southeastern Taiwan and later on China on July 20 about 120 miles (190\u00a0km) south of Shanghai. It quickly dissipated. A station in the Ry\u016bky\u016b Islands reported a pressure of 997.0 hectopascals (29.44\u00a0inHg) with light winds.[5] A tropical depression formed on July 20 while located between the Philippines and the Marianas Islands. After moving steadily northwestward, the system stalled for two days, and later turned to the north-northeast. The storm intensified into a typhoon shortly before crossing the Ry\u016bky\u016b Islands, after which it turned sharply westward. Unfavorable conditions encountered the storm, and it rapidly dissipated over the open waters of the East China Sea on July 27. A station in Naha, Okinawa recorded a pressure of 999.0 hectopascals (29.50\u00a0inHg), with another station in the Ry\u016bky\u016b Islands reporting winds of around 20\u00a0mph (32\u00a0km/h).[5] A well-developed typhoon was first observed on July 22 moving rapidly northward about 700 miles (1,100\u00a0km) east of Taiwan. The typhoon turned to the northwest, passing just south of the Japanese island of Ky\u016bsh\u016b. It turned to the west, crossing the Yellow Sea and striking the Chinese province of Shandong before dissipating on July 25. A station in the Ry\u016bky\u016b Islands recorded a pressure of 997.0 hectopascals (29.44\u00a0inHg), with a station on Borodino Island reporting winds of about 15\u00a0mph (24\u00a0km/h).[5] On July 22, a small typhoon developed a short distance off the coast of Taiwan. It drifted northwestward, then turned to the northeast, and by July 24 unfavorable conditions caused it to dissipate. A ship sailing between Hong Kong and Shanghai, China reported a pressure of 995.0 hectopascals (29.38\u00a0inHg) and winds of around 35\u00a0mph (56\u00a0km/h).[5] An area of low pressure organized into a tropical depression on July 25 over the open waters of the western Pacific Ocean. The depression tracked northwestward, and gradually strengthened to attain typhoon status on July 27. After turning to the west, it gradually recurved towards the north and approached northern Taiwan. Under varying steering currents, the typhoon executed a counterclockwise loop over the country, and exited from the southern coastline after turning eastward. By the morning of August 1, it was located about 250 miles (400\u00a0km) east of Taiwan, after which the typhoon accelerated to the northeast. After reaching the Ry\u016bky\u016b Islands on August 3, the storm stalled, turned to the northwest for a day, then weakened until dissipating on August 6 to the south of Japan after turning to the east. A station in the Philippines reported a pressure of 996.0 hectopascals (29.41\u00a0inHg) in association with the storm, with another station recording winds of 68\u00a0mph (109\u00a0km/h).[5] On July 28, a low pressure area formed into a tropical depression over the Marianas Islands. It tracked to the northwest, and quickly intensified into a typhoon a few hours after developing while located about 250 miles (400\u00a0km) south of the Ogasawara Islands. After changing its motion to the west, the typhoon turned sharply northward on July 31, followed by a turn to the east-northeast. The storm passed through the Ogasawara Islands on August 2, and halted its forward motion before turning to the northwest. On August 6 the typhoon struck south-central Japan and later the island of Hokkaid\u014d after turning to the northeast, and it was last observed on August 8 in the open western Pacific Ocean. A ship passing through the center of the typhoon recorded a pressure of 960.0 hectopascals (28.35\u00a0inHg) and winds exceeding 55\u00a0mph (89\u00a0km/h).[5]"

It moved northwestward without strengthening, and dissipated on September 16 about 600 miles (970\u00a0km) east of the Philippines. The depression never affected land.[7] On September 17 a tropical depression developed in the South China Sea. It tracked westward, and intensified into a typhoon. On September 19, the storm made landfall on Vietnam about 150 miles (240\u00a0km) northwest of Da Nang, and subsequently dissipated. Meteorological details for the typhoon are unavailable due to the presence of the Pacific Theatre of World War II.[7] An area of disturbed weather organized into a tropical depression on September 18 about 250 miles (400\u00a0km) west of Guam. The depression slowly intensified as it moved generally northwestward, and by September 21 it attained typhoon status while located about east of Aparri on Luzon. Shortly after strengthening into a typhoon, the storm turned to the northeast and paralleled the southern coastline of Japan a short distance offshore. It was last observed on September 24.[7] Atmospheric pressure was relatively low over the South China Sea during the last week of September, and subsequent to the development of a circulation in an area of disturbed weather, a tropical depression formed on September 27. It quickly strengthened to typhoon status, and made landfall on eastern Vietnam just south of Da Nang on September 30. The storm quickly weakened over land, with only slight traces of the former typhoon by the following day. A station in the northern Philippines recorded a pressure of 1,000.0 hectopascals (29.53\u00a0inHg), and a recording station near the location of its final landfall reported winds of about 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h).[7]"

The system gradually strengthened to typhoon status while it tracked west-northwestward. On October 7 the typhoon turned to the northwest and moved through the southern Luzon Strait, passing about 30 miles (48\u00a0km) southwest of Basco in the Batanes on October 9. Under unfavorable conditions the typhoon steadily weakened over the subsequent days, and dissipated on October 12 over the southern portion of the Taiwan Strait. The minimum pressure associated with the typhoon was a value of 957.0 hectopascals (28.26\u00a0inHg) at Basco, where winds exceeding 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h) were also recorded. Damage was minor over northern Luzon.[8] A tropical depression was first observed on October 7 to the east-northeast of Guam. Tracking to the northwest, the depression steadily intensified to attain typhoon status. Several days later, it began to weaken while gradually recurving to the northeast, and on October 13 it became extratropical. A ship on its way to the Philippines recorded a pressure of 995.0 hectopascals (29.38\u00a0inHg) along with winds of about 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h).[8] On October 10 a tropical depression was first observed about 300 miles (480\u00a0km) south of Guam. It initially moved west-northwestward, and strengthened into a typhoon on October 11 while briefly changing its motion to the southwest. The next day the typhoon turned to the northwest, and days later turned to the north while located about 150 miles (240\u00a0km) east of Bataan Province in the Philippines. After passing through the Ry\u016bky\u016b Islands, it weakened as it turned to the northeast and east, and on October 17 it was last observed turning to the southeast over the open Pacific Ocean. A ship en route to Hong Kong on October 15 recorded a pressure of 968.0 hectopascals (28.59\u00a0inHg) and winds of over 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h) while located to the east of Taiwan. The passage of the typhoon caused 33\u00a0fatalities in Japan.[8] A low pressure area developed into a tropical depression on October 21 about 300 miles (480\u00a0km) northwest of Guam. After initially moving northwestward, it turned to the north and intensified into a typhoon on October 22. On October 23 it passed near or over the Ogasawara Islands, where a recording station reported a pressure of 996.0 hectopascals (29.41\u00a0inHg).

It moved quickly to the west-northwest, and struck the Philippine island of Samar without strengthening further. After passing through the archipelago, the storm entered the South China Sea late on November 5, and gradually weakened until dissipation on November 9 near southwestern Taiwan. A station in Santa Cruz in Laguna province recorded a pressure of 997.0 hectopascals (29.44\u00a0inHg), with at least one station in the Philippines reporting tropical storm force winds. Reports from the country indicate it was potentially a typhoon, though meteorologists decided it was not due to relatively high pressures and lack of significant convection to the southwest of the center.[9] A tropical depression formed on November 6 about 500 miles (800\u00a0km) east of Mindanao. It initially moved to the west-northwest, and gradually recurved to the northeast. After accelerating east-northeastward, the depression was last observed on November 13 as a remnant low pressure area over the open western Pacific Ocean. It is unknown if it strengthened into a tropical storm.[9] On November 22 a tropical depression formed to the east of Mindanao, and subsequently tracked to the northwest. Days later it stalled while located about 250 miles (400\u00a0km) east of Samar Island, and gradually weakened. Cold air intruded the circulation on November 25, and two days later it became extratropical.[9] A well-developed typhoon was first observed on November 29 while located about 150 miles (240\u00a0km) south of Yap. It moved to the northwest, and struck Samar Island on December 2. The typhoon continued northwestward through the archipelago, and gradually weakened while drifting through the South China Sea. It turned to the northeast, and dissipated on December 5 off the coast of northern Luzon. The typhoon produced heavy rainfall and strong winds along its path through the Philippines. Rivers throughout Masbate island were overflown from the abundant rainfall, causing 34\u00a0fatalities on the island. A station on Samar Island recorded a barometric minimum of 975.0 hectopascals (28.79\u00a0inHg).[10] An area of disturbed weather organized into a tropical depression on December 5 about 200 miles (320\u00a0km) southwest of Guam. After moving west-northwestward for several days, it turned to the northeast on December 9, during which it attained typhoon status. The typhoon maintained peak winds for about two days before quickly weakening to a remnant area of low pressure on December 11. A ship in the vicinity of the cyclone reported a minimum pressure of 952.0 hectopascals (28.11\u00a0inHg).[10] On December 16, a low pressure area quickly organized into a typhoon about 350 miles (560\u00a0km) east of Surigao. It moved quickly to the northwest at speeds of about 30\u00a0mph (48\u00a0km/h), faster than all but one previously known typhoon. The storm struck southeastern Luzon and turned to the north and north-northeast. After passing near Manila it reached open waters on December 20. For the following two days, it drifted eastward, possibly executing a loop, and after accelerating to the northeast it was last observed on December 24. A station at Sorsogon recorded a pressure of 998.0 hectopascals (29.47\u00a0inHg). While passing through the northern Philippines, the typhoon produced heavy rainfall, killing 19 on Masbate and 14 in northern Luzon.[10] The final typhoon of the season was first observed on December 22 about 225 miles (362\u00a0km) south of Guam. It initially moved to the northwest, and on December 24 the typhoon turned to the east-northeast. It steadily weakened, and was last observed on December 26 accelerating out to sea. The typhoon produced heavy rainfall and winds of around 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) on Guam.

The depression steadily intensified as it tracked west-northwestward, and intensified into a typhoon before striking Samar Island and Leyte Island on November 19. It continued westward until reaching the western region of the South China Sea on November 22.[9] An approaching cold front turned the typhoon to the northeast, resulting in a rare occurrence of a typhoon recurving northeastward in the western portion of the South China Sea. On November 24 the typhoon passed over Macau, and two hours later the eye crossed directly over Hong Kong. The calm of the center of the eye lasted for fifteen minutes at the Hong Kong Observatory, the first time on record that the calm of a typhoon was recorded there. The typhoon began to become extratropical after making landfall,[11] and continued northeastward through southern China. It gradually weakened while passing through the Taiwan Strait and possibly over Taiwan before dissipating on November 26.[9] While crossing over the Philippines, a station in Capiz on Panay Island recorded a pressure of 981.0 hectopascals (28.97\u00a0inHg) as well as winds in excess of 55\u00a0mph (89\u00a0km/h). The passage of the typhoon sunk a motor boat on Masbate island, killing 48 of the 50 occupants aboard. One person was reported missing and presumed dead in Balangiga in Eastern Samar, believed to be caused by drowning. Property damage was great in Samar, Leyte, and Capiz provinces.[9] In Hong Kong, wind gusts reached 74\u00a0mph (119\u00a0km/h) during a rainband ahead of the storm. Rainfall began seven hours before the arrival of the typhoon, and amounted to roughly 4.27 inches (108\u00a0mm). The heaviest rainfall occurred in rainbands ahead of the typhoon, with about 1.6 inches (41\u00a0mm) falling during a 1-hour time period. The lowest pressure recorded in Hong Kong was about 989.0 hectopascals (29.21\u00a0inHg) while the typhoon was passing through the area. Damage was minor in Hong Kong.[11]"

        "content": "Construction of the earth-filled Saddle Dam D near Paksong,[5] part of the $1.2bn (\u00a3915m)[6] hydroelectric project by Xe-Pian Xe-Namnoy Power Company (PNPC),[6][note 1] was begun in 2013.  The hydroelectric project was a build-operate-transfer project.[7] PNPC is a joint investment venture formed in March 2012 by SK Engineering and Construction (SK E&C), Korea Western Power (KOWEPO), Ratchaburi Electricity Generating Holding (RATCH), and Lao Holding State Enterprise (LHSE).[8] SK E&C holds a 26% stake in PNPC, LHSE 24%, and RATCH and KOWEPO equally own the remaining shares.[9] Part of an overall project to build two main dams and five auxiliaries,[10] by the time of the collapse, it was near to completion and was intended to open for business in 2019.[11] Although landlocked, Laos is traversed by many intertwining rivers, which has encouraged their damming.[12] The dam's construction was part of what has been described[by whom?] as an \"ambitious\u00a0... scheme to become the 'battery' of Asia\", due to the country's location on the Mekong river[13][note 2] and \"abundant natural resources\".[15] The dam was intended to form a chain with other dams in the adjacent province of Champasak, across the Houay Makchanh, Xe Namnoy and Xe Pian rivers.[13] The dam, close to the Cambodian border,[6] was intended to operate to a capacity of 410 megawatts, and earn revenue for the government by exporting 90% of the electricity produced to Thailand,[6][17] which is more economically prosperous and developed compared to Laos.[18] Environmental pressure groups have long been critical of the Laotian government's ambitions regarding hydroelectric power, which have involved building multiple dams on the Mekong as well as on its tributaries. Concern has focused on potential damage to the flora and fauna and the animal societies dependent on the river to survive. Neighboring countries, like Cambodia and Vietnam that are downstream from the dams and rely heavily on the Mekong[19][20] for fishing,[21] food, agricultural irrigation, transport, tourism and cultural traditions,[19][20] have expressed concern that Laos' hydroelectric ambitions could \"disrupt vital ecosystems and their own river systems\".[6][note 3] The dam building program has regularly required the displacement and transplanting of inhabitants of villages that are found to obstruct dam construction, the benefits of which \"are mainly enjoyed outside of the country\", said environmental activists.[15] The company denied that the dam had collapsed,[22] blaming recent heavy weather for the flooding, which had resulted in torrential rain filling the dam beyond capacity and overflowing, it said,[11] which exacerbated the flooding which had already taken place downstream.[22] A spokesperson for SK E&C said, \"we believe that parts of the upper area of the dam were lost due to heavy rains and [then] the water overflowed\".[23] The International Rivers organization[17]\u2014whom the Washington Post described as \"a nongovernmental group generally critical of such projects\"[5]\u2014suggested that the collapse illustrates the \"major risks\" involved if construction is \"unable to cope with extreme weather conditions\", as, particularly in Laos, \"unpredictable and extreme weather events are becoming more frequent\".[17] Indeed, an evacuation order had been in place for the area at the bottom of the dam due to cracks having been discovered in it.[22] This damage had been reported to the company by South Korean contractors \"at least a day before\" the flooding, reported news outlets. Engineers from SK E&C apparently informed the PNPC that the top of the dam's structure had been washed away by 9 p.m. the previous night. Repair work was delayed because of the heavy rain.[15] Furthermore, the Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that it had obtained documents showing that \"11 centimetres of subsidence was found at the centre of the dam\" as early as the previous Friday. This subsidence was severe enough to prevent the use of emergency repair equipment.[15] On 11 September 2017, the reservoir for a dam under construction on the Nam Ao River in Phaxay district, Xiangkhouang Province collapsed after heavy rains in the area.[24] In December 2016, the Xekaman 3 dam in Dak Cheung District, Sekong Province, had to be shut down after six years of usage due to damage in water tunnels.[25]"

By 25 July, nearly 3,000 people had been rescued.[30] The village of Ban Mai alone had 50 inhabitants known to be missing.[15] Rescue efforts were complicated by the fact that the area is densely forested[22] with no mobile-phone coverage,[11] which may also have contributed to the uncertainty as to casualty rates.[5] What roads previously existed were washed away in the floods, and the affected villages were only approachable by either helicopter or flat-bottomed boats.[15] As of 23 September, 40 people were confirmed dead, at least 98 more were missing and 6,600 others were displaced.[2][31]"

In the immediate aftermath of the disaster, Chinese companies and businesses in Laos that were involved in the construction of China-Laos railway immediately joined the rescue work efforts.[39] Thai rescue workers reportedly complained that Laos had shown lethargy in allowing them entry, meaning that they had been kept waiting at the border.[15] The International Red Cross organized water purification devices for the area as each village lost its food supplies,[5] while the Asean Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance (AHA Centre) relief items were dispatched from its warehouse in Malaysia to Vientiane by the Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF).[40] On 26 July, South Korean President Moon Jae-in ordered a relief team to be sent into the country, a rare order from their President for any accident in foreign country since a South Korean firm was involved in the incident.[41] Singapore announced that they will be sending their Civil Defence Force (SCDF) officers and US$100,000 to aid relief efforts,[42] with the Singapore Red Cross (SRC) also announced S$50,000 in humanitarian aid.[43] Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) delivered S$280,000 in flood relief supplies on Thursday evening while officers from SCDF will arrive on Friday.[44] The Vietnamese government has provided a total of US$200,000 relief aid,[45][46] with another US$50,000 coming from their Defence Ministry[47] and another VND300 million (US$13,000) from Agriculture and Rural Development Ministry.[48] Vietnam Electricity (EVN) have contributed around VND1 billion (US$43,000) while the Vietnam Red Cross Society (VRC) Central Committee handed over US$50,000 to the Laos embassy in Vietnam.[48] The Vietnamese People's Army (VPA) sent a contingent team of 100 officers, including medics and rescue vehicles to assist in relief efforts.[49] A 32-strong team People's Liberation Army (PLA) medical contingent was also dispatched,[50] together with the arrival of relief supplies from Thailand.[51] Mercy Malaysia has sent a rapid assessment team to assist in both severe flooding caused by the dam collapse and tropical storm Son-Tinh,[52] with the Malaysian government also conveyed to their Laotian counterpart that they will donating RM400,000 (US$100,000) to assist Laos to facilitate its relief efforts.[53] On 30 July, the Cambodian government donated $100,000 relief aid.[54] The following day, Chinese relief aid began to arrived into the Laotian capital.[55] South Korean government also deciding to send more aid along with the offer of US$1 million aid shortly after the arrival of medicine and relief supplies from the country.[56][57] Another relief team consisting of 19 medical personnel was sent by South Korea on 7 August.[58] Apart from the aid of South Korean government, SK Group has offered to donate $10 million relief aid, Korean Air has sent 36,000 litres of mineral water with 2,000 blankets and Lotte Group has donated US$100,000.[57][59] Foreign individuals living in Laos also helping to deliver aid by raising money from their food businesses.[60] Government compensation for lives lost amounted to 1.5 million Lao kip (U.S. $176) for each person.[31]"

        "content": " Tropical Storm Son-Tinh, known in the Philippines as Tropical Storm Henry, was a weak but very deadly tropical cyclone that devastated Vietnam and Laos in July 2018. Son-Tinh originated from an area of low pressure over the Philippine Sea on July 15, 2018. Moving quickly westwards, Son-Tinh strengthened to the ninth tropical storm of the annual typhoon season on July 17. Intensifying only slightly while crossing the South China Sea, Son-Tinh made its first landfall over Hainan Island on July 18. After emerging into the Gulf of Tonkin, Son-Tinh restrengthened before making its second landfall as a tropical storm in Northern Vietnam on July 19. Once inland, Son-Tinh weakened into a low pressure area as it slowed and made a clockwise loop. The remnants of Son-Tinh then emerged back over water and regenerated into a tropical depression late on July 21. The storm caused severe floods and mudslides in Vietnam, leading to the death of at least 32\u00a0people.[2][3][4] Over 82,000 hectares (200,000 acres) of agricultural land was inundated and at least 17,000\u00a0farm animals were swept away by the floods. The storm also caused or related to the havoc in the neighbouring country of Laos with the collapse of Attapeu dam, in which 40 people died and 98 more missing (and probably as much as 1,100 more people are missing[1]) and 6,600 more are displaced.[5][6][7]"

Accordingly, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) designated it as 11W while the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) gave it the local name Henry.[8][9] As the system moved westward at high speed, it gradually intensified as its convective structure improved, and strengthened a tropical storm by July 17, with the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) assigning the system the international name Son-Tinh.[10][11] Thereafter, however, Son-Tinh weakened slightly as it neared Hainan island due to moderate vertical wind shear.[12] Continuing to struggle to maintain intensity amid increasing wind shear, Son-Tinh crossed over Hainan island at around 03:00\u00a0UTC on July 18; despite land interaction the system continued to maintain its overall convective organization.[13] Later that day, as Son-Tinh emerged from land into the Gulf of Tonkin, Son-Tinh managed to intensify over the warm waters, with sea surface temperatures of over 28\u00a0\u00b0C (82\u00a0\u00b0F) contributing to offset otherwise unfavorable upper atmospheric conditions.[14] Before making landfall in Northern Vietnam, the JMA reported that Son-Tinh reached peak intensity with 10-minute sustained winds of 75\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph) and a central pressure of 994\u00a0hPa (29.4\u00a0inHg).[15] Once inland over Northern Vietnam, Son-Tinh began to weaken quickly. Both the JMA and the JTWC issued their final warnings on Son-Tinh on July 19 as the system degenerated into an area of low pressure embedded in the monsoon.[16][17] The JTWC, however, continued to track Son-Tinh's remnants for the next two days.[18] Through July 19 and 20, Son-Tinh's remnants curved northwards and then eastwards over Northern Vietnam, before moving southeastward back into the Gulf of Tonkin on July 21.[18] Persistent convection developed over the system, aided by a tropical upper tropospheric trough to the northeast, prompting the JTWC to begin issuing advisories on Son-Tinh once again on July 21.[19] Simultaneously the JMA reported that Son-Tinh had regenerated into a tropical depression.[20] With vertical wind shear now low and sea surface temperatures remaining high near 29\u00a0\u00b0C (84\u00a0\u00b0F), the JTWC stated that Son-Tinh intensified back into a tropical storm on July 22,[21] while the JMA continued to maintain Son-Tinh as a tropical depression.[22]"

Megi made its second landfall over Zhangpu in Fujian, China on October 23.[2] Megi killed 31 people and caused $255.1 million (2010 USD) in damage over Luzon, making it top twenty of the costliest typhoons in the Philippines.[3] After moving to the South China Sea, the outflow of Megi and a weather front together brought torrential rainfall, caused $42.2 million (2010 USD) in damage and killed 38 people in Yilan, Taiwan, making Megi the deadliest typhoon of 2010s in Taiwan.[4] Megi also caused $411.7 million (2010 USD) in damage over Fujian, China, although there were no deaths by the storm in the province.[5]"

        "content": "Late on October 10, a tropical disturbance formed east-southeast of Guam.[6] There were favorable environmental conditions, such as low vertical wind shear, good upper-level divergence and poleward outflow.[7] The system began to significantly develop on October 12, prompting the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issuing a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert at 09:00 UTC.[8] Several hours later, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began monitoring the system as a tropical depression.[9] Early on October 13, JTWC also classified the system as a tropical depression and designated it 15W.[10] Hours later, well-defined convective banding features developed around the system and thunderstorm activity over the center of circulation increased. Sea surface temperature above 28\u00a0\u00b0C (82\u00a0\u00b0F) and high oceanic heat content allowed for further strengthening. Situated to the southwest of a subtropical ridge, the system slowly tracked west-northwest towards the Philippines.[11] Around 12:00 UTC, the system further intensified into a tropical storm, earning the name Megi from JMA.[12] Late on October 13, Tropical Storm Megi became quasi-stationary, but a mid-latitude trough moving from the west caused the storm to resume a northwestward track around the periphery of the subtropical ridge.[13] Throughout the morning of October 14, a central dense overcast developed over the center of Megi, allowing for intensification.[14] Later that day, a microwave scanned the developing eye of Megi, resulting in JMA upgrading the system to a severe tropical storm and JTWC upgrading it to a typhoon.[15] On October 15, JMA upgraded Megi to a typhoon, and the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) began to mention the typhoon and named it Juan as it entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility, with improved outflow over the western semi-circle and a well-defined low-level circulation center with tightly curved banding.[16][17] On October 16, Megi began rapid deepening with a well-defined eye due to enhanced poleward outflow by a transitory mid-latitude trough.[18] Early on October 17, Megi started to moved westward and then west-southwestward because of the subtropical ridge. By the warm waters, impressive convection and a circular 20 nautical miles (37\u00a0km; 23\u00a0mi) diameter eye, JTWC upgraded Megi to a super typhoon with category 5 strength on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale, becoming the only super typhoon in 2010 and the first since Nida in 2009.[21] A hurricane hunter aircraft indicated 1-minute maximum sustained surface winds at 165 knots (305\u00a0km/h; 190\u00a0mph) and a mean sea level pressure of 890\u00a0hPa (26.28\u00a0inHg) at 13:05 UTC.[22] However, in postanalysis, the JTWC lowered the maximum intensity slightly, to 160 knots (295\u00a0km/h; 185\u00a0mph). Late on October 17, Megi developed a well-defined 25 nautical miles (46\u00a0km; 29\u00a0mi) diameter eye with a concentric eyewall and excellent radial outflow.[23] According to RSMC Best Track Data, Megi attained the highest 10-minute maximum sustained winds at 125 knots (230\u00a0km/h; 145\u00a0mph) since Bess in 1982 and the lowest atmospheric pressure at 885\u00a0hPa (26.13\u00a0inHg) since Vanessa in 1984 in the Northwest Pacific Ocean at 18:00 UTC and 00:00 UTC on the next day. Maintaining peak intensity, Typhoon Megi made landfall over Isabela, Philippines at 03:25 UTC (11:25 PST) on October 18.[1][24] When passing the Sierra Madre, the eye filled due to land interaction, but tightly curved banding and excellent radial outflow remained.[25] The weakened typhoon arrived at the South China Sea late on October 18, and it began to reorganize.[26] On October 19, Megi formed an enlarged but ragged eye.[27] Late on the same day, Megi turned northwestward and moved slowly due to the significantly weakening western subtropical ridge in response to a deepening mid-latitude shortwave trough moving into Southeast China.[28] Typhoon Megi turned northward then north-northeastward towards a break in the subtropical ridge caused by an approaching mid-latitude trough on October 20.[29] By low vertical wind shear and good radial outflow especially on the poleward channel, the typhoon started to gradually intensify.[30] On October 21, JMA reported that Megi attained its secondary peak intensity by the 10-minute maximum sustained winds reaching 95 knots (175\u00a0km/h; 110\u00a0mph) and the atmospheric pressure decreasing to 935\u00a0hPa (27.61\u00a0inHg), when the typhoon had a 40 nautical miles (74\u00a0km; 46\u00a0mi) diameter round eye.[31] On October 22, the eye of Typhoon Megi became cloud-filled and convection begun eroding due to increasing vertical wind shear.[32] Late on the same day, JMA downgraded Megi to a severe tropical storm in the Taiwan Strait because of subsidence induced by a developing upper-level trough west of the storm.[33] On October 23, Megi made landfall over Zhangpu in Fujian, China at 04:55 UTC.[2][34] Soon, Megi weakened to a tropical storm in mainland China, as the majority of convection associated with the system has dissipated, prompting JTWC issuing a final warning.[35] Megi further weakened to a tropical depression late on October 23. On October 24, the tropical depression dissipated completely around 12:00 UTC, though according to the JTWC Best Track Data analysis, Megi became extratropical at 00:00 UTC on the next day."

Official estimates following the passing of the typhoon placed agricultural losses at around US$34 million with tens of thousands of tons of rice and corn lost.[78][79] Fears of a rice shortage in the next few weeks were allayed by the National Food Authority which announced that sufficient food had been stockpiled.[80] Megi inflicted substantial damage to much of the infrastructure as it crossed Luzon.[81] Communication infrastructure in Cagayan and Isabela suffered extensive damage during the typhoon with an estimated 90% of regional communications lost.[82] Officials believe that it would take five days to restore them.[83] Electricity in the northern provinces of Cagayan, Kalinga, Apayao, Northern Isabela, the Mountain Province, parts of Benguet, Ilocos Norte, la Union, Nueva Ecija, Aurora, parts of Tuguegarao[84] was disrupted by Megi. The National Grid Corp. announced that eleven towers along one transmission line suffered extensive damage, which also affected power supplies to the capital leading to outages of up to 3 hours.[85] Many domestic and international flights by carriers such as Cebu Pacific[86][87] and Philippine Airlines[88] bound for the northern Philippines were cancelled because of the impact of the typhoon, but as the typhoon left the islands, many flights were restored.[89] Many roads in Luzon remained closed through October 18,[90] and bus operators cancelled trips to Cagayan and Isabela due to the poor weather.[91] The departure of Megi left large quantities of debris, as well as unsanitary conditions.[92] The Philippine Red Cross dispatched a water search and rescue team to Cagayan to aid rescue operations.[93] UNICEF announced that the organisation was monitoring the event and that relief supplies were being prepared should the Philippines Government request aid.[94] The United Nations Office for the Coordination on Humanitarian Affairs have also committed to helping with disaster relief.[95][96] Reserve military officers, volunteers, and helicopters were on standby in preparation for the storm, with one retired army general describing the operations as \"preparing for war\".[97] Search and rescue operations for survivors was hampered by winds that were still reaching 210 kilometres (130\u00a0mi) throughout the region.[98] According to official reports, the province of Isabela bore the brunt of the storm with the towns of Palanan and Divilacan suffering extensive damage and Maconacon reportedly being completely destroyed.[99] PAGASA lowered storm signals as the typhoon weakened when it crossed into the mountains in northern Luzon.[100] One person drowned near Tuguegarao, Cagayan during the afternoon of October 18 after being swept away in a river that had overflowed its banks.[101][102] The body of another man who had drowned in Ilocos Sur province was recovered.[103] Another five people died during the storm: one man after being pinned by a falling tree, a mother and her two children when a tree fell on their house and a fifth when struck by lightning. Three people were killed in Isabela province by a storm surge while another drowned attempting to cross a river in Nueva Ecija province.[104] A further nine people have been injured, some by falling debris.[105][106][107] The president made a statement expressing his sympathy and condolences for the bereft families, while also declaring that despite the strength of Megi, the loss of life was significantly less than during Typhoon Basyang and Tropical Storm Ondoy.[108] As of October 20, the death toll stood at 19.[109] Juan became the second super typhoon to hit the area, 21 years after the first such storm, Super Typhoon Tasing of 1989. Child United, a Seattle-based non-profit which provides disaster relief in Asia, was on standby to provide assistance to families left homeless by the typhoon.[110] Their relief operation began October 18 in the Philippines, with supplies already in-country being prepared for immediate delivery to the disaster site, and additional supplies prepared for shipment from the United States.[111] The organization collected monetary donations to assist in further disaster relief, as well as donations of towels, sheets, toiletries (shampoo, toothpaste, etc.) and canned goods.[110] The USS Essex Expeditionary Strike Group (ESG) provided disaster relief in the aftermath. The ESG was composed of the USS Essex (LHD 2), USS Denver (LPD 9) and USS Harpers Ferry (LSD 49). Amphibious Squadron 11 and the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit with Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron 262 (HMM-262) were embarked with the ESG.[112] Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron 265 (HMM-265) also provided disaster relief. The unit was ashore at Clark International Airport participating in an exercise when the typhoon hit. Their mission changed from participation in the exercise to disaster relief.[113] Juan as a typhoon name was retired by PAGASA, and replaced with Jose, as the typhoon reached the damage cost threshold of \u20b11 billion.[114] However, Jose has also been retired and replaced by Josie as it too caused in excess of \u20b11 billion worth of damage.[115][116]"

According to the Central Weather Bureau, a record 939\u00a0mm (37.0\u00a0in) of rain fell in a 24\u2011hour span between October 20 and 21. This surpassed the previous record set by Typhoon Morakot in August 2009, just over a year prior.[118] In Suao, a record 181.55\u00a0mm (7.148\u00a0in) of rain fell within an hour, triggering some of the worst flash flooding in the area in over 20 years.[119] Megi also brought much rainfall in Hualien, Taitung, Pingtung, Taipei, Keelung, and New Taipei. At least 12 people have been confirmed dead and 23 others are missing. Early damage estimates placed losses to agriculture at NT$45 million (US$1.5\u00a0million).[120] Later reports on October 22 indicated that seven people were killed when the temple they were sheltering in was buried by a landslide.[121] Near Suao, multiple landslides struck a major highway stranding more than 400 people. Torrential rainfall caused a 500\u00a0m (1,600\u00a0ft) section of a nearby mountain to collapse, burying a bus carrying 19 people, whom officials fear may have all perished. Air force helicopters have been called in to aid in the search for the bus and any survivors.[122] By the morning of October 24, 13 fatalities had been confirmed and 25 people were reported missing.[123] After more than ten days of search-and-rescue operations, all missing persons across the island were declared legally deceased.[124]"

        "content": " Typhoon Fanapi, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Inday, was a damaging and deadly typhoon that struck Taiwan and southeastern China in September 2010. It was the eleventh tropical storm and fourth typhoon of the very inactive season. The storm formed on September\u00a014 east of the Philippines and moved slowly for several days, initially to the northwest, then curving to the northeast before turning westward due to a ridge to the north. During this time, Fanapi intensified to reach 10\u00a0minute maximum sustained winds of 175\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph). Fanapi made its first landfall on September\u00a019 over Hualien, Taiwan, becoming the first typhoon to hit the island since Typhoon Morakot in August 2009. Later that day made a final landfall in Fujian, China. The storm dissipated on September\u00a021 over southern China. The typhoon first affected southern Japan, bringing rainfall to the outer Miyako Islands. However, impacts were worst in Taiwan and mainland China. In southern Taiwan, Fanapi dropped heavy rainfall, peaking at 1,126\u00a0mm (44.3\u00a0in) in Majia, Pingtung. About 150,000\u00a0people evacuated their homes, and there were heightened preparations after the damaging effects of Typhoon Morakot the previous year. The heavy rainfall from Fanapi caused landslides, heavy crop damage, and flooding, notably in the major city of Kaohsiung, where rains totaled 506\u00a0mm (19.9\u00a0in). In some areas of the city, the floods reached over one-story deep, inundating cars and causing about NT$3\u00a0billion (New Taiwan dollar, US$93.75\u00a0million) in industrial damage.[nb 1] There were five deaths in Taiwan during the storm's passage, and damage was estimated at NT$5\u00a0billion (US$158\u00a0million). Later, the threat from Fanapi caused 264,000\u00a0people to evacuate their homes in southeastern China. The storm dropped heavy rainfall in the region, reaching 640\u00a0mm (25\u00a0in) in Guangdong. Fanapi also caused landslides there, killing 100 people, including 28 in Xinyi due to a collapse at a mine. Also in Guangdong, the storm wrecked 16,000\u00a0homes and flooded 66,400\u00a0ha (164,000 acres) of crop fields. Provincial damage was estimated at \u00a55.15\u00a0billion (CNY, $757.05\u00a0million). The name Fanapi was later retired due to the heavy damage."

        "content": "An area of convection, or thunderstorms, persisted west of Guam on September\u00a013,[1] in association with the monsoon trough.[2] The system gradually developed a low-level circulation and rainbands, aided by low wind shear from an anticyclone aloft.[1] Late on September\u00a014, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA)[nb 2] designated the system as a tropical depression to the east of the Philippine island of Luzon.[3] Around the same time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)[nb 3] classified the system as Tropical Depression 12W. A nearby tropical upper tropospheric trough limited the depression's outflow to the north, although convection continued to increase. The depression moved northwestward along the southwestern periphery of a ridge.[5] At 03:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a015, the Philippine-based PAGASA began warning on the system, giving it the local name Inday.[6] Nine hours later, the JMA named the system Tropical Storm Fanapi.[3] As a strengthening tropical storm, Fanapi developed deeper convection near the center. A passing trough to the north weakened the ridge and caused the storm to slow,[7] turning northeastward by September\u00a016. That day, Fanapi developed an eye feature,[8] becoming a typhoon at 18:00\u00a0UTC.[3] As the ridge built into the East China Sea, the storm responded by turning to the northwest, and at the same time, outflow improved to the north.[9] The eye organized further as it contracted to a diameter of 19\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi). By that time, the typhoon was moving due westward toward Taiwan, steered by a ridge over northeastern China. At 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a018, the JTWC estimated that Fanapi attained peak 1\u00a0minute winds of 195\u00a0km/h (121\u00a0mph).[10] Around the same time, the JMA estimated peak 10\u00a0minute winds of 175\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph).[3] Early on September\u00a019, Typhoon Fanapi made landfall over eastern Taiwan near Hualien City with winds of 162\u00a0km/h (101\u00a0mph), according to Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau.[11] The storm subsequently weakened over land,[3] dipping southwestward as convection diminished over the northern portion of the storm.[12] However, the storm resumed its westward trajectory and soon moved over the Taiwan Strait as a severe tropical storm.[3] The thunderstorms reorganized slightly as Fanapi reached open waters, and a nearby ship reported winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph).[13] Early on September\u00a020, the storm made a second landfall on southeastern China near Fujian and weakened further over land,[3][14] although thunderstorms persisted southeast of the circulation along the coast.[15] Fanapi weakened into a tropical depression later that day and dissipated late on September\u00a021.[3]"

The Fuzhou Changle International Airport in the province's capital city canceled 37\u00a0flights due to the storm.[30] About 78,000\u00a0people in low-lying areas of Guangdong left their houses.[32] Oil futures rose in Asia due to the potential for the storm affecting China's offshore oil platforms.[33] While Fanapi was still over Taiwan, the Hong Kong Observatory issued the Number 1 Standby Warning and later upgraded it to a warning Number 3 for Hong Kong. The storm ultimately passed about 150\u00a0km (93\u00a0mi) north of the territory.[14]"

The storm killed 8,791\u00a0pigs and 533,000\u00a0chickens, and many fish breeding ponds were marred.[49] Agriculture damage was preliminarily estimated at $NT2.12\u00a0billion (US$65.27\u00a0million).[50] The storm forced 25\u00a0roads to be closed, mostly due to debris.[23] The South-Link Line was shut down after a railroad bridge along the Taimali River was washed out.[25] Across Taiwan, 111\u00a0people were injured,[25] mainly due to broken glass, and some were blown off motorcycles by high winds.[23] A girl drowned after slipping into the flooded Taoyuan Canal, and a companion attempting to rescue her died as well. One woman drowned after falling into a swollen river while harvesting her crops.[21] These three deaths were not directly related to the storm.[51] The storm directly killed two people \u2013 one was due to electrocution in Pingtung County, and the other due to drowning in Tainan County.[52] Overall damage in Taiwan were counted at NT$5\u00a0billion (US$158\u00a0million).[53]"

The landslides cut off traffic between cities, in conjunction with floodwaters.[58] In Xinyi, a storm-related landslide collapsed a dam at a mine,[56] killing 28\u00a0people,[59] including four people downstream. The collapse also damaged homes and farms while killing over 100\u00a0tons of fish.[60] Damage in the city alone was estimated at \u00a5460\u00a0million (Chinese yuan, US$68.5\u00a0million),[56] with 350\u00a0houses destroyed.[61] The floods forced about 128,000\u00a0people to evacuate in Guangdong,[59] including 18,930\u00a0people in Yangchun.[56] Fanapi wrecked 16,000\u00a0homes and flooded 66,400\u00a0ha (164,000 acres) of crop fields. Throughout Guangdong, Fanapi killed 100 people and provincial damage was counted to be CNY 5.15 billion (US$757.05 million).[62] Total economic losses in Fujian province were counted to be CNY 610 million (US$89.71 million).[63]\nWhile passing north of Hong Kong, Fanapi produced thunderstorms and gale-force winds in Hong Kong,[14] with a peak precipitation of 295.5\u00a0mm (11.63\u00a0in).[64] The rains caused isolated flooding that caused residents in Pok Fu Lam to require rescue.

The mayor Kiku Chen temporarily suspended her reelection campaign due to the floods.[46] About 80% of the factories in Kaohsiung were reopened by September\u00a021.[25] The high crop damage allowed farmers to qualify for low interest loans.[36] Rail lines took two weeks to reopen due to damage.[42] Power and water service was restored within days of the storm, although residents in flooded areas were advised to boil water before usage.[25] There was also an increase in dengue fever after the floods.[66] The Red Cross Society of China donated about US$100,000 in the days after the storm.[67] The government announced on September\u00a020 that families affected by the floods would receive NT$30,000 (US$945.92) per house.[68] Throughout Taiwan, exports during September 2010 decreased 6.9% from August's levels due to the storm and an industrial fire.[69] In mainland China, officials used helicopters to airdrop relief goods to Guangdong. By three days after the storm, workers distributed 2,000\u00a0tents and 1,000\u00a0beds.[57] Once the floodwaters dropped, residents returned their homes to clean up the mud and damage. Farm officials in Guangdong used 50\u00a0tons of disinfectant to prevent the spread of disease, while the provincial government allocated \u00a5240\u00a0million (CNY, US$35\u00a0million) for rebuilding.[59] About 1,000\u00a0soldiers worked to clean debris and animal carcasses from the reservoir providing drinking water to Maoming.[39] The collapsed dam in Guangdong was later torn down due to being structurally deficient.[70] Zijin Mining, the owner of the dam, had to sell a mine to pay for compensation and fines related to the incident,[71] which ultimately totaled \u00a5245\u00a0million (CNY, US$38.7\u00a0million).[72] After the storm, the Red Cross Society of China provided \u00a51\u00a0million (CNY, US$148,000) to localities affected hardest by the storm, as well as distributing mosquito nets, water purifiers, food, and clothing.[73]"

During August 28, the disturbance developed a low level circulation which rapidly consolidated throughout that day. This led to the Japan Meteorological Agency and the JTWC designating it as Tropical Depression 08W during that day before the JTWC reported that the depression had intensified into a tropical storm. During the next day the PAGASA reported that the Tropical Depression had moved into their area of responsibility and subsequently named it Tropical Storm Glenda. Later that day the JMA also reported that Glenda had intensified into tropical storm and named it as Kompasu.[citation needed] Early on August 30, the JTWC reported that Kompasu had developed an eye feature and had intensified into a typhoon. However the JMA did not follow suit until 1800 UTC, that day after the JTWC had assessed the intensity of Kompasu at 165\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph). During the next day as Kompasu passed over Okinawa both the JTWC and the JMA reported that Kompasu had peaked with windspeeds of 185\u00a0km/h, (115\u00a0mph) and 150\u00a0km/h, (90\u00a0mph) respectively.[citation needed] The Japan Meteorological Agency's Regional Specialized Meteorological Center in Tokyo, Japan uses the Typhoon Committees Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale which is based on 10-minute sustained winds for its tropical cyclone tracking information, while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center uses 1-minute sustained winds.[5] The conversion factor between the two is 1.14.[6] The JMA's peak intensity for Kompasu was 150\u00a0km/h, (90\u00a0mph) 10-minute sustained, or 170\u00a0km/h, (105\u00a0mph) 1-minute sustained.[6] The JTWC's peak intensity for Kompasu was 185\u00a0km/h, (115\u00a0mph) 1-minute sustained, or 165\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph) 10-minute sustained.[6][7] The storm made landfall near Seoul on September 2 at 6:35 AM local time.[1]"

Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness (TCCOR) level three was issued the following morning.[8] By August 30, forecasts showed that a strengthening storm would strike the area, possibly bringing winds in excess of 130\u00a0km/h (81\u00a0mph). Following this, the TCCOR level was increased to two.[9][10] For the first time in over three years, TCCOR level one was declared on August 31. Military personnel and residents across the island were urged to complete their preparations and remain indoors for the duration of the typhoon.[11] During the storm's passage on August 31, the highest warning level, TCCOR One-E (emergency) was declared.[12] Following Kompasu's passage, the emergency warning was changed to recovery as conditions improved.[13] Throughout Okinawa, Kompasu brought strong winds and heavy rains, leaving an estimated 32,000 residences without power.[14] The highest rainfall total was measured in Motobu at 4.96\u00a0in (126\u00a0mm).[15] Winds in excess of 150\u00a0km/h (93\u00a0mph) felled a 300-year-old tree. The 17\u00a0m (56\u00a0ft) Sion Pine Tree was the last of its kind on the island and was once the symbol of the northern Okinawa Region.[16] The Okuma Recreation Facility sustained substantial damage and was closed to the public for at least a week. According to United States Air Force captain Adam Vaccarezza, concrete towers fell during the storm. Although Kompasu was a strong typhoon when it passed over Okinawa, no loss of life took place; however, five people were injured.[14] Some homes sustained roof damage across the region, prompting a few evacuations. Additionally, Kompasu resulted in the cancellation of 432 flights to and from the island chain, stranding 57,126 people.[15]"

Developing out of a tropical disturbance east of the Philippines on July\u00a011, 2010, Conson quickly developed as it tracked nearly due west. Favorable environmental conditions, such as low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures, allowed the system to intensify into a severe tropical storm by July\u00a012. Around the same time, the JTWC assessed the storm to have been equivalent to a Category\u00a01 hurricane. The following day, Conson struck Quezon Province with winds of 100\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph)[nb 1] before weakening. After crossing the archipelago, the storm entered the South China Sea where it was able to re-strengthen. By July\u00a016, Conson attained typhoon status as it neared the southern Chinese island of Hainan. After brushing the island at peak intensity with sustained winds estimated at 130\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph), the storm weakened in the Gulf of Tonkin due to less favorable conditions. The storm eventually made landfall near Hanoi, Vietnam on July\u00a017 and dissipated the following day. In the Philippines, Conson produced widespread, torrential rains which triggered significant flooding. At least 76 people are known to have been killed across the country and 72 others are listed as missing. Preliminary damage estimates were placed at PHP189\u00a0million (US$4.1\u00a0million). In China, at least two people have been killed due to wind-related incidents. Hainan Province sustained significant damage from the typhoon, with damage estimated at \u00a5500\u00a0million (US$73.8\u00a0million).

The two systems ultimately merged into one over the Philippines between May\u00a028 and 29. Now tracking northeastward, the system re-intensified and became a tropical storm on May\u00a030. Lucille attained its peak intensity later that day with winds of 85\u00a0km/h (53\u00a0mph). As it accelerated over open waters, the system brushed the islands of Iwo Jima and Chichi-jima before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on June\u00a01. The remnants of Lucille were last noted on June\u00a04 near the International Date Line. Between May\u00a027 and 29, heavy rains fell across much of Luzon as Lucille developed. These rains, amounting to 406\u00a0mm (16\u00a0in) in the suburbs of Manila, triggered destructive floods that left some areas under 4.6\u00a0m (15\u00a0ft) of water. The worst of the floods took place during the overnight hours of May\u00a028 to 29. During that time, hundreds of homes were swept away and an estimated 300\u2013500 people, including at least 80\u00a0children, were killed. Monetary losses from the floods exceeded $2\u00a0million."

        "content": "On May\u00a024, 1960, a possible area of low pressure was identified to the west of Koror in the Republic of Palau. Tracking generally to the northwest, the system gradually developed.[1] Despite only having winds around 30\u00a0km/h (19\u00a0mph),[2] it was classified as a tropical depression early the next day and assigned the name Lucille by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). Around the same time, a second, less organized low pressure system developed off the west coast of Luzon, Philippines. That system remained almost stationary over the South China Sea as Lucille accelerated northwestward. Early on May\u00a027, the JTWC issued their final advisory on the depression as it approached the Philippines. After degenerating, the remnants of Lucille moved over the Visayas.[1] Shortly after the JTWC issued their final advisory on Lucille, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began monitoring the system near Luzon as a tropical depression.[2] By May\u00a028, radiosonde data from Clark Air Base in Luzon indicated that the second system acquired a closed circulation at the 500\u00a0mb level and began moving northeastward.[nb 1] While crossing the northern Philippines, the two systems merged and became a single cyclone, retaining the name Lucille. During its passage of the country, winds up to 63\u00a0km/h (39\u00a0mph) were reported in Manila. Once back over open waters, the system intensified as it accelerated northeastward, attaining tropical storm intensity early on May\u00a030.[1][2] Tropical Storm Lucille attained its peak intensity late on May\u00a030 with winds of 85\u00a0km/h (53\u00a0mph) and an estimated barometric pressure of 985\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.09\u00a0inHg).[1] At this time, the China Meteorological Administration assessed Lucille to have been a stronger system, attaining typhoon status with two-minute sustained winds estimated at 125\u00a0km/h (78\u00a0mph).[2] Around 1700\u00a0UTC on May\u00a031, the storm tracked approximately 65\u00a0km (40\u00a0mi) west of Iwo Jima. Roughly five hours later, it moved within 15\u00a0km (9.3\u00a0mi) of Chichi-jima where a pressure of 992\u00a0mbar (992\u00a0hPa; 29.3\u00a0inHg) was measured. Sustained winds on Chichi-jima reached 95\u00a0km/h (59\u00a0mph); however, these were determined to be unrepresentative of Lucille's actual intensity due to natural funneling on the island. On June\u00a01, the system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone as it turned west-northwestward and continued over open waters.[1] The remnants of Lucille were last noted by the JMA on June\u00a04 as it crossed the International Date Line.[2]"

On the former, winds reached 55\u00a0km/h (34\u00a0mph) while on the latter, gusts peaked at 130\u00a0km/h (81\u00a0mph). The gusts on Chichi-jima caused the USS Cayuga County to broach in the harbor.[1] Due to the significant loss of life caused by the storm, the name Lucille was retired. This marked the first time that a tropical cyclone in the Western Pacific had its name removed following its usage. For unknown reasons it was not replaced with any particular name, making it one of two storms in the basin to not have a replacement, although Lucy took the name's place in 1962.[4]"

The heaviest rains took place between May\u00a027 and 28, with conditions similar to a tropical storm occurring during the overnight hours. During a 24-hour span on May\u00a027, 218\u00a0mm (8.6\u00a0in) of rain fell in Manila.[5] In surrounding areas, more than 406\u00a0mm (16\u00a0in) of rain fell.[6] Gale-force winds toppled trees and billboards and brought down telephone lines.[7] The city of Manila was brought to a virtual standstill as three quarters of the city became submerged in at least 0.3\u00a0m (1\u00a0ft) of water.[8] Transportation was shut down and businesses were deserted the day after the floods.[7] Taking place mainly in the suburban communities surrounding Manila, rivers over-topped their banks and inundated \"squatter\" areas.[9] The hardest-hit areas were submerged in up to 4.6\u00a0m (15\u00a0ft) of water.[10] Residents reported that homes were swept off their foundations by the water and were brought downstream. Others reported seeing bodies floating amid debris.[7] In Tondo, floodwaters reaching 1.8\u00a0m (6\u00a0ft) deep killed at least seven people.[5] Hundreds of homes were swept away in Manila, resulting in many deaths.[10] Numerous homes were washed away in Quezon City.[5] The heart of Manila was spared flooding as the river running through the city began to recede after nearly over-topping the concrete dike surrounding it.[11] Throughout the Philippines, officials confirmed that 108\u00a0people, including 80\u00a0children, had been killed and a further 150\u00a0were missing by May\u00a030.[10] Later reports on the storm stated that approximately 300\u00a0people lost their lives.[4][10] Some news reports indicated that as many as 500\u00a0people may have been killed.[8] Additionally, more than 20,000\u00a0people were left homeless.[10] Losses amounted to roughly $2\u00a0million. The floods were regarded as the nation's worst since 1947.[9] The flooding caused by Lucille was also considered the worst ever in the country by some until September\u00a02009 when Typhoon Ketsana devastated Manila.[10][12] In the immediate aftermath of the floods, the entire Manila police force was mobilized to assist residents and begin relief operations. On May\u00a029, Quezon City mayor Norberto S. Amoranto sent an emergency request to the Philippine Air Force to rescue people trapped on rooftops.[10]"

        "content": "In November and December\u00a02004, the prevailing pattern was conducive for severe weather across the Southern United States, with a large ridge over the northern Pacific Ocean supporting a southerly storm track toward the Gulf Coast. The fall season contributed to an already active year, solidifying 2004 as the busiest year for tornadoes on record in the United States.[1] This particular tornado outbreak began on November\u00a022 as a potent cold-core low over Southern California began to move eastward toward Texas, where the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) issued a Slight risk of severe weather.[2] At the surface, a warm front became increasingly defined stretching from Central Louisiana westward through Central Texas. To the south of this boundary, a weakening capping inversion, dewpoints reaching the lower 70s \u00b0F, and mixed layer convective available potential energy upwards of 1,500\u00a0J/kg indicated an environment supportive of damaging winds and isolated tornadoes.[3][4] Series of strong to severe thunderstorms developed along this boundary,[5] including a persistent supercell near the Houston metropolitan area.[6] Low-level wind shear was locally enhanced along this front, allowing the storms to produce brief tornadoes as they interacted with it throughout the afternoon.[5] On November\u00a023, the cold-core low and associated mid- to upper-level winds of 90\u00a0kn (105\u00a0mph; 165\u00a0km/h) shifted eastward from the Texas Panhandle toward the Mississippi River Valley. With a low-pressure area forming over North Texas and advancing toward Arkansas, the warm front began the day just inland from the northwestern Gulf Coast but soon began to lift northward.[7] South of this boundary, MLCAPE values of 2,000-2,500\u00a0J/kg were prevalent, while initially weak shear profiles improved as the upper-level disturbance approached from the west.[8] By the afternoon hours, tornadic supercells developed north of I-10 before spreading eastward into Louisiana and Mississippi with time.[9][10] Trailing this activity, an intense squall line developed across coastal sections of Texas and progressed eastward with increasing damaging wind potential.[11] Even as this line overtook previously discrete supercells,[12] additional ones developed across Mississippi and Alabama through the morning hours.[13] Finally, as convection spread eastward into Georgia and the Carolinas, the combination of continued strong shear but marginal instability caused the event to transition to more of a damaging wind episode.[14] Complimenting the Moderate risk that shifted eastward into Alabama, Georgia, and the Florida Panhandle early on November\u00a024, the SPC issued another Moderate risk for a secondary threat of severe weather farther north.[15] Here, the deepening surface low supported an arced warm front across Indiana, Ohio, and Kentucky. In the presence of strong wind shear and MLCAPE values of 500-800\u00a0J/kg,[16] bands of convection developed across the region, particularly focused along a pre-frontal trough.[17] Tornadic supercells tracked across southeastern Indiana toward the Ohio border over ensuing hours. By the evening, these storms were undercut by a surging cold front, and loss of daytime heating eroded the instability necessary for severe storms to continue.[18][19]"

        "content": " Typhoon Utor, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Seniang,[1] swept through the central Philippines in December\u00a02006, exacerbating the damage left behind by previous Philippine typhoon strikes that year. Residual moisture from the tropical cyclone indirectly contributed to extensive flooding in Malaysia. Utor originated from an area of disturbed weather that organized into a tropical depression on December\u00a07 west-southwest of Yap. The cyclone steadily progressed westward while gradually intensifying, reaching tropical storm intensity late on December\u00a07. On December\u00a09 and the ensuing two days, Utor crossed the central Philippines and reached typhoon strength before weakening somewhat upon entry into the South China Sea. Reintensification ensued afterwards, and Utor reached its peak intensity on December\u00a013 with maximum sustained winds of 155\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph) shortly after regaining typhoon strength.[nb 1] However, wind shear and dry air began to take its toll on Utor thereafter, quickly weakening the storm until its dissipation on December\u00a015. Due to the destruction wrought by Typhoon Durian just weeks prior, preparations began in earnest in the Philippines. Over 91,000\u00a0people were evacuated from areas at risk, primarily from Albay. Two major summits to be held in Cebu were postponed as a result of the forecast inclement weather. In addition, recovery efforts for victims of Durian had to be suspended and all domestic flights in the Philippines were cancelled. Utor's impacts in the central Philippines were extensive, with 30\u00a0casualties reported and the damage toll reaching US$15.8\u00a0million.[3] Widespread power outages affected the entirety of Eastern Visayas. Numerous ships sunk as a result of rough seas generated by the typhoon, including a ferry carrying 104\u00a0passengers and crew. Following the storm, relief agencies began to allocate resources to those affected by the typhoon, in turn also adding to relief efforts for the three Philippine typhoons which preceded Utor. Precautionary efforts also took place in Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia, while the Paracel Islands sustained marked damage but no fatalities. Although the storm mostly dissipated in the South China Sea, Utor's remnant moisture later contributed in part to Peninsular Malaysia's worst flood event in recorded history, as copious amounts of precipitation fell over a short, four-day period. Eight people were killed by the floods which were worst in Kota Tinggi and Segamat District."

        "content": "The predecessor to Typhoon Utor was first noted by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) as a cluster of thunderstorms southeast of Chuuk on December\u00a02.[nb 2] Over the next few days, a center of circulation accompanied by intermittent shower activity began to develop in the presence of favorable conditions.[1] At 00:00\u00a0UTC on December\u00a07, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) determined that the disturbance had become sufficiently organized to be considered a tropical depression;[5][nb 3] at the time the cyclone was centered 175\u00a0km (110\u00a0mi) west-southwest of Yap. Tracking westward under the influence of a powerful subtropical ridge to its north, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm at 18:00\u00a0UTC. In accordance, the storm was given the name Utor; this name had been submitted by the United States and means \"squall line\".[1] Utor's development following its naming was slow, but quickened as the tropical storm neared the Philippines. The tropical cyclone reached the southeastern coast of Samar by 06:00\u00a0UTC on December\u00a09 and began tracking through the central Philippine archipelago over the next two days. Despite its interaction with the nearby islands,[1] Utor continued to strengthen without much impediment and reached typhoon strength in the Visayan Sea at 12:00\u00a0UTC that day. Twelve hours later, the typhoon attained an initial peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 955\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.20\u00a0inHg) in the Sibuyan Sea according to the JMA.[5] The JTWC analyzed an intensity of (185\u00a0km/h) 115\u00a0mph at that time.[1] By 12:00\u00a0UTC on December\u00a010, Utor had emerged into the South China Sea.[5] Although Utor tracked back over water on December\u00a010, the storm began to weaken due to increasing wind shear and dry air from the west.[1] As a result, the JMA downgraded Utor to severe tropical storm intensity upon its emergence into the South China Sea.[5] Despite these hindering conditions, the storm's improved outflow was sufficient to enable redevelopment.[1] At 18:00\u00a0UTC on December\u00a011, the JMA once again upgraded the system to typhoon strength southeast of Hainan. Intensification continued until Utor peaked with winds of 155\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph) and a minimum pressure of 945\u00a0mbar (hPa; 27.91\u00a0inHg) the next day.[5] This strength was held for only twelve hours before Utor's outflow began to succumb to the wind shear and dry air stemming from the monsoonal flow it had previously suppressed.[1][6] Traveling in a tight clockwise loop, the typhoon rapidly weakened on December\u00a013; by the following day Utor was a minimal tropical storm. At 06:00\u00a0UTC on December\u00a014, the storm degenerated into a tropical depression and continued to execute a small anticyclonic loop before dissipating on December\u00a015.[5]"

Downtown Tacloban also suffered a blackout.[20] Off of Boracay, a boat operator was killed after their ship capsized.[14] Another 67\u00a0ships, which consisted of speedboats and ferries, sunk during the storm's passage.[21] Buildings were unroofed and trees were torn apart on the island, littering its beaches with debris.[19] A barge was forced by large waves into the pier at San Agustin, Romblon, resulting in the spilling of 25,000\u00a0L (6,600\u00a0gal) of diesel fuel.[22] Two children were killed in Tacloban and Capiz as a result of falling trees; an additional three people in Capiz were feared to have drowned due to floods.[14] Two thousand people became stranded after the Philippine Coast Guard cancelled the operation of 43\u00a0ferry services.[23] Similarly, 8,000\u00a0people became stranded at seaports after the coast guard barred vessels from sailing.[24] Extensive damage occurred in Occidental Mindoro, where 422\u00a0homes were destroyed and an additional 1,421\u00a0damaged.[25] Rough seas caused the outriggers on a ferry between Batangas and Puerto Galera, Oriental Mindoro to break apart, causing the ship to begin disintegrating offshore. However, the 104\u00a0passengers and crew on board were able to escape and were later rescued.[26] Further north in southern Luzon, roads and bridges were rendered impassable after sustaining damage.[27] A state of emergency was declared for Aklan, where property damage equated to \u20b151\u00a0million (US$1\u00a0million).[28][nb 4] The Central Visayas region of the Philippines suffered the worst impacts, with a damage cost of \u20b1345.2\u00a0million (US$7\u00a0million), primarily to agriculture.[nb 4][29] Following the storm's passage, chapters of the Philippine Red Cross assisted in relief efforts in impacted areas.[30] The Philippine Department of Social Welfare and Development allocated \u20b127.7\u00a0million (US$600,000) to relief efforts.[nb 4][31] Food and sheltering were provided to 2,615\u00a0people in three provinces by the Adventist Development and Relief Agency.[32] Many localized relief agencies donated sacks of rice to impacted residents.[33] The United Nations appealed for US$46\u00a0million for use in recovery efforts following Utor in addition to the three Philippine typhoons which preceded it.[16] Overall, the impacts of Utor killed 30\u00a0people and injured 44\u00a0in the Philippines. Another eight people were never accounted for. The damage toll wrought by Utor amounted to US$15.8\u00a0million.[34] Furthermore, 36,542\u00a0houses were damaged by Utor, of which 9,439\u00a0were destroyed. Capiz and Aklan were the areas that sustained the most residential damage. People who were evacuated out of hazardous regions in advance of Utor were able to return home beginning on December\u00a018,[35] nine days after initial landfall.[1]"

Flooded areas of the western half of the country drained floodwaters into the Chao Phraya River.[36] Off of Malaysia, a rough sea warning for coastal stretches of Sabah and northern Sarawak due to the threat of high wind-swept waves caused by Utor.[37] In Vietnam, delegations were sent to coastal areas to guide residents in preparing for Utor and secure fishing boats, while troops were sent to reinforce buildings and fortify sea defenses.[38] Preparations for \"mass evacuations\" also went into effect, particularly along Vietnam's central coastline.[39] Border guards called back 3,785\u00a0fishing vessels with over 21,000\u00a0fishermen to shore.[40] Aircraft, automobiles, canoes, and ships were dispatched into threatened areas to disseminate information regarding the typhoon.[41] Similar precautionary measures took place in Hainan, where more than 20,000\u00a0fishing boats were called back to shore.[42] Forty-nine people were evacuated out of the Paracel Islands due to the threat of the typhoon.[43] As Utor was traversing the South China Sea, a fishing boat became stranded near Langhua Reef in the Paracel Islands; the occupants were rescued by a rescue ship operated by the Hainan Maritime Bureau,[44] though five were flown to hospitals for medical treatment.[45] A total of 140\u00a0sheds on the islands of Yongxing, Yayong, Zhaoshu, and Bei Dao were flattened by the passing typhoon, while a ship at harbor sank and five others ran aground.[43] On the Qilian Yu island sub-group, 98\u00a0fishermen on the islands were rescued by the Nanhai Rescue Bureau following days without clean water and food supplies. Utor had destroyed all of the islands' bunkhouses, resulting in requests for rescue.[46] Moisture associated with Utor was partially blamed for heavy rains which produced extensive flooding in Peninsular Malaysia;[47] these floods were the first in a long string of flood events that would plague the region until February\u00a02007.[48] The tropical moisture acted in tandem with wind shear and a monsoonal flow to produce continuous precipitation over the Malaysian states of Pahang, Johor, and Malacca. Rainfall peaked at 567.8\u00a0mm (22.35\u00a0in) in Bandar Muadzam Shah over a four-day period, with similar rainfall totals occurring elsewhere.[49] These floods were considered the worst in the history of southern Malaysia.[50] The worst-affected areas were Segamat and Kota Tinggi, where both towns were inaccessible by land after all main roads leading to those towns were flooded.[51] Eight fatalities resulted from the historical flooding.[52]"

        "content": " Super Cyclonic Storm Amphan (/\u02c8\u0259mp\u0294\u0259n/) was an extremely powerful and catastrophic tropical cyclone that caused widespread damage in Eastern India, specifically in West Bengal and Odisha, and in Bangladesh, in May 2020. It was the strongest tropical cyclone to strike the Ganges Delta. It was a rare cyclone that lashed northern Bangladesh from Rajshahi to Rangpur in the early hours of 21 May with strong winds. It caused severe damage to mango production of Rajshahi and Rangpur. It was also the fourth super cyclone that hit West Bengal and Kolkata since 2015 as well as being one of the strongest storms to impact the area.[1][2][3] Causing over US$13\u00a0billion of damage, Amphan is also the costliest cyclone ever recorded in the North Indian Ocean, surpassing the record held by Cyclone Nargis of 2008.[4] The first tropical cyclone of the 2020 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, Amphan originated from a low-pressure area persisting a couple of hundred miles (300\u00a0km) east of Colombo, Sri Lanka, on 13 May 2020. Tracking northeastward, the disturbance organized over exceptionally warm sea surface temperatures; the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) upgraded the system to a tropical depression on 15 May while the India Meteorological Department (IMD) followed suit the following day. On 17 May, Amphan underwent rapid intensification and became an extremely severe cyclonic storm within 12 hours. On 18 May, at approximately 12:00 UTC, Amphan reached its peak intensity with 3-minute sustained wind speeds of 240\u00a0km/h (150\u00a0mph), 1-minute sustained wind speeds of 270\u00a0km/h (170\u00a0mph), and a minimum central barometric pressure of 920\u00a0mbar (27.17\u00a0inHg). The storm began an eyewall replacement cycle shortly after it reached its peak intensity, but the continued effects of dry air and wind shear disrupted this process and caused Amphan to gradually weaken as it paralleled the eastern coastline of India. On 20 May, 12:00 UTC, the cyclone made landfall in West Bengal. At the time, the JTWC estimated Amphan's 1-minute sustained winds to be 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph). Amphan rapidly weakened once inland and dissipated shortly thereafter. Coastal areas in West Bengal comprising West Midnapore, East Midnapore, North 24 Parganas, South 24 Parganas, Kolkata, Hooghly and Howrah were heavily affected by the cyclone. It also caused significant destruction in Bangladesh, bringing rain and strong winds to Rajshahi and Rangpur. It created havoc in the metro city of Kolkata.[5] The name Amphan was suggested by Thailand which means 'sky' in Thai. It is pronounced as Um-pun.[6]"

        "content": "During 13 May 2020, an area of low pressure developed over the Southeastern Bay of Bengal about 1020\u00a0km (635\u00a0mi) to the southeast of Visakhapatnam in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.[7][8] The area of low pressure was located within a favorable environment for further development with good equator-ward outflow, exceptionally warm sea surface temperatures between 32 and 34\u00a0\u00b0C recorded in the basin, and low vertical wind shear.[8] Over the next couple of days, the system became more marked as it gradually consolidated further, with bands of deep atmospheric convection wrapping into the system's low-level center.[9][10] During 16 May, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) reported that the area of low pressure had developed into a depression and designated it as BOB\u00a001 while it was located about 1,100\u00a0km (685\u00a0mi) to the south of Paradip in the Indian state of Odisha.[11] Moving northwards, the depression continually organised and became a cyclonic storm a few hours later, receiving the name Amphan. Intensification was temporarily impeded as moderate easterly wind shear disrupted the system's cloud pattern.[12] On 17 May, conditions for significant intensification became more conducive as upper-level winds improved. As a result, Amphan underwent rapid intensification into a severe cyclonic storm, with the JTWC assessing an increase in winds from 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph) at 12:00\u00a0UTC to 215\u00a0km/h (135\u00a0mph), the equivalent to a Category\u00a04 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale (SSHWS), just six hours later.[13] Furthermore, the IMD upgraded Amphan to an extremely severe cyclonic storm on their cyclone intensity scale.[14] The broad storm was characterized by a cloud shield extending more than 1,110\u00a0km (690\u00a0mi) and a sharply-outlined 10 nautical mile-wide eye.[15] Early on 18 May, microwave imagery depicted two distinct concentric eyewalls, a telltale sign of an eyewall replacement cycle that is typical for very intense cyclones.[16] Through the day, the effects of wind shear and dry air hampered this internal core change, causing the eyewall to erode by late on 18 May.[17][user-generated source?] Around 5:30\u00a0p.m. IST (12:00 UTC), Amphan made landfall as a Very Severe Cyclonic storm near Bakkhali, West Bengal with winds of 155\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph).[18] As it moved further inland, Amphan rapidly weakened. Just six hours after landfall, the JTWC downgraded the storm to a Category 1-equivalent cyclone and issued its final warning on the system, as it became disorganized.[19] On 21 May, Amphan degenerated into a well-marked low pressure area."

The Bangladesh Army deployed 71\u00a0medical teams and arranged 18,400\u00a0packets and relief materials in preparation for Amphan's aftermath. Twenty-five ships were dispatched by the Bangladesh Navy to handle emergency, rescue, and relief operations, with aerial support from the Bangladesh Air Force.[56] The Ministry of Agriculture of Bangladesh advised coastal farmers to harvest all mature paddy fields to mitigate the estimated loss of 12\u00a0percent of crop yield.[57] Seven thousand domestic animals were also moved to shelter under the direction of the Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock.[58] An IMD yellow alert was active for 13 of Kerala's 14\u00a0districts on 18\u00a0May,[59] while an orange alert was issued by the agency for West Bengal, anticipating extensive damage in six districts.[60] The Bangladesh Meteorological Department issued cyclone danger signal #10, their highest warning, at the Port of Mongla and the Port of Payra on 20\u00a0May, signifying \"great danger\" due to Amphan with winds expected to exceed 89\u00a0km/h (55\u00a0mph). Signal #10 was also issued for eleven coastal districts, in addition to offshore islands and islands within the Ganges Delta.[61] Flood and landslide warnings were issued by the Disaster Management Centre of Sri Lanka on 19\u00a0May. Boats, helicopters, and crews were stationed by the Sri Lanka Air Force and Sri Lanka Navy throughout the island to bolster emergency response.[62] Coastal provinces of Thailand along the Andaman Sea were warned by the Thai Meteorological Department of the threat of heavy rain on 19\u00a0May.[63] Storm alerts issued by the Thai Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation encompassed 62\u00a0provinces, including Bangkok,[64] while warnings for flash floods, high waves, and landslides were issued for 14\u00a0provinces in southern Thailand.[65] The National Centre for Hydrology and Meteorology of Bhutan warned of the possibility of flash flooding and landslides in the country.[66] The Bhutanese Department of Disaster Management advised against travelling, particularly in southern Bhutan.[67]"

Most of the evacuations in India occurred in West Bengal.[79][80] Over a million people were expected to evacuate from areas near the Bangladesh\u2013India border.[81] Around 4,000\u00a0personnel from the SDRF oversaw evacuations in India.[82] Evacuations began on 17\u00a0May in Jagatsinghpur, beginning with the elderly and pregnant living in thatched homes.[83] Magistrates were directed to begin evacuating residents from vulnerable homes and low-lying areas in Odisha the following day.[84] The Odisha government took a more targeted evacuation approach for Amphan than in previous storms where more widespread evacuations were utilized.[85] Odisha had shelter capacity for up 1.1\u00a0million evacuees, though only 10\u00a0percent was expected to be used.[86] Over 141,000\u00a0people were ultimately moved to shelters in coastal Odisha.[50] The government of West Bengal planned to evacuate 200,000\u00a0people from their homes by 18\u00a0May;[86] nearly 300,000\u00a0people evacuated in total from the state, including 200,000 from North 24 Parganas district and more than 40,000\u00a0from Sagar Island.[87][88][23] The NDRF reported that over 500,000\u00a0people evacuated from Odisha and West Bengal.[89] Officials farther inland in Dhanbad and Bokaro Steel City, Jharkhand, were also instructed to move people from susceptible housing to safety.[90] Two million people were expected to evacuate from low-lying areas of Bangladesh on 19\u00a0May;[91] Enamur Rahman, the Minister of Disaster Management and Relief, stated that the evacuation for Amphan in Bangladesh was unprecedented in scale.[92] Trawlers were used to evacuate thousands from the sediment islands in the Ganges Delta to the Bangladeshi mainland.[93] Approximately 50,000\u00a0people were evacuated from the islands of the Sundarbans.[69]"

The storm was considered the strongest to hit the region in over a decade.[2] At least 86\u00a0people died in West Bengal;[94] most of the fatalities were due to electrocution or the collapse of homes.[102] The state government estimated that the storm caused at least \u20b91.02\u00a0trillion (US$13.5\u00a0billion) in damages and directly affected 70\u00a0percent of the state's population.[4][94][103] Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee described the storm's effects there as worse than that of COVID-19.[50] An estimated storm surge of 5\u00a0m (16\u00a0ft) inundated a wide swath of coastal communities and communications were severed. The greatest inundations were expected in the Sundarbans, where flooding could extend 15\u00a0km (9.3\u00a0mi) inland.[104] Embankments in the region were overtaken by the surge, leading to inundation of the islands in the Sundarbans.[105] Bridges linking islands to the Indian mainland were swept away.[106] The cyclone produced sustained winds of 112\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph) and gusts to 190\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph), which were recorded by the Alipore observatory, Kolkata, West Bengal, damaging homes and uprooting trees and electric poles.[50] Wind speed along coastal areas were measured up to 150\u2013160\u00a0km/h (93\u201399\u00a0mph). In Canning a wind speed of 157\u00a0km/h (98\u00a0mph) with gusting up to 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph) was recorded, while nearby nimpith and Sagar Island observed 155 and 111\u00a0km/h (96 and 69\u00a0mph) wind speed.[107] The Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport recorded wind speeds up to 133\u00a0km/h (83\u00a0mph) . In average, Kolkata and its surrounding recorded highest wind speed of 110\u2013130\u00a0km/h at 7-8 PM and rainfall between 220 and 240\u00a0mm was recorded in Kolkata and its surroundings on 20 May 2020.[108] This overturned vehicles and snapped approximately 10,000\u00a0trees.[107][104][109][110] The Calcutta Municipal Corporation stated that Amphan toppled over 4,000\u00a0electric poles, leaving much of the city without power for over 14\u00a0hours.[111][112] At least 19\u00a0people were killed in Kolkata.[110] The storm also triggered widespread flooding around the city. 236\u00a0mm of rain was recorded in Kolkata.[110] Downed power lines caused power outages across West Bengal, prompting CM Mamata Banerjee to order power supplies to be cut in the two states of 24 Parganas as a precautionary measure.[50] In North 24 Parganas, 2\u00a0people were killed and up to 5,500\u00a0homes were damaged.[50] Thousands of mud homes were damaged in the neighboring Hooghly district.[104] A million homes were damaged in South 24 Parganas and breached embankments led to the flooding of villages and swaths of cropland.[94][102] About 26,000\u00a0homes were destroyed in Gosaba. Saltwater inundation affected surrounding areas following damage to 19\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi) of nearby embankments. Around 150\u00a0km from the area in Nadia,the storm caused severe damage.[110] Across West Bengal, 88,000 hectares (220,000 acres) of rice paddies and 200,000 hectares (490,000 acres) of vegetable and sesame crops were damaged.[102] Neighboring Odisha saw significant effects, with wind speed reaching 106\u00a0km/h (66\u00a0mph) and rainfall up to 300\u00a0mm (12\u00a0in) in Paradip.[113] In Bhadrak, rainfall reached 384.6\u00a0mm (15.14\u00a0in).[96] Approximately 1,167\u00a0km (725\u00a0mi) of power lines of varying voltages,[citation needed] 126,540\u00a0transformers, and 448 electrical substations were affected, leaving 3.4\u00a0million without power. Damage to the power grid reached \u20b93.2\u00a0billion (US$42\u00a0million).[114] Four people died in Odisha, two from collapsed objects, one due to drowning,[95] and one from head trauma.[96] Across the ten affected districts in Odisha, 4.4\u00a0million people were impacted in some way by the cyclone. At least 500\u00a0homes were destroyed and a further 15,000 were damaged. Nearly 4,000\u00a0livestock, primarily poultry, died. The Cyclone was strongest at its northeast section.[citation needed]"

The storm sank three destroyers, killed 790 sailors, damaged 9 other warships, and swept dozens of aircraft overboard off their aircraft carriers. Task Force 38 (TF\u00a038) had been operating about 300\u00a0mi (260\u00a0nmi; 480\u00a0km) east of Luzon in the Philippine Sea, conducting air raids against Japanese airfields in the Philippines and had been trying to refuel their ships. Information given to Halsey about the typhoon was incorrect, and despite warning signs of worsening conditions, the ships remained on station until December 17 when Halsey ordered the Third Fleet into the center of the typhoon. With currently available data,[3] it was the 23rd and last known Western Pacific tropical cyclone formed during the 1944 season."

        "content": "TF\u00a038 consisted of 7 fleet carriers, 6 light carriers, 8 battleships, 15 cruisers, and about 50 destroyers. The carriers had been conducting raids against Japanese airfields in the Philippines, and ships were being refueled, especially many destroyers, which were running low on fuel. When the storm hit, the procedure had to be aborted. Damage to the fleet was severe. Some ships rolled more than 70 degrees. Three destroyers, Spence, Hickox, and Maddox, had nearly empty fuel stores (10\u201315% of capacity) and so lacked the stabilizing effect of the extra weight, making them relatively unstable. Additionally, several other destroyers, including Hull and Monaghan, were of the older Farragut-class and had been refitted with over 500 long tons (510\u00a0t) of extra equipment and armament, which made them top-heavy. Spence, Hull, and Monaghan either capsized or were sunk after water flooded down their smokestacks and disabled their engines. Without power, they were unable to control their heading and were at the mercy of the wind and seas. Hickox and Maddox pumped seawater into their empty fuel tanks, adding enough stability to ride out the storm with relatively minor damage. Many other ships of TF\u00a038 suffered various degrees of damage, especially to radar and radio equipment, which crippled communications within the fleet. Several carriers suffered fires in their hangars, and 146 aircraft were wrecked or blown overboard. Nine ships\u2014including one light cruiser, three light carriers, and two escort carriers\u2014suffered enough damage to be sent for repairs. The carrier Monterey was nearly taken down in flames by its own airplanes as they crashed into bulkheads and exploded during violent rolls. One of those fighting the fires aboard Monterey was Lieutenant Gerald Ford, later President of the United States. Ford later recalled nearly going overboard when 20\u00b0 and greater rolling caused aircraft below decks to careen into each other, igniting a fire. Ford, serving as General Quarters Officer of the Deck, was ordered to go below to assess the raging fire. He did so safely and reported his findings back to the ship's commanding officer, Captain Stuart Ingersoll. The ship's crew was able to contain the fire, and the ship got underway again.[6] Planes went adrift, collided, and burst into flames. Monterey caught fire at 0911 (18 December) and lost steerageway a few minutes later. The fire was brought under control at 0945 and the C.O., Captain Stuart H. Ingersoll, decided to let his ship lie dead in the water until temporary repairs could be effected. She lost 18 aircraft burned in the hangar deck or blown overboard and 16 seriously damaged, together with three 20-mm guns, and suffered extensive rupturing of her ventilation system. Cowpens lost 7 planes overboard and caught fire from one that broke loose at 1051, but the fire was brought under control promptly; Langley rolled through 70 degrees; San Jacinto reported a fighter plane adrift on the hangar deck which wrecked seven other aircraft. She also suffered damage from salt water that entered through punctures in the ventilating ducts.\nCaptain [Jasper T.] Acuff's replenishment escort carriers did pretty well. Flames broke out on the flight deck of Cape Esperance at 1228 but were overcome; Kwajalein made a maximum roll of 39 degrees to port when hove-to with wind abeam. Her port catwalks scooped up green water, but she lost only three planes which were jettisoned from the flight deck; it took one hour to get them over the side. Three other escort carriers lost in all 86 aircraft but came through without much material damage.\"[7] In the words of Admiral Chester Nimitz, the typhoon's impact \"...represented a more crippling blow to the Third Fleet than it might be expected to suffer in anything less than a major action.\" The events surrounding Typhoon Cobra were similar to those the Japanese navy faced some nine years earlier in what they termed the \"Fourth Fleet Incident\"."

This was the first survivor from any of the capsized destroyers to be picked up. Shortly thereafter, many more survivors were picked up, in groups or in isolation. Tabberer's skipper, Lieutenant Commander Henry Lee Plage, directed that the ship, despite its own dire condition, begin boxed searches to look for more survivors. Tabberer rescued 55 survivors in a 51-hour search, despite repeated orders from Halsey to return all ships to port in Ulithi. She picked up 41 men from Hull and 14 from Spence before finally returning to Ulithi after being directly relieved from the search by two destroyer escorts. After the fleet had regrouped (without Tabberer), ships and aircraft conducted search-and-rescue missions. The destroyer Brown rescued the only survivors from Monaghan, six in total. She additionally rescued 13 sailors from Hull. Eighteen other survivors from Hull and Spence were rescued over the three days following Typhoon Cobra by other ships of the 3rd Fleet. The destroyer USS\u00a0The Sullivans\u00a0(DD-537) emerged from the storm undamaged and began looking for survivors before returning to Ulithi on Christmas Eve.[12] In all, 93 men were rescued of the over 800 men presumed missing in the three ships, and two others who had been swept overboard from the escort carrier Anzio. Despite disobeying fleet orders, Plage was awarded the Legion of Merit by Halsey, and Tabberer's crew was awarded Navy Unit Commendation ribbons (the first ever awarded)."

This led to a severe loss of men, ships, and aircraft. A Court of Inquiry was convened on board the USS Cascade at the naval base at Ulithi, with Admiral Nimitz, CINCPAC, in attendance at the court.[13] Captain Herbert K. Gates was the judge advocate for the court.[14] The court found that though Halsey had committed an \"error of judgement\" in sailing the Third Fleet into the heart of the typhoon, it stopped short of unambiguously recommending sanction. In January 1945, Halsey passed command of the Third Fleet to Admiral Raymond A. Spruance. This typhoon prompted the U.S. Navy to establish weather monitoring infrastructure, which eventually became the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.[15][16] The typhoon plays a central part in Herman Wouk's The Caine Mutiny."

The nineteenth named storm of the annual typhoon season, Aere formed on October 4, 2016 as a tropical depression to the east of Luzon, Philippines shortly after the JMA had started tracking Songda. On the next day, the system had become a tropical storm and it moved into South China Sea. During October 7, it intensified into a severe tropical storm and reached peak intensity with 10-minute winds of 110\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph). Shortly thereafter, due to remaining in almost the same area for hours, Aere began to weaken to a tropical storm, and on October 10, it weakened to a tropical depression, before weakening to a low-pressure area late on October 11. On October 13, Aere re-generated into a tropical depression and it made landfall in Hu\u1ebf, Vietnam late that day. The system moved towards Laos and Thailand before it fully dissipated on October 14. Aere affected parts of Southeast Asia in October 2016, but its impact was most severe in Vietnam. Heavy flooding triggered by the remnants of Aere from October 13 to October 17, 2016 in North-Central Vietnam caused severe damage. A total of 7 people were killed and total damage reached US$209\u00a0million. The remnants of Aere also caused heavy rains in northeast Thailand."

It was subsequently classified as a tropical depression during October 4, by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), while it was located about 1,000\u00a0km (620\u00a0mi) to the northeast of Manila in the Philippines,[2] to the east to the Babuyan Group of Islands.[3][4] Later that day, PAGASA had named the system Julian.[5] The JTWC started issuing advisories on the system while it moved westward during October 5, with the designation of 22W.[6] Despite Julian having a disorganised structure while crossing the Luzon Strait, the system was located in an area of light to moderate wind shear and very warm sea surface temperatures.[7] After satellite imagery had depicted a significant increase of convection, all agencies upgraded Julian to a tropical storm, with the JMA naming it as Aere.[8][9][10][11] Hours later, when Aere had emerged to the extreme northern part of the South China Sea, Aere reached peak intensity with 10-minute winds of 110\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph), just shy of typhoon strength, after it remained nearly stationary between two subtropical ridges.[12][13] Shortly thereafter, due to remaining in almost the same area for hours, Aere began to weaken and the JMA downgraded it to a tropical storm.[14][15] By October 10, Aere's LLCC became exposed due to southwesterly wind shear and both the JMA and JTWC issued their final advisory three hours later.[16][17] The JMA tracked its remnants as it moved southwestward until it weakened to a low-pressure area late on October 11.[18] Later, the low-pressure area moved southwestward on October 12,[19] until the well-marked low pressure area of Aere re-generated into a tropical depression early on October 13.[20][21] The JMA started to tracked the tropical depression[22] and the JTWC re-issued advisories too.[23] Now moving westward, Aere had flaring convection with weak banding and was located in an area of high SSTs and low wind shear.[24] Although the system had failed to re-organize into a weak tropical storm, the JTWC issued its final advisory and shortly thereafter it made landfall several kilometers north of Da Nang, Vietnam.[25] The remnants of Aere was tracked by the JMA as a weak tropical depression on October 14.[26] It moved towards Laos and Thailand[27] until it fully dissipated later that day.[26]"

According to the 2020 census, it had a population of 102,316,[7] making it the 43rd-most populous city in Texas. The city was named, in 1876, for a waterfall on the Wichita River, which was destroyed due to flooding in 1886. The city is home to the Newby-McMahon Building (otherwise known as the \"world's littlest skyscraper\"), constructed downtown in 1919 and featured in Robert Ripley's Ripley's Believe It or Not!."

As late as 1841, a large Indian settlement was present in the area that is now the city of Wichita Falls.[9] American settlers arrived in the 1860s, mainly as cattle ranchers. The city was named Wichita Falls on September 27, 1876, as the Wichita River runs through the area and a waterfall was in the river's course in 1876. Just 10 years later in 1886, a flood destroyed the original waterfall on the Wichita River for which the city was named.[9][10][11] After nearly 100 years of visitors wanting to visit the no longer existing falls, the city built an artificial waterfall beside the river in Lucy Park. The recreated falls are 54\u00a0ft (16\u00a0m) high and recirculate at 3,500 gallons per minute. They are visible to south-bound traffic on Interstate 44. On the day the city was named in 1876, a sale of town lots was held at what is now the corner of Seventh and Ohio Streets \u2013 the birthplace of the city.[12] The Fort Worth & Denver City Railway arrived in September 1882, the same year the city became the county seat of Wichita County.[8] The city grew westwards from the original FW&DC train depot which was located at the northwest corner of Seventh Street and the FW&DC.[12] This area is now referred to as the Depot Square Historic District,[13][14] which has been declared a Texas Historic Landmark.[15] The early history of Wichita Falls well into the 20th century also rests on the work of two entrepreneurs, Joseph A. Kemp[16] and his brother-in-law, Frank Kell. Kemp and Kell were pioneers in food processing and retailing, flour milling, railroads, cattle, banking, and oil.[17] Downtown Wichita Falls was the city's main shopping area for many years. Those shops lost ground to the creation of new shopping centers throughout the city beginning with Parker Square in 1953 and other similar developments during the 1960s and 1970s, culminating with the opening of Sikes Senter Mall in 1974. The city has been seeking funding to rebuild and restore the downtown area since 2010.[8] Wichita Falls was once home to offices of several oil companies and related industries, along with oil refineries operated by the Continental Oil Company (now ConocoPhillips) until 1952 and Panhandle Oil Company (founded in Wichita Falls, sold to American Petrofina in 1965).[18] Both firms continued to use a portion of their former refineries as gasoline/oil terminal facilities for many years."

Wichita Falls has one of the largest freeway mileages for a city of its size[citation needed] as a result of a 1954 bond issue approved by city and county voters to purchase rights-of-way for several expressway routes through the city and county, the first of which was opened in the year 1958 as an alignment of U.S. 287 from Eighth Street at Broad and Holliday Streets northwestward across the Wichita River and bisecting Lucy and Scotland Parks to the Old Iowa Park Road, the original U.S. 287 alignment.[citation needed] That was followed by other expressway links including U.S. 82\u2013287 east to Henrietta (completed in the year 1968), U.S. 281 south toward Jacksboro (completed 1969), U.S. 287 northwest to Iowa Park and Electra (opened 1962), Interstate 44 north to Burkburnett and the Red River (opened 1964), and Interstate 44 from Old Iowa Park Road to U.S. 287/Spur 325 interchange on the city's north side along with Spur 325 from I-44/U.S. 287 to the main gate of Sheppard Air Force Base (both completed as a single project in 1960). However, cross-country traffic for many years had to contend with several ground-level intersections and traffic lights over Holliday and Broad Streets near the downtown area for about 13 blocks between connecting expressway links until a new elevated freeway running overhead was completed in 2001.[citation needed] Efforts to create an additional freeway along the path of Kell Boulevard for U.S. 82\u2013277 began in 1967 with the acquisition of right-of-way that included a former railroad right-of-way and the first project including construction of the present frontage roads completed in 1977, followed by freeway lanes, overpasses, and on/off ramps in 1989 from just east of Brook Avenue west to Kemp Boulevard; similar projects west from Kemp to Barnett Road in 2001 followed by Barnett Road west past FM 369 in 2010 to tie in which a project now underway to transform U.S. 277 into a continuous four-lane expressway between Wichita Falls and Abilene.[59]"

Joan was the strongest typhoon of 1959 Pacific typhoon season, and one of the most intense Pacific typhoons on record. Joan formed from a surface center to the northeast of Guam on August 23, in which Japan Meteorological Agency began to track and classify the system as a tropical depression on the next day. A reconnaissance aircraft was sent to investigate the surface center and in 03:25 UTC on August 25 the surface center was classified as a tropical storm by Joint Typhoon Warning Center. The storm rapidly intensified into a typhoon in the same day it was formed. By the next three days as Joan tracks towards Taiwan, Joan explosively intensified to attain peak intensity with the pressure of 885 millibars (26.1\u00a0inHg), which is tied with Nina as the most intense Pacific typhoon on the record at the time.[1] Shortly afterwards, Joan attained peak strength as a Category\u00a05 equivalent super typhoon on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale with winds of 165 knots (190\u00a0mph) before making landfall in Taiwan as a 160 knots (180\u00a0mph) typhoon, which was according to JTWC is the strongest landfall in the recorded history at the time. After making landfall, Joan weakened into a 110 knots (130\u00a0mph) typhoon before making landfall on Fujian, China as a Category\u00a02 equivalent typhoon on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale with winds of 95 knots (109\u00a0mph). Once onshore, Joan did not degenerate quickly as Joan remained as a tropical cyclone for about one day before transitioning into a extratropical cyclone in 18:00 UTC of August 31. Extratropical remnants of Joan quickly traversed through South Korea and Japan before being last noted on 18:00 UTC, September 2. In Taiwan, damages were considerable with 3,308 homes being destroyed and $3 million in crop damage were recorded. 11 people were killed and 74 people were injured during the onslaught of the storm. In mainland China, Joan caused 60 casualties, including 3 deaths. In South Korea, Joan caused several rivers on the Korean peninsula to overflow their banks, killing 17 people and injuring 21. Another 7,000 people were rendered homeless."

On August 24, JMA began to track the developing system and classified the system as a tropical depression.[1][nb 1]  A reconnaissance aircraft was sent to this area, and on August 25 at 03:25 UTC JTWC classified the system as a 40 knots (46\u00a0mph) tropical storm with JTWC giving the name Joan to the said storm. The new storm quickly intensified, as Joan became a typhoon in the midnight of the next day. By noon on the next day, Joan became a 85 knots (98\u00a0mph) typhoon while tracking to the west.[5][6] As Joan began to intensify further into a 100 knots (120\u00a0mph) typhoon on August 27, Joan began to track northwestward with the speed of 10 knots (12\u00a0mph). On the next day, Joan rapidly intensified again for the second time as Joan began to increase movement speed up to 17 knots (20\u00a0mph), and by the midnight of August 29 Joan attained its peak intensity with the pressure of 885 millibars (26.1\u00a0inHg), which is tied with Nina as the most intense Pacific typhoon on the record at the time.[1] In the next six hours before making landfall, Joan attained the peak strength as a Category\u00a05 equivalent typhoon on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale with winds of 170 knots (200\u00a0mph), while the pressure rises up into 900 millibars (27\u00a0inHg). Shortly after reaching peak strength, Joan made landfall near Hualien City, Taiwan with the winds of 160 knots (180\u00a0mph). Joan quickly weakened after making landfall on Taiwan, with the winds falling into 110 knots (130\u00a0mph) after emerging in Strait of Taiwan at the midnight of August 30.[6] Six hours later, Joan made landfall in Fujian, China with the intensity of 95 knots (109\u00a0mph) of August 30, with the slower speed of 10 knots (12\u00a0mph). Joan begins to slowly degenerate after the second landfall, though Joan remained on typhoon intensity for most of the day. However, by 18:00 UTC, Joan started to rapidly dissipate as JTWC published the last tropical cyclone warning on Joan.[5] By the next day, Joan began recurving to the northeast while weakening further into a tropical storm. At 18:00 UTC on the same day, Joan transitioned into a extratropical cyclone while above Zhejiang, China. Emerging in the Yellow Sea as an extratropical low in the midnight of September 1, Joan quickly traversed through South Korea as a weak extratropical storm. By the evening of September 1, extratropical remnants of Joan emerged in the Sea of Japan. On September 2, extratropical remnants of Joan traversed through central Japan before being last noted at southeast of Tokyo in 18:00 UTC of the same day.[6]"

        "content": "Tropical Storm Bret was the deadliest natural disaster in Venezuela since the 1967 Caracas earthquake. The third tropical cyclone of the 1993 Atlantic hurricane season, Bret formed on August\u00a04 from a westward-moving, African tropical wave. Bret would later peak as a 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) tropical storm as it neared Trinidad. It took an extremely southerly course through the Caribbean, passing over the coasts of Venezuela and Colombia. High terrain in the northern parts of those countries severely disrupted the circulation of the storm, and Bret had weakened to a tropical depression before emerging over the extreme southwestern Caribbean Sea. There, it restrengthened to a tropical storm and made landfall in Nicaragua on August 10, dissipating soon after. Bret's remnants reached the Pacific Ocean, where they would later regenerate into Hurricane Greg. Though Bret was only a weak tropical storm at landfall, it caused extreme flooding and nearly 200 deaths as it moved through South America, mostly in Venezuela. The first tropical storm to strike the country in 100\u00a0years, Bret deluged northern regions with 13.35\u00a0in (339\u00a0mm) of rainfall. The capital, Caracas, received 4.72\u00a0in (120\u00a0mm) of rain over seven hours, resulting in widespread mudslides in the hills around the city that buried houses and carried away cars. There were 173\u00a0deaths in the country, and damage was estimated at US$25\u00a0million (1993\u00a0USD).[nb 1] Volunteers and firefighters helped storm victims cope with the damage, while workers cleared roads to restore transportation. Outside of Venezuela, Bret first affected Trinidad and Tobago, causing minor flooding and power outages. It passed just south of Cura\u00e7ao, where the storm damaged the coral reef and the roofs of 17\u00a0homes. The storm later brushed northern Colombia, killing one person there, before hitting Central America. In Nicaragua, Bret killed 31\u00a0people and left US$3\u00a0million in damage, with many coastal towns isolated by floods. There was one death in neighboring Costa Rica and seven in Honduras, all due to flooding. In Central America, damage would be compounded by Hurricane Gert as it traversed the region in early September."

        "content": "Tropical Storm Bret originated from a tropical wave\u2014a westward-tracking low-pressure area\u2014that crossed the coast of Africa on August 1, 1993. Throughout its journey across the open Atlantic, the wave retained an impressive cloud structure with an area of deep convection. By August 4, the associated thunderstorm activity consolidated and organized into curved rainbands. The National Hurricane Center (NHC), noting the improving structure and sufficient support from Dvorak intensity estimates, reassessed the wave as a tropical depression at 12:00 UTC that day, the third such system of the annual hurricane season.[1] At the time of its classification, it was located along the 10th parallel north over the central Atlantic, about 1,150\u00a0mi (1,850\u00a0km) west-southwest of the Cape Verde Islands. With a very resilient high-pressure area to its north, the depression continued moving due west at an unusually low latitude for most of its existence.[1][2] The system gradually organized due to low wind shear.[3] After the outflow increased and the circulation became better established, the NHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Bret early on August\u00a05. Initially, the agency expected the storm would attain hurricane status while moving west-northwestward through the Caribbean Sea,[4] although the storm would maintain its westward track. Early on August\u00a06, Bret attained peak winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h),[1] fueled by warm waters and increased banding around a central dense overcast.[5] The circulation became exposed late on August\u00a06, but the thunderstorms soon refired over the center.[1] At 07:00\u00a0UTC on the next day, Bret struck the island of Trinidad near Galera Point.[6] The storm moved across the northern portion of the island,[1] and later made landfall in northeastern Venezuela near Macuro.[6] After hitting northeastern Venezuela, Bret continued westward through the extreme northern portion of the country. Around 20:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a07, the circulation emerged into the southeastern Caribbean Sea.[1] The circulation weakened and became poorly-defined, although the storm maintained stronger winds to the north.[7] Despite the southerly inflow being disrupted by the mountainous terrain, Bret maintained its circulation while continuing westward,[8] passing just north of Venezuela's capital Caracas. Around 08:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a08, the storm moved back onshore Venezuela near Morrocoy National Park in Falc\u00f3n state.[6] Later that day, the NHC noted that there was \"little if any circulation left to this system\", although the agency continued issuing advisory due to the storm's heavy rainfall.[9] However, a circulation emerged into the Gulf of Venezuela,[10] which soon crossed into northeastern Colombia. There, the circulation neared the Pico Crist\u00f3bal Col\u00f3n, the tallest mountain in Colombia with a peak of 18,947\u00a0ft (5,775\u00a0m). This caused the structure to deteriorate, and on August\u00a09 Bret weakened to tropical depression status with the circulation \"practically dissipated\", according to the NHC.[11] The Hurricane Hunters had difficulty finding a closed circulation,[12] prompting the NHC to discontinue advisories at 15:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a09.[13] After moving through the southwestern Caribbean Sea, Bret began to re-develop convection as upper-level conditions became more favorable.[11] By early on August\u00a010, surface observations confirmed the presence of a low-level circulation, and the NHC re-issued advisories on the system.[14] The convection continued to organize, prompting the NHC to upgrade Bret again to a tropical storm.[15] The storm strengthened slightly further to a secondary peak of 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h). Around 17:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a010, Bret made its final landfall in southern Nicaragua near Bahia Punta Gorda. The circulation moved through the country and turned more to the west-northwest.[11] Operationally, it was believed that Bret survived after crossing Central America and entered the eastern Pacific, as the NHC designated it Tropical Depression Eight-E.[16] Post-storm analysis determined otherwise that Bret dissipated over western Nicaragua, near the Pacific coast on August\u00a011.[11] The remnants continued to the west-northwest, eventually developing into a tropical depression on August\u00a015 off the west coast of Mexico. The system eventually became Hurricane Greg with peak winds of 130\u00a0mph (210\u00a0km/h), which lasted until August\u00a028.[17]"

About 24\u00a0hours in advance of the storm, tropical cyclone warnings and watches were issued for the southern Lesser Antilles and Venezuela.[18] The first tropical storm watch was posted late on August\u00a05 from Dominica southward to Trinidad. On the next day, this was upgraded to a tropical storm warning and hurricane watch from Saint Lucia to Trinidad. Tropical storm warnings spread westward through Venezuela along the storm's path, as well as the ABC islands and northern Colombia along the Guajira Peninsula.[19] Later when Bret began reorganizing in the southwestern Caribbean, portions of Nicaragua were under a tropical storm warning only nine hours before the storm struck.[18] The warning covered from Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua through the entirety of the Costa Rican coastline, as well as San Andr\u00e9s island offshore.[20] In Trinidad and Tobago, the government set up shelters and sent home non-essential oil workers. Officials canceled flights and shut the ports as a precaution.[21] Stores and business closed early after locals had stocked up on life supplies. Army troops were deployed in Port of Spain to avert looting.[22] The threat of the storm caused a rise in unleaded oil prices.[23] In Venezuela, boats were ordered to remain at port, while flights were canceled to Isla Margarita and Puerto la Cruz.[24] Rescue workers were mobilized in the capital city of Caracas to prepare in the event of landslides.[25] Ahead of the storm, the head of Sucre state declared a state of emergency,[26] and later Caracas was placed under the same state once the rains began.[27] According to the governor of Venezuela's capital district, local weather media expected the storm to only brush Caracas and surrounding areas; as a result, not all precautions were made.[28] On August\u00a07, weather officials stated that the brunt of the storm had passed and that the storm was weakening; this was before the onslaught of the flooding rains.[29] In neighboring Colombia, officials issued a wind and heavy rain warning in response to the storm.[30] Towns shut off electricity along the coast and canceled flights.[31] Later, about 1,000\u00a0people evacuated from eastern Costa Rica,[32] and another 40,000\u00a0evacuated from portions of Nicaragua,[33] Flights in the country were canceled due to the storm.[34]"

Ten soldiers were burned while attempting to move a downed wire in Tobago.[38] The storm damaged houses on southern Trinidad and central Tobago.[21] Meanwhile, flood waters devastated local crops, resulting in losses of more than TT$4 million (US$730,000). Infrastructure damage due to inaccessible roads and bridges totaled TT$979,000 (US$179,000).[39] On nearby Grenada, a weather station reported sustained winds of 37\u00a0mph (60\u00a0km/h), with gusts to 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h). A ship known as the Lady Elaine, reported winds of 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h), while anchored at Hog Island on the south coast of Grenada.[18] Passing 70\u00a0mi (110\u00a0km) to the south, Bret brushed Cura\u00e7ao with tropical-storm-force winds and light precipitation.[40] A peak wind of 48\u00a0mph (77\u00a0km/h) was recorded at a local weather station, though strong onshore breeze averaged 30 to 35\u00a0mph (48 to 56\u00a0km/h).[41] The storm damaged the roofs of 17\u00a0homes and caused power outages to the island.[42] Rough surf, with wave heights of 4.9\u00a0ft (1.5\u00a0m), severely disrupted the coral reef along the south shore, breaking off 25\u201350% of the reef's branches. In particular, elkhorn (Acropora palmata) and fire coral (Millepora complanata) received extensive damage to their structures. Of the coral reefs, those in shallow waters were worst affected; considerable damage also occurred to pillar coral (Dendrogyra cylindrus), which typically grow at depths of less than 16\u00a0ft (4.9\u00a0m) below water. The animals and plants there were affected as well.[41] In addition, nearby Bonaire experienced gusts to gale force during the passage of the storm.[43][44] As a minimal tropical storm, Bret moved through northern Colombia.[18] The storm downed a power line onto a house in the city of Maicao, killing one person and injuring another.[29] An oil tanker rode out the storm at Cove\u00f1as port, with no effects to it or the nation's oil industry.[45]"

Isla Margarita offshore reported wind gusts of 53\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h),[18] as well as high waves 66\u00a0ft (20\u00a0m) in height. The capital city Caracas recorded wind gusts of around 31 to 37\u00a0mph (50 to 60\u00a0km/h);[28] according to news reports, Bret was the first tropical storm to affect Caracas in 100\u00a0years.[30] However, the storm's rainfall was more significant. Guanare in western Venezuela reported 13.35\u00a0in (339\u00a0mm) of rainfall in just 10\u00a0hours. Quebrada Seca in Barinas state recorded 11.23\u00a0in (285\u00a0mm) of rainfall over 24\u00a0hours, and in the capital Caracas, 4.72\u00a0in (120\u00a0mm) of rainfall occurred over just seven hours.[18] The capital ultimately was affected by 10\u00a0hours of heavy rainfall.[46] One station in the country recorded 5\u00a0in (130\u00a0mm) of precipitation in seven hours, setting a nationwide record for the 20th century for the heaviest rainfall over that duration.[47] The heavy rainfall was the most destructive aspect of Tropical Storm Bret in Venezuela.[28] On the offshore Isla Margaria, the rains flooded the primary hospital,[42] and rivers overflowed,[48] although damage was minimal.[49] On the mainland, heavy rainfall caused damaging mudslides and flooding,[18] and entire houses buried in the middle of the night with little notice. Flooded rivers washed away cars and homes in the hills of Caracas,[28] mostly along the flooded La Guarre River.[29] Floodwaters mixed with raw sewage from damaged water lines across the region. Residents returned to damaged homes despite warnings.[47] Damage was worst in Petare, La Vega, and El Valle, all surrounding Caracas on insecure mountainsides. One home was wrecked in Petare, killing four family members.[29] At least 19\u00a0people perished in Miranda state, and another three deaths were reported in Aragua due to landslides.[50] Residents requested assistance from the local fire company, although disrupted telephone service created an atmosphere of confusion.[28] Strong winds also destroyed the roofs of other houses,[51] and areas were left without power.[52] Portions of the Pan-American Highway and a coastal road were disrupted by landslides,[51] and the state of Barinas was largely isolated due to road blockages.[47] Most roads west of Caracas were likewise blocked.[30] Overall, Tropical Storm Bret left over 11,000\u00a0people homeless,[53] including 6,000 in Barinas state,[47] and 3,500 in Caracas.[51] Bret left US$25\u00a0million in damage and caused 173\u00a0deaths in the country,[18] while at least 500 were injured.[47] Most of the deceased were living in poorly built homes around Caracas,[18] where at least 120\u00a0people were killed, mainly children.[47] The storm was the deadliest natural disaster in Venezuela since the 1967 Caracas earthquake.[47]"

Throughout Nicaragua, Bret destroyed 12\u00a0bridges and disrupted the drainage systems along the regional road network.[54] Heavy rainfall also caused rivers to overflow, causing heavy damage in adjacent fields that affected rice, cassava, and bananas;[55] about 1,800 hectares (4,400 acres) of rice fields were destroyed.[56] Two villages of the Miskito people were washed away, leaving 500\u00a0residents homeless.[57] The storm damaged at least 1,500\u00a0houses and destroyed another 850,[54] leaving around 60,000\u00a0people temporarily homeless.[36] Bret also destroyed ten churches and ten schools, as well as 25\u00a0medical centers.[54] The storm killed nine people offshore when a boat sank in the Corn Islands,[18] and there were 31\u00a0deaths overall in the country.[35] The preliminary damage total was around US$3\u00a0million, although it did not include crop or infrastructure damage.[36] The storm brought heavy rainfall and high seas to the east coast of Costa Rica,[15] as well as gusty winds.[32] One death occurred in the country, as well as US$7.7\u00a0million in damage.[35] Similarly heavy rain fell in the Mosquitia region of Honduras.[58] Floodwaters reached 7\u00a0ft (2.1\u00a0m) deep, isolating coastal towns.[36] Overflown rivers and flooding forced about 1,700\u00a0people to evacuate by canoe, while some residents rode out the storm on the roofs of their homes.[32][36] About 16,000\u00a0people were left homeless.[59] The storm destroyed over 2,000 hectares (4,900 acres) of various crops, and there were seven deaths in the country.[36] In El Salvador, light winds were also experienced,[32] with moderate rainfall reaching 4.1\u00a0in (104\u00a0mm) in La Palma, Chalatenango.[60] The storm knocked down trees near the capital San Salvador, temporarily leaving the city without power.[57]"

After the storm, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) provided US$50,000 in emergency spending, and UNICEF sent US$15,000 to buy oral rehydration salts.[51] A Venezuelan radio station held a marathon to collect relief items, such as food or clothing.[64] After the storm, the Nicaraguan government declared a state of disaster in the North and South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Regions, as well as Tisma in the Masaya Department.[54] The government sheltered those made homeless in Bluefields along the Atlantic coast.[57] Relief efforts were coordinated by the Comit\u00e9 Nacional de Emergencia to provide aid to the affected storm victims.[65] Officials sent medical crews to the hardest hit areas. This was due to an increased potential for the spread of water-born diseases, the result of ongoing floods and damaged sanitation facilities. Meanwhile, planes flew overhead to determine the extent of damage. On August\u00a018, the government requested international assistance to cope from the disaster. In response, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the UNDP sent US$70,000 in emergency aid, some of which to be used for fuel to transport medicine and food. The World Food Programme sent 72\u00a0tons of food and milk. The countries of Japan and the United States were the first to respond; the former provided $100,000, and the latter sent a Lockheed C-130 Hercules to distribute food. Switzerland later sent US$81,000 as a cash donation, while the European Economic Community sent US$227,000 worth of food and medicine. After Tropical Storm Gert struck in early September, various other countries sent additional money, food, medicine, and other goods.[54] The government of Honduras used one helicopter to deliver relief goods to stranded residents on roofs.[36] Persistent rainfall following Bret caused additional flooding and damage,[58] and the damage total between Bret and subsequent Tropical Storm Gert totaled US$60\u00a0million in Honduras.[66]"

        "content": "On the evening of March\u00a027, upper-air plots identified a broad and powerful upper-level trough exiting the southern Rocky Mountains into the Great Plains.[1] Winds in the upper reaches of the troposphere accelerated upwards of 140\u00a0kn (160\u00a0mph; 260\u00a0km/h) across Texas and Mississippi. In the mid-levels of the atmosphere, the trough detached into a cut-off low, while a potent shortwave trough rounded the base of this feature into the Gulf Coast of the United States. Winds at this level increased to 95\u00a0kn (110\u00a0mph; 175\u00a0km/h), and notably, became increasingly diffluent across the Southeastern United States.[2] Early on March\u00a028, a surface area of low pressure developed over eastern Texas and reached a minimum barometric pressure of 987\u00a0mb (29.1\u00a0inHg) as it pushed into western Tennessee later that day.[3] Winds in the lower levels of the atmosphere intensified to 50\u201360\u00a0kn (60\u201370\u00a0mph; 95\u2013110\u00a0km/h) and likewise increased at the surface,[2] contributing to significant warm air advection to the south of a warm front draped across the Appalachian Mountains in North Carolina. By 15:00\u00a0UTC, surface dewpoints had surged in excess of 60\u00a0\u00b0F (16\u00a0\u00b0C) across Georgia and South Carolina, at which time forecasters at the National Weather Service Severe Local Storms Unit (SLSU) \u2013 equivalent to the modern-day Storm Prediction Center \u2013 outlined a Moderate risk of severe weather from southwestern Georgia northeastward into southern Maryland. Within three hours, these moist dewpoints surged well into eastern North Carolina as the surface low pushed into southern Kentucky.[3] To the south of the original area of low pressure, a distinct mesolow developed along the warm front across northern Alabama. This feature first began to form around 18:00\u00a0UTC, and within three hours, it had rapidly deepened to a barometric pressure of 976\u00a0mb (28.82\u00a0inHg). This system moved rapidly northeast at speeds up to 55\u00a0kn (65\u00a0mph; 100\u00a0km/h), thus crossing into eastern North Carolina during the evening hours.[2] As it did so, low-level winds across the eastern Carolinas originated from a southerly direction instead of a southwesterly direction; this shift in flow created a strongly sheared environment across the region. Meanwhile, afternoon temperatures climbed above 80\u00a0\u00b0F (27\u00a0\u00b0C), contributing to significant destabilization. Convective available potential energy values rose between 2,000 and 3,000\u00a0J/kg into North Carolina,[1] with locally higher values observed in northeastern South Carolina.[2] These environmental conditions bore strong resemblance to the idealized tornado setup across the Carolinas, and they prompted the SLSU to upgrade areas from eastern Alabama into the Outer Banks of North Carolina to a High risk of severe weather,[3] the first occurrence on record in this portion of the United States.[1] As the mesolow moved across the Carolinas, it was supported by a surface trough to its east-northeast which likely formed as a result of differential heating.[3] Strong low-level convergence associated with this feature led to vigorous thunderstorm development in close proximity to the low,[1] where low-level helicity was maximized and highly supportive of supercell thunderstorms.[2] These supercells first began producing tornadoes across Upstate South Carolina around 19:15\u00a0UTC and continued to do so as they moved northeast, passing between Columbia and Charlotte around 22:00\u00a0UTC, near Fayetteville around 00:00\u00a0UTC on March\u00a029, and finally ending north of the Albemarle Sound in northeastern North Carolina around 02:00\u00a0UTC.[1][3] In total, 24 tornadoes were confirmed, with 11 each in the Carolinas and 2 in Georgia. The size and scope of the event drew parallels to the 1884 Enigma tornado outbreak and tornado outbreak on April 16, 2011, and it held the record for number of tornadoes in the Carolinas until that 2011 event.[1] Comparisons were also drawn to the 1925 Tri-State tornado outbreak given the progression of an intense collection of tornadoes located near the mesolow.[2]"

This was an unusual East Coast outbreak both in its sustained intensity and in some of its meteorological specifics. It was noted by Grazulis and other researchers[13]:\u200a648\u200a that this outbreak developed near the center of a large-scale low, in a fashion resembling the 1925 Tri-State tornado. In this outbreak, the damage path was attributed to separate tornadoes, though one storm produced (on an estimated 250+ mile track) a family of 13 large tornadoes, 10 of which produced F3 or F4 damage, which was occasionally connected by swaths of downburst damage. The resulting tornado family, the series of tornadoes in totality is among the longest on record.[49] This outbreak was also part of a larger storm system that was responsible for producing severe weather across a much wider area of the eastern U.S. On the previous day, weaker tornadoes had been reported in scattered locations from Louisiana to Alabama, and a thunderstorm-caused flash flood was suspected to be the cause of a train derailment in north Florida. The northern part of the same system first spawned additional severe (non-tornadic) thunderstorms, which caused 4 additional deaths in Maryland and Pennsylvania, before then dropping snow, sleet and ice across a wide area of the northeast. The thunderstorms which produced the tornado outbreak were also responsible (according to the same data) for numerous reports of large hail and wind damage in Appalachian southwest North Carolina, and numerous larger cities (Atlanta, Baltimore, Greenville, South Carolina, Columbia, South Carolina, Charlotte, North Carolina, Dover, Delaware, Fayetteville, North Carolina, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Raleigh, North Carolina, Suffolk, Virginia, Norfolk, Virginia) at the periphery of the outbreak, with wind damage from thunderstorms reported as far north as Delaware."

At least two of the eleven known tornadoes were violent events, equal to F4 or higher in intensity on the Fujita scale.[2][self-published source?] It was one of only three disastrous tornado outbreaks (one of the others being the 1904 Moscow tornado) in modern Russian history, and the third-deadliest tornado outbreak in European history. Based upon observed damages, the main tornado, an F4 in Ivanovo caused extreme damage, throwing heavy objects of 50,000 kilograms (110,000\u00a0lb) for distances up to 200 metres (0.12\u00a0mi). Another tornado, assessed to have been at least F4, occurred at Kostroma. Severe thunderstorms also produced hail up to 1 kilogram (2.2\u00a0lb) in weight, among the heaviest hailstones confirmed worldwide. In all, the entire tornado outbreak killed at least 69 people (though the exact death toll is unknown) and injured 804.[1] It was previously rated as an F5, however, recent reanalysis has lowered the rating to F4 in 2018 by the European Severe Storms Laboratory."

        "content": "On June\u00a08, 1984, a negatively tilted trough caused an extratropical low pressure area to form over the coast of the Socialist Republic of Romania (now non-Communist Romania). Surface moisture moved north from the Black Sea and caused nearby dew points to rise to 20\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00b0F); though at that time these were restricted to Romania and the Ukrainian SSR, dew points were higher than average elsewhere.[3] By 1800 UTC, developing thunderstorms over the Ukrainian SSR spread overnight into the Russian SFSR. Between 00 and 12 UTC on June\u00a09, the strengthening low pressure area moved north-northeast over the northwestern Russian SFSR before undergoing occlusion. In the meantime, a strong cold front rapidly advanced along a line extending south from the surface low, then south of Minsk in the Byelorussian SSR (now Belarus), to near Bucharest. This front separated the drier air mass to the north from the warm, moist air mass near the Black Sea, and strong wind speeds near ground level caused vertical mixing. Therefore, dew points actually dropped before the first tornadoes formed, but nevertheless several factors overcame the lower dew points to produce tornadoes. Among these were a strong upper-level jet stream, clear skies causing daytime heating and instability, strong synoptic-scale lifting leading to ascension of updrafts, and high adiabatic lapse rates promoting thunderstorm development. All these factors combined to produce severe weather near Moscow. The tornadoes occurred in this region because an unstable and moist air mass, supported by warm sea surface temperatures over the Black Sea, had been in place four days before the outbreak began. The unusually strong intensity of the trough in the region on June\u00a08\u20139, with a 500-millibar geopotential height measured at about 2.7 standard deviations below normal, also favored an intense tornado outbreak.[3]"

About 1,180 homes were also damaged, destroyed or leveled by the tornado.[10] Some estimates indicate up to 95 deaths[4] or even more, with some sources suggesting 400 deaths in the outbreak were all related to the Ivanovo tornado. At 1130\u00a0UTC[3]\u2014other sources say 1205\u00a0UTC[10]\u2014this powerful multiple vortex tornado touched down 15\u00a0mi (24\u00a0km) south of Ivanovo.[5] Near Ivanovo, the tornado snapped or bent pine, spruce, and birch trees about 1\u20133\u00a0m (3.3\u20139.8\u00a0ft) from ground level.[5] In the town itself, the tornado picked up and cast aside a crane, weighing 320,000 kilograms (710,000\u00a0lb), and threw a water tank, weighing 50,000 kilograms (110,000 pounds), over a distance of 200 metres (0.12\u00a0mi).[3][11] ESWD mentions that the tornado destroyed factory areas. Near the Volga River, the tornado ripped up trees by their roots and destroyed many small huts.[11] Steel water containers capable of holding 150 cubic metres (40,000\u00a0US\u00a0gal) of water were carried 100 metres (330\u00a0ft) in the air and transported 1\u00a0km (0.62\u00a0mi) from their original site. Hail in association with the parent thunderstorm weighed up to 1 kilogram (2.2\u00a0lb), among the heaviest hailstones measured anywhere in the world;[3] though the measurement came with few details, it is comparable to the world record, a hailstone also measuring 1\u00a0kg (2.2\u00a0lb) in Bangladesh on April\u00a015, 1986.[12] The F4 tornado tracked for 99 miles (160\u00a0km)\u2014though some sources suggest only 80 kilometres (50\u00a0mi)[3]\u2014before dissipating near Lunyovo in Yaroslavl Oblast.

The population was 2,164 at the 2010 census, a 2.8 percent decline from the figure of 2,227 recorded in 2000.[4] Developed as a railroad station in an agricultural area in the late 19th century, the small town is notable for its proximity to the Spiro Mounds. This is a Mississippian culture center that was active from about 900 to 1450 CE that was part of a culture in Eastern Oklahoma and Western Arkansas. Today, the 80-acre site with several earthwork mounds is preserved as Oklahoma's only State Archeological Park and one of North America's most important archaeological sites. It is the westernmost site of the expansive Mississippian culture, which had associated centers through the Mississippi and tributary river valleys."

        "content": "In 1895 and 1896, the Kansas City, Pittsburg and Gulf Railroad (later owned by the Kansas City Southern Railroad) established a station at the present site of Spiro, which connected the area to the city of Fort Smith, Arkansas. This railroad access attracted residents from the nearby town of Skullyville, and Spiro soon developed as the principal town in this area. The town population was 543 in 1900.[5] A post office was established at Spiro, Indian Territory on September 21, 1898.[6]  At the time of its founding, Spiro was located in Skullyville County, a part of the Moshulatubbee District of the Choctaw Nation.[7] Several accounts differ as to how the post office was named. One claims that Spiro was the maiden name of the first postmistress. Another claims it was the maiden name of the mother of a Fort Smith banker.  According to the Oklahoma Historical Society, Spiro was named after Celia Spiro, wife of an Oklahoma banker, Iser H Nakdimen. He founded the City National Bank in Ft. Smith, Arkansas and the First National Bank in Muldrow, Oklahoma.[8] Cotton was an important cash crop. In 1901, Spiro had three cotton yards and one cotton gin. By 1910, there were three cotton gins and the population had grown to 1,173. As cotton cultivation became more mechanized, labor needs declined. The Great Depression of the 1930s took the heart out of the market. Timber harvesting and processing and livestock became important industries in the region. The population declined to 969 in 1930, as agricultural workers migrated to other areas for jobs. It rebounded to 1,365 by 1950 as the economy grew.[5] On March 26, 1976, the town was struck by an F5 tornado, the highest level on the Fujita scale, resulting in two deaths.[9] The town was again hit by a tornado on April 21, 1996 as the storm moved across the Sunset Corners area and eastward through the town center, however the storm resulted in no deaths in Spiro although 4 people were killed as the storm moved into Arkansas."

The tornado destroyed virtually every house and business building in the community, but all residents survived. The tornado was accompanied by an F-3 anticyclonic tornado two miles to the southeast.  One unusual aspect of the F5 cyclonic tornado and F3 anticyclone tornado was the simultaneous right turn made by each.[7]  Dr. Ted Fujita, the originator of the Fujita tornado intensity scale, said the tornado which hit Jordan was one of the most intense and destructive he had ever studied.[8]"

The tornado began southwest of the small town of Luther, Iowa a little before 3:30 pm and moved north northeast. The tornado strengthened and grew larger (at some points, more than a mile wide) as it approached US 30 just east of the intersection of IA 17. The tornado turned toward the north with the small hamlet of Jordan, Iowa in the path. A small satellite F3 tornado formed on the southwest side of the main tornado and moved around the back side and to the east of the tornado around 3:40 pm before merging back with the parent storm north of Jordan by 3:50 pm. The small hamlet of Jordan was raked by the half-mile wide F5 tornado, destroying nearly everything in its wake. The parent tornado turned north-northwest before encountering outflow from a storm to its northwest, pushing it in an ESE direction. An anticyclonic tornado formed to the east of the parent tornado and it went to the north following the parent storm about two miles to its east. It too felt the downburst winds from the northwest and was pushed to the east as well. The parent tornado began to shrink and weaken as it approached the Boone and Story County line northwest of Ames, lifting about four miles west of Gilbert, Iowa at 4:15 pm, but the storm was not through yet. The downburst winds that had pushed the tornado to the east were now rampaging the countryside in northern Story County around Gilbert northeastward to Story City, Iowa where more houses and farmsteads were damaged or destroyed by the strong straight line winds, although there were no deaths and only a few injuries. More than 60 homes, and over 300 farm buildings were hit and destroyed by the family of tornadoes and the downburst winds that followed.[1] Theodore Fujita (creator of the Fujita Scale) said the damage was most likely the most severe and extreme he had ever examined and also one of the most rare, referring to the anticyclonic F3 tornado that accompanied and mimicked the F5 tornado from the parent storm. At same time of the supercell that produced the Jordan tornado, another supercell formed, producing an F4 wedge tornado with a width of 800 yards (730\u00a0m) near Lemont, Illinois and causing two fatalities and 23 injuries.

It was the sixteenth named storm and the sixth typhoon of the annual typhoon season in 2016. Malakas formed on September 11, just south of Guam. The system gradually organized and improved its outer bands, which prompted JTWC to give its identifier as Tropical Depression 18W. A few hours later, JMA received its name Malakas for 18W. On September 13, Malakas entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility, which gained the name Gener by PAGASA. Despite its marginal conditions for further development, Malakas continued to intensify into a typhoon. On September 16, Malakas now on a very favorable development, which allowed the typhoon to upgrade into Category-2. After maintaining its intensity, Malakas intensified into a Category-4 typhoon as well-defined eye circulation popped out. Shortly after it reached its peak intensity, Malakas started to gradually weaken, downgraded back to Category-2 typhoon. However, Malakas gained strength again and attained to Category-3 major typhoon before it made landfall on \u014csumi Peninsula in Japan.

The JMA had 10-minute sustained winds of 175\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph) on midnight of September 17.[15] Shortly thereafter, its eye became cloud-filled and ragged and weakened to a Category 3 typhoon.[16] Later in that same day, Malakas further weakened to a Category 2 as satellite imagery depicted warming cloud tops, decreasing convection and SSTs of only around 28\u00a0\u00b0C (82\u00a0\u00b0F).[17] However, by September 18, Malakas started to re-intensify as it moved east-northeastward.[18] Malakas reached its secondary peak intensity on September 19, but only as a Category 3 typhoon.[19] Malakas then started to weaken due to land interaction with Japan.[20] On September 20, the JTWC downgraded Malakas to a tropical storm,[21] while the JMA downgraded it to a severe tropical storm,[22] because at around 00:00 JST on September 20 (15:00 UTC on September 19), Malakas made landfall over the \u014csumi Peninsula in Japan.[23] It subsequently crossed Cape Muroto at around 11:00 JST (02:00 UTC) and made landfall over Tanabe at around 13:30 JST (04:30 UTC).[24][25] Both agencies issued their final advisory later that day as it became extratropical.[26][27]"

        "content": "The Hohokam lived in this area and built canals to support their agriculture. They abandoned their settlements during the 15th century, with a few individuals and families remaining nearby. Fort McDowell was established approximately 25\u00a0mi (40\u00a0km) northeast of present downtown Tempe on the upper Salt River in 1865 allowing for new towns to be built farther down the Salt River. US military service members and Hispanic workers were hired to grow food and animal feed to supply the fort, and less than a year later, had set up small camps near the river that were the first permanent communities in the Valley after the fall of the Hohokam. (Phoenix was settled shortly afterward, by 1867\u201368.) The two settlements were 'Hayden's Ferry', named after a ferry service operated by Charles T. Hayden, and 'San Pablo', and were located west and east of Hayden Butte respectively. The ferry became the key river crossing in the area. The Tempe Irrigating Canal Company was soon established by William Kirkland and James McKinney to provide water for alfalfa, wheat, barley, oats, and cotton. Pioneer Darrell Duppa is credited with suggesting Tempe's name, adopted in 1879, after comparing the Salt River valley near a 300-foot (91\u00a0m)-tall butte, to the Vale of Tempe near Mount Olympus in Greece.[5] From its founding in 1871 until 90 years later, Tempe was a sundown town where African Americans were permitted to work but forced to live elsewhere.[6] In 1965, Warren and Carol Livingston were the first African Americans to buy property in Tempe.[7] In 1885, the 13th Arizona Territorial Legislature chose Tempe for the site of the Territorial Normal School, which became Arizona Normal School, Arizona State Teachers College, Arizona State College and finally Arizona State University. The Maricopa and Phoenix Railroad, built in 1887, crossed the Salt River at Tempe, linking the town to the nation's growing transportation system. The Tempe Land and Improvement Company was formed to sell lots in the booming town. Tempe became an economic hub for the surrounding agricultural area. The Maricopa County Board of Supervisors incorporated the town of Tempe in 1894.[8] The completion of Roosevelt Dam in 1911 guaranteed enough water to meet the growing needs of Valley farmers. On his way to dedicate the dam, former President Theodore Roosevelt applauded the accomplishments of the people of central Arizona and predicted that their towns would be prosperous cities in the future. Less than a year later, Arizona was admitted as the 48th state,[9] and the Salt River Valley continued to develop.[citation needed] On August 30, 1971, Tempe was hit by a rare F2 tornado that injured 41 people, the most injuries recorded from a tornado in Arizona, and caused damage in upwards of $3 million. One indirect fatality occurred when a man died from a heart attack during the storm.[10][11] In the 20th and 21st centuries, Tempe has expanded as a suburb of Phoenix, and as a center of education and commerce."

Due to this as well as being the home of the main campus of Arizona State University, Tempe has a fairly dense, urbanized development pattern in the northern part of the city especially in relation to the Valley Metro Line . Going south, development becomes less dense, consisting of single-family homes, strip malls and lower-density office parks. The Salt River runs west through the northern part of Tempe; part of the river is dammed in two places to create Tempe Town Lake. According to the United States Census Bureau, the landlocked city has a total area of 40.2 square miles (104\u00a0km2), of which 40.1 square miles (104\u00a0km2)  is land and 0.1 square miles (0.26\u00a0km2)  is water. The total area is 0.32% water, including Tempe Town Lake. The city of Tempe is bordered by Mesa to the east, Scottsdale and the Salt River Pima\u2013Maricopa Indian Community to the north, Phoenix and Guadalupe to the west, and Chandler to the south. Tempe is generally flat, except for Tempe Butte or Hayden Butte (generally known as A-Mountain for Arizona State University's \"A\" logo located on its south face), located next to Sun Devil Stadium, Twin Buttes and Bell Butte on the western edge of Tempe, and the buttes within Papago Park at northwest corner of Tempe.

It then began hosting the Insight Bowl which is now known as the Guaranteed Rate Bowl. As of 2018, there is no bowl game in Tempe because of renovations to Sun Devil Stadium. Edward Jones Investments and State Farm Insurance have regional headquarters in Tempe.[23] Tempe houses several performance venues including Gammage Auditorium and the Tempe Center for the Arts. Tempe Town Lake is home to many national and international events, such as Ironman Arizona and Rock n Roll Marathon. Gammage Auditorium was also the site of one of the three Presidential debates in 2004, and Super Bowl XXX was played at Sun Devil Stadium. Additionally, Tempe is the spring training host city of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. One of Arizona's largest shopping malls, Arizona Mills, sits near the border with the town of Guadalupe. The city is the location of the first IKEA branch in Arizona, also near the southern boundary. Tempe Marketplace, a large open air mall featuring live music and water and laser shows, is located just southeast of Tempe Town Lake. Tempe can boast an array of wholesalers and manufacturers. Mill Avenue, located just west of Hayden Butte, is a shopping and entertainment area in the city popular with pedestrians and students.

Most of the information known about this tornado came from a detailed 77-paragraph study by German scientist Gottlob Burchard Genzmer, which was published one year after the tornado occurred.[5][6] The tornado completely destroyed several structures, and several tree branches reportedly thrown into the atmosphere. Many areas were covered with up to 2 centimetres (0.8\u00a0in) of ice.[4] The storm which produced the violent tornado was dry, with almost no rain reported. Large hail, reportedly reaching 15 centimetres (6\u00a0in) in diameter covered the ground. The hail caused significant crop and property damage, killed dozens of animals, and injured multiple people in a large stretch around the tornado and to the northwest of the tornado's path."

        "content": "The tornado touched down at F2 intensity about 1.5 kilometres (0.9\u00a0mi) southwest of Feldberg, and began uprooting oak and beech trees. It escalated into F2\u2013F3 intensity, throwing two children, who survived, into a lake. Around this time, several geese were \"smashed\" by hail, and the tornado grew to a width of about 100 metres (110\u00a0yd). Continuing northeast, the tornado crossed a lake and was spotted by a person, who described it as a \"wedge tornado\". The witness said the lake's water rose and then retreated around the time of the tornado. After crossing the lake, the tornado blew the roof and walls off a home. This is where the only fatality from the tornado occurred.[4] The tornado shifted east-northeast and narrowed to a width of 45 metres (49\u00a0yd). As it reached its smallest width, still maintaining F3 intensity, a possible twin or satellite waterspout merged with it along the shore of Lake Luzin. Immediately after, the tornado changed direction to almost due north and intensified to F3\u2013F4 intensity as it destroyed a beech timber forest. It then widened to 225 metres (246\u00a0yd), snapped and uprooted several solitary oak trees, throwing them 35 metres (38\u00a0yd) into the air. Soil drifting, known today as ground scouring, occurred at this time. Crops, grass and 10 centimetres (4\u00a0in) of topsoil were removed. The tornado then turned northeast, where it destroyed Lichtenberg Forest.[4] The tornado intensified, tearing the bark from an oak tree at F4 intensity and soon after reached its peak intensity. A mansion with an adjacent dairy farm was destroyed except for the ground floor. Oak tree stubs were ripped out of the ground, and cobblestones weighing 75 kilograms (165\u00a0lb) were thrown.[4] The European Severe Storms Laboratory said damage at the mansion warranted a rating of F5/T11 with estimated windspeeds of at least 480\u00a0km/h (300\u00a0mph).[3][4][1] A witness described the experience as being \"surrounded by birds trapped in the vortex\".[4] After destroying the mansion, the tornado quickly weakened to F1 and left a 500-metre (550\u00a0yd) wide path of light damage in a forest.[4] The tornado soon intensified again as it struck Rothe Kirche and uprooted an old oak tree, which lifted a skeleton out of a grave at F3 intensity. Around this time, the tornado reached its maximum width of 900 metres (980\u00a0yd) and caused severe damage to an oak and beech forest. The tornado then continued northeast, passing just west of Woldegk, near the settlement of Canzow, where it damaged a mansion, tore apart two barns, and overturned seven dung carts at F2\u2013F3 intensity. Further to the northeast, the tornado caught a flock of geese in flight, killing some and injuring between 60 and 100 geese. Isolated tree damage was seen around this time as well. The tornado then struck Helpt at F2 intensity, where a mansion and another structure sustained roof damage, as well as the upper floor being removed from a gatehouse. After striking Helpt, the tornado dissipated.[4]"

An area of disturbed weather near the Philippines was first observed on November\u00a01. Following an increase in organization, the disturbance was designated as a tropical cyclone on November\u00a04. Moving west, Tess steadily strengthened due to favorable conditions aloft. During the evening of November\u00a05, Tess was estimated to have achieved its highest intensity, with winds of 115\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph). Rapid weakening then ensured as Tess neared Vietnam, and after making landfall in the country on November\u00a06, Tess dissipated the next day. Tropical Storm Tess and its precursor disturbance brought extensive flooding to much of the central Philippines. In Cebu, eight people were killed, and many homes and bridges were destroyed. The province of Palawan, a geographically isolated island from the rest of the country, suffered severe damage due to mudslides and flooding. There, 75\u00a0people were confirmed to have died, and 600\u00a0others were later presumed to have perished. In the suburbs of the capital city of Manila, 3,000\u00a0people were forced to flee their homes due to rising floodwaters. In all, there were a total of 686\u00a0deaths in the country. Nationwide, 144,136 people were evacuated to shelter, and 86\u00a0homes were destroyed, with 430\u00a0others receiving damage. Damage in the country totaled $11.38\u00a0million\u00a0(1988\u00a0USD). In addition to the impact on the Philippines, Tess killed 37\u00a0people and inflicted $11\u00a0million in damage in Vietnam."

        "content": "In what would later become the second of two tropical cyclones to form within the basin during November 1988,[1] an area of disturbed weather was first noted by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) early on November\u00a01.[2] Six hours later, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started following the system.[3][nb 1] The same day, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration also started to track the storm and assigned it with the local name Welpring.[5]\nOver the next three days, the disturbance tracked southwest while embedded within the northeasterly flow of the winter monsoon. After passing through the Visayas island group and emerging into the open water of the Sulu Sea, the system began to increase in organization. At 17:30\u00a0UTC on November\u00a03, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. At 00:00\u00a0UTC the next day, the JTWC classified the system as a tropical depression, citing satellite intensity estimates of 55\u00a0km/h (35\u00a0mph),[2] while the JMA upgraded it to tropical storm intensity.[6][nb 2] At this time, the tropical cyclone was centered 620\u00a0km (385\u00a0mi) south of Manila.[1] Almost immediately after the upgrades, the storm's track shifted from southwestward to westward in response to a trough weakening to the north; this also weakened the pressure gradient between the trough and a nearby ridge starting on November\u00a04. In turn, wind shear decreased and allowed the storm to intensify. Following an increase in satellite intensity estimates, the JTWC upgraded the depression into a tropical storm, and named it Tess, at 06:00\u00a0UTC. As the storm tracked over the South China Sea,[2] strengthening continued. On November\u00a05, the JMA upgraded Tess into a severe tropical storm.[3] At midday, the JTWC estimated that Tess attained typhoon intensity,[6] which was also its maximum intensity of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph).[2] At 18:00\u00a0UTC on November\u00a05, the JMA reported that Tess attained winds of 115\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph) and a barometric pressure of 975\u00a0mbar (30\u00a0inHg), its peak intensities in terms of both winds and pressure.[3] Data from the JTWC suggests the storm weakened rapidly as it approached Vietnam.[6][1] At 00:00\u00a0UTC on November\u00a06, the JTWC stopped tracking the system;[2] however, intensity estimates from the JMA had only decreased slightly during this time, and continued to classify Tess as a severe tropical storm.[3] Tess then moved across the Mekong River delta,[2] moving ashore midday about 240\u00a0km (150\u00a0mi) east-northeast of Ho Chi Minh City.[1] By early November\u00a07, the JMA stopped tracking the system.[3]"

On the island, the town of Rizal sustained the worst damage from the storm. There, 23 fatalities occurred. The island's north-south coastal road was covered in 7.5\u00a0ft (2.3\u00a0m) of water. By November\u00a010, 75\u00a0people were confirmed to have been killed throughout Palawan, with 600\u00a0others subsequently listed as missing by the Philippine Red Cross.[13] The missing were presumed dead by December 14.[14] In part because the water level was already 5.5\u00a0ft (1.7\u00a0m) above normal due to Ruby, Laguna Lake, situated on the southeastern side of the capital city of Manila, overflowed its banks.[15] This forced 3,000\u00a0people,[16] mainly in the suburbs of Pasig, Taguig and Pateros, to evacuate their homes.[17] Outside Palawan Island,[13] Tess only resulted in 11\u00a0fatalities only in the island chain, all due to flooding.[18] Nationwide, the storm was blamed for 686\u00a0deaths.[13][14][18] Additionally, 144,136\u00a0people or 28,824\u00a0families were evacuated to shelters as a result of the flooding. A total of 86 homes were destroyed and 430 others were damaged.[19] Furthermore, damage to private property totaled $7.58\u00a0million (1988 USD). In addition, the storm caused $3.8\u00a0million in damage to agriculture. Overall, the nation suffered $11.38\u00a0million damage due to the cyclone.[20][nb 3] Even though the storm had weakened drastically by this time, Tess killed 37\u00a0people in Vietnam,[1] destroyed thousands of homes,[21] and inflicted $11\u00a0million in damage.[1] Following Tess, Philippine President Corazon Aquino visited the provinces of Pangasinan and Pampanga, both situated to the north of Manila to tour damaged areas, distribute relief, aid and inaugurate an infrastructure project.[9] A mere few days after Tess, Typhoon Skip became the third cyclone to hit the archipelago in two weeks.[22]"

The 16th named storm of the 2002 Pacific typhoon season, Sinlaku formed on August\u00a027 northeast of the Northern Marianas Islands. After initially moving to the north, it began a generally westward motion that it maintained for the rest of its duration. Sinlaku strengthened into a typhoon and attained its peak winds on August\u00a031. Over the next few days, it fluctuated slightly in intensity while moving over or near the Ryukyu Islands. On September\u00a04, the typhoon's eye crossed over Okinawa. It dropped heavy rainfall and produced strong winds that left over 100,000\u00a0people without power. Damage on the island was estimated at $14.3\u00a0million.[nb 1] After affecting Okinawa, Sinlaku threatened northern Taiwan, which was previously affected by two deadly typhoons in the previous year. Officials enacted many preparations, although damage ended up being minimal on the island. Two people were killed on Taiwan, however. Sinlaku weakened slightly before making its final landfall in eastern China near Wenzhou on September\u00a07. There, the storm produced a record wind gust of 204\u00a0km/h (127\u00a0mph), and just south of the city, high waves destroyed several piers and a large boat. High rainfall and winds from Sinlaku destroyed 58,000\u00a0houses, and large areas of crops were destroyed. Damage in China was estimated at $709\u00a0million, and there were 28\u00a0deaths there."

        "content": "The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)[nb 2] began monitoring a tropical disturbance on August\u00a026, noting that an area of convection had an associated circulation. With favorable conditions, the agency assessed a fair potential for development.[2] On August\u00a027, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA)[nb 3] classified the system as tropical depression south of the Japanese island of Minamitorishima,[3] although the circulation was exposed from the convection. The next day, the JTWC initiated warnings on Tropical Depression 22W about 945\u00a0km (587\u00a0mi) northeast of Saipan, after the thunderstorms began wrapping into the center.[2] Initially, the depression moved generally northward through a weakness in the subtropical ridge,[2] strengthening into Tropical Storm Sinlaku on August\u00a029.[3] The building ridge, located east of Japan, gradually turned the storm westward.[4] As early as August\u00a029, the JTWC reported that an eye feature was beginning to develop.[2] After further intensification, Sinlaku strengthened, and the JMA upgraded it to a typhoon on August\u00a031;[3] the JTWC estimated Sinlaku attained typhoon status a day earlier.[4] Shortly after Sinlaku become a typhoon, the JMA estimated it attained peak 10\u00a0minute maximum sustained winds of 150\u00a0km/h (93\u00a0mph).[3] Also on August\u00a031, the JTWC estimated peak 1\u00a0minute winds of 205\u00a0km/h (127\u00a0mph).[4] On September\u00a01, Sinlaku began undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle, although cooler water temperatures caused by previous Typhoon Rusa prevented restrengthening.[2] The typhoon turned more to the west-northwest on September\u00a02, and without much change in intensity, it passed just south of Iwo Jima that day and very near the Japanese island of Minamidaitojima around 2130\u00a0UTC on September\u00a03. The next day, Sinlaku also passed just south of Okinawa Island,[3] although its large 110\u00a0km (68\u00a0mi) eye crossed over the southern portion of the island; the JTWC estimated the storm had winds of 175\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph) while passing near Okinawa.[4] A trough passing north of Sinlaku slowed the typhoon's westward movement. Dry air in the region,[2] and later increased wind shear caused a steady weakening trend. On September\u00a06, Sinlaku passed a short distance north of Taiwan,[4] and subsequently a west-northwest motion resumed.[2] The JMA downgraded the typhoon to a severe tropical storm on September\u00a07 in the East China Sea,[3] although the JTWC maintained it as a typhoon.[4] Around 1030\u00a0UTC that day, Sinlaku made landfall in east-central China near Wenzhou, a city near the border of Zhejiang and Fujian provinces.[2] The storm weakened while progressing inland, although its circulation remained well-defined until dissipating on September\u00a09.[3][4][2]"

        "content": "Typhoon Sinlaku first affected Iwo Jima, producing sustained winds of 131\u00a0km/h (81\u00a0mph), with gusts to 183\u00a0km/h (114\u00a0mph).[2] Residents on the small island of Minamidaitojima evacuated their homes to safer areas during the storm. Rainfall caused flooding on the island. Offshore Okinawa, a Philippine cargo ship went missing, prompting a rescue mission by the Japanese Coast Guard.[5] The crew was rescued a day later, and no one was injured.[6] Before affecting the island, officials on Okinawa canceled 150\u00a0airplane flights and halted bus service. Schools ended early,[7] and only essential personnel were reporting at Kadena Air Base.[8] While striking Okinawa, Sinlaku dropped heavy rainfall, peaking at 453\u00a0mm (17.8\u00a0in) at two locations. Rainfall spread northward through the Amami Islands, reaching 315\u00a0mm (12.4\u00a0in) at Yoronjima. The highest hourly precipitation total was 56\u00a0mm (2.2\u00a0in), recorded at Naha, Okinawa. Sinlaku produced winds as strong as 122\u00a0km/h (76\u00a0mph),[9] with gusts to 191\u00a0km/h (119\u00a0mph) on Okinawa. Gale-force winds affected the island for about 21\u00a0hours.[2] During its passage, the typhoon destroyed 11\u00a0houses and damaged 231\u00a0others, and 45\u00a0houses were flooded.[9] High winds knocked down power lines, which left 105,500\u00a0homes without electricity on Okinawa.[6] Sinlaku injured 31\u00a0people, four of them severely, but there were no deaths in Japan. Insured damage in Japan totaled $14.3\u00a0million (\u00a51.7\u00a0billion 2002\u00a0JPY).[nb 4][9] Sinlaku left about $3.6\u00a0million in damage to Kadena Air Base on Okinawa.[4] In Taiwan, the country's Central Weather Bureau issued storm warnings for coastal waters and for areas along the coast.[5] Premier Yu Shyi-kun ordered various government agencies fully prepare for the typhoon, including the activation of a disaster contingency system.[11] The typhoon caused the Taiwan Stock Exchange to close at its lowest level of the year,[12] before the exchange was closed during the storm's passage. Officials also closed schools and government buildings in Taipei, and flights between northern and southern Taiwan were canceled.[13] The typhoon caused a boat race to be delayed by one day.[14] Passing north of Taiwan, Sinlaku dropped about 100\u00a0mm (3.9\u00a0in) of rainfall in the capital city of Taipei.[15] A station in Ilan County reported a peak rainfall of 387\u00a0mm (15.2\u00a0in).[2] The high rainfall filled two reservoirs to capacity, both of which had low levels in the previous month.[16] The storm left 200\u00a0houses without water,[4] and in Taoyuan County (now Taoyuan City), 700\u00a0houses lost power.[17] Storm damage forced about 1,500\u00a0people to evacuate their houses.[18] High waves lashed the island's northern coast, forcing hundreds of boats to remain at port.[13] This included thousands of Chinese fishermen who stayed in special shelters, which represented a change in policy; in previous storms Taiwan officials did not allow Chinese fishermen to stay for fear of Chinese emigration to the island.[17] Sinlaku killed two people, one who was swept away by high surf along Taiwan's east coast. However, damage was minor on the island, limited to downed tree branches in Taipei.[15][19] After the storm, Taiwan residents complained that meteorologists overemphasized the threat of the storm, which was due to heavy damage from typhoons Nari and Toraji.[20] The threat of Typhoon Sinlaku prompted 640,000\u00a0people in eastern China to evacuate,[2] including 48,000\u00a0people near Wenzhou who worked on aquaculture farms. About 100,000\u00a0troops were put on standby before the storm struck to assist in its aftermath.[21] Eight flights were canceled due to the storm.[22] Upon making landfall, the typhoon dropped heavy rainfall along its path, including a 24\u2011hour total of 215\u00a0mm (8.5\u00a0in) where it moved ashore. Several cities reported over 100\u00a0mm (3.9\u00a0in) in a 12\u2011hour period.[2] The rainfall caused the Huangpu River to rise to above-normal levels, which prompted officials to close 1,000\u00a0floodgates to prevent flooding in Shanghai.[23] In Wenzhou, Sinlaku produced a peak wind gust of 204\u00a0km/h (127\u00a0mph), which was the highest gust in the city on record.[2] High waves just south of the city, estimated at 16.2\u00a0m (53\u00a0ft), wrecked five fishing piers and a large boat.[24] Typhoon-force wind gusts were observed along the coast of Fujian and Zhejiang provinces. About 58,000\u00a0houses were damaged or destroyed in the two provinces;[2] this included 3,800\u00a0destroyed houses in Wenzhou where the storm struck.[25] The high winds downed trees onto power lines, leaving areas without power. About 97,000 hectares (240,000 acres) of crop fields were wrecked. Many schools and businesses were closed during the storm.[15] Overall damage was estimated at $709\u00a0million (\u00a55.88\u00a0billion 2002\u00a0CNY),[nb 5][2] and there were 28\u00a0deaths in the country;[15] most of the deaths were caused by collapsing houses.[26] Officials distributed food and thousands of tents and blankets to residents who lost their homes.[27]"

Forming as a tropical depression on September\u00a03 to the southeast of Guam, Fran steadily intensified as it moved along a general northwest track. After brushing Guam two days later, the system achieved typhoon status on September\u00a06 after the formation of an eye. A period of explosive intensification ensued thereafter and Fran reached its peak as a Category\u00a04-equivalent typhoon with winds of 240\u00a0km/h (150\u00a0mph) the following day. Gradual weakening began on September\u00a08 as it neared the Ryukyu Islands, and the system subsequently meandered near the islands for two days before striking Kyushu on September\u00a012. It then moved over the Sea of Japan where it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and ultimately dissipated on September\u00a016. Regarded as the worst typhoon in ten years, nearly a week of continuous rains caused disastrous flooding and landslides across Japan. Accumulations peaked at 2,781\u00a0mm (109.5\u00a0in) in Hiso, Tokushima. More than 325,000\u00a0people were forced to evacuate their homes and transportation was crippled. Nearly half a million homes were damaged or destroyed, leaving 300,000\u00a0people homeless. Many residents required rooftop rescue by helicopter. All told, the typhoon killed 169\u00a0people and left at least US$660\u00a0million in damage throughout its path."

        "content": "In early September\u00a01976, an area of convection was identified within a monsoon trough to the northeast of Pohnpei. Traveling west, the system gradually developed and was classified as a tropical depression\u2014the seventeenth of the season\u2014at 12:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a03 by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC).[1][note 1] At this time, the depression was located roughly 795\u00a0km (494\u00a0mi) southeast of Guam.[3] Situated near a weakness in a subtropical ridge (located south of Japan), the incipient depression turned northwest and gained strength. Aircraft reconnaissance found the system to have achieved tropical storm status by 03:39\u00a0UTC the next day, measuring a central pressure of 997\u00a0hPa (mbar; 29.44\u00a0inHg). At this time, the system was assigned the name Fran. On September\u00a05, Fran brushed the Mariana Islands to the southwest, passing 35\u00a0km (22\u00a0mi) west of Guam. Intensification began in earnest on September\u00a06 as a 55\u00a0km (34\u00a0mi) wide eye developed, signaling Fran's rise to typhoon status. Upper-level conditions, including two anticyclones to the north and east, temporarily hindered additional strengthening by suppressing the typhoon's outflow.[1] During the latter part of September\u00a06, the aforementioned hindering features quickly subsided, allowing for ample ventilation of the storm and enabled a period of explosive intensification. Aided by a shortwave trough over central China, Fran's outflow dramatically improved. In a roughly 24-hour span from September\u00a06\u20137, Fran's central pressure plummeted from 977\u00a0hPa (mbar; 28.85\u00a0inHg) to 916\u00a0hPa (27.05\u00a0inHg). This included a drop of 43\u00a0hPa (mbar; 1.27\u00a0inHg) in 12\u00a0hours.[1] Fran achieved its peak maximum sustained winds of 240\u00a0km/h (150\u00a0mph) at 12:00\u00a0UTC,[note 2] classifying it as a Category\u00a04-equivalent on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale.[3] The storm also entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility around this time, prompting PAGASA to assign it with the local name Reming.[5] A subsequent reanalysis, though not yet integrated into JTWC's official track, determined Fran to have been slightly weaker with winds of 230\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph).[6] Though conditions remained highly favorable, Fran entered a near-steady state at this point with its pressure decreasingly slightly to its lowest observed value of 913\u00a0hPa (mbar; 26.96\u00a0inHg) at 21:09\u00a0UTC.[1] At this time, Fran was an unusually large cyclone with gale-force winds extending 485\u00a0mi (300\u00a0mi) from its center and an immense 13.4\u00b0 radius of outermost closed isobar.[4][6] The previously beneficial shortwave trough bypassed the typhoon on September\u00a08 and allowed for increased wind shear from an anticyclone to the west to impact Fran. This resulted in slow weakening of the storm. Rounding the edge of a separate trough, Fran also began a northward turn that directed it at the Ryukyu Islands of Japan.[1] Between 12:00 and 18:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a09, the eye of Fran passed between Okinoerabujima and Tokunoshima. Continual back and forth shifting of a trough north of the typhoon caused Fran to slow to a crawl by September\u00a010. For the next day, Fran moved erratically along the western edge of the Tokara Islands, southwest of Kyushu, all the while battering the region with torrential rain and damaging winds. A deepening trough over China pushed the weakening typhoon northeast on September\u00a011,[1] with Fran eventually making landfall over Nagasaki Prefecture between 12:00 and 18:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a012.[3] Winds up to 156\u00a0km/h (97\u00a0mph) were reported in Nagasaki City.[7] After losing typhoon strength, Fran emerged over the Sea of Japan where cooler waters spurred its transition into an extratropical cyclone by 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a013.[1] The remnant system continued northward, brushing Primorsky Krai, Russia, before turning back to the south.[8] On September\u00a014, multiple vessels encountered gale-force winds, with a ship by the call sign URPS reporting 111\u00a0km/h (69\u00a0mph) winds, and seas up to 9.4\u00a0m (31\u00a0ft). Winds gradually subsided as the storm weakened, and only two ships encountered gales on September\u00a015.[4] It ultimately dissipated over the Sea of Japan on September\u00a016.[8]"

Damage, if any, is unknown, though sustained winds of 56\u00a0km/h (35\u00a0mph) and gusts of 76\u00a0km/h (47\u00a0mph) were observed on Guam.[1] Prior to the arrival of Fran in the Ryukyu Islands, the United States Air Force relocated 30\u00a0aircraft from their base in Okinawa to bases in South Korea.[11] Officials stressed the nature of the evacuation as the movement of aircraft coincided with the end of a heightened alert period along the Korean DMZ following the death of two U.S. Army officers.[12] The typhoon's slow movement led to tremendous rainfall accumulations across parts of southeastern Japan,[13] with some areas seeing continuous rain for six days.[14] Multiple stations recorded over 1,000\u00a0mm (39\u00a0in) of rain,[13] primarily across Shikoku,[9] with a peak of 2,781\u00a0mm (109.5\u00a0in) in Hiso, Tokushima.[10] Of this, 1,140\u00a0mm (44.8\u00a0in) fell in a 24-hour span between September\u00a011\u201312, the highest such total on record in Japan.[15] However, sources differ on this total with some indicating the peak 24-hour total being 1,174\u00a0mm (46.2\u00a0in) in Fukuharaasahi,[16][failed verification] or 1,114\u00a0mm (43.9\u00a0in), which was observed in Kito.[17] Regardless of which total was valid, it remained the national record until August\u00a02004 when Typhoon Namtheun produced a 24-hour total of 1,317\u00a0mm (51.9\u00a0in) in Kisawa.[17] Significant totals across other prefectures include 1,392\u00a0mm (54.8\u00a0in) in Motoyama, K\u014dchi, 1,328\u00a0mm (52.3\u00a0in) in Uchinomi, Kagawa, 1,188\u00a0mm (46.8\u00a0in) on Mount Dainichi, and 1,184\u00a0mm (46.6\u00a0in) on Mount \u014cdaigahara.[13] Thousands of landslides caused considerable damage and killed at least 70\u00a0people.[14][18] More than 325,000\u00a0people evacuated across the nation.[7] An embankment along the Nagara River near Anpachi, Gifu, collapsed on September\u00a012 and forced thousands of residents from their homes. Many required evacuation by boat or helicopter.[19] A total of 11,193\u00a0homes were destroyed a further 442,317 sustained damage. Floods also affected 80,304 hectares (198,440 acres) of crops.[13] Tremendous damage to infrastructure paralyzed transportation in many areas,[20] and travel across the entire nation was disrupted for at least three days.[7] Hundreds of bridges were damaged or washed away.[20] Passing 110\u00a0km (68\u00a0mi) east of Okinawa, Fran produced sustained winds of 102\u00a0km/h (63\u00a0mph) with gusts to 135\u00a0km/h (84\u00a0mph) at Kadena Air Base.[1] Throughout Japan, 169\u00a0people died and 435\u00a0others were injured.[13] Property damage exceeded US$660\u00a0million,[21] and more than 300,000\u00a0people were rendered homeless.[21] Fran was regarded as the worst storm to strike Japan in 10\u00a0years when Typhoon Ida claimed more than 300\u00a0lives.[1][19] Offshore, the storms destructive winds and waves split the 52,157\u00a0ton oil tanker Ryoyo Maru in two over the Bungo Channel,[4] anchored near Beppu; all 62\u00a0crewmen were rescued safely.[22] Another ship, the 2,556\u00a0ton Panamanian freighter JCIS, ran aground in Minamata Bay. In Pohang, South Korea, the 23,089\u00a0ton British bulk carrier Eastern Freedom broke all its stern-side moorings, resulting in its propeller and rudder being damaged; a nearby Korean naval ship was also damaged. While over the Sea of Japan, Fran's extratropical remnants caused havoc among the Soviet fishing fleet. In all, 138\u00a0vessels sank or were damaged by the storm.[4] About 5,300\u00a0members of the Japan Self-Defense Forces were mobilized for relief efforts across the nation by September\u00a013. A rescue helicopter crashed over Mikawa Bay during a mission, resulting in three injuries. Many people were forced to wait on their roof overnight for rescue as floodwaters swept through towns.[20]"

Entering West Texas, the storms interacted with a warm front and began producing violent, long-lived tornado families. The storms likely began generating large hail and weak tornadoes over rural areas in New Mexico, but encountered few structures or observers then. Ahead of the storms, dew points reached the lower 60s \u00b0F as far north as Lubbock, Texas, and slowly moved northward, in tandem with the warm front, after sunset. Along with copious moisture, strong wind shear was present at this time; these factors, as well as a robust shortwave trough, favored strong tornadoes overnight. Supercells largely paralleled the warm front all night long, coinciding with thick fog that obscured the tornadoes.[2]"

The tornadoes damaged a 20-mile-long (32\u00a0km) swath, crushing a pickup truck and killing a few of its occupants, while destroying eight\u00a0homes nearby, injuring seven\u00a0people, and doing $750,000\u00a0in losses. The tornadoes also wrecked many outbuildings and barns. One\u00a0of the tornadoes subsequently passed through Plainview, causing 40\u00a0injuries and $41\u20442\u00a0million in damage there. Initially seen by storm spotters southwest of town, the tornado touched down at the Plainview Country Club, skipping east as it downed power lines, trees, and some buildings. Turning northeast, the tornado intermittently damaged tall structures in a 400-to-600-yard-wide (370 to 550\u00a0m) swath through town. The tornado produced continuous damage as it hit Seth Ward, leveling \"almost everything\" in a three-to-six-block-wide swath. East of Claytonville the tornado leveled a few rural homes, one\u00a0of which it swept away, killing a couple inside and leaving behind some concrete blocks on its foundation. Near Claytonville, the tornado cut a continuous, 20-mile-long (32\u00a0km), 300-to-400-yard-wide (270 to 370\u00a0m) path. Rural losses reached $445,000, and 70\u00a0cattle were killed or injured. In southeastern Silverton, the tornado killed a 14-year-old girl and destroyed eight\u00a0homes. Damages reached $11\u20442\u00a0million, half of which was to a large grain elevator. Two\u00a050-foot-tall (15\u00a0m) tanks were carried 1\u20444\u00a0mi (0.40\u00a0km), and a 1,500,000-US-bushel (53,000,000\u00a0L) tank was moved 50\u00a0ft (15\u00a0m). The final damage, rated F3, occurred near Hedley as a farmhouse and barns were destroyed, resulting in a loss of $35,000. The last 22\u00a0mi (35\u00a0km) of the path may have been related to a separate member of the tornado family and included a few unrecorded injuries.[52]"

The tornado also badly damaged agricultural equipment, downed fences, and splintered power poles. Heading northeast at 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h), the tornado produced a continuous path 26\u00a0mi (42\u00a0km) long and 1\u20442\u00a0mi (0.80\u00a0km) in width before lifting and possibly reforming as a new tornado.

After passing near White Deer, this or a related tornado then cut a broken, 5-to-7-mile-long (8.0 to 11.3\u00a0km), 100-yard-wide (91\u00a0m) swath across southeastern Pampa at F2 intensity, unroofing or severely damaging 20\u00a0homes and wrecking many trailers. The tornado also damaged municipal buildings in Pampa, and caused losses of $11\u20442\u00a0million there, along with 10\u00a0injuries. Its damage in town, though substantial, was spasmodic, however. The tornado finally ended in a rural area near Hoover; despite its longevity, it only produced F4 damage at the start of its trek.[53]"

Forming northeast of Tulia, it first caused $100,000\u00a0in damage to ranches and farms, injuring or killing 85\u00a0cattle. After impacting remote countryside for some time, the tornado then leveled a home on each side of U.S. Route 287, west-northwest of Clarendon, badly injuring a woman and killing her husband.

In addition, it blew a trailer off its foundation, wrecked a barn, destroyed a CMU print shop, downed trees, and slightly uplifted a school auditorium roof. Losses in the Ripley area totaled $50,000, and F2-level damage was noted. The tornado may have lifted and reformed into a new tornado before touching down in southern Corinth, cutting a 3-mile-long (4.8\u00a0km) swath through a densely-inhabited section of town. The main damage was concentrated in three\u00a0segments 200 to 250\u00a0yd (180 to 230\u00a0m) wide, with roof and tree damage between each segment.

However, the National Hurricane Center did not issue their first advisory on the system until its intensity was confirmed by a reconnaissance aircraft on August\u00a030. Turning slightly northward, Christine gradually intensified, attaining its peak strength on September\u00a02. At that time, the storm had winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 996\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.41\u00a0inHg), just below hurricane status. Shortly after, increasing wind shear caused the system to quickly weaken. By September\u00a04, Christine had been downgraded to a tropical depression as it tracked through the Leeward Islands. After degenerating into a tropical wave, the cyclone's remnants fully dissipated on September\u00a06. Although Christine had weakened to a tropical depression by the time it passed through the Leeward Islands, heavy rains from the storm, peaking at 11.74\u00a0in (298\u00a0mm), caused flooding in Puerto Rico. Over 600 homes were flooded and dozens of families had to be evacuated from several towns. One person died from electrocution after stepping on a downed wire on a flooded street. Minor damage was recorded in the Virgin Islands, mainly downed power lines which left roughly 500 people without telephone service."

        "content": "Tropical Storm Christine originated from a tropical wave over Africa in late-August.[1] As it neared the Atlantic Ocean, the wave spawned a tropical depression inland at 14.0\u00b0W, over the country of Guinea, on August\u00a025.[1] The formation of this depression was farther east than any other tropical cyclone on record in the Atlantic hurricane basin, although storms may have gone undetected prior to the start of satellite imagery in the 1960s.[citation needed] This was unlike most cyclone producing waves which travel several hundred miles over water before spawning a depression.[1] Tracking nearly due west, the depression moved over water several hours later and bypassed the Cape Verde Islands on August\u00a027.[1] The following day, the depression intensified into a tropical storm;[2] however, advisories were not issued by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) on the system until August\u00a030 because of the lack of reconnaissance aircraft data. It was determined that Christine had become a tropical storm by this time after receiving reports of gale-force winds from a German cargo ship in the vicinity of the storm.[1] The first advisory from the NHC came after a reconnaissance plane found sustained winds of 50\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h) and a barometric pressure of 1007\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.74\u00a0inHg). At that time, Christine was located roughly 1000\u00a0mi (1,500\u00a0km) east of Trinidad.[1] Although the storm was relatively disorganized by this point, satellite imagery showed large outer bands extending hundreds of miles (kilometres) from the storm.[3] By August\u00a031, the storm began to slow[4] and turn towards the west-northwest.[2] The NHC noted that they did not have a firm grip on the storm and were unsure of its future track and intensity.[4] Below average sea surface temperatures ahead of the system would hamper significant development.[5] Continuing on this track, Christine gradually intensified and on September\u00a02, the storm attained its peak intensity just below hurricane-status while situated roughly 300\u00a0mi (500\u00a0km) east of Guadeloupe.[1] At this time, a reconnaissance aircraft recorded[1] sustained winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 996\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.41\u00a0inHg).[2] Shortly after Christine attained this intensity, increasing wind shear caused the storm to weaken as it neared the Leeward Islands.[1][6] The NHC noted that a trough ahead of Christine would determine the future of the storm. This trough would either merge with the storm and allow significant intensification, or remain separate and cause Christine to dissipate.[7] By September\u00a03, the low-level circulation had been displaced from all convective activity[1] and Christine weakened to a tropical depression.[2] Several hours after weakening, the depression passed over Antigua with winds of 35\u00a0mph (55\u00a0km/h). The following day, the system degenerated into a tropical wave near the northeastern coast of the Dominican Republic. The remnants of Christine were monitored by the NHC for several days before dissipating near the trough on September\u00a06.[1][7]"

Later that day, the gale warnings were expanded southward to include islands north of Dominica. After Christine weakened to a tropical depression, the NHC discontinued all watches and warnings for the Leeward Islands.[1] Schools were closed in Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands as a precaution. Six scientists had to be evacuated from the small island of Aves once the storm posed a threat to them.[11] On St. Thomas, nine emergency shelters were opened, mainly in schools.[12] On September\u00a05, an emergency meeting was held by disaster officials in Puerto Rico about the threat of flooding from Christine. All residents were urged by government officials to have their disaster kits ready and be prepared to evacuate if told to do so. Firefighters, on and off-duty, were advised about the possibility of evacuations and would be pulled into work if needed.[13] As it passed through the Leeward Islands, Christine produced torrential rainfall, peaking at 11.74\u00a0in (298\u00a0mm) in eastern Puerto Rico. A maximum of 3.16\u00a0in (80\u00a0mm) also fell in the United States Virgin Islands.[14] Rainfall totals on other islands are unknown but are likely similar to those in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The precipitation led to flooding on several islands. One person was killed during the storm after being electrocuted by a downed power line on a flooded road.[1] Public works crews worked throughout the storm to keep roads clear; however, one road that was under construction became a \"sea of mud\" as crews could not clear the flood waters fast enough.[15] The towns of Yabucoa, Humacao, Maunabo, Las Piedras and Carolina sustained flood damage from the storm. In Yabucoa, 40 families were evacuated as 25 homes were damaged. The most substantial flooding took place in Humacao where 60 families were evacuated and 500 homes sustained damage. Six bridges, four sewer systems and 14 homes were damaged in Maunabo. An additional 21 people were evacuated from Las Piedras and 41 homes were damaged and in Carolinas, 23 more homes were damaged. Although there was extensive property damage, no monetary value is available.[5] Numerous calls were made to police in the United States Virgin Islands about downed power lines throughout the passage of the depression. High winds, gusting up to 40\u00a0mph (65\u00a0km/h) left roughly 500 people without telephone service on St. Croix.[16] No major damage was reported on any of the affected islands in the wake of Christine.[11] Residents in the drought-stricken regions of Florida were hoping for increased rainfall from the remnant wave of Christine;[17] however, the system did not reach the United States before dissipating.[1] The storm's remnants only produced squally weather in Florida on September\u00a07 and 8.[18]"

The storm came during a period of very cold temperatures across much of the United States, bringing frigid temperatures as far south as the Gulf Coast. The Weather Channel Unofficially named it Winter Storm Leon. The winter storm caused major impacts and severe travel issues in the states of Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi as many people were caught outside unexpectedly in the hazardous conditions, which included snow, freezing rain and sleet. Many travellers were stuck on highways for hours, some even requiring medical assistance due to being stuck. 180 people were injured by the storm and at least two were confirmed to have died in the winter storm."

The breakdown of the normal polar vortex around the North Pole allowed an outbreak of frigid Arctic air to penetrate well into the South. The cold wave traveled much further south than normal, such that when the precipitation arrived from the Gulf Coast winter storm, freezing temperatures were occurring all of the way down to the coast.[4] Despite the unusually far southward incursion of cold air, the storm took a somewhat more northward track than initially expected, much to the relief of some areas that were spared, and much to the surprise of others further north that had not paid attention to later changes in weather forecasts and corresponding winter storm warnings. On January 31, the weakened winter storm was absorbed into the circulation of another more powerful extratropical cyclone over the North Atlantic, while situated off the coast of South Carolina.[5]"

Bridges to barrier islands were also closed due to ice, and the almost total lack of deicing equipment and chemicals both for the Florida DOT and for local governments in all affected states, which had to rely entirely on sand spreaders retrofitted to dump trucks. Other states were able to move resources down from further up-state, however freeways and other state routes are generally the only roads which are treated by state governments. On the Atlantic coast, Jacksonville was completely spared, and in coastal Georgia the ice storm warning was lowered, leaving Savannah with only some sleet.

        "content": "The National Weather Service (NWS) had forecast the storm well in advance, as did meteorologists for local media and for national TV networks. For north and central Georgia, NWSFO Peachtree City first issued a winter storm watch well in advance of the storm, which included most of metro Atlanta except for the northernmost counties. On January 27, warnings were issued for the south metro area, while the central region (from east to west) was placed under a winter weather advisory.  Some took this to be a \"lowering\" from a storm watch, although this was not the case, since there is no separate precursor to an advisory (which indicates less than 2 inches (5\u00a0cm) in the case of snow), other than the same watch used as a precursor to a potential warning.  A source of some of the confusion was a tweet issued by the NWSFO in Peachtree City at 3:08 pm and repeated on the local news that read: \"Winter precip will make travel risky across GA midday Tues into Weds. Not a bad idea to stay off the roads if you're able!\". Many believed that the storm would not occur until midday and planned accordingly.[1] At 3:38 AM, on January 28, the winter storm warning was expanded northward, to include all except the northern exurbs.[1] Despite this coming more than two hours before school systems' 6 am deadline to call off classes and notify local media, and the fact that the previous advisory predicted plenty enough snow to make driving dangerous, and that prior releases noted the northward trend may require expansion of the warning, many superintendents, including those of Douglas County Schools, Cobb County Schools, Marietta City Schools, Fulton County Schools, DeKalb County Schools, Decatur City Schools, Cherokee County Schools, Paulding County School District and Gwinnett County Schools, failed to cancel school until it was too late. Some superintendents apologized, including those for Douglas and Atlanta, while Cobb superintendent Hinojosa refused to acknowledge his failure, and even went so far as to claim that he \"wouldn't have done anything different\", despite students being stuck on school buses for hours, and some having to spend the night in schools.[6] Even more students were stuck in Cherokee, a northern exurban county to which the warning was not extended until later in the morning, but still well before students were actually released. Gwinnett schools failed to release students early at all, and was spared only by the fact that the snow and dropping temperatures arrived slightly later on the northeast side of the metro. DeKalb schools staged buses outside schools, and thus had very few students stuck. South-metro counties correctly called off classes before they began, avoiding issues entirely. Buses became stuck not only due to slick roads, but even more so because traffic in metro Atlanta (except the east and southeast) quickly ground to a halt between noon and 1pm, as shown on TV by traffic-speed maps from GDOT's Georgia Navigator system. Complete gridlock ensued, preventing the area's few snowplows and other road-treatment vehicles from getting anywhere.[7] Tractor-trailer trucks became stuck on the Perimeter (Interstate 285), essentially closing the bypass route around the city. Other trucks, normally banned from inside the Perimeter except for local deliveries and pickups, then went through town and became stuck along with other traffic. At least three babies were born on the roads, including one delivered on I-285 by a Sandy Springs police officer who was having his own birthday that day,[8] and whose daughter was born when the Great Blizzard of 1993 hit Atlanta.  Another was born with nobody other than the mother present. Along with the Georgia State Patrol (GSP) and Highway Emergency Response Operator (HERO) units, the Georgia National Guard was called out to deliver supplies and rescue stranded motorists.  (One unit included Clark Howard, a GNG reservist who is well known as a consumer reporter for WSB-TV 2 and nationally for a daily radio show based at WSB AM 750.)  Cars blocking lanes of travel were towed, with most jurisdictions paying for towing to the road shoulder, or to a location where cars could be retrieved later (for example, the state towed cars from the west side of I-285 and I-20 to the West Lake MARTA station parking lot).  Cobb was the only county that was only offering reduced prices rather than free towing, despite being one of the counties that caused the problem by failing to pre-treat roads. Only MARTA rail continued to run, while MARTA buses and other bus systems had to halt service.[9] As a result of the snowy and icy conditions around Atlanta, the National Basketball Association decided to postpone a game between the Detroit Pistons and Atlanta Hawks.[10]"

At one point, a continuous string of winter storm warnings was draped across at least eight states from Texas to the Carolinas, a distance of over 1,000 miles (1,600\u00a0km).

However, Atlanta city limits only encompass about 10% of the nearly five million people in metro Atlanta (which is in turn about half of all Georgians).  The other 90% live in other cities or in unincorporated areas of counties.  With more than a dozen counties, each with multiple cities, very little intergovernmental cooperation occurs due to local politics, and there is no metropolitan government except for a weak planning agency.  Further complications are because commuting frequently occurs between suburbs rather than to the city and back, so that even if Atlanta were to act on its own, it would have little effect on the rest of the region. Additionally, Georgia public schools are organized under the Georgia Department of Education, thus school districts are not under local government control. State freeways are also outside the jurisdiction of local authorities, and the state did not even permit snow removal or other treatment of surface state routes until January 2011, when Atlanta was forced to wait two days to treat the heavy snow and freezing rain that had frozen solid together on the city's main street, Peachtree Street, since it is also a state route (9 and 141).  Therefore, the only thing that the mayor has legal or practical authority to do is to make sure that city streets are treated out to the city limits, and to encourage those businesses in the extended central business district to either let employees go earlier in a staggered and orderly fashion, or to keep them at home to begin with. To avoid future snows from becoming disasters, Mayor Reed has decided to hire an emergency manager for the city, in hopes of coordinating a more regional response, although it is unclear if suburban counties with a long-time antipathy toward the city will accept such an outreach.  Governor Deal is convening a Severe Weather Warning Task Force that includes local and state officials, as well as meteorologists from the National Weather Service, the locally headquartered Weather Channel, and from local TV stations, including Ken Cook with 40 years at WAGA-TV 5, and Chesley McNeil at WXIA-TV 11 since 2009, after coming from snowy Buffalo, New York."

Developing out of a poorly organized system on October\u00a08 to the east of the Philippines, Bess featured two centers of circulation. Initially the southern low was monitored; however, a low to the north soon became the dominant center. Tracking generally west-northwestward, the storm gradually intensified before striking northern Luzon as a minimal typhoon on October\u00a011. Temporary weakening took place due to interaction with land. After moving back over water the following morning, Bess regained typhoon intensity. This was short-lived though, as conditions surrounding the cyclone soon caused it to weaken. Now moving due west, the weakening storm eventually struck Hainan Island as a tropical storm on October\u00a012 before diminishing to a tropical depression. The depression briefly moved back over water before dissipating in northern Vietnam on October\u00a014. Bess produced heavy rains throughout the Philippines, especially in Luzon where 782.3\u00a0mm (30.80\u00a0in) was measured in Baguio. These rains triggered extensive flooding and landslides that killed 26\u00a0people and left 3\u00a0others missing. Many homes were destroyed and damage amounted to $9.2\u00a0million (1974\u00a0USD). On October\u00a012, a reconnaissance plane, with a crew of six, investigating the periphery of the storm went missing. It is presumed that the entire crew was lost when the aircraft crashed off the coast of Luzon. Though the center remained offshore, strong winds and high tides also impacted Hong Kong, causing minor flooding."

        "content": "On October\u00a06, 1974, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began monitoring a tropical disturbance several hundred miles southeast of Guam. Tracking quickly westward to west-northwestward in response to a strong subtropical ridge to the north, the system gradually organized, passing near Ulithi atoll on October\u00a07. Accompanied by a broad monsoonal flow, the disturbance featured multiple centers of circulation. On October\u00a08, it developed into a tropical depression and soon into a tropical storm, at which time it was assigned the name Bess. Early on October\u00a09, an aircraft reconnaissance mission into Bess revealed that a new dominant center of circulation had developed to the north of the original low. The southern low soon dissipated as the northern one became a tropical storm. The northern system retained the name Bess and is considered the same storm by the JTWC.[1] After the northern circulation became the dominant center on October\u00a09, a deepening trough in the westerlies caused a decrease in synoptic pressures, resulting in Bess' forward motion greatly decreasing.[1] Maintaining a west-northwesterly track, strong outflow developed, especially to the southwest of the circulation.[2] The storm eventually intensified into a typhoon on October\u00a010 as it approached the northern Philippines.[1] Due to the cyclone's proximity to the country, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Susang.[3] Later that day, Bess made landfall in northern Luzon, roughly 95\u00a0km (59\u00a0mi) south of Escarpada Point, with winds estimated at 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph). Though classified a minimal typhoon by the JTWC,[1] the Hong Kong Royal Observatory reported that reconnaissance planes had recorded surface winds of 140\u00a0km/h (87\u00a0mph) before the system moved ashore.[2] Inland, a barometric pressure of 976.9\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.85\u00a0inHg) was recorded in Tuguegarao as the typhoon passed 55\u00a0km (34\u00a0mi) to the north.[1] Due to the interaction with the high terrain of northern Luzon, Bess temporarily weakened to a tropical storm before regaining typhoon strength over the South China Sea during the afternoon of October\u00a011.[1] As the storm emerged back over water, satellite images revealed a relatively large system with clouds spanning an area 485\u00a0km (301\u00a0mi) in diameter.[2] Upon reintensifying, Bess turned due west in response to a dominating high-pressure area over Southern China. With a large difference in pressures between the two systems, a strong northeasterly flow developed between them.[1] This resulted in gale-force winds occurring up to 400\u00a0km (250\u00a0mi) from Bess's center.[2] During the evening of October\u00a012, the combined effects of a winter monsoon and entrainment of cool, dry air from mainland China began to weaken the system. By the following morning, Bess had weakened to tropical storm as it passed 305\u00a0km (190\u00a0mi) south of Hong Kong.[1][2] The system later struck Hainan Island with winds of 85\u00a0km/h (53\u00a0mph) before lessening to a tropical depression. The dissipating system emerged over the Gulf of Tonkin on October\u00a014 and ultimately dissipated as it began moving ashore in northern Vietnam later that day.[1]"

        "content": "Striking northern Luzon as a typhoon, Bess produced damaging winds and torrential rainfall across the region. Gusts peaked at 178\u00a0km/h (111\u00a0mph) in Aparri, Cagayan while Baguio experienced gusts of 150\u00a0km/h (93\u00a0mph).[1] Communication across the region was greatly disrupted as numerous power lines and trees were downed.[4] While much of the peninsula received 130 to 150\u00a0mm (5 to 6\u00a0in) of rain, a 24\u2011hour maxima of 782.3\u00a0mm (30.8\u00a0in) was reported in Baguio. The rainfall triggered widespread flash flooding and landslides, resulting in 26\u00a0fatalities and extensive damage.[1] One death took place in Baguio after a girl was buried in a landslide.[4] At least three other people were reported missing.[1] In a town roughly 805\u00a0km (500\u00a0mi) south of Manila, a landslide destroyed eight homes and a school.[5] Flood waters inundated four villages in the central Philippines.[5] The storm affected a total of 35,562\u00a0people, of which about 4,000 became homeless.[5][6] Total losses amounted to $9.2\u00a0million (1974\u00a0USD).[7] On October\u00a011, a level one warning signal was raised for Hong Kong, indicating that a tropical cyclone was approaching the region. This was soon raised to level three as strong winds were expected to affect the area. Although the center of Bess passed roughly 305\u00a0km (190\u00a0mi) south of Hong Kong, the pressure gradient between the tropical storm and high pressure to the north resulted in strong winds across the region. On Pratas Island, Taiwan (ROC), winds of 50 knots and a sea-level pressure of 987.2 millibars[2]:\u200a21\u200a were reported. In Hong Kong itself, winds reached 45\u00a0km/h (28\u00a0mph) and gusted to 85\u00a0km/h (53\u00a0mph). Gusts up to 113\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph) occurred on Tate's Cairn. In contrast to the unusually strong winds, Bess produced virtually no rainfall as it passed by, with only a trace of precipitation measured between October\u00a011 and 14 in Hong Kong. Along the coast, abnormally high tides combined with storm surge flooded low-lying areas of the city. Tides at Tai Po Kau reached 3.6\u00a0m (12\u00a0ft) with a surge of 1.5\u00a0m (4.9\u00a0ft). Sea water leaked into the city's underground sewage system and caused minor flooding in the area's western district. Some property damage was reported.[2] While over the South China Sea on October\u00a012, a United States Air Force WC-130H Hercules reconnaissance aircraft (call sign Swan 38),[8] with a crew of six, went missing while collecting data on the cyclone.[1][9] The plane took off from Clark Air Base during the night on October\u00a012 and made its final contact six hours later roughly 95\u00a0km (59\u00a0mi) north of Manila.[9] A rescue team of five Air Force aircraft and the USS White Plains was dispatched to look for survivors.[10] Search and rescue missions for the crew only found pieces of debris, such as an aircraft survival radio, soundproofing material, and orange cushion-like material.[9] All six crewmen were never found and are presumed dead.[11] Following the incident, the 53d Weather Reconnaissance Squadron established the Swan 38 Memorial Scholarship for outstanding students in the 403d Wing.[8] Because of the damage and loss of life caused by the storm, the name Bess was retired and replaced with Bonnie. However, when the list of typhoon names was changed to incorporate male names in 1979, the name was re-introduced to the roster. Coincidentally, it was again retired in 1982 when a powerful storm named Bess caused extensive damage and loss of life in Japan.[7]"

The twenty-second tropical or subtropical cyclone and twenty-first named storm of the extremely active and record-breaking 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, Alpha originated from a large non-tropical low that was first monitored by the National Hurricane Center on 15\u00a0September. Initially not anticipated to transition into a tropical cyclone, the low gradually tracked south-southeastward for several days with little development. By early on 17\u00a0September, the low had separated from its frontal features and exhibited sufficient organization to be classified as a subtropical cyclone, as it approached the Iberian Peninsula, becoming a subtropical storm around that time. Alpha then made landfall just south of Figueira da Foz, Portugal during the evening of 18\u00a0September, then rapidly weakened as it moved over the mountainous terrain of Northeastern Portugal. The system degenerated into a remnant low on 19\u00a0September, when it was last noted. At least two EF1\u00a0tornadoes were confirmed in Portugal, and one person was killed due to strong winds in Spain. Impacts from Alpha were rather minor as a subtropical cyclone, although Alpha produced some significant rainfall and gusty winds in both Portugal and Spain as a remnant low.[1][2] Total damages from the storm were estimated to be greater than \u20ac20 million (US$24.2 million), with a majority of the damage occurring in Portugal.[3][4]"

        "content": "Alpha originated from a large, extratropical low-pressure area, which developed over the Northeastern Atlantic Ocean on 14 September.[1] As a strong upper-level trough dug southeastward and became a cut-off low about 500\u00a0nmi (580\u00a0mi; 930\u00a0km) north of the Azores, the interaction between the low and a surface front promoted the formation of a strong frontal low, which rapidly deepened and reached its extratropical peak that day, with maximum 1-minute sustained winds as high as 112\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph) and a minimum central atmospheric pressure of 992\u00a0mbar (29.3\u00a0inHg).[1] By this time, the extratropical cyclone had a very large radius of gale-force winds expanding over 500\u00a0km (270\u00a0nmi; 310\u00a0mi) from its center of circulation.[1] The low was initially very slow-moving, but began to dip southeastward and weaken by 15 September when the National Hurricane Center (NHC) first began to monitor the system for possible development into a tropical or subtropical cyclone.[1][5] This was because the system was expected to track close to a region of unusually-warm sea surface temperatures to the west of Portugal of around 22\u00a0\u00b0C (72\u00a0\u00b0F), though these temperatures would still typically be too cold to support tropical cyclogenesis.[1] The size of the low's wind field continued gradually decreasing on 16 September, as some of its frontal features gradually became less defined, although the NHC only highlighted a low (20%) chance of development at this time, operationally.[1][6] Nonetheless, convection, or thunderstorm activity, became more concentrated and organized near the center of the low, and a newly formed central low soon became the dominant feature within the larger extratropical system.[7] In post-season analysis, the NHC estimated that Alpha had developed as a subtropical storm at 06:00\u00a0UTC on 17 September, as the thunderstorm activity associated with the smaller low feature became well-organized; in real time, advisories on the system did not begin until almost 35 hours later.[1] Alpha accelerated to the northeast, and a combination of radar imagery from Portugal, scatterometer passes, and satellite-derived wind data revealed Subtropical Storm Alpha had peaked around 00:00\u00a0UTC on 18 September, just about 417\u00a0km (225\u00a0nmi; 259\u00a0mi) off the coast of Portugal, while the storm was producing 1-minute sustained winds up to 80\u00a0km/h (50\u00a0mph).[1][8] Alpha maintained its intensity up to its landfall about 17\u00a0km (11\u00a0mi) south of Figueira da Foz, Portugal, around 18:40\u00a0UTC that day.[1] The storm's final minimum central pressure estimate of 996\u00a0mbar (29.4\u00a0inHg) was based on a surface pressure of 999\u00a0mbar (29.5\u00a0inHg) being recorded in Monte Real, Portugal, well north of the cyclone's landfall point.[9] After landfall, the small low-level circulation associated with Alpha began to quickly decay, as the storm moved inland, and the cyclone weakened to a subtropical depression at 0:00\u00a0UTC on 19 September.[1] Alpha degenerated into a remnant low later that day, as it moved over the mountainous terrain of Northeastern Portugal.[1]"

Of these reports, 143 were in Leiria District and 135 were in Lisbon District.[16] Alpha caused an estimated \u20ac20 million (US$24.2 million) in damage in Portugal before the region would later be hit by another significant storm, Windstorm Barbara, in late October.[3] In Spain, orange warnings were also raised by the State Meteorological Agency (AEMET) for the Spanish autonomous communities of Madrid, Extremadura, Aragon, and Catalonia as Alpha moved into Portugal late on 18 September, citing a risk of heavy rain, hail, and strong wind gusts.[17] Yellow alerts were also issued in Castile and Le\u00f3n and Castilla\u2013La Mancha.[17] Rain and windy conditions spread further inland into Spain, while the remnants moved eastward.[2] Castilla\u2013La Mancha's news agency reported that uprooted trees and minor floods had occurred in the community during Alpha, while several water rescues were carried out around midday of 19 September.[18] The fast-moving cluster of thunderstorms associated with the remnants of Alpha produced 38\u00a0mm (1.5\u00a0in) of rain in half an hour in Valencia before the remnants exited into the Mediterranean Sea.[19] Wind gusts of up to 94\u00a0km/h (58\u00a0mph) were reported in the town of Coria, C\u00e1ceres.[13] The remnants of Alpha caused a train with 25\u00a0passengers to derail in Madrid, although no one was seriously injured. A woman died in Calzadilla after the roof of a cattle shed collapsed on top of her.[20][1] Alpha also caused lightning on Ons Island, which led to an isolated forest fire.[20]"

        "content": "The tornado outbreak of February 28 \u2013 March 1, 2017 was a widespread and significant outbreak of tornadoes and severe weather that affected the Midwestern United States at the end of February 2017 and beginning of March. Fueled by the combination of ample instability, strong wind shear, and rich low-level moisture, the event led to 71 confirmed tornadoes and thousands of other non-tornadic severe weather reports. The most notable aspect of the outbreak was a long-tracked EF4 tornado\u2014the first violent tornado of 2017 and the first violent tornado during the month of February since the 2013 Hattiesburg tornado\u2014that tracked from Perryville, Missouri to near Christopher, Illinois, killing one person. Three EF3 tornadoes were recorded during the event, including one that caused two fatalities in Ottawa, Illinois, one that caused a fatality near Crossville, and one that heavily damaged or destroyed homes in and around Washburn. In addition to the deaths, 38 people were injured by tornadoes and an additional 30 were injured by non-tornadic impacts, mainly by fallen trees."

        "content": "The first indications of a severe weather event came on February\u00a024, when the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) issued a threat area across Arkansas and portions of the lower Mississippi Valley valid for February\u00a028.[1] The threat level was maintained for Arkansas and surrounding states in the subsequent outlook, while a new risk area was introduced from northern Louisiana to southwestern Kentucky valid for March\u00a01.[2] Despite significant variance among model guidance, the SPC issued a day 3 Enhanced risk over the Ozark Plateau into southeastern Missouri, encompassed by much broader Slight and Marginal risk areas.[3] The next day, an Enhanced risk was introduced portions of the Mid-South and Ohio River Valley in anticipation of a widespread damaging wind event on March\u00a01.[4] On February\u00a028, the SPC introduced a Moderate risk of severe weather across portions of eastern Missouri, central and southern Illinois, central and southern Indiana, into western and northern Kentucky. The organization warned of supercell thunderstorm development and the potential for \"nocturnal significant tornadoes.\"[5] As the storm system spread east on March\u00a01, a Moderate risk was briefly added across central Kentucky and middle Tennessee into the Cumberland Gap.[6] The setup for a widespread tornado outbreak came as a 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h) mid- to upper-level trough progressed eastward from the Great Basin and lower Colorado River Valley to the Mississippi Valley on February\u00a028. With large-scale height falls, three rounds of severe weather were expected to evolve across the Midwestern United States: elevated thunderstorms across northern Illinois early in the day, significant supercell development throughout the evening and overnight hours, and a quasi-linear convective system throughout the overnight hours into March\u00a01.[7] At the surface, an area of low pressure developed near the Missouri\u2013Iowa border and progressed into southern Michigan late on February\u00a028. A cold front, meanwhile, extended from the Plains to the Mississippi Valley, and a warm front lifted northward across Illinois. In the warm sector ahead of the cold front, rich low-level moisture surged northward, with dewpoints of 65\u201370\u00a0\u00b0F (18\u201321\u00a0\u00b0C) observed across Texas and Louisiana. Although a strong subtropical jet stream allowed a widespread cirrus plume to overspread the risk area, limiting surface heating in some locations, mid-level CAPE values were still expected to reach upward of 1500\u20132000\u00a0J/kg. Combined with ample moisture, steep mid-level lapse rates, and sufficient destabilization, effective bulk shear near or over 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h), was expected to yield storm relative helicity values in excess of 300\u2013400\u00a0m2/s2. However, the driving mechanism for convection across the risk area was still somewhat uncertain given the confluence of a weak capping inversion, warm-air advection, and negligible ascent.[8] The first signs of convective activity came around 19:45\u00a0UTC, when shallow cumulus development was observed across Arkansas.[9] A half hour later, at 20:15\u00a0UTC, the SPC issued their first tornado watch across portions of Kansas, Missouri, and Illinois, the first of many watches issued throughout the afternoon and overnight hours.[10] The first significant tornado touched down at 22:41\u00a0UTC, causing extensive damage along a path from Naplate to northwest of Marseilles, Illinois, most notably the city of Ottawa, with that tornado being rated EF3. There, two deaths were recorded and fourteen people were injured. Two other EF3 tornadoes were documented during the outbreak: one near Washburn, Illinois,[11] and the other from Crossville, Illinois to Oakland City, Indiana that caused one fatality as well that traveled 44 miles and was produced by the same supercell as the Perryville tornado. The strongest event was an EF4\u00a0tornado that traveled more than 50 miles (80\u00a0km) from Perryville, Missouri to southwest of Christopher, Illinois that killed one person, making it the first violent tornado of 2017, and the first since an EF4\u00a0tornado struck near Chapman, Kansas on May 25, 2016. In total, 72\u00a0tornadoes were confirmed during the outbreak. This outbreak would be followed by another outbreak which affected many of the same areas only 5\u00a0days later."

        "content": "The first EF4 tornado of 2017 began at 01:51\u00a0UTC on March\u00a01 (7:51\u00a0p.m. CST on February\u00a028) to the west of Perryville in Perry County, Missouri, where it snapped the trunks of several hardwood trees and caused EF1 damage to homes. An outbuilding was destroyed at EF2 intensity near the intersection of Country Road 810 and North Highway. The tornado then continued to the northeast and intensified at an exceptional rate, causing EF4 damage as it impacted a small subdivision of large homes on the west side of I-55. Multiple two-story homes along Kyle Lane were completely leveled. One person was killed in their vehicle as the tornado crossed I-55, and least a dozen cars were mangled and destroyed after being thrown 200\u2013300 yards (180\u2013270\u00a0m) from a nearby salvage yard. The tornado then moved across a series of open pastures before crossing US 61 and impacting the northwestern outskirts of Perryville at EF4 intensity. A residential subdivision along Moore Drive in this area sustained devastating damage, with many homes completely leveled, a few of which were swept clean from their foundations. Numerous trees in this area were snapped and denuded, and several vehicles were flipped and tossed. One home in this area was anchor-bolted to its foundation with its wall studs' toe-nailed at both the top and bottom and was completely swept away with only the basement left behind. Despite the high-quality construction, the overall context surrounding this home was not indicative of an intensity greater than mid-range EF4, and maximum winds along this segment of the path were estimated to have peaked at 180\u00a0mph (290\u00a0km/h).[97] The tornado weakened to high-end EF2 strength as it crossed Country Road 906, destroying a garage and collapsing the exterior walls of a residence. As the tornado continued through sparsely populated areas further to the northeast, it produced a mixture of EF2 and EF3 damage to homes. A few homes along this portion of the path were left with only a single interior room standing, and multiple outbuildings were destroyed. Large hay bales from one of the outbuildings were thrown up to 50 yards away. As the tornado crossed the Mississippi River into Illinois, trees along the riverbank were shredded and debarked. The tornado took on a multiple-vortex structure at this point, as evidenced by multiple distinct ground striations in nearby fields, and also attained its peak width of 0.6 miles (0.97\u00a0km). Once in Illinois, the tornado continued at EF2 strength as it passed south of Rockwood, snapping hundreds of trees and a few power poles. A house at the edge of the damage path sustained EF0 roof damage. Past Rockwood, the tornado tore through the Shawnee National Forest, downing thousands of trees at EF1 to EF2 strength as it continued to the northeast. EF1 and EF2 damage continued to the south of Ava, as numerous trees were snapped and uprooted and several outbuildings were completely destroyed. East of Ava, many trees, mobile homes, and frame homes sustained considerable damage, and additional outbuildings were destroyed as damage continued to range from EF1 to EF2 in intensity. The tornado then narrowly missed the town of Vergennes to the south, completely destroying a house at EF3 intensity. Outbuildings and large grain silos were destroyed, and trees and power poles were snapped just south of town as well.[97] Continuing northeastward past Vergennes, EF2 damage occurred as a small home was largely destroyed, power poles were snapped, outbuildings were destroyed, an antenna was bent, and a dump truck was flipped over. EF2 damage continued as the tornado clipped the northern fringes of Elkville, with multiple homes and outbuildings severely damaged or destroyed in that area. The Powerade Park baseball field complex was also damaged, and many trees were snapped. EF1 damage to trees was observed further to the northeast as the tornado traversed unpopulated swampy areas. The tornado passed south of Campbell Lake and then moved into Franklin County, where it dramatically re-intensified to high-end EF3 strength as it crossed IL 184. A farmhouse at this location was obliterated and swept cleanly away, with the debris shredded and scattered one mile (1.6\u00a0km) downwind. National Weather Service damage surveyors were unable to recover anything larger than a few wooden 2x4s and some pieces of siding downwind from the foundation. Nearby trees were snapped and denuded as well. Due to the intensity of the damage, the damage at this location was initially assigned an EF4 rating. However, further surveys revealed that the home was not attached to its cinder block foundation, and the rating was subsequently decreased to high-end EF3. Beyond this point, the tornado weakened to EF1 intensity and caused moderate damage to some homes and outbuildings before it lifted at 02:57\u00a0UTC (8:57\u00a0p.m. CST) to the southwest of Christopher. With a total path length of 53.47 miles (86.05\u00a0km), it was the longest-tracked tornado in the county warning area of the Paducah, Kentucky National Weather Service office in 36 years. In addition to the one fatality, twelve people were injured.[97][98]"

        "content": "A tornado touched down just northeast of Carmi in White County, Illinois at 03:54\u00a0UTC on March\u00a01 (9:54\u00a0p.m. CST), snapping the trunks of hardwood trees at EF1 strength. It rapidly intensified to EF3 strength farther to the east as it crossed IL 1, completely destroying a single-wide mobile home and rolling four to five vehicles. A residence was moved about 3 feet (1.0\u00a0yd) off its foundation, with a majority of its second floor swept away, a four-wheeler flipped upside down, a refrigerator tossed atop the rubble, and an associated garage completely destroyed. A small brick outbuilding nearby was severely damaged, a double-wide mobile home was obliterated, and several power poles were snapped in this area as well. The tornado then crossed 1675 East Street and North 1750 East Street, narrowly missing the city of Crossville to the south. EF3 damage was again inflicted to a residence that sustained major damage to its structure, had its garage destroyed, and had a vehicle rolled about 30 yards (27\u00a0m). Just past 1800 East Street, one small barn storing farm equipment was decimated while a larger outbuilding had its main support beams break loose from the concrete pads, forcing the roof beams to buckle. Damage to these structures was rated EF2. Another large barn nearby was severely damaged and a small brick outbuilding was destroyed, with damage to those structures rated EF1.[97] Farther along the path, the tornado re-intensified to EF3 strength as it crossed at the North 1935 East Road and East 1975 North Road intersection to the north of Phillipstown. The old part of a home, which had to be rebuilt after being hit by the 1925 Tri-State tornado, was destroyed while the newer part of the structure was damaged. A vehicle from this residence was thrown 30 yards (27\u00a0m). Several other structures in this area sustained EF2 damage, including a house that had its roof torn off, two double-wide mobile homes that were destroyed with nearby vehicles displaced, and an outbuilding that was completely destroyed. A house at the edge of the circulation had some of its metal roofing removed as well. The tornado continued towards the Wabash River, downing numerous trees at EF1 intensity as it moved through unpopulated areas.[97] In total, 35 structures were damaged in the county.[97] The tornado crossed the Wabash River into Posey County, Indiana and restrengthened to EF2 intensity, obliterating two metal barns. It veered east-southeast but quickly back east-northeast, causing severe damage to many hardwood trees along its path. Southeast of Griffin, a free-standing light pole was collapsed. The storm narrowed after crossing I-64, but continued to produce EF2 damage to a barn that was flattened. Along Pumpkin Run Road, multiple power poles were snapped, while along Murphy Road, a residence sustained damage to its roof. A nearby house was completely shifted off its foundation, with nearby hardwood trees snapped and uprooted. As the tornado passed north of Poseyville into Gibson County, wooden power poles were snapped and large amounts of debris was strewn throughout a treeline along SR 165. A pocket of EF3 damage was noted as a metal building was totally destroyed with its foundation swept clean. Cars at the structure were tossed 15 yards (14\u00a0m), 6x6 poles were snapped at the concrete, and two double-wide mobile homes were destroyed with their metal frames tossed 50\u201375 yards (46\u201369\u00a0m). An anchor-bolted frame home had one of its walls, its windows, and its stella doors blown out. Another nearby home had a large section of its roof ripped off, sustaining EF2 damage. Along South County Road 1075 West, EF2 damage continued as power poles were snapped, a mobile home was destroyed, and hundreds of trees were snapped and uprooted. Continuing northeast, a steel barn was destroyed and hundreds of additional trees were snapped. The tornado then produced another area of EF3 damage as it destroyed a brick home. The house had its roof ripped off, exterior walls collapsed, and had its attached garage destroyed. An occupant of this home was left trapped in the debris after the tornado and had to be dug out.[97] Farther along the path, the tornado weakened back to EF2 strength as a residence to the southeast of Owensville had its entire roof destroyed and sustained damage to its concrete block walls, while several nearby outbuildings were damaged. EF2 damage continued as it crossed SR 168 to the west of Fort Branch, tearing off large sections of roof from homes and crumpling large grain bins. The tornado weakened as it affected areas just north of Fort Branch, but still caused considerable high-end EF1 roof damage to several homes and downed many trees. To the northeast of Fort Branch, EF1 damage continued as homes sustained roof damage, including a brick home that lost about 1/4 of its roof. A metal building had part of its roof ripped off and walls pushed in along South County Road 550 East, while a final pocket of EF2 damage was noted farther along the path just west of I-69, where a barn was completely destroyed. The final observed damage was to a barn south of Oakland City that had half of its roof torn off and gable blown out at 04:45\u00a0UTC (10:45\u00a0p.m. CST), marking an end to the tornado's 44.6 miles (71.8\u00a0km) path. Damage to this last structure was rated EF1. In all, 106 structures were damaged in Gibson County, of which 33 suffered minimal damage, 26 suffered minor damage, 21 suffered major damage, and 26 were destroyed. One person was killed, and two others were injured by this tornado,[97] all in Illinois.[99]"

Chaba also caused 7 deaths in the country.[1] Typhoon Chaba was the eighteenth named storm and the eighth typhoon of the 2016 Pacific typhoon season. Chaba originated as a depression around the east-northeast of Guam. Being in a marginally favorable environment, JMA proceeds to name the system as Chaba. On September 28, JTWC gave its identifier as Tropical Depression 21W. Its LLCC starts to improve, prompting the JTWC to upgrade into a tropical storm. Chaba entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility, receiving the name Igme as it moved northwestwards. Chaba became more symmetrical which later ensued its rapid intensification. Chaba later reached the peak intensity of 1-minute sustained winds of 280 km/h (175 mph) and a central pressure of 911 hPa (26.90 inHg), equivalent to a Category-5 super typhoon. Shortly after this, Chaba began to weaken into a Category-4 typhoon as it moved over the Yellow Sea on October 4. At 10:00 a.m. KST (01:00 UTC), Chaba made landfall in Busan as a weakening Category-1 typhoon. Shortly after landfall, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone which prompted the JMA to issue its final advisory."

        "content": "On September 26, a tropical depression developed approximately 1,445\u00a0km (898\u00a0mi) east-northeast of Guam.[2] Despite a marginally favorable environment, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the system to a tropical storm and assigned it the name Chaba late the next day.[2][3] Early on September 28, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) gave the identifier of 21W.[4] Flaring convection and improved overall convective structure prompted the JTWC to upgrade it to a tropical storm.[5] By September 30, Chaba had intensified into a severe tropical storm after deep convection had evolved into a banding feature and very favorable conditions such as very low wind shear and sea surface temperatures (SSTs) of about 30 degrees Celsius.[6][7] On October 1, Chaba entered the Philippine area of responsibility, with PAGASA assigning the local name Igme, as it started to move in a northwestward direction.[8] Several hours later, both agencies upgraded Chaba to a typhoon after its organization and structure had vastly improved.[9][10] During the next day, Chaba became more symmetric as feeder bands wrapped into its deep central convection, signalling the onset of explosive intensification.[11] Continuing its strengthening trend, Chaba reached Category 5 super typhoon intensity with a sharp 5\u00a0nmi (9.3\u00a0km; 5.8\u00a0mi) wide eye surrounded by a very intense convective core due to very warm SSTs.[12] On October 3, Chaba reached its peak intensity with 10-minute sustained winds of 215\u00a0km/h (130\u00a0mph), 1-minute sustained winds of 280\u00a0km/h (175\u00a0mph), and a minimum central pressure of 905 mbar.[13] Thereafter, the JTWC stated that Chaba began weakening, as its core became asymmetric,[14] and Chaba weakened to a strong Category 4 typhoon by October 4.[15] Later, significant weakening led the JTWC to downgrade Chaba further to a Category 2 typhoon, due to interaction with strong north-northeasterly winds.[16] At 10:00\u00a0a.m. KST (01:00 UTC), Chaba struck Geojedo and then made landfall in Busan an hour later with winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph).[17] At that time, Chaba started to undergo extratropical transition and the JTWC issued its final advisory a few hours later, while downgrading the system to a tropical storm.[18][19] At the same time, the JMA downgraded Chaba to a severe tropical storm.[20] Six hours later, the JMA issued its final advisory, as Chaba became extratropical.[21]"

The storm originated in an area of convection that detached from a tropical depression over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico on June\u00a024. A new area of low pressure developed underneath the convection and the system began to intensify. Later that day, the storm had become sufficiently organized to be classified as a subtropical depression. Early on June\u00a025, it made landfall near Clearwater, Florida with winds of 50\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h) and later attained its peak intensity over eastern Florida with winds of 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h). After reemerging into the Atlantic Ocean, the system began to weaken as it underwent an extratropical transition. The storm ultimately dissipated off the coast of North Carolina early on June\u00a026. Despite its relatively weak strength, the system produced nearly 12\u00a0in (300\u00a0mm) of rain around Tampa, Florida, and the National Hurricane Center reported upwards of 20\u00a0in (510\u00a0mm) nearby. Around Lake Okeechobee, precipitation totals of 7\u00a0in (180\u00a0mm) were common. The heavy rainfall led to moderate flooding across the state. One tornado was confirmed to have touched down in association with the cyclone. Three people drowned as a result of the storm and damage amounted to $10 million (1974\u00a0USD, $61.8\u00a0million in 2009\u00a0USD)."

By June\u00a024, the depression began to weaken as it moved near the Mexican coastline, causing convective activity to move away from the center of circulation. Later that day, a new area of low pressure developed underneath the convection in the central Gulf of Mexico.[1] It continued to mature, and around 1800\u00a0UTC, the system had become sufficiently organized to be classified as a subtropical depression.[2] Although subtropical, the storm was operationally considered to be non-tropical,[3] but was reassessed in a post-season analysis of the system.[1] Upon becoming subtropical, the storm tracked rapidly towards the northeast at 24\u00a0mph (39\u00a0km/h). Early on June\u00a025, the depression intensified into a subtropical storm as it neared the Florida coastline.[2] Reconnaissance missions were flown into the storm until it made landfall near Clearwater, Florida with winds of 50\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h) during the morning of June\u00a025.[1][2] Although over land, the system continued to intensify as it moved through the Florida Peninsula.[1] Roughly six-hours after landfall, the storm attained its peak intensity with winds of 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h) and a barometric pressure of 1000\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.53\u00a0inHg).[2] Not long after attaining this intensity, the storm moved over the far western Atlantic Ocean and began to weaken. Later that day, it began to undergo an extratropical transition, acquiring frontal features and elongated convection. The storm completed this transition within 12\u00a0hours before becoming poorly defined and dissipating off the North Carolina coastline early on June\u00a026.[1][2]"

Several vessels became stranded in the storm, resulted in many Coast Guard rescues, many by towing the ships back to shore.[3] A tornado was reported near Fort Myers.[6] Additionally, two waterspouts touched down near Sarasota; however, both struck unpopulated areas and left no damage.[3] One of the two waterspouts was later confirmed as an F0 tornado with a track length of roughly 1\u00a0mi (1.6\u00a0km).[7] Beach erosion was common along many beaches in southeastern states.[8] The most significant erosion took place between Cedar Key and Naples where coastal flooding was reported.[9] After moving through Florida, the subtropical storm brought gusty winds and light to moderate rainfall to Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina.[8] Throughout Florida, three people were killed by the storm from drowning and floods left roughly $10 million (1974\u00a0USD, $61.8\u00a0million in 2009\u00a0USD) in damage.[1]"

The first was the mid/late 1970s where schools located south of the first ring suburbs near or through the I-71 corridor were realizing unprecedented growth.  The conference's six charter members had outgrown their respective leagues.  Berea and Midpark, both in the heart of the I-71 corridor, followed suit in 1979.  During the 1980s Wadsworth, a member with strong athletic programs despite smaller enrollment, left for the Suburban League where opponents along the US-224 and I-76/I-94 corridors made better natural border rivalries.  Cloverleaf followed suit in the late 1990s due to stagnation in its enrollment and its inability to maintain its programs at competitive levels in the PC.  Conversely, Medina, also along the corridor, joined the PC in 1986 because of its unprecedented growth and the greater natural border rivalries among the league's charter members.  The final shift was the early 2000s where first-ring south/west Cleveland suburbs found the charter PC members were now larger, more suitable opponents and closer in proximity; saving some travel among Lake Erie League opponents of years past.  Lorain County schools, Elyria and North Ridgeville, were looking for closer, competitive opponents as an alternative to the continued shrinking of Lorain City and Sandusky schools.  Their proximity to I-80 and I-480 made the jump to the PC more viable.  This conference was a powerhouse in all sports and it was also the foundation of the Cleveland area's first suburban mega-conference, the NEO Conference, whose format was patterned after similar mega-conferences formed in Columbus, Dayton and Cincinnati suburbs."

Fern peaked north of Yap on December 26, with JTWC assessing winds of 150\u00a0km/h\u00a0(90\u00a0mph), while the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center, Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) assessed peak winds of 110\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph), just below typhoon strength. The storm soon became sheared and weakened slowly. Fern continued to weaken to a tropical depression on December 30. Both agencies stopped advisories later on the same day. Fern made a direct hit at Yap on Christmas Day. A cargo ship was abandoned after it was damaged by high winds offshore. On the island, Fern caused $3 million (1996\u00a0USD) of damage.

The trough in the southern hemisphere spawned cyclones Ophelia, Phil, and Fergus. Around that time, convection began to increase near the equator, and was associated with a westerly wind burst. A low level circulation center was noted by JTWC on December 19 at 0600 UTC. Two days later, convection consolidated near the circulation center,[1] and JMA began tracking it at 0000 UTC as a tropical depression.[2][nb 1] JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert at 1500 UTC, as sea level pressure began to deepen, and signs of upper level divergence were found in the system. The first advisory for Tropical Depression 42W followed three hours later, on December 17 at 1200 UTC.[1][4] JTWC upgraded the depression to a tropical storm on December 22 at 0000 UTC as it traveled westerly, and was given the name Fern.[1] According to JTWC, the wind speeds meandered at minimal tropical storm strength.[1][4] JMA proceeded to upgrade the depression into a tropical storm at 1800 UTC, with winds of 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph), and a pressure reading of 996 hectopascals (996\u00a0mbar).[2][nb 2] On Christmas Eve, Fern slowly traveled toward Yap.[1] The storm passed over Yap the next day, strengthening to 105\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph) at 0000 UTC, according to JTWC.[4] JMA assessed Fern had winds of 100\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph) at the same time.[2] Fern also began its recurvature that day, beginning its turn north.[6] Eighteen hours later on Christmas Day, JTWC upgraded Fern to a typhoon, with winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph).[1][4] JMA continued to keep it as a severe tropical storm at that time.[2] On December 26 at 1200 UTC, Fern reached its peak at 150\u00a0km/h\u00a0(90\u00a0mph) north of Yap after its recurvature, according to JTWC.[1][4] JMA assessed that Fern reached its peak of 110\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph), with a pressure reading of 975\u00a0hPa (975\u00a0mb) twelve hours later.[2] On December 28, Fern began to weaken when it encountered a shear line.[1] On the next day, JTWC downgraded Fern back to tropical storm strength, with winds of 110\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph).[4] At the same time according to JMA, the storm had weakened to 80\u00a0km/h (50\u00a0mph), with a pressure reading of 985\u00a0hPa (985\u00a0mbar).[2] Both warning centers downgraded Fern into a tropical depression by December 30, as it continued to travel along a shear line.[1][2][4] JTWC issued the final warning at 0600 UTC,[1] while JMA stopped tracking the depression at 1200 UTC.[2] JTWC continued to track the low until December 31, where it stalled north of Guam.[4][6]"

Roads and bridges were severely damaged, accounting for half of the damage.[1] Homes and other private properties were also significantly damaged. Most crops on the island, such as coconuts, bananas, papayas, and breadfruit, were destroyed by the storm. Public facilities, like schools and hospitals, suffered widespread destruction.[7] On January 3, 1997, a state of emergency was declared for Yap by Acting President Jacob Nena, stating that Fern caused \"an imminent threat to health, safety and welfare of the people of the affected areas.\"[7] Two months later, on March 20, United States President Bill Clinton declared Yap State a disaster area, allowing the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to start the damage assessment of the area. The FEMA funding was only for public facilities, and did not include private properties.[8] The request for individual assistance was not approved by FEMA, as damage to private properties were not much, and assistance from the national government and Yap State were sufficient.[9]"

The twenty-first named storm and the thirteenth typhoon of the 2015 Pacific typhoon season, Dujuan brought extremely powerful winds throughout the Yaeyama Islands and Taiwan in late September, causing 3 deaths in Taiwan. The typhoon also caused over \u00a52.5 billion (US$392.9\u00a0million) damage in East China. Dujuan originated as a monsoon depression, developing into a tropical storm on September 22. After slowly consolidating under an improving environment, the system intensified into a typhoon on September 25, and it started to present a large eye two days later. Dujuan reached its peak intensity on September 27 and made landfall over Taiwan on the next day. Interaction with the mountainous terrain of Taiwan significantly weakened the typhoon. Dujuan then made its second landfall over Fujian on September 29."

        "content": "The origin of Typhoon Dujuan can be traced back to a tropical disturbance that formed over the Maloelap Atoll late on September 14.[1] Convection remained very fragmented until September 20, when the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the low-pressure area to a tropical depression east-northeast of Guam early on that day.[2][3] Moreover, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert at the same time and indicated a monsoon depression, although the low-level circulation center (LLCC) was exposed and located east of the deep convective banding.[4] In the afternoon on September 21, the JMA began to issue tropical cyclone warnings to the system, shortly before the JTWC also upgraded it to a tropical depression and designated it as 21W, based on the convective structure and a RapidSCAT image.[5][6] On September 22, although the structure remained asymmetric with a fully exposed LLCC under easterly moderate vertical wind shear, the system still intensified into a tropical storm late on the same day and received the name Dujuan from the JMA.[7][8] Many meteorological agencies initially forecasted a recurving track south of Japan to Dujuan, but those agencies changed it to a west-northwest track pointing to Taiwan after 24 hours.[9] Dujuan developed smaller vortices rotating around a larger circulation centroid with deep convection along the western periphery on September 23;[10] however, right after the storm entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility and was named Jenny by PAGASA, there was only one partially exposed LLCC within the consolidating structure in the afternoon, leading more model guidances to show a stairstep track vice a recurve scenario.[11][12] When moving and organizing slowly on September 24, Dujuan was upgraded to a severe tropical storm early on that day, with an apparent eye revealed by a microwave imagery.[13][14] Based on a ragged eye under decreasing vertical wind shear, both of the JTWC and then the JMA upgraded Dujuan to a typhoon early on September 25, as the system started to track northwestward along the southwestern periphery of a deep-layered subtropical ridge.[15][16][17] Good divergent outflow as well as low vertical wind shear allowed Dujuan to intensify stably on September 26, yet dry air and subsidence were impacting the system at the same time, causing the western eyewall to break down.[18] Due to decreasing dry air, Dujuan improved its overall structure significantly late on the same day when starting to track west-northwestward.[19] Due to sea surface temperatures of 29\u00a0\u00b0C and improved radial outflow enhanced by a microscale anticyclone aloft, the JTWC indicated that the typhoon with an enlarged 80\u00a0km (50\u00a0mi) eye embedded in the highly deep and symmetric core had one-minute maximum sustained winds at 230\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph) early on September 27, equivalent to Category 4 of the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale.[20] This was increased to 240\u00a0km/h (150\u00a0mph) in post-season reanalysis, making Dujuan a super typhoon. Right after record-breaking winds were observed in Yonaguni of Okinawa, Japan around 16:00 JST (07:00 UTC) on September 28, the JMA raised Dujuan's estimated intensity of ten-minute maximum sustained winds to 205\u00a0km/h (127\u00a0mph) immediately, although the deep convective banding had begun to loosen with unraveling along the western side.[21][22] Soon, the eye shrunk quickly and became cloud-filled when the eyewall was interacting with the terrain of Taiwan, indicating a weakening trend from both the JMA and the JTWC.[23] The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) announced that Typhoon Dujuan had made landfall over Nan'ao, Yilan at 17:40 TST (09:40 UTC);[24] at around 01:00 TST on September 29 (17:00 UTC on September 28), Dujuan emerged into the Taiwan Strait from Fangyuan, Changhua.[25] Severely eroded by the Central Mountain Range and the Xueshan Range in Taiwan, the system rapidly weakened and was downgraded to a severe tropical storm by the JMA at 00:00 UTC on September 29.[26][27] Dujuan made its second landfall over Xiuyu District, Putian of Fujian, China at around 08:50 CST (00:50 UTC) on September 29, shortly before the JTWC issued the final warning.[28][29] The JMA downgraded the system to a tropical storm at 06:00 UTC and then a tropical depression at noon.[30][31] One day later, the system was absorbed into a stationary front which later became a powerful extratropical cyclone.[32][33]"

        "content": "The origins of Tropical Storm Norman were from the same tropical wave that spawned Atlantic Hurricane Gordon,[1] which emerged off the coast of Africa on September\u00a04. The wave moved westward,[2] with the southern portion of the wave crossing Central America while Gordon formed in the northwest Caribbean Sea. When the wave reached the eastern Pacific Ocean on September\u00a016, it interacted with a pre-existing low-level circulation, which produced a large area of disturbed weather. On September\u00a018, the convection began contracting and organizing, gradually developing a circular area of thunderstorms with well-defined outflow. It is estimated that at 0000\u00a0UTC on September\u00a020, the system developed into Tropical Depression Sixteen-E, about 205 miles (330\u00a0km) south-southeast of Manzanillo, Colima.[1] Upon first becoming a tropical cyclone, the depression was located within an area of weak steering currents.[1] Initially it was forecast to remain offshore; with warm waters and light wind shear, the depression was forecast to intensify into a strong tropical storm, and possibly attain hurricane status.[3] However, the circulation was difficult to locate, and as such its exact motion was uncertain.[4] Ships in the region confirmed the center of the storm as further northeast than previously thought, but also confirmed tropical storm force winds; as a result, the National Hurricane Center upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Norman.[5] Strengthening continued, and Norman attained peak winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h), shortly prior to making landfall west of L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas, Michoac\u00e1n, late on September\u00a020.[1] Initially, the storm was forecast to dissipate quickly over land, although the possibility was noted for a westward turn, due to an anticyclone located over central Mexico.[6] About 10\u00a0hours after moving ashore, Norman weakened to tropical depression status, and while moving further inland its track turned to the northwest.[1] The center became very ill-defined over the mountainous terrain of southwest Mexico, although stronger rainbands persisted offshore.[7] Late on September\u00a021, the poorly defined center of Norman emerged into open waters near Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco, and subsequently turned northward.[1] At first, the depression was forecast to re-intensify into a minimal tropical storm;[8] however, its previous land interaction prevented it from ever re-strengthening. The circulation remained close to the coastline, and at 1500\u00a0UTC on September\u00a022, Norman made landfall near Mazatl\u00e1n, Sinaloa, as a weak tropical depression. Within a few hours, the cyclone dissipated over land.[1]"

The warning was dropped after Norman made landfall the next day. No additional warnings were issued upon Norman's reemergence over water because it was never expected to restrengthen.[1] Norman produced heavy rainfall across western Mexico, officially peaking at 14\u00a0in (360\u00a0mm) at Callejones, Colima. At La Villita, Michoac\u00e1n, total rainfall reached 9.5\u00a0in (240\u00a0mm).[1] However, the highest amount was actually at Petacalco/La Union.[9] The rainfall caused severe flooding and mudslides, which killed about nine people.[10] Additionally, the heavy precipitation flooded streets and homes as well as down trees.[11] Four of the deaths occurred in the State of Chiapas as a result of a mudslide. Two more were swept away by raging rivers in the State of Veracruz, and another two people drowned in the State of Guerrero.

Subsequently, the storm weakened and moved into the Taiwan Strait before making its final landfall near Quanzhou, China the next day. The storm quickly weakened over the Chinese mainland, and dissipated entirely several hours after landfall. In Taiwan, where Morakot first made landfall, heavy rainfall resulted in flooding. Commercial flights, schools, and rail service in some areas was cancelled in advance of the storm. Precipitation there peaked at 653\u00a0mm (25.71\u00a0in) over a period of nearly two days in Taitung County.

Tracking north-northwestward under the influence of a passing trough,[1] the system intensified further into a tropical storm by 0600\u00a0UTC on August\u00a02,[3] thus receiving the name Morakot. At the time, the storm was well organized with a steady outflow pattern.[1] Intensification continued, and at 1800\u00a0UTC on August\u00a02 the JMA determined Morakot to have peaked in intensity with winds of 85\u00a0km/h (50\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 992\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.29\u00a0inHg);[3] however, the JTWC still considered Morakot to have been a strengthening tropical cyclone at the time. The appearance of a ragged eye prompted the agency to upgrade the storm to typhoon status at 0600\u00a0UTC on August\u00a03,[2] though other agencies still maintained Morakot's tropical storm classification.[1] Over the rest of the day the cyclone moved rather erratically before making its first landfall on Taitung, Taiwan late on August\u00a03.[2] Morakot had slightly weakened prior to landfall and as such estimates from the JMA of the storm's intensity at the time of landfall were slightly lowered to 75\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph).[3] Despite the slowing of the storm's forward motion as it moved across the island, passage over Taiwan was brief and Morakot entered the Taiwan Strait by early on August\u00a04.[1] The cyclone's northwesterly track brought the storm to a second landfall, this time near Quanzhou, China, at approximately 1000\u00a0UTC that day.[2] Weakening was quick over China, and by two hours after landfall the JMA declared Morakot to have weakened below tropical depression intensity.[3] The JTWC continued to monitor the system until it was determined to have dissipated by 0000\u00a0UTC on August\u00a05.[2]"

Precipitation from the tropical cyclone peaked at 653\u00a0mm (25.71\u00a0in) over nearly two days in Taitung County.[1] The rains uprooted trees in southeastern Taitung City and triggered some landslides.[6] Flash flooding was reported in Pingtung County.

Heavy rains also fell in Zimao Town, where 334\u00a0mm (13.15\u00a0in) of rain was documented in eight hours. Quanzhou City was heavily impacted by the rainfall, and total losses there reached CN\u00a5240\u00a0million (US$29\u00a0million). One death resulted in the city. Further south in Heyuan, widespread power outages were caused by torrential rainfall. Winds blew two people off of a high falsework, killing both. The rainfall from Morakot in China somewhat relieved persistent drought conditions in the region. Following the passage of the tropical storm, however, 703\u00a0cloud seeding missions were carried out in Fujian Province in order to produce enhanced artificial rainfall. This included the deployment of 1,027\u00a0rockets and 14,700\u00a0cannonballs containing silver iodide. As a result of these, rainfall totals ranging from 40\u201360\u00a0mm (1.6\u20132.4\u00a0in) over a 138,500\u00a0km2 (53,500\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) area were attributed to anthropologically enhanced precipitation.[1] Though not directly related to Morakot, the storm's cyclonic circulation helped in part to produce thick smog and low visibility conditions in parts of Hong Kong.[9]"

The storm developed as a tropical depression over the South China Sea on May\u00a022. Tracking north-northwestward, the system steadily intensified, attaining peak winds of 110\u00a0km/h (68\u00a0mph). The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) assessed Cecil to have been slightly stronger with one-minute sustained winds of 140\u00a0km/h (87\u00a0mph).[nb 1] The storm made landfall near Hoi An, Vietnam early on May\u00a025 and quickly weakened. The system later dissipated over Laos on May\u00a026. In Vietnam, heavy rains accompanied the storm, amounting to over 510\u00a0mm (20\u00a0in) in some areas, triggered catastrophic and deadly flooding. Widespread structural and agricultural losses took place in addition to the significant loss of life, with damage estimated at \u20ab300\u00a0billion ($71.7\u00a0million). In the wake of the flooding, some international aid was sent to Vietnam, though most relief work was conducted by the nation's government, local agencies, and the Red Cross."

        "content": "On May\u00a020, following Typhoon Brenda's passage through the South China Sea, a monsoon trough extending from the area into the Bay of Bengal received enhanced low-level southwesterly flow. An environment of weak wind shear in the wake of the typhoon allowed a new area of low pressure to form within the southwesterly flow on May\u00a021. With convection becoming persistent and the system's overall presentation more organized by May\u00a022, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert at 0300\u00a0UTC.[2] Around this time, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a tropical depression.[3][nb 2] Later that day, convection wrapped entirely around the center of circulation; this structural improvement, combined with nearby surface observations, prompted the JTWC to designate the system as Tropical Storm Cecil.[2] Initially, Cecil was forecast to maintain a northward track into a weakness in a subtropical ridge left behind by Typhoon Brenda; however, Cecil turned westward on May\u00a023 due to another ridge over China. With favorable atmospheric conditions, Cecil continued to intensify through May\u00a024. By 0600\u00a0UTC, a ragged 75\u00a0km (47\u00a0mi) wide eye developed over the center of circulation, indicating it had become a typhoon. The storm ultimately attained peak winds of 140\u00a0km/h (87\u00a0mph) while situated just off the coast of central Vietnam.[5] However, the JMA reported Cecil to have been slightly weaker, classifying it as a severe tropical storm with ten-minute sustained winds of 110\u00a0km/h (68\u00a0mph).[3] Around 1800\u00a0UTC (just after midnight on May\u00a025, local time), the storm made landfall near Hoi An with winds of 130\u00a0km/h (81\u00a0mph). Once onshore, Cecil quickly weakened to a tropical depression. Turning slightly to the west-northwest, the remnants of Cecil continued inland before dissipating over eastern Laos early on May\u00a026.[2]"

About 7,500 metric tons of rice seeds were also lost.[8] The hardest hit areas were in Qu\u1ea3ng Nam Province, where damage reached \u20ab300\u00a0billion ($71.7\u00a0million).[9][10] The storm destroyed at least 10,000 homes and damaged another 27,000,[6] leaving an estimated 336,000 people homeless.[8] Approximately 60\u00a0percent of the forests and forestry nurseries in the province were ruined.[11] By June\u00a05, 151 people were confirmed dead across the country with another 600 missing.[8] Eventually, the death toll was revised to 751 as all missing persons were considered dead.[12] In the wake of the storm, Vietnamese soldiers were deployed to rescue survivors. Local police forces were also stepped up to prevent looting.[7] On June\u00a05 government also requested international assistance to deal with the scale of the disaster. However, this was later retracted on June\u00a016, though spontaneous donations were appreciated. The governments of Australia and France provided Vietnam with $75,188 and $73,964 in funds respectively. Additionally, the Swedish Red Cross donated clothing, which was later distributed by the local Red Cross along with medicine and relief supplies.[8] A total of \u20ab52\u00a0million ($124,000) worth of funds and relief supplies, including 1,600\u00a0m (5,200\u00a0ft) of fabric, and two tons of clothing, was sent to Quang Nam province.[10]"

The fifth tropical depression and fourth named storm of the 2009 Atlantic hurricane season, Danny developed on August 26 from the interaction between a westward-moving tropical wave and an upper-level trough while situated east of the Bahamas. The storm never fully matured, and resembled a subtropical cyclone. It meandered generally northwestward before being absorbed into another weather system on August 29. Danny had only minor effects on land. However, it triggered high surf and rip currents from Florida through the Mid-Atlantic states, leading to the death of a 12-year-old boy in North Carolina. The cyclone's remnants contributed to widespread rainfall in the northeast United States. At one point, some weather forecasts predicted Danny to rapidly strengthen, and hit Nantucket as a Category 1 hurricane, although this never occurred. Localized flooding was reported, particularly in Pennsylvania. It later caused heavy precipitation and power outages in Atlantic Canada."

        "content": "Danny originated in a tropical wave that exited the west coast of Africa on August 18. Convective activity associated with the system briefly began to organize on August 22, but wind shear soon halted further development. On August 24, thunderstorms once again increased as the disturbance interacted with an upper-level trough.[1] On August 25, a Hurricane Hunters mission into the system revealed a broad area of tropical-storm force winds, but no closed circulation center. However, around 0900 UTC on August 26, satellite imagery and QuikSCAT data indicated that a closed low had formed. While situated about 430\u00a0mi (690\u00a0km) east of Nassau, Bahamas, the feature was declared a tropical storm\u2014skipping the tropical depression stage.[1] Due to the interaction of the initial wave and the upper-level trough, Danny maintained a \"non-classical\" structure resembling that of a subtropical cyclone.[1] Even after its designation as a tropical storm, the storm was highly disorganized. Little or no deep thunderstorm activity surrounded the center, and the highest winds were confined to a rainband in the northern semicircle of the cyclone.[2] The storm moved erratically northwestward throughout the day on August 26, strengthening only slightly.[1] Danny's center reformed several times, making it difficult to determine its direction of movement.[3] By early on August 27, the tropical storm became slightly better organized, although the most intense winds were still removed from the center.[4] Danny peaked with maximum sustained winds of 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 1006 mbar (hPa; 29.71 inHg). It held this strength for about 12 hours before reinvigorated shear caused the storm to gradually weaken as it meandered northward.[1] By August 28, Danny further deteriorated, and reconnaissance aircraft found that it was barely a tropical storm.[5] After stalling during the afternoon, the center resumed a north or north-northwestward drift.[6] A strong upper-level trough moving through the southeastern United States forced Danny northeastward. It also triggered the formation of another low pressure system near the coast of North Carolina early on August 29. Although this low formed within Danny's cyclonic envelope, satellite imagery indicated that it did not have the characteristics of a tropical cyclone. Therefore, it is not considered to be a continuation of Danny. The new low caused the tropical storm to degenerate into a trough about 275\u00a0mi (445\u00a0km) southeast of Wilmington, North Carolina, and Danny's remnants were absorbed into a developing frontal zone shortly thereafter.[1]"

It was discontinued on August 29.[1] As the storm remained offshore, its effects were limited. However, it generated strong rip currents and high waves along the U.S. East Coast which may have resulted in the drowning death of a 12-year-old boy near Corolla, North Carolina, on August 28.[7] On September 1, the Currituck County Sheriff's Office reported that the boy's body was found on the beach about 1\u00a0mi (1.6\u00a0km) north of where he went missing.[8] Farther south, 7-foot (2\u00a0m) swells reached Florida's Atlantic coast.[9] High surf and rip currents also affected the Mid-Atlantic states, prompting officials to issue bathing restrictions.[10] A surfer in Monmouth County, New Jersey, broke his leg in the rough conditions.[11] The remnants of the storm interacted with a frontal boundary, triggering widespread precipitation across numerous states. In Delaware County, Pennsylvania, torrential rainfall produced flash flooding that trapped one family in their basement.[12] A creek near Philadelphia overflowed its banks and caused minor flooding.[13] Several roads in Lehigh County, including one lane of U.S. Route 222, were closed due to flood waters.[14] Flooding also took place in New Jersey; numerous basements were submerged and motorists in Camden County had to be rescued from their vehicles.[15] In Maryland, rainfall peaked at 7\u00a0in (180\u00a0mm).[16] The extratropical system impacted New England with high winds and heavy rainfall. At least 2\u00a0in (50\u00a0mm) of rain fell in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Some roads throughout the region became impassable due to standing water.[17] A site in the Nantucket Sound recorded a wind gust to 61\u00a0mph (98\u00a0km/h).[18] The former tropical cyclone produced wind gusts of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) in Maine, toppling trees and ripping boats from their moorings at a harbor in Eastport.[19] Danny's remnants later caused heavy rain across Atlantic Canada. At Saint John, New Brunswick, 100\u00a0mm (3.9\u00a0in) of rain flooded at least 50 basements. The Meteorological Service of Canada hoisted several weather advisories for New Brunswick, Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia.[20][21] In Nova Scotia, over 16,000 residences lost power at the height of the storm.[22]"

        "content": "This destructive tornado touched down on the southwest side of Petersburg, and rapidly intensified as it struck the historic downtown area of the city. Several well-built, multi-story brick buildings were leveled, along with a train station. A decorative caboose near the train station was ripped from its anchors and thrown 20 feet, pulling the anchors out of the ground in the process. Damage in downtown Petersburg was rated as F4. The tornado then moved through the Pocahontas Island neighborhood at F3 intensity, heavily damaging or destroying 47 homes and a church. A total of 100 buildings were damaged or destroyed in Petersburg. The tornado then crossed into Colonial Heights, severely damaging a strip mall, a K-mart, and a waterbed store. A Wal-Mart was destroyed, with three fatalities occurring at that location. Many cars in the parking lot were tossed and destroyed as well. Damage in Colonial Heights was rated as low-end F3. The tornado then crossed into Prince George County at F2 intensity, striking a sand and gravel company. Several cars and trucks were overturned, the second floor of a cinder-block building was destroyed, conveyor belts were twisted and overturned, and one person was killed at that location. Many trees were downed throughout the county. The tornado then struck the north side of Hopewell at F1 intensity, where it blew roofs off of an apartment complex. The tornado caused minor damage to an additional 49 homes, major damage to 13 homes and destroyed two other homes in Hopewell. The tornado exited Hopewell, weakened to an F0, and dissipated in Charles City County. From start to finish, this storm caused 4 deaths and 246 injuries. It was the deadliest Virginia tornado since 10 people were killed in Ivy on September 30, 1959.[2] It was also the first recorded F4 tornado in Virginia state history.[3] For a number of years afterwards, the remains of a damage swath (sheared, twisted and broken vegetation) through thick trees was visible along the west side of I-95 on the immediate north side of the Appomattox crossing. Perhaps one of the longest lasting reminders of the twister was on the Martin Luther King Jr. Bridge between Colonial Heights and Petersburg. As the tornado had smashed through the historic district, it ripped a traffic light off the bridge, and the snapped pillars remained until the bridge was replaced in 2002. As a result of the damage that occurred, a State of emergency was issued for Petersburg.[4][5]"
