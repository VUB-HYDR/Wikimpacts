        "content": " On February\u00a019\u201320, 1884, one of the largest and most widespread tornado outbreaks in American history occurred over the Southeastern United States,   known as the Enigma tornado outbreak due to the uncertain number of total tornadoes and fatalities. Nonetheless, an inspection of newspaper reports and governmental studies published in the aftermath reveals successive, long-tracked tornado families striking Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia, with an estimation of at least 51\u2014and possibly 60\u00a0or more\u2014tornadoes. The majority of reported tornado activity was seen across Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina, which were all struck severely by multiple waves of tornado families. In the Southeast, the outbreak began during the late morning in Mississippi, preceded by severe thunderstorms in Louisiana. Shortly thereafter, the outbreak widened and intensified, progressing from Alabama to Virginia between noon and midnight. The outbreak also produced the deadliest individual tornado in North Carolina history, an F4 which swept through the Rockingham area, killing 23.[nb 1][nb 2][nb 3]"

Detailed coverage in a Wadesboro-based newspaper provides an unusually (by 19th-century standards) precise survey of the movement and damage produced by three\u00a0of those storms in the southern Piedmont of North Carolina. This storm first formed in southeastern Union County, from a supercell that had produced significant damage in South Carolina earlier. Most of the path of this storm was in rural areas, with injuries and major damage along Beaverdam Creek, south of Marshville in Union County, and along Brown Creek in Anson County, northeast of Polkton. Significant damage also occurred in and around the towns of Polkton and Ansonville, where structures in both towns were widely damaged, with homes and farm buildings destroyed south of Ansonville. A total of four\u00a0people were killed: a pair in a \"'mansion'\" that was destroyed, and another pair in one\u00a0of 28\u00a0homes that were wrecked on a plantation. Eyewitnesses in Polkton noted that the storm \"crossed the railroad about a mile east of Polkton last night prostrating everything in its course. Could see the storm from Polkton by lightning, looked like a cloud of dense smoke and sounded like thunder. Hail stones measuring 2+1\u20442\u00a0in (6.4\u00a0cm) long, 1+1\u20442\u00a0in (3.8\u00a0cm) wide and 1\u00a0in (2.5\u00a0cm) thick fell.\" Homes were also destroyed near Mangum in Richmond County and near Pekin in Montgomery County.[27]"

The first tornado-specific damage occurred in the Pioneer Mills community between Harrisburg and Midland in Cabarrus County, where a mill was destroyed and estimated F2\u00a0damage was inflicted upon several residences, including several small and a few larger homes that were wrecked. The storm passed within 2\u00a0mi (3.2\u00a0km) of Albemarle; little damage was recorded elsewhere in Stanly County. Several poorly constructed buildings were destroyed along the Uwharrie River in Montgomery County, and damage to farms was widespread in the county. One\u00a0person was killed, but there may have been other deaths. Downburst damage continued to southwest of Asheboro.[28]"

        "content": "Spawned late in the outbreak, the storm which swept from Anson to Harnett Counties in North Carolina passed through the Rockingham area, and became the deadliest tornado in recorded North Carolina history. This storm first touched down east of the town of McFarlan, in southeastern Anson County. The storm produced little damage in Anson County, but caused two\u00a0deaths south of Pee Dee. Tracking to the northeast, it crossed the Pee Dee River into Richmond County and produced sporadic damage until just southeast of Rockingham. Extreme damage to pine forests was first noted just south of town. Strengthening considerably, the storm swept through the southeast edge of Rockingham, where large homes were destroyed to their foundations, and large hardwood trees were snapped at ground level. The Philadelphia Church community (presently on U.S. Highway 1, 3\u00a0mi (4.8\u00a0km) northeast of downtown Rockingham) was devastated, with most of the poorly constructed dwellings in the community completely destroyed. 15\u00a0or more deaths occurred there. The storm had widened to nearly 1\u00a0mi (1.6\u00a0km) in width at this point. Forests and rural homes were flattened in and beyond Philadelphia. The storm then tracked through what is now the town of Hoffman, before entering Moore County. Severe damage was again seen in the communities of Keyser and Manly (presently at the northeast corner of the city of Southern Pines), along the southeast edge of Moore County. The storm then curved slightly to the east, dissipating into a wide area of downburst damage near the community of Johnsonville. A total of at least 23\u00a0people were killed, for many of the injured may have died later. Eyewitnesses reported large hail and intense lightning displays preceding the storm. An unusually detailed accounting of the storm's passage through Richmond County was provided two days later: a local resident undertook an informal, but detailed survey of the damage produced by the storm, and this account was published in an Anson County newspaper. This accounting establishes a steady southwest-to-northeast movement through the county, with a number of buildings\u2014sharecropper cabins, large homes, and a mill\u2014swept away along the path. As the storm passed 1\u00a0mi (1.6\u00a0km) southeast of downtown Rockingham, it may have peaked in intensity; it was noted that all structures along a 5-mile-long (8.0\u00a0km) segment of the path (beginning at this point) were destroyed. The surveyor noted a path width of 1\u20444\u20131\u20442\u00a0mi (0.40\u20130.80\u00a0km), with the most extreme damage (and most deaths) in the Philadelphia Church community. The surveyor noted that: Trees were taken up by the roots and hurled with fearful rapidity through the air and those not uprooted had all the bark taken off. The scene after the storm, particularly the position of the prostrate trees, indicated a convergence toward the center, as if a vacuum was created there and the wind rushed in from either side to fill it. A second, detailed survey of the path was made 10\u00a0days later by J. A. Holmes; his findings were published in the Elisha Mitchell Scientific Society journal for 1884.[29]"

Homes were swept away by water in Louisville, Kentucky, New Albany, Indiana, and Jeffersonville, Indiana, as well as in other towns along the Ohio River. Blizzard conditions occurred in the eastern Midwest. In Tennessee the mid-latitude system associated with the outbreak generated severe thunderstorms that produced strong, destructive winds on February\u00a019. These winds caused \"great\" damage to forestland, fencing, and housing, especially in and near Clarksville.[30]"

Individual deaths may have been counted multiple times, leading to an exaggerated death toll, but on the other hand rural Black dead may have been undercounted, many of whom were undocumented sharecroppers. Of thousands reported dead, the names of fewer than 100\u00a0could be verified. According to an article appearing in the Statesville (NC) Landmark three days later, the damage tally in Georgia alone was estimated to be $1\u00a0million, in 1884\u00a0dollars. Tabulations from 1884\u00a0estimate a total of $3\u20134\u00a0million in tornado damage (with an unknown amount of flood and other damage), with 10,000\u00a0structures destroyed, as many as 800\u00a0dead, and up to 2,500\u00a0injured. The same reported an estimated 60\u00a0tornadoes and called the outbreak the worst in U.S. history to date. Between 10,000 and 15,000 people were reportedly rendered homeless and even said to be \"starving\". The outbreak produced the largest 24-hour total of killer tornadoes until the 1974 Super Outbreak. The precise number of tornadoes as well as fatalities incurred during the outbreak is unknown, but the death toll was variously estimated to range from 370\u00a0to 2,000\u00a0at the time. A reliable survey by the Signal Corps in 1889 located 182\u00a0fatalities, and a reanalysis by tornado researcher Thomas P. Grazulis in 1993 counted 178\u00a0deaths.[31]"

On 8 March, rainfall was reported in the departments of Tumbes, Piura, Lambayeque, La Libertad, Ancash, and Lima. On 10 March,  the La Leche River overflowed in Lambayeque Province, affecting the district of Illimo, leaving 3,000 homeless and leaving over 1,000 homes uninhabitable.[6][18] In the department of La Libertad, there was flooding in the provinces of Chep\u00e9n and Pacasmayo after torrential rains.[18] SENAMHI reports indicated that the departments of Lambayeque and La Libertad exceeded the historical record of rainfall accumulation in 24 hours, reporting values not recorded since the 1997\u201398 and 2017 El Ni\u00f1o events.[19] By 14 March, dozens of huaicos were reported throughout the nation as a result of the rainfall.[6] Huaicos were reported in the Lima Province, with mudslides reported in Anc\u00f3n, Carabayllo, Chaclacayo, Cieneguilla, Comas and Punta Hermosa.[20] In Punta Hermosa, widespread flooding was reported.[6] The Piura River surpassed its crest in the urban area of Piura, resulting in flooding.[6] The town of Quiruvilca was completely destroyed by landslides.[6] Residents of Illimo, who faced flooding since 10 March, reported that despite much of the city being flooded, no response was provided and that they had not received drinking water for nearly five days.[6] Per\u00faSAT-1 collected images of Cyclone Yaku's impact in an effort to respond to the system's effect.[6]  In the early morning hours of 15 March, some residents of Lurigancho-Chosica were evacuated due to the risk of huaicos.[6] At least 60% of homes in Catacaos were abandoned due to the risks of the Piura River overflowing.[6] CEPRENED estimated that 592 districts along Peru were at risk of landslides or mudslides due to heavy rains. Also, the National Institute of Civil Defence (INDECI) reported more than 45,000 people affected and 1,312 houses collapsed, with La Libertad being the most affected department.[5] Regarding infrastructure and building losses, over 3,000 homes were left uninhabitable. The destruction included 58 schools, four medical facilities, over 60 kilometres (37\u00a0mi) of road, over 94 kilometres (58\u00a0mi) of irrigation canals and at least 118 bridges.[6] President Dina Boluarte flew over the flooded areas after the heavy rains that affected in Lambayeque.[21] The government of Dina Boluarte received criticism from international media and television celebrities,[22] who claimed that its response to the natural disasters that hit the country was either slow or nonexistent.[23][24]"

Names were taken from the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet, with the first named storm being designated \"Able\", the second \"Baker\", and so on. It was a very active season with sixteen\u00a0tropical storms, with eleven of them developing into hurricanes. Six of these hurricanes were intense enough to be classified as major hurricanes\u2014a denomination reserved for storms that attained sustained winds equivalent to a Category 3 or greater on the present-day Saffir\u2013Simpson scale. One storm, the twelfth of the season, was unnamed and was originally excluded from the yearly summary, and three additional storms were discovered in re-analysis. The large quantity of strong storms during the year yielded, prior to modern reanalysis, what was the highest seasonal accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) of the 20th century in the Atlantic basin; 1950 held the seasonal ACE record until broken by the 1995 Atlantic hurricane season and the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season. However, later examination by researchers determined that several storms in the 1950 season were weaker than thought, leading to a lower ACE than assessed originally.[1][2] This season also set the record for the most tropical storms, eight, in the month of October. The tropical cyclones of the season produced a total of 88\u00a0fatalities and $38.5\u00a0million in property damage (1950\u00a0USD). The first officially named Atlantic hurricane was Hurricane Able, which formed on August\u00a012, brushed the North Carolina coastline, and later moved across Atlantic Canada. The strongest hurricane of the season, Hurricane Dog, reached the equivalent of a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale and caused extensive damage to the Leeward Islands. Two major hurricanes affected Florida: Easy produced the highest 24-hour rainfall total recorded in the United States, while King struck downtown Miami as a Category 4 hurricane and caused $27.75\u00a0million (1950\u00a0USD) of damage. The two major landfalls made the 1945\u20131950 period the only five-year period to feature five major hurricane landfalls in the United States\u2014a record that held until tied in 2000\u20132005.[1][2] The last storm of the year, an unnamed tropical storm, dissipated on November\u00a012."

This season was the first time that the United States Weather Bureau operated with radar technology to observe hurricanes 200\u00a0mi (320\u00a0km) away from land. Although the season began on June\u00a015, tropical activity typically does not begin before August.[5] The tropics remained tranquil through early August, and the U.S. Weather Bureau noted that the season had been \"remarkably quiet\".[6] The inactive period ended on August\u00a012, when the first tropical storm developed east of the Lesser Antilles. This storm received the name \"Able\" as part of the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet.[6] (The same alphabet was also used in the 1951 and 1952 seasons, before being replaced by female naming in 1953.)[7] Before the end of August, four hurricanes had formed in the Atlantic, two of which attained major hurricane status.[6] A major hurricane is a tropical cyclone with winds of at least 111\u00a0mph (179\u00a0km/h); a storm of this intensity would be classified as a Category\u00a03 or greater on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale introduced in the 1970s.[8] In contrast to the busy August, only three named storms developed in September\u2014although three of the August hurricanes lasted into September. Hurricane Dog became the strongest hurricane of the season on September\u00a06 with winds of 145\u00a0mph (233\u00a0km/h); its peak strength occurred over the open Atlantic Ocean, so it did not cause significant damage when it was at its strongest. It was among the most severe hurricanes on record in Antigua, where the hurricane struck early in its duration.[6] Eight tropical storms or hurricanes formed in October, which is greater than in any other year.[9][nb 2] In total, there were sixteen tropical storms during the season, of which five (Tropical Storm How, Tropical Storm Mike and three unnamed tropical storms) did not attain hurricane status. Overall, six major hurricanes occurred during the year.[9]  The Hurricane Hunters made about 300\u00a0flights into hurricanes during the season, the most since the practice began in 1943.[6] The number of storms was above average; in a typical year, eleven tropical storms, six hurricanes, and between two and three major hurricanes take place.[10] With the numerous major hurricanes, the season produced a high accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) of 211, although it was originally assessed as 243 before reanalysis. At one point, the 1950 total was the highest on record, before being surpassed by the 2005 season.[9][11][12] This value is an approximation of the combined kinetic energy used by all tropical cyclones throughout the season.[13]"

The first storm of the year originated from a tropical wave that exited the west coast of Africa around August\u00a05. Its status over the next few days were unknown due to sparse observations. On August\u00a012, the system was designated Tropical Storm Able east of the Lesser Antilles, which strengthened to hurricane status on August\u00a014. Able gradually intensified as it tracked generally west-northwestward, and by 12:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a017, Able became a major hurricane. Initially, Able was thought to pose a threat to the Bahamas and Florida.[6][9][14] Instead, the hurricane turned to the northwest, reaching its peak intensity as a strong Category 3 hurricane, with winds of 125\u00a0mph (201\u00a0km/h). The storm later turned to the northeast, passing just offshore Cape Hatteras, North Carolina and Cape Cod. Steadily weakening and accelerating, Able struck Nova Scotia as a minimal hurricane, and later struck Newfoundland as an extratropical storm. It dissipated early on August\u00a024 in the far northern Atlantic Ocean.[1][6] Along the coast of North Carolina, the hurricane produced light winds and rough waves,[15] as well as moderate precipitation. Heavier rainfall occurred in southern New England,[16] causing flooding in portions of New York City and producing slick roads that caused nine traffic fatalities.[17] Able produced hurricane-force winds in Nova Scotia,[6] and damage across Canada totaled over $1\u00a0million (1950\u00a0CAD, $13.2\u00a0million 2024\u00a0USD) in the agriculture, communications, and fishing industries.[18] Two people died in Canada when their raft was overturned.[19]"

It moved northwestward and later turned to the west, attaining hurricane status on August\u00a021. The next day, the hurricane attained Category 2 intensity just as it crossed over Antigua,[1][6][9] where heavy damage was reported. More than 100\u00a0homes were damaged or destroyed, which left thousands homeless.[20] Afterward, the hurricane began to weaken, and later on August\u00a022 its winds decreased to tropical storm status. The cyclone then struck Montserrat as a strong tropical storm. The next day it struck southwestern Puerto Rico, and shortly thereafter weakened into a tropical depression, passing over the Dominican Republic. Baker turned more to the west, re-attaining tropical storm status before striking eastern Cuba on August\u00a024.[1][6][9] In Cuba, 37 people died, and the property losses reached several million dollars.[21] On August\u00a025, Baker weakened to tropical depression status while crossing Cuba, but soon thereafter regained tropical storm intensity in the western Caribbean Sea. Two days later, Baker entered the Gulf of Mexico, and by the next day Baker had regained hurricane status. It turned northward, reaching a peak intensity of 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h) on August\u00a030. Baker weakened slightly before making landfall near Gulf Shores, Alabama with winds of 85\u00a0mph (137\u00a0km/h) on August\u00a031.[6][9] Property and crop damage totaled $2.55\u00a0million (1950\u00a0USD), primarily between Mobile, Alabama and Saint Marks, Florida.[6] Torrential rainfall fell throughout the region, with the largest total occurring in Caryville, Florida, where 15.49\u00a0in (393\u00a0mm) of precipitation were recorded.[22] The heavy precipitation was responsible for extensive crop damage across the region. The hurricane also spawned two tornadoes, one of which destroyed four houses and a building in Apalachicola, Florida. In Birmingham, Alabama, high wind downed power lines, which caused one death and two injuries due to live wires. While inland, Baker tracked northwestward and eventually dissipated over southeastern Missouri on September\u00a01.[6][9]"

For four days, the storm tracked generally to the west as a weak tropical storm. On August\u00a025, it turned to the northwest and intensified, becoming a hurricane on August\u00a028. On August\u00a030, Charlie attained peak winds of 110\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h), although the Hurricane Hunters estimated higher winds. At the time, the hurricane was stalled to the east-southeast of Bermuda, and subsequently turned to a westward drift.[6] On September\u00a02, Charlie turned to the north and northeast. At the time, it co-existed with two other hurricanes, Dog and Easy; it is a rare occurrence for three hurricanes to exist simultaneously in the Atlantic. Charlie slowly weakened and lost tropical characteristics, and by September\u00a05 Charlie had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone about 480\u00a0mi (770\u00a0km) southeast of Halifax, Nova Scotia. It dissipated later on September\u00a05 without having affected land.[6][9]"

Its first observation as a tropical cyclone occurred on August\u00a030, when it was a 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) hurricane; the storm is believed to have begun farther east as a Cape Verde-type hurricane, but was not detectable before August 30.[1][9] At the time, Dog was located east of the Lesser Antilles, and it quickly attained major hurricane status as it moved to the west-northwest. Dog passed through the Lesser Antilles with winds of 130\u00a0mph (210\u00a0km/h).[6][9] It was considered among the worst hurricanes in the history of Antigua,[6] where thousands were left homeless.[23] Damage was estimated at $1\u00a0million (1950\u00a0USD, $12.7\u00a0million 2024\u00a0USD), and there were two deaths from drowning in the region.[6] After passing through the Leeward Islands, the hurricane turned to a northerly drift with continued intensification. On September\u00a05, it attained wind speeds that would be equivalent to a Category 4 hurricane on the present-day Saffir-Simpson scale, with sustained winds of 145\u00a0mph (233\u00a0km/h). Operationally, the wind intensity value was estimated by Hurricane Hunters at 185\u00a0mph (298\u00a0km/h) when the hurricane was located about 450\u00a0mi (720\u00a0km) south-southwest of Bermuda;[6] this estimate is now believed to have been an overestimation of the peak winds in Hurricane Dog, though the storm produced enormous wave heights at sea.[9] Maintaining peak intensity for about 18\u00a0hours, Dog began a weakening trend as it made a sharp turn to the west. It accelerated to the north on September\u00a010, and two days later Dog passed within 200\u00a0mi (320\u00a0km) of Cape Cod.[6][9] Newspapers attributed heavy rainfall in the Mid-Atlantic states\u2014which resulted in five deaths\u2014to the hurricane.[24] Further north, the hurricane killed 12\u00a0people in New England, and produced a total of $2\u00a0million (1950\u00a0USD, $25.3\u00a0million 2024\u00a0USD) of property damage.[6] Twelve others died in two shipwrecks off the coast of Canada.[25] The hurricane later became a strong extratropical cyclone, maintaining hurricane-force winds while passing south of Nova Scotia and eventually hitting Scotland with hurricane-force gusts on September\u00a018.[9]"

Moving northeastward, the hurricane crossed Cuba on September\u00a03 and entered the Gulf of Mexico. Easy turned to the northwest and strengthened to its peak intensity as a Category 3 hurricane. At the time, Easy was located just off the west coast of Florida; however, a ridge to its north caused the hurricane to stall, execute a small loop, and make landfall near Cedar Key. Following the landfall, Easy moved offshore, turned to the southeast, and made a second landfall near Hernando Beach on September\u00a06. The hurricane turned northwestward over the Florida Peninsula, and gradually weakened as it moved into Georgia and the southeastern United States. On September\u00a09, Easy dissipated over northeastern Arkansas.[6][9] Damage in Cuba was minor, although large portions of western Florida experienced hurricane-force winds and heavy rainfall.[6] Yankeetown reported 38.70\u00a0in (983\u00a0mm) of precipitation in 24\u00a0hours, which at the time was the largest 24-hour rainfall total on record in the United States.[26] The cumulative total rainfall on Yankeetown from Easy was 45.20\u00a0in (1,148\u00a0mm), which still retains the record for the wettest tropical cyclone in Florida.[27] Damage was heaviest in Cedar Key, where half of the houses were destroyed and most of the remaining were damaged. The rainfall caused heavy crop damage in the region. Across the state, Easy caused $3\u00a0million in damage (1950\u00a0USD), the total was less than expected, due to the sparse population of the affected area. Additionally, the hurricane was indirectly responsible for two deaths by electrocution. At the time, Easy was also known as the \"Cedar Keys Hurricane\".[6]"

A small system, the hurricane moved generally northwestward and gradually intensified. After turning toward the north, Fox reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 140\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h) on September\u00a014, as it passed about 300\u00a0mi (480\u00a0km) east of Bermuda. Following its peak intensity, the hurricane accelerated to the north and northeast. By September\u00a017, Fox had lost all tropical characteristics, and later that day the circulation dissipated about halfway between the Azores and Newfoundland.

The next day, King struck Cuba near Camag\u00fcey, Cuba with winds of 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h), equivalent to an upper-end Category 1 hurricane.[9] The hurricane killed seven people and caused $2\u00a0million (1950\u00a0USD, $25.3\u00a0million 2024\u00a0USD) in damage throughout the country.[34] After crossing Cuba, King rapidly deepened as it turned toward South Florida, becoming the sixth and final major hurricane of the season on October\u00a018. King made landfall around 04:30\u00a0UTC on October\u00a018, with estimated winds of 130\u00a0mph (210\u00a0km/h), or a Category\u00a04 on the Saffir-Simpson scale; it was the most severe hurricane to impact the city since the 1926 Miami hurricane. As it approached Miami, the hurricane had a radius of maximum winds of 6\u00a0mi (9.7\u00a0km), and a minimum pressure of 955\u00a0mbar (28.2\u00a0inHg) was reported as King moved across the city.

The storm initially moved westward across the Gulf of Mexico, but soon swung southward into the central portion of the Gulf on October\u00a019. Hurricane Love's maximum sustained winds are believed to have reached their peak intensity early on October 20. Throughout the hurricane's track, dry air infringed on the western side of the tropical cyclone's circulation, which produced unfavorable conditions for additional tropical cyclogenesis. On October\u00a020, the storm began curving northeastward towards the coast of western Florida; however, the dry air completely circled Love's center of circulation, drastically weakening the cyclone in the process. On October\u00a021, Love weakened to a tropical storm, and it struck the Big Bend region of Florida, north of Cedar Key. At the time, its winds were only of moderate gale force, and the storm degenerated into a trough of low pressure shortly thereafter. This combined with an approaching cold front to produce a powerful extratropical storm.[6][9] Certain areas began preparing for the storm along Florida's west coast. Hospitals set up emergency facilities in case of power failure, and some coastal residents left their homes.[36] Initially, the storm was forecast to strike the Tampa area, but missed to the north as it weakened.

The film was produced as a collaboration between Stevens, Leonardo DiCaprio, James Packer, Brett Ratner, Trevor Davidoski, and Jennifer Davisson Killoran. Martin Scorsese is an executive producer.[3] The film covers effects of climate change in various regions of the world, and discusses climate change denial. Numerous public figures are interviewed in the documentary. To offset the carbon emissions of the production, the filmmakers paid a voluntary carbon tax. The soundtrack features compositions by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, Mogwai and Gustavo Santaolalla. The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2016, and was released theatrically on October 21, before airing on the National Geographic Channel on October 30.[4][5] As part of National Geographic's commitment to covering climate change, the documentary was made widely available and free of charge on various platforms.[6] It received generally positive critical reviews."

There was a lot to take in. All that we witnessed on this journey shows us that our world's climate is incredibly interconnected and that it is at urgent breaking point.\u00a0... We wanted to create a film that gave people a sense of urgency, that made them understand what particular things are going to solve this problem. We bring up the issue of a carbon tax, for example, which I haven't seen in a lot of documentaries. Basically, sway a capitalist economy to try to invest in renewables, to bring less money and subsidies out of oil companies. These are the things that are really going to make a massive difference.\u00a0... We need to use our vote\u00a0... We cannot afford to have political leaders out there that do not believe in modern science or the scientific method or empirical truths\u00a0...

DiCaprio repeatedly references a 15th-century triptych by Hieronymus Bosch, The Garden of Earthly Delights, which, he explains, hung above his crib as an infant, and which he uses as an analogy of the present course of the world toward potential ruin as depicted on its final panel.[11] The film also documents, in part, the production of DiCaprio's 2015 film The Revenant. DiCaprio's comments and inquiries focus extensively on climate change denial, mostly among corporate lobbyists and politicians of the United States.[12][13] They interview with British-born astronaut Piers Sellers, a NASA scientist who flew on three space missions, discusses his desire to publicize the perils of global warming in the short time he expected he had remaining to live, as he had stage IV pancreatic cancer as he was being filmed. He died on December 23, 2016.[14]"

On March 6, the system moved into the Mid-Atlantic region of the east coast, and intensified into a nor'easter, dumping up to 3 feet of snow in some places. By late March 6, 2013, the nor'easter had knocked out power to about 250,000 homes and businesses."

        "content": "Just after the February winter storm, an extratropical cyclone developed on early March 1, 2013, in the Gulf of Alaska moved ashore in British Columbia. After moving ashore, the storm weakened as it moved into the Western United States. Over the next few days, the storm dumped large amounts of snow across the Western States and the Great Plains, affecting areas that were already impacted by a previous blizzard. The storm quickly moved eastwards while slowly restrengthening. On March 4, the storm developed a severe side over the southern states, after tapping into moisture coming from the Gulf of Mexico. On March 5, the storm developed into a blizzard, while it was over the midsection of the Eastern United States, adding more snow to areas that had already received record snowfall from previous major winter storms. The blizzard conditions resulted in multiple flight cancellations and traffic problems across the Eastern States. A maximum amount of 36 inches of snow was recorded near the Bear Paw Ski Bowl in Montana.[2] On March 6, the system moved off the coast of Virginia, and intensified into a nor'easter. The storm curved towards the northeast, and began impacting New England. Light precipitation began as early as the morning of Wednesday, March 6.  This precipitation started as drizzle but changed over to light snow showers as the day progressed.  On the morning of Thursday, March 7, heavy snow began in parts of Connecticut, followed by a lull.  This period of snow led to many 90 minute delays for Connecticut school districts. On Thursday, March 7, the nor'easter slowly began pulling away from the east coast as it moved northeastward. However, the storm continued to intensify, and brought heavy snow and powerful winds to parts of New England beginning Thursday night. From late March 7 to March 8, the nor'easter absorbed a smaller system coming in from the west, adding much more moisture to the storm, which resulted in heavy snowfall across parts of New England. Heavy snow in southern New England continued from Thursday night through much of the day on Friday.  Over 2 days, the storm had dumped 10+ inches of snow across 11 states from Montana to Massachusetts. This added more snow to an already record-breaking snowfall season, which was brought on by multiple previous winter storms from February. Early on March 8, the nor'easter stalled off the coast of northern New England while maintaining its intensity, due to a blocking ridge of high pressure over Newfoundland. Later on March 8, the nor'easter began affecting southern Newfoundland, while continuing to intensify. At this time, the nor'easter reached its peak intensity of 986 millibars. On March 9, the ridge of high pressure over Newfoundland weakened enough for the nor'easter to begin moving out to sea. Up to 29.8 inches of snow were recorded in Milton, Massachusetts, by the end of the storm's snowfall on March 9. The nor'easter slowly weakened while moving eastwards, and its winds were still felt for several hours on March 9 after the snowfall had ended. By March 10, the nor'easter had completely left the east coast. On March 11, the nor'easter reached the middle of the North Atlantic Ocean and continued weakening, as it slowly moved eastwards. On the same day, the nor'easter lost its frontal boundary and became an Upper-level low, and its eye began to shrink. On March 12, the nor'easter stalled, and began absorbing moisture coming from the tropics, and the storm lost its eye. On March 13, the system began losing its organization, and spawned a new frontal low to the north, which brought thunderstorms and strong winds to the Azores Islands. The storm slowly began moving eastward, as it continued weakening steadily. On March 14, The storm began to accelerate towards the northeast and became an extratropical storm again. Later on the same day, the system slightly reintensified and absorbed the new low, while spawning a few small circulations around the edge of the storm. The storm brought rain to Madeira, and brought cloudy weather to the Canary Islands. On March 15, the nor'easter began to rapidly weaken, and lost a lot of moisture, as it continued accelerating towards Western Europe. On March 16, the system began interacting with a much more powerful storm complex situated over the United Kingdom, and brought thunderstorms to parts of Western Europe. On March 17, the system rapidly became disorganized as it began being absorbed by the larger storm complex. During the next several days, the storm system continued to move eastward, while slowly degenerating. On March 21, the system was completely absorbed by the larger storm complex, while located over the northern Adriatic Sea.[1]"

The storm dropped up to 10 inches of snow in the Chicago area on March 5. In the evening of March 6, Hatteras, North Carolina reported 3 feet of water on Highway 12 with the road impassable.[4] Despite a forecast of 5-10 inches of snow, most of the Washington DC metro area was spared. On March 5, the federal government closed offices in Washington, D.C.\nThe White House canceled a planned celebration for the Alabama Crimson Tide and Congress called off several hearings. More than 954,000 students who attend major school districts in Washington, Virginia, Maryland and Ohio got the day off.\nAmtrak shut down some trains in Washington, Virginia, West Virginia and New York.[4] Some snow totals from March 6 according to AccuWeather.com were: Frostburg, Maryland: 12.5\"; New Kensington, Pennsylvania: 12.0\"; Charlottesville, Virginia: 14.5\"; Worcester, Massachusetts 20.8 inches; Auburn, Massachusetts 19 inches; Randolph, Massachusetts:24.1 inches and Franklin, West Virginia: 24.0\". More than 440 flights were canceled on March 7, according to FlightAware.com. New York City was expected to get up to 3 inches of snow by the morning of March 8  with some higher total amounts possible on eastern Long Island. Boston was expected to see 2 to 4 inches, with higher totals where a winter storm warning was issued from Worcester to just north of Providence. Winter warnings were posted in seven Northeast states with most snowfall to occur on March 8.[5] On March 7, the NWS in Boston recorded 10.2\" of snow, breaking the single-day mark set in 1941. The city ended with 13.1 inches of snow. The Blue Hill Meteorological Observatory in Massachusetts measured 29.8 inches of snow over a 36-hour period. Because the storm's wind area was so large, rough surf and rip currents were felt all the way southward towards the eastern coast of Florida over the weekend of March 9 and 10.[6] The snowfall totals in many areas of southern New England vastly exceeded what was expected from forecasts, which meant that many people were unprepared for a large storm.  Most television meteorologists in Boston had predicted only a few inches of snow and mostly rain, but this forecast failed miserably.  Many towns surrounding Boston received around two feet of snow, which greatly surprised residents. Boston schools were left in session as the height of the storm occurred since they did not know the gravity of the situation."

At that time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began tracking the storm with winds of 30\u00a0mph (50\u00a0km/h), or tropical depression strength. The system began traveling eastward, and later to the northeast on March 22. Then, it turned sharply southward towards Hawaii on the same day. The system turned southwest toward the Hawaiian Islands at 0600 UTC of March 25, making its first landfall near Hauula on Oahu at 1200 UTC that day.[3][4] The system weakened below tropical storm intensity as it passed through the island of Oahu.[2] By six hours later, the system left the island and continued southward. Then, the system slowed down and curved back north toward Oahu. The system made a second landfall on Oahu near M\u0101kaha, just past 0000 UTC on March 28.[3][4] Later, the system scrapped the northwestern coast of the island. It re-entered the Pacific six hours later and turned west. The system then sped up and made its last landfall near Kealia, just past 0000 UTC on March 29.[3][4] The storm moved quickly across the island, and it left the island about six hours later. The JTWC stopped tracking the system east of the island of Nihoa eighteen hours later, after it had started to move across the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands.[3][4] The system has been considered a tropical or an extratropical cyclone. The JTWC[3] and the American Meteorological Society (AMS) both consider the storm to be a tropical cyclone.[2] However, the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers for the eastern north Pacific, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) and Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) do not include the system in their archives. Due to this, the system was not considered tropical or subtropical officially.[1] On March 25, tropical storm warnings were posted for the Hawaiian Islands. Winds of 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h) were reported in Oahu as the storm came near the island. In Honolulu, six inches (15\u00a0cm) of rain was reported.[2] The system contributed to the already above-average rainfall in the Hawaiian Islands. The rainfall amount for March 1951 was nearly 200 to 700 percent above normal.[5] The rainfall set records for that month, but they were later broken in 2006.[6]"

It was the first cyclone to make landfall in Bangladesh since Cyclone Mora in 2017.

Immediately the Joint Typhoon Warning Centre (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on the system by 15:00 UTC on 22 October.[5] Hours later, BOB 09 gained momentum and in the agency's fifth bulletin, it was reported that it had turned into a deep depression.[6] On 23 October, the cyclone intensified further into a cyclonic storm, thus receiving the name Sitrang by the IMD; the name Sitrang was contributed by Thailand. By 09:00 UTC on 23 October, the JTWC designated the storm as Tropical Storm 05B.[7] As it was predicted to make landfall over Bangladesh, there was a prediction that Sitrang would turn into a severe cyclonic storm, but it did not materialize because of increase in dry air.[8] When it made landfall over Bangladesh close to Patuakhali in Barisal on the early hours of 25 October (local time), the cyclone began to lose strength and was downgraded to a deep depression. The JTWC issued final warning for the system by 21:00 UTC on October 25.[9] Afterwards, Sitrang continued to weaken and in its thirteenth and final bulletin, the IMD declared that the cyclone had degenerated to a low pressure area by 06:00 UTC on 25 October.

By mid-afternoon the next day, a low-pressure area progressed into southwestern Oklahoma, supporting a quasi-stationary front across southern Oklahoma and a sharpening dry line southward into central Texas. The combination of partially sunny skies and dew points in the upper 60s Fahrenheit led to a very unstable environment across northwestern Texas and into southwestern Oklahoma. Thunderstorm activity soon developed in the vicinity of the area of low pressure, but the highest risk of tornadic activity was expected to materialize farther east where the direction of surface winds would be more conducive to rotating storms.[11] As the storms tracked eastward, multiple damaging tornadoes were reported.[1] Farther south across eastern Texas and western Louisiana, a subtle warm front and an additional surface boundary proved to be the impetus for convection to develop supercell characteristics.[12][13] One such supercell in Walker and Houston counties further organized as it curved right into an undisturbed environment of high wind shear and moisture.[14] Within the hour, it spawned an intense, long-tracked tornado with winds of 130\u2013165\u00a0mph (209\u2013266\u00a0km/h) as estimated by the SPC based on historical analogs.[15] This long-tracked cell maintained prominence and spawned additional tornadoes for several hours as it continued through Louisiana and into Western Mississippi.[16] On its trail, additional storms in a moderately unstable, highly sheared environment continued to pose a threat for all hazards.[17] Severe weather from this group of storms continued throughout the overnight hours along the Gulf Coast, with large swath of wind damage and tornadoes continuing into April 23. More storms fired up just offshore of the Florida panhandle as the first band moved off the coast around mid-day. These storms produced more tornadoes and wind damage before weakening that night.[18]"

        "content": "This large, intense wedge tornado first touched down at 5:35\u00a0p.m. CDT (22:35 UTC) in Trinity County along the north shore of Lake Livingston northwest of Onalaska south of FM 356. It then quickly crossed into Polk County and moved along the north shore of the lake, blowing down several trees while throwing several others into the lake. The tornado then rapidly strengthened as it briefly moved over the north part of the lake before causing major damage in Onalaska. Reaching low-end EF3 intensity, it first struck the Paradise Acres community on a small peninsula in the northwestern part of town. Numerous homes and manufactured homes were heavily damaged or destroyed in this area, and many trees were snapped or denuded as well. A few well-built frame homes sustained loss of their roofs and exterior walls along this segment of the path. It then moved back over Lake Livingston before moving ashore on the north side of Onalaska. The tornado was slightly weaker here, but still produced widespread high-end EF2 damage as many manufactured and site-built homes in neighborhoods south of FM 356 were damaged or destroyed, with debris strewn throughout the area. Dozens of trees were snapped or uprooted as the tornado crossed FM 356 before it entered another neighborhood on the northeast side of town. Several frame homes had their roofs torn off and exterior walls collapsed along and east of FM 3459 while other manufactured homes were completely destroyed. All three deaths and 33 injuries from the tornado occurred in Onalaska. The tornado weakened as it moved east-northeast out of Onalaska and crossed over the extreme northeastern part of Lake Livingston. Trees and homes along the shore were damaged at EF1 strength before the tornado moved into rural areas of Polk County and crossed FM 3152, mostly snapping or uprooting countless hardwood and softwood trees, although one house along FM 350 suffered roof damage. The tornado then reached its peak width of over one-half-mile (0.80\u00a0km) wide as it tore through the north side of Seven Oaks while restrengthening to EF2 intensity. Two mobile homes were completely destroyed as the tornado crossed US 59 and hardwood trees in the area were snapped, denuded, and partially debarked. The tornado then weakened back to EF1 strength as it continued to the east-northeast, damaging more trees, including one large tree that fell on a mobile home, destroying it while barely missing a man sitting at his computer. The tornado then dissipated near FM 942 southwest of Barnes at 6:15\u00a0p.m. CDT (23:15 UTC).[85][86] The tornado was on the ground for 40 minutes and tracked 29.78 miles (47.93\u00a0km), with a peak width of 1,100 yards (1,000\u00a0m). A total of 291 homes were affected by the tornado in Onalaska alone, 46 of which were destroyed. All three fatalities and 33 injures were also in Onalaska. This was the first of multiple strong tornadoes from this long\u2013tracked supercell.[85][86] This was also the second time Onalaska had been struck by a strong tornado with the first time being May 1, 1967, when an F2 tornado moved through town, injuring two people.[87]"

The second named storm of the 2018 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, Mekunu developed out of a low-pressure area on May\u00a021. It gradually intensified, passing east of Socotra on May\u00a023 as a very intense tropical cyclone. On May\u00a025, Mekunu reached its peak intensity. The India Meteorological Department estimated 10\u00a0minute sustained winds of 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph), making Mekunu an extremely severe cyclonic storm. The American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center estimated slightly higher 1\u00a0minute winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph). While at peak intensity, Mekunu made landfall near Raysut, Oman, on May 25. The storm rapidly weakened over land, dissipating on May 27. While passing near Socotra, Cyclone Mekunu dropped heavy rainfall, causing landslides and flooding that killed 20\u00a0people. In the eastern Yemeni mainland, the cyclone caused power outages and flooding, resulting in four fatalities. In Oman, Cyclone Mekunu killed seven people and caused about US$1.5\u00a0billion in damage. Rainfall from Mekunu reached 617\u00a0mm (24.3\u00a0in) in Salalah. The rainfall created desert lakes in the Empty Quarter, or Rub' al Khali, contributing to a locust outbreak that affected 10\u00a0countries, including Pakistan where the outbreak led to a state of emergency."

        "content": "On May\u00a018, an area of convection persisted in the Arabian Sea, northwest of the Maldives, with a broad circulation. With very warm ocean temperatures over 29\u00a0\u00b0C (84\u00a0\u00b0F) and moderate wind shear, atmospheric conditions were conducive for eventual tropical cyclone development. At the same time of the disturbance's formation, Cyclone Sagar was located in the Gulf of Aden.[2] On May\u00a020, a distinct low-pressure area developed over the central Arabian Sea.[3] The convection became increasingly organized, aided by good outflow to the north and south.[4] On May\u00a021, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) classified the system as a depression.[3] The American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) followed suit and began issuing advisories on the system early on May\u00a022, designating it Tropical Cyclone 02A.[5] Upon its formation, the storm was moving northwestward toward the Arabian Peninsula, steered by a ridge to the northeast. Both the IMD and the JTWC anticipated steady intensification, due to decreasing wind shear.[3][5] On May\u00a022, the IMD upgraded the depression to a deep depression, and later a cyclonic storm, naming it Mekunu.[3] An eye feature developed in the center of the storm on May\u00a023, indicative of an intensifying storm.[6] That day, the IMD upgraded Mekunu to a Very Severe Cyclonic Storm \u2013 the equivalent of a minimal hurricane \u2013 while the storm passing east of Socotra.[3] There was uncertainty in predictive storm models around this time whether Mekunu would continue to the northwest, or turn to the northeast,[6] although the storm would continue its northwest trajectory for the remainder of its duration.[3] On May\u00a024, Mekunu weakened slightly due to a bout of easterly wind shear, causing the eye to become ragged.[7] However, the storm re-intensified, and the thunderstorms organized into a compact area near the center around the eye.[8] The IMD upgraded Mekunu to an extremely severe cyclonic storm on May\u00a025, estimating peak 3-minute sustained winds of 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph).[3] On the same day, the JTWC estimated peak winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph), equivalent to a Category\u00a03 on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale.[8] At its peak intensity, Mekunu had a compact 13\u00a0km (8\u00a0mi) eye, which was visible on satellite imagery.[9] Between 18:30\u201319:30\u00a0UTC on May\u00a025, Mekunu made landfall at peak intensity on southern Oman, near Raysut.[3] It was the first storm of hurricane intensity to strike Dhofar Governorate since 1959.[10] The storm rapidly weakened over the dry, mountainous terrain of western Oman.[11] On May\u00a027, the IMD downgraded Mekunu to a well-marked low-pressure area, near the borders of Oman, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia.[3]"

Salalah Airport was shut down for a period of 24\u00a0hours.[12] Cyclone Mekunu dropped heavy rainfall on Socotra island while passing to its east, causing floods that knocked out most of the island's communications. This spurred the Yemeni government to declare a state of emergency.[12] More than 1,000\u00a0households evacuated, utilizing 11\u00a0shelters in the island's capital, Hadibu, or otherwise staying with relatives.[13][14][15] Flooding washed out the main road connecting Hadibu with Socotra Airport,[10] and roads on the east and west side of the island.[13] Landslides covered farms, destroyed food stocks, knocked down palm trees, and washed away thousands of animals.[15][16][14][17] The storm also damaged water wells, causing interruptions to sewage systems, and leaving residents without clean drinking water.[14][17] Five cars were destroyed by the floods, and several houses were damaged.[17][14] The storm capsized 120\u00a0fishing boats and wrecked over 500\u00a0fishing net.[12] Throughout the island, Mekunu killed at least 20\u00a0people.[17] On the Yemeni mainland, flooding rains damaged roads, vehicles, and buildings in Hadhramaut and Al Mahrah Governorates. The cyclone damaged power lines and generators, causing power outages. In Alaibri, flooding isolated about 2,000\u00a0people for about three days.[17] The storm capsized two ships in Al Ghaydah.[14] Across the Yemeni mainland, Mekunu killed four people and injured twenty others.[17] Cyclone Mekunu struck Oman at peak intensity,[3] bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall. Over a four-day period, the cyclone dropped 617\u00a0mm (24.3\u00a0in) in Salalah, which is five times the average annual rainfall. During a 24-hour period, the storm dropped 278\u00a0mm (10.9\u00a0in) of rainfall. The heavy rainfall flooded roads, low-lying areas, and wadis, or dry river beds.[10] The rains collected in area dams,[18] and created lakes in Rub' al Khali, or the Empty Quarter, a large desert that typically receives 30\u00a0mm (1.2\u00a0in) of annual rainfall. The rains created the first lakes in the desert in nearly 20\u00a0years, which was expected to grow vegetation that could feed local camels for two years.[19] Salalah, just east of the landfall location, recorded sustained winds of 96\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph).[11] Dhalkoot, along the coast, recorded wind gusts of 110\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph).[10] Across Oman, particularly near Salalah, Mekunu damaged houses, cars, boats, and other property, resulting in 1,123\u00a0insurance claims as of December\u00a031, totalling \ufdfc155\u00a0million (US$403\u00a0million).[20][21] The Aon insurance company estimated US$1.5\u00a0billion in damage.[22] Seven people died in Oman, including one who died after being in a coma for nine days.[23]"

Saudi Arabia sent its first plane of aid on May\u00a027.[12][13][17][24] The UAE also sent helicopters to search for missing people, and airlifted 17\u00a0people injured during the storm. The crew from the UAE helped reopen the island's roads.[17][13][25] The Qatar Red Crescent Society sent five medical teams, along with emergency supplies.[16] By May\u00a026, Socotra's airport and port were reopened.[17] The United Nations Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS) carried four flights of food, shelter, and water supplies.[26] On the Yemeni mainland, local Red Cross chapters provided water and food to affected residents. Workers cleared roads to restore access to isolated villages.[17] The Oman State Council Bureau noted that national unity during the storm helped mitigate storm effects, including cooperation between military, police, information agencies, and volunteers.[27] The General Directorate of Nature Conservation worked with the Dhofar governorate to plant 600\u00a0seedlings of Avicennia, to replace the plants washed out during the storm.[28] The heavy rainfall from Mekunu created favorable breeding conditions for locusts in the Rub' al Khali, or the Empty Quarter. Five months after the storm, Cyclone Luban brought additional rainfall to the region, allowing for more locusts to breed. By February 2019, a locust infestation had spread across the Arabian Peninsula and into Iran, and later into the Horn of Africa, India, and Pakistan, eventually reaching 10\u00a0countries. In February 2020, Pakistan declared an emergency due to the locusts threatening food security.[29][30][31]"

On October\u00a010, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) upgraded Luban to a very severe cyclonic storm \u2013 equivalent to a Category\u00a01 hurricane \u2013 and estimated maximum sustained winds of 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph). The storm made landfall on October\u00a014 in eastern Yemen, as a cyclonic storm. The storm quickly weakened over the dry, mountainous terrain of the Arabian Peninsula, before dissipating on October\u00a015. Upon moving ashore, Cyclone Luban produced flooding rains in Somalia, Oman, and Yemen. The cyclone killed 14\u00a0people in Yemen, when heavy rainfall cut off villages and damaged roads. Damage in the country was estimated at US$1\u00a0billion.[nb 1] In Oman, desert rainfall caused a small locust outbreak. Luban coexisted with Very Severe Cyclonic Storm Titli in the Bay of Bengal, marking the first time since 1971 that two storms of such intensity were active at the same time in the North Indian Ocean."

        "content": "On October\u00a04, an upper-level low persisted over the southeast Arabian Sea.[1] That day, the American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) first mentioned an area of scattered convection southwest of India as an area for potential tropical cyclogenesis, due to projections from tropical cyclone forecast models. The convective system was located in the warm waters of the Arabian Sea in an area of low wind shear.[2] The circulation slowly became more defined,[3] developing a low-pressure area on October\u00a05. On October\u00a06, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) designated the system as Depression ARB 04. A day later, the agency upgraded the system to a deep depression, and on October\u00a08, the IMD upgraded it further to Cyclonic Storm Luban.[1] On the same day, the JTWC initiated advisories on Luban, giving it the designation Tropical Cyclone 05A.[4] By that time the JTWC initiated advisories, Luban had rotating rainbands around a persistent central area of thunderstorms, with good outflow to the north. The circulation became better defined over time, steered generally west-northwestward by a subtropical ridge to its north.[4] On October\u00a09, the IMD upgraded Luban to a severe cyclonic storm,[5] as the thunderstorms continued to bloom over the circulation.[6] A day later, the IMD upgraded Luban further to a very severe cyclonic storm, with maximum sustained winds of at least 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph), equivalent to a hurricane.[7] Luban coexisted with Very Severe Cyclonic Storm Titli, marking the first time since 1977 that two storms of such intensity were active at the same time in the North Indian Ocean.[1] The JTWC also upgraded Luban to the same intensity on October\u00a010, noting the development of an eye feature.[8] Both the IMD and the JTWC estimated that Luban attained a peak winds of 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph). They also forecasted that the storm would continue its general trajectory and strike the Arabian Peninsula.[9][10] Caught between two ridges, Luban moved slowly toward the Arabian Peninsula. The slow movement caused upwelling, which cooled the waters, thus weakening the cyclone despite otherwise favorable conditions. The central core of convection diminished and became restricted to the eastern side of the circulation.[11][12] On October\u00a013, thunderstorm activity increased over the center, signaling some re-intensification.[13] Luban again weakened as it approached land, affected by the cooler water and air temperatures.[14] On October\u00a014, around 06:00\u00a0UTC, Luban made landfall in eastern Yemen, about 30\u00a0km (20\u00a0mi) south of Al Ghaydah, with winds of 75\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph).[15] The storm rapidly weakened over the dry and mountainous terrain,[16] degenerating into a well-marked low on October 15.[1]"

Dalkout reported a 24-hour precipitation total of 145\u00a0mm (5.71\u00a0in) and Salalah of 138\u00a0mm (5.43\u00a0in).[19] The rains created temporary lakes between desert dunes, which produced a small locust outbreak.[20] To the south of the center, the outer rainbands of Luban dropped rains in Puntland, Somalia.[21] Cyclone Luban struck Yemen in the midst of a civil war and a cholera outbreak.[22] The United Nations Population Fund moved 1,250\u00a0rapid response kits to coastal areas of Yemen in anticipation of Luban's landfall. Medical teams also moved to the region on standby in preparation for storm victims.[23] Luban dropped heavy rainfall upon moving ashore, reaching 290\u00a0mm (11\u00a0in) in Al Ghaydah; there, wind gusts reached 102\u00a0km/h (63\u00a0mph).[1] Luban caused about US$1\u00a0billion in damage in Yemen,[24] with the worst effects in Al Mahrah Governorate,[25] where about 90% of the infrastructure was damaged. The storm killed 14\u00a0people in the country, and 124\u00a0people were injured, with 10\u00a0people missing. About 8,000\u00a0people were left homeless because of Luban.[26] Storm damage forced 2,203\u00a0families to leave their houses, using 38\u00a0schools for shelter.[27] Flooding washed away thousands of livestock,[28] and damaged Yemen's coastal roads and bridges, which disrupted relief efforts.[27][29] Dirt roads were washed away, isolating seven villages and about 3,000\u00a0people.[30] The port of Nishtun was closed during the storm, but was reopened in the subsequent weeks.[29][27] In Al-Masilah, flooding damaged or destroyed 62\u00a0houses. The storm damaged the hospital in Qishn District, forcing all workers to evacuate, and shutting down the facility for at least a week.[27] The storm damaged about 90% of the power grid in Al Ghaydah.[29] Many areas lost access to clean water after wells were destroyed. The Yemeni Red Crescent operated search and rescue missions, with help from a helicopter sent by Saudi Arabia.[27] In the storm's aftermath, various governments and non-governmental organizations provided emergency supplies to residents affected by Luban. The King Salman Relief Centre sent two trucks from Aden to the worst affected areas to distribute tents, blankets, and mattresses. The Oman Charitable Organization sent seven trucks with food and other supplies to eastern Yemen. The World Health Organization sent three tons of medical supplies, including kits for cholera, malaria, and general trauma.[29][27] About 10\u00a0days after the storm struck, the Emirates Red Crescent reconnected seven villages after clearing debris and restoring the dirt roads.[30] Al Mahrah Governorate allocated \ufdfc\u200e2\u00a0billion (US$2.55\u00a0million) for repairing public facilities.[24]"

The IMD estimated peak winds of 150\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph), while the American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) estimated peak winds of 195\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph). Late on October\u00a010, Titli made landfall in Andhra Pradesh, and it quickly weakened over land as it turned to the northeast. It degenerated into a remnant low on October\u00a012. Ahead of the storm's landfall in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, about 300,000\u00a0people evacuated. Titli ultimately killed 89\u00a0people from its impacts, including 85 in India. The cyclone produced strong winds, with gusts to 126\u00a0km/h (78\u00a0mph), along with a storm surge that flooded coastal areas. The storm also dropped heavy rainfall as it moved through India. Mohana in Odisha recorded 460\u00a0mm (18\u00a0in) of rainfall over 48\u00a0hours. This caused floods and landslides, crop damage, fallen trees, and power outages that affected at least 400,000\u00a0people. Throughout India, Titli damaged 127,081\u00a0houses, forcing 63,562\u00a0people to stay in relief camps. Damage in the country was estimated at \u20b96,673.1\u00a0crore (US$920\u00a0million). Four people died in Bangladesh due to landslides."

        "content": "As early as October\u00a03, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) anticipated the development of a tropical cyclone in the Bay of Bengal. Environmental conditions for development included warm sea surface temperatures up to 31\u00a0\u00b0C (88\u00a0\u00b0F) and low wind shear. Early on October\u00a07, a low pressure area developed in the Andaman Sea, accompanied by intense convection, or thunderstorms.[1] A weak anticyclone was located over an elongated low-level circulation associated with the system. With tropical cyclone forecast models uncertain about the system's future, the American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) assessed a low chance for development on October\u00a07.[2] On October\u00a08, the system organized into a depression in the central Bay of Bengal, supported by a moist environment.[1] The circulation gradually became better organized, developing outflow in its periphery.[3] The depression moved generally northwestward toward the southeast coast of India, steered by a ridge to its northeast. With favorable conditions, the depression gradually strengthened, first to a deep depression late on October\u00a08, and further into a cyclonic storm early the next day; at that time, the IMD named the storm Titli.[1] Also on October\u00a09, the JTWC initiated warnings on the system, classifying it as Tropical Cyclone 06B.[4] As it approached the coast of India, Titli underwent rapid deepening as its structure evolved into a mature cyclone. The storm intensified into a severe cyclonic storm late on October\u00a09. Early the next day, Titli strengthened further into a very severe cyclonic storm, as an eye formed in the center of the thunderstorms. At the same time, Very Intense Cyclonic Storm Luban was located in the Arabian Sea, marking the first time since 1977 where there were two simultaneous very severe cyclonic storms in the North Indian Ocean. Titli continued strengthening, with estimated peak winds of 150\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph) according to the IMD.[1] Meanwhile, the JTWC assessed that the cyclone reached peak winds of 195\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph), the equivalent of a Category\u00a03 on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale.[5] Late on October\u00a010, Titli made landfall near Palasa, Andhra Pradesh, at peak intensity, as its eye contracted to a diameter of 12\u00a0km (7.5\u00a0mi).[1] The storm quickly weakened over land as it turned to the northeast through Odisha state, encountering cooler, drier air as it moved around the western end of the ridge.[1][6] By late on October\u00a011, Titli fell back to depression status. It moved into West Bengal and weakened into a well-marked low on October\u00a012, spreading into neighboring Bangladesh.[1]"

        "content": "Ahead of Titli's landfall, officials in India and Bangladesh warned for fishermen to avoid sailing through Titli in the Bay of Bengal and to seek shelter.[7][8] The IMD issued various bulletins and warnings for the public via social media, WhatsApp, and other briefings to the press.[1] Officials advised people in coastal areas to evacuate,[9] and ultimately about 300,000\u00a0people left their houses, using about 2,000\u00a0shelters and relief camps.[10] 123\u00a0pregnant women were transported to hospitals as a precaution.[11] Schools and child-care centers were closed in parts of Odisha.[12] The Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority suspended river transport vessels during the passage of the storm.[13] While moving through southeastern India, Titli dropped heavy rainfall. Mohana, Odisha recorded 460\u00a0mm (18\u00a0in) of rainfall over 48\u00a0hours. Tekkali in northeastern Andhra Pradesh recorded 330\u00a0mm (13\u00a0in) of precipitation over the same time period. Heavy rainfall also occurred in West Bengal and across northeast India. In addition to floods from rainfall, Titli produced a storm surge as it moved ashore. Palasa in Andhra Pradesh recorded a water rise of about 1\u00a0m (3.3\u00a0ft). The cyclone also produced strong winds near its landfall point, with gusts estimated as high as 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph).[1] Korlam in extreme northeastern Andhra Pradesh recorded wind gusts of 126\u00a0km/h (78\u00a0mph).[14] Across southeastern India, Titli killed 85\u00a0people, with eight of the deaths in Andhra Pradesh, and the other 77 in Odisha.[1] In Gajapati district in Odisha, a single landslide killed 12\u00a0people, after residents sought refuge in a cave.[15] Other deaths occurred due to floods, housing damage, and falling trees.[16][14] Damage from flooding caused by Titli totaled at \u20b93,673.1 crore (US$507 million) in Andhra Pradesh,[17] and \u20b93,000 crore (US$413 million) in Odisha.[18] Along its path, Titli damaged 127,081\u00a0houses, forcing 63,562\u00a0people to stay in relief camps.[19] Floodwaters entered the jail in Asika.[19] Two major rivers, the Rushikulya and the Vamsadhara, swelled to reach dangerous levels, causing flooding in three districts that affected more than 600,000\u00a0people.[20] The cyclone uprooted many trees along its path,[1] blocking roads and knocking down power lines.[1][14] Authorities estimated that 6,000 to 7,000 electrical poles were uprooted by Titli's strong winds. As a result, 400,000 to 500,000 people were without power in Andhra Pradesh.[21] In Srikakulam, residents faced water shortages when the storm polluted wells and water systems. At least five bridges were damaged across the area.[19] Floods damaged more than 3,785\u00a0km2 (1,461\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of crops,[22] and killed many farm animals, including more than 40,000\u00a0birds.[19] Titli caused major destruction to the East Coast railway, forcing the cancellation of at least six trains.[23] In Visakhapatnam along the coast, the winds damaged six boats. Three people were lost when their boat went missing from Vizianagaram.[14] To help residents affected by the storm, the Odisha government provided financial compensation to families for 15\u00a0days, with a family of four receiving more than \u20b93,000 (US$22).[20] After the storm, 15 teams from the National Disaster Response Force, along with the Odisha Disaster Rapid Action Force, were placed around Odisha.[24] Firefighters and other crews removed trees from roads. Officials provided meals and plastic sheeting for people affected by storm damage.[11] Helicopters dropped meals to people in difficult to reach areas.[15] Caritas India, a Catholic relief organization, provided families with sheeting and cleaning, including mosquito nets, blankets, and tarpaulins.[22] In Andhra Pradesh, N. Chandrababu Naidu announced a series of relief measures to provide relief to people in Srikakulam District. After having undertaken visits to Mandals such as Vajrapukotturu and Palasa he ensured the supply of 50\u00a0kg worth rice to those belonging to the Fishermen community and 25\u00a0kg to those belonging to other communities. The government would also ensure the supply of other necessary goods such as potatoes, pulses and onions. Moreover, a compensation of Rs.1 lakh was given to the next to kin of the 7 people who lost their lives, along with other compensatory measures such as Rs. 1000 to those whose houses and shops were damaged, Rs. 5000 compensation for loss of cattle and compensation to farmers for damage to crops on basis of a survey. He also prioritized the immediate restoration of drinking water and power, clearing of roads by removing uprooted trees and undertaking repair work of railway stations and railway quarters.[25] Cyclone Titli's effects extended into Bangladesh, where Cox's Bazar recorded three days of heavy rainfall.[26] There, the storm damaged at least 15\u00a0buildings, including some facilities for Rohingya refugee camps.[27] Landslides in Chittagong killed four people after wrecking two houses.[28]"

The floods were described by the media and residents as \"one of the biggest disasters the area has ever faced\".[2] Residents of the area were forced to abandon their cars and homes because of the rising, powerful floodwaters. The residents of the southern area of the village Polia were forced to evacuate because of a broken embankment in the area, and were taken by a bus to a hotel in Didymoteicho temporarily, to prevent injuries and deaths."

Many houses including the central square of the village were flooded and local authorities were present in the area for hours.[5] Residents managed to get inside the village church to save themselves.[6] Schools in Mikro Dereio were closed on the spot.[7]\nAt the same time, an iron bridge was destroyed by the water pressure in the village Loutra near Alexandroupoli. The bridge used to connect the two sides of the village. Warning signs were placed by the authorities of the Municipality of Alexandroupoli.[8] Few hours later, Bulgaria opened up the Ivaylovgrad Dam, releasing large amounts of water in the Evros river.[9] Around 14:00, the river of Erythropotamos started exceeding the expected levels and reached the top of the embankment around the river. In the meantime, the fields around Metaxades started to flood. Around 15:00, a bus carrying passengers from Alexandroupoli to Orestiada was trapped at the Feres agency, unable to go anywhere because of all the roads being blocked due to floods. Teachers that worked in Alexandroupoli were unable to return to their home, and that resulted in them staying in Feres and Tychero all day. Around 16:00, Erythropotamos overflowed and embankments broke, causing severe damage to fields and properties around the area of many villages of the Didymoteicho municipality. A few minutes later, the General Regional Police Directorate of Eastern Macedonia & Thrace announced the cessation of traffic on the National Road Ardaniou - Ormeniou (A21), from the settlement of Provatona to the District of Dadia. Around 17:00, the village of Poros was evacuated because of the overflow of the stream \"Tsai\" which led to the decision by the mayor of Alexandroupoli, Giannis Zampoukis.\nAround 19:00, the Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that in the next few hours an increase in the water level of the rivers Arda and Erythropotamos is expected following the gradual and controlled release of water from the Ivaylovgrad Dam. A few minutes later, The Police Department of Alexandroupoli decided to temporarily stop the traffic. Around 20:30, the river level of Erythropotamos has exceeded the vigilance limit and has reached 5.81 meters with an alarm limit of 7 meters. At this time, many villages in the area of Erythropotamos flooded with severe damages in buildings and fields from powerful water pressure. The aqueduct in the area of Alepochori went underwater and this led to the water being cut off for Alepochori and Polia. Other villages experienced the same water issue but it wasn't critical damage. In the meantime, the residents of the southern area of the village Polia were forced to evacuate their houses because of a broken embankment in the area, allowing floods to speed up, and were taken by a bus to a hotel in Didymoteicho temporarily, to prevent injuries and deaths. Around 23:00, the road between the villages Polia and Avdella was cut in half due to water pressure. Under that road were optical fibers for internet and telephones, which were cut apart. That led to telecommunications being unavailable in Alepochori.[10]"

The snow melting in combination with the heavy rainfall caused new serious floods in many areas. Around 10:30, military vehicles and vehicles of the municipality of Alexandroupoli went to the settlement of Apalos in order to transport the children of the Kindergarten, where the power cut off and the ground floor started to flood, to the church of the village so that the parents could pick them up. At the same time, the municipality of Alexandroupoli announced the suspension of the operation of all school units in Apalos. The settlements of Antheia and Maistros face serious problems as the water level is constantly rising. Around 11:00, streets in Soufli and Agnantia flooded and the authorities was present in areas needing help. Around 12:00, in High School of Antheia, students and teachers were trapped inside. Also, traffic was stopped on the National Road Ardaniou - Ormeniou (A21), from the village Thymaria to Provatonas. Around 13:00, students were trapped in the school of Apalos, and for this reason a rescue operation was set up by the fire brigade. During the operation, however, the 46-year-old Chief Firefighter Zafeiropoulos Ioannis, driver of a fire truck that participated in the efforts and \"stuck\" in the rainwater, as he was walking away, was swept away by the rushing waters and was found dead near the airport streams. Two other colleagues were in the vehicle, who managed to get out safely.[11][12] His death caused pan-Hellenic shock and mourning. Around 16:00, the national road and many streets were flooded. Many fields were destroyed and some houses were damaged. Later that day, announcements from the mayor of Alexandroupoli were made about the suspension of schools in Apalos and Antheia due to dangers and due to damages on buildings."

Houses were flooded inside and destroyed furniture and personal items of residents. Many farmers had significant loss due to field and agricultural vehicle damage. Some areas of the embankments in Alepochori and Polia were broken, leaving the area vulnerable for future floods. The broken embankments also restrict farmers and residents from visiting specific areas because of destroyed paths. Some machines in the aqueducts were damaged due to being under water during the floods, which led to the water being cut off for about a week. As a result, the inhabitants of some settlements were forced to carry buckets of water from water sources in the wider area of their places of residence. A few days later, in consultation with the authorities, the mayors and the presidents of the cities and settlements, bottles of water were sent to each resident. Some roads were destroyed, which have led to major traffic inconveniences. Under the road that collapsed in Avdella, there were optical fibers which were responsible for the internet connection and for the interconnection of the landlines in the villages of Alepochori and Polia. This led to severe optical fiber damage that took about two months to repair, leaving children unable to attend e-learning (which was mandatory of a general COVID-19 lockdown that was going on since November) for weeks until a solution was to be found. The most tragic event of the floods is the death of the 46-year-old firefighter Ioannis Zafeiropoulos, who was the father of three children and participated in an operation to free students from school due to the floods. He gave up his last breath, in his attempt to free students in a school in the area of Apalos.[13]"

It was the deadliest and longest-tracked tornado in an outbreak that produced numerous strong tornadoes in several states; 57 fatalities were confirmed in the tornado.[2] Early estimates suggested that the tornado family\u2014identified by some media outlets as a \"Quad-State tornado\", due to the storm's long track and similarity to the 219-mile (352\u00a0km) Tri-State tornado of 1925\u2014might have cut a path of up to 250 miles (400\u00a0km) across the affected areas, making it the longest-tracked tornado in history.[4][5][6] However, storm surveys found that the majority of the storm's path consisted of two distinct EF4 tornadoes, with three short-lived and weak tornadoes in between them in northwestern Obion County, Tennessee. The parent supercell that produced the two EF4 tornadoes, and eleven tornadoes in total, later became known as the \"Quad-State supercell\"."

        "header": "Meteorological synopsis",
        "content": "On December 8, the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) outlined a slight risk of severe weather across a broad area of the Mississippi Valley. Despite the potential for a higher-end severe threat to materialize, forecasters expressed uncertainty regarding the extent of instability, degree of directional wind shear, and late timing of potential storms.[7] The following day, the SPC noted the increased potential for organized severe thunderstorms in the region extending from southeastern Arkansas northeast into southern Indiana, upgrading that area to an enhanced risk.[8] As an intense upper-level trough progressed across the High Plains, with robust instability and moisture return across the Mississippi Valley, the SPC expanded the enhanced risk and introduced a moderate risk area from northeastern Arkansas into southern Illinois on the morning of December 10. Forecasters indicated that atmospheric conditions favored the development of nocturnal supercells capable of producing long-tracked, strong tornadoes.[9] At 3:00\u00a0p.m. CST (21:00\u00a0UTC), the SPC issued a tornado watch across the highest risk area (encompassing central and eastern Arkansas, west Tennessee, northwestern Mississippi, southeastern Missouri, and southern portions of Illinois and Indiana), the first of eleven issued over subsequent hours over the middle Mississippi Valley.[10] Initial storms developed across central Arkansas around 2:00\u00a0p.m. CST (20:00\u00a0UTC), with even weaker activity developing over central Missouri a little over 1+1\u20442 hours later; additional clusters of thunderstorms developed over southwestern Missouri (forming between Bolivar and Carthage, eventually back-building into northeastern Oklahoma) and central Arkansas (forming southwest of Hot Springs) between 5:00 and 5:30\u00a0p.m. CST (23:00\u201323:30\u00a0UTC).[11] Though this activity lacked much vigor at its onset due to a strong capping inversion,[12] the convective cells began to show organization as they progressed eastward. One such storm\u2014which formed from the initial mid-afternoon activity near Arkadelphia, Arkansas\u2014matured into a long-lived supercell as it progressed in an unstable, deeply moist, and highly sheared environment;[13] this cell ultimately persisted for more than 550 miles (890\u00a0km) over several hours from eastern Arkansas to northeastern Kentucky, producing two large and intense tornadoes along its track, among eleven tornadoes in total. The cell started showing signs of surface-based rotation southwest of Searcy, Arkansas, around 5:30\u00a0p.m. CST (23:30\u00a0UTC). At 5:51\u00a0p.m. CST, the National Weather Service office in North Little Rock issued the first tornado warning associated with the storm for portions of Jackson, Lawrence, White, and Woodruff counties.[14] One of the first tornadoes associated with the storm, an EF0, touched down in western Poinsett County (near Weiner) around 6:40\u00a0p.m. CST; about fifteen minutes later, storm spotters reported a large tornado near Greenfield, prompting a PDS tornado warning for portions of Poinsett, Craighead and Mississippi counties (including areas to the south of Jonesboro).[15] Doppler radar analysis estimated that the supercell maintained a nearly continuous high-end rotational vorticity signature, averaging 94\u00a0mph (151\u00a0km/h; 82\u00a0kn) for approximately four hours and 20 minutes, a rarity among thunderstorms that produce mesocyclonic vorticity exceeding such speeds (averaging 1.5% of all supercells). The only velocities below said average recorded along the storm track were observed between 8:44 and 9:01\u00a0p.m. CST [02:44\u20133:01 UTC] as the storm crossed from Obion County, Tennessee into Hickman County, Kentucky. This time frame coincides with the start of the Western Kentucky tornado, implying the supercell underwent a mesocyclone re-strengthening phase during this period. During this intense tornado's lifetime, peak gate-to-gate velocities of 128\u00a0mph (206\u00a0km/h; 111\u00a0kn) were recorded at 9:58\u00a0p.m. CST (04:58 UTC) over northeastern Marshall County, Kentucky.[16][17][18] Elsewhere, multiple lines of intense storms, some featuring embedded supercells, developed across the Mississippi Valley region through the overnight hours and generated other strong and long-lived tornadoes.[19][20] By the pre-dawn hours of December\u00a011, a decrease in instability led to a gradual weakening of a line of thunderstorms stretching along the associated cold front from eastern Kentucky southward into central Alabama.[21][22] The SPC issued a record-setting 43 mesoscale discussions (MCD) throughout the course of the day (12 UTC December 10 to 12 UTC December 11), all of which were associated with the broader storm system: 38 of the MCDs issued were convective discussions relating to the severe thunderstorm activity, and five were non-convective discussions relating to heavy snow associated with the system that concurrently fell throughout much of the Upper Midwest.[23] The National Weather Service (NWS) issued a total of 149 tornado warnings throughout the night across nine states: Arkansas, Tennessee, Missouri, Mississippi, Kentucky, Illinois, and Indiana.[24][18] These included multiple 'particularly dangerous situation' (PDS) tornado warnings and tornado emergencies in Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Missouri. Eight of the tornado warnings issued during the event by the NWS offices in Memphis, Tennessee, and Paducah, Kentucky, were tornado emergencies, the most ever issued during the month of December (breaking the previous record of three issued on December 23, 2015).[25][26] Effects from the system responsible for the outbreak extended into Canada, where the Meteorological Service of Canada issued wind and heavy rainfall warnings for portions of Ontario. However, no tornadoes were expected nor reported north of the border.[27]"

After the dissipation of that tornado in Obion County northeast of Samburg, the supercell produced three weak, brief tornadoes before this one formed several miles to the northeast. The tornado initially caused minor damage to trees and roofs as it moved through the north side of Woodland Mills, crossing SR 5. After moving northeast a one-half mile (0.80\u00a0km), it crossed the Tennessee\u2013Kentucky state line near the community of State Line in Fulton County, causing additional tree damage rated EF0. The total damage caused by the tornado in Tennessee was estimated at $25,000 (2021 USD).[28] Farther to the northeast, the tornado reached EF2 strength, tearing roofs off homes, damaging or destroying outbuildings, damaging irrigation equipment, and ripping apart trailer homes. Soon after, the tornado became violent and directly impacted the small community of Cayce at low-end EF4 intensity, where multiple homes and small businesses were damaged or destroyed, with some that were leveled or swept clean from their foundations. A music venue housed in an old school building was badly damaged, and the Cayce Volunteer Fire Department building was totally destroyed, with the metal beams of the structure severely twisted as pieces of heavy machinery were tossed around. Several outbuildings and mobile homes were also obliterated. One fatality occurred in Cayce, and several other people were injured.[2][29] After moving to the northeast of Cayce, the tornado weakened but still remained strong as it moved through rural areas to the northeast of town at EF3 intensity, destroying barns and a cell tower, and tearing the roof and exterior walls from a house. The tornado moved into Hickman County and appeared to intensify dramatically as it crossed US 51, where extreme ground scouring occurred in nearby fields. The tornado scoured multiple trenches into the ground in this area, with all grass and several inches of topsoil removed in the worst affected areas.[30] However, no structures were impacted near US 51, and no rating was applied to the intense scouring. EF3 damage continued past this point as homes and metal truss towers were destroyed. EF2 damage was noted as it tracked into Graves County, closely paralleling Purchase Parkway and US 45 directly toward the city of Mayfield. A house along KY 339 had its roof torn off, and many trees and power poles were downed in this area.[31]"

        "content": "The National Weather Service issued a tornado emergency for Mayfield at 9:26\u00a0p.m. CST (03:26 UTC) as the now-massive wedge tornado approached the town from the southwest.[31] As the tornado entered Mayfield, it regained EF4 intensity, and numerous homes were damaged or destroyed along Cardinal Road, some of which were leveled or swept from their foundations. Trees in this area were debarked and denuded, cars were thrown, and mobile homes were obliterated. EF4 damage continued after the tornado crossed over Mayfield Bypass (US 45 Bypass/I-69), where Mayfield Consumer Products, a candle factory where approximately 110 employees were working, was flattened.[32][33] The large metal-framed warehouse building completely collapsed, trapping many employees and resulting in eight deaths and numerous injuries.[34][35][32][33] Allegedly, workers' jobs had been threatened if they left the factory between the first and second tornado warnings for the area\u00a0\u2013 a tornado warning had been issued earlier that evening at approximately 5:30\u00a0p.m. CST\u00a0\u2013 and then again after the second tornado warning was issued after 9:00\u00a0p.m. CST.[36] Several other industrial businesses were also damaged or destroyed near the candle factory, while semi-trucks and other industrial vehicles were thrown and destroyed as well, some of which were left unrecognizable.[29] After briefly weakening to EF3 intensity, the tornado intensified even further, reaching just below high-end EF4 intensity as it moved along US 45 and tore directly through the center of Mayfield, resulting in widespread, catastrophic damage throughout the historic downtown square, listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its late Victorian and Classical Revival architecture.[37][38] Most of the structures in downtown Mayfield were heavily damaged or destroyed, including multiple large, well-built, multi-story brick buildings that completely collapsed. Only large piles of bricks and lumber remained in the hardest-hit portions of the downtown area, and streets were left buried under debris. The large and well-constructed Graves County Courthouse had much of its roof torn off, its clock tower collapsed, and it had some of its exterior upper-floor walls knocked down.[39] Several restaurants, an indoor soccer facility, a barber shop, automotive business, gym, bank, movie theater, health and rehab center, and many other businesses were destroyed in downtown Mayfield. Large metal silos were crumpled and heavily damaged at a granary, and the large Mayfield water tower was toppled and destroyed. The post office, city hall, fire station, and police station were also significantly damaged or destroyed,[32] and the emergency operations center lost the ability to transmit radio communications. Three large churches were destroyed in downtown Mayfield, including the First Presbyterian Church, a large and well-built brick structure that was mostly leveled. The First Christian Church sustained collapse of its domed roof and upper walls, while the First United Methodist Church's sanctuary, which was constructed with very thick masonry exterior walls, collapsed. A school bus garage, metal industrial buildings, and apartment buildings also sustained major structural damage or were destroyed in other areas of town. The tornado also devastated residential areas in town, levelling or sweeping numerous homes from their foundations. Many trees were denuded and debarked, and cars were thrown hundreds of yards and mangled. Dual polarization radar imagery showed that the tornado had lofted debris up to 30,000 feet (9,100\u00a0m) into the air as it impacted the city.[40] Twenty-two people were killed in and around Mayfield, with hundreds more injured, many severely.[41][42][43] The tornado's winds peaked at 188\u00a0mph (303\u00a0km/h) in the city.[29]"

        "content": "After leaving Mayfield, the tornado weakened, producing damage at EF2 to EF3 strength and continuing northeast along I-69 and KY 58. A hangar and some small airplanes were destroyed at the Mayfield Graves County Airport, and multiple homes were badly damaged. A church and a business were damaged nearby, and further weakening occurred further to the northeast, where EF0 to EF1 damage to trees and structures was noted. It then intensified again as it approached and crossed the Marshall County line along I-69 before moving through the northwestern and northern outskirts of Benton, damaging or destroying many homes, garages, and outbuildings, downing numerous trees and power lines, and flipping RV campers. Most of the damage through this section of Marshall County ranged from EF2 to EF3 in intensity, though a few homes to the southwest of Benton were leveled or swept from their foundations at high-end EF3 strength.[44] Damage continued through the Briensburg community at EF2 intensity, where homes near and along US 68 sustained partial to total roof loss, outbuildings were damaged or destroyed, and a metal truss transmission tower collapsed. Past Briensburg, EF3 damage was noted along Lowery Road, where a poorly anchored home was leveled, and a few other homes sustained EF2 damage along this segment of the path. The tornado again reached EF4 intensity as it tore directly through the small community of Cambridge Shores, located along the western shore of Kentucky Lake. Numerous homes were completely leveled in Cambridge Shores, including multiple large lakeside homes that were flattened or swept away. Numerous large trees were snapped, denuded, and debarked, and vehicles were thrown in this area. A fire department building had its roof torn off, and large metal boat storage buildings were also destroyed. The tornado then weakened but remained strong as it crossed over Kentucky Lake into Lyon County and moved through the Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area, mowing down a large swath of trees and snapping power poles at EF2 strength as it passed near Twin Lakes before crossing Lake Barkley. After crossing Lake Barkley, the tornado strengthened back to EF3 intensity as it crossed KY 93 and I-24 near the eastern shore of the lake, where many additional homes sustained major damage or were destroyed, including several that were leveled or swept from their foundations.[29] Soon after, it explosively intensified again and crossed into Caldwell County along KY 293, producing EF4 damage as it impacted the south edge of Princeton, where another tornado emergency was issued.[45] 2 miles (3.2\u00a0km) before impacting Princeton, the tornado hit and destroyed a Kentucky mesonet station, which recorded 120.1 miles per hour (193.3\u00a0km/h) winds, setting the new record for the highest measured wind gust in Kentucky history.[46] Within two-miles, the tornado intensified a minimum of 60 miles per hour (97\u00a0km/h).[46] In Princeton, dozens of homes were destroyed along the southern and southeastern fringes of town, especially at the Princeton Golf and Country Club subdivision, where several houses were leveled or swept away. The University of Kentucky Research Center was destroyed, with metal roof trusses carried hundreds of yards from the structure and wrapped around trees. Cars were thrown from the parking lot into adjacent fields, metal light poles were ripped from their concrete footings, and ground scouring was noted as well.[47][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] Trees were stripped of their limbs and partially debarked in and around Princeton, barns and farm buildings were obliterated, livestock was killed, and cycloidal markings were left in fields outside of town. Four fatalities occurred in Princeton, along with numerous injuries. The tornado then followed US 62, producing EF2 to EF3 damage to homes in the small communities of Lewistown and Midway.[29]"

        "content": "Past Midway, the tornado became violent and reached EF4 strength again as it moved along US 62, producing catastrophic damage as it made a direct hit on the city of Dawson Springs, located along the Caldwell\u2013Hopkins county line. A fourth tornado emergency was in effect for Dawson Springs and St. Charles as the storm moved through the area. Residential areas in the northern part of Dawson Springs were devastated, with entire blocks of homes destroyed, many of which were leveled or swept from their foundations. Cars were thrown, copious amounts of structural debris were strewn in all directions, countless trees were shredded and debarked, and only rubble remained in the hardest-hit neighborhoods. The Dawson Village apartment complex was totally destroyed, and several two-story brick apartment buildings sustained EF4 damage there, being largely reduced to rubble with only a few first-floor interior walls left intact. However, Timothy Marshall, a meteorologist, and structural and forensic engineer, Christine L. Wielgos, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service of Paducah, & Brian E. Smith, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service of Omaha, later published a damage survey from Dawson Springs which rated this apartment complex as mid-EF3 intensity with winds estimated at 155 miles per hour (249\u00a0km/h), due to structural flaws that were found.[48] Numerous vehicles were thrown into piles in the parking lot of the complex. Several duplexes were destroyed at Clarkdale Court, including one that was leveled with only a pile of debris remaining. An American Legion post and a car wash were flattened, while a church and a medical clinic sustained major damage. Some logistics facilities and warehouses were leveled in an industrial park as the tornado exited town, and several metal self-storage unit buildings and large garages were obliterated nearby.[49] 14 people were killed in the Dawson Springs area, and many others were injured. A mother and her two children survived with major injuries by hanging on to a mattress as they were thrown 250 feet through the air into a field after the tornado swept their Dawson Springs home from its foundation after crushing them underneath it first.[38][29][50] A photograph was lofted from a destroyed house in Dawson Springs and transported almost 130 miles (210\u00a0km) by the intense tornadic updrafts, eventually being found in New Albany, Indiana.[51] South-southwest of Dawson Springs, a group of storm chasers photographed a possible satellite tornado associated with the parent tornado. However, the National Weather Service did not confirm this.[52][53] Weakening slightly to high-end EF3 strength but continuing to cause major damage, the tornado tracked to the northeast beyond Dawson Springs, passing north of Ilsley and through the rural community of Carbondale. Farm outbuildings and mobile homes were demolished, and multiple houses sustained major damage or were destroyed, some of which were flattened. Additional high-end EF3 damage occurred and another tornado emergency was issued as it moved through Barnsley, just south of Earlington and Helca and just north of Mortons Gap.[54] Almost every house in the small community was damaged or destroyed, including some that were leveled, though they were not well-constructed.[citation needed] A train on the CSX freight line adjacent to US 41 in the town derailed, and 25 multi-ton freight cars were derailed, several of which were thrown from the tracks, including one that was tossed into a house.[55] Thousands of large trees were mowed down, and vehicles were flipped. Past Barnsley, the tornado crossed over another CSX freight line and I-69 before passing through an unpopulated swampy area, where more large trees were snapped or uprooted, and damage was rated EF2. Continuing into northern Muhlenberg County, yet another tornado emergency was issued for the community of Bremen as the tornado approached from the southwest. It abruptly intensified to its peak intensity of high-end EF4 with 190\u00a0mph (310\u00a0km/h) winds as it crossed and paralleled KY 175 through the north side of town. Many homes were destroyed along this portion of the path, including several that were obliterated and completely swept away, with little debris remaining. Large trees sustained severe denuding and debarking, grass was scoured from the ground, and vehicles were thrown through the air and severely mangled. Some of the worst damage in Bremen occurred along Bethlehem Cemetery Road, where a row of four homes were obliterated, with debris scattered and wind-rowed long distances through fields across the street. Concrete floor slabs were torn from the foundation of one home and shattered, while the paved driveway of another residence was cracked and scoured. Houses that were farther away from the center of the damage path sustained roof and exterior wall loss, while mobile homes, barns, garages, and outbuildings were also destroyed. Bethlehem Baptist Church had one of its brick exterior walls blown out and was shifted off of its foundation slightly, while Church Street General Baptist Church lost much of its roof.[56][57] A total of 11 people were killed in and around Bremen, and others were injured.[58] Among the fatalities was District Judge Brian Crick, who represented Muhlenberg and McLean counties, as confirmed in a statement from the Supreme Court of Kentucky on December 11.[59] Some weakening occurred, but significant damage continued after the tornado exited Bremen and crossed US 431 south of Stroud, where some homes and mobile homes were damaged or destroyed, and hundreds of large trees were snapped and denuded. Damage in this area was rated EF2 to low-end EF3.[29]"

It moved through an abandoned coal strip mine, overturning a large section of a coal conveyor belt, snapping many trees, and downing power poles. A few farm outbuildings were also damaged or destroyed in this area. It became strong again north of Centertown along KY 85, producing EF2 damage as multiple homes and outbuildings were damaged or destroyed, including a well-built house that had much of its roof torn off and sustained collapse of an exterior wall. Five large chicken houses were destroyed, and hundreds of large hardwood trees were snapped and uprooted along a quarter-mile wide swath along this section of the path. Weakening back to EF1 intensity, the tornado downed trees along Carter Ferry Road and Mud College Road. The tornado entered a flatter area to the west of Hartford and began to intensify once more, and large steel power poles were bent over or broken along Johnson School Road, earning an EF3 rating. It crossed US 231, I-165, and KY 69 north of Hartford, along with the Rough River three times.[2] Homes and businesses sustained significant EF3 damage in this area, and two tractor-trailers were lifted and thrown 40 yards (37\u00a0m), with one of the cabs being badly mangled. Large barns and garages were completely demolished, and a small brick office structure was destroyed, along with homes, very large silos, and a fertilizer storage facility.[29][60] The last area of EF3-strength damage occurred along KY 69 and Utley Drive northeast of Hartford, where a poorly-anchored block-foundation home was swept away and completely destroyed, and other houses nearby sustained total loss of their roofs and exterior walls. Two anchored mobile homes were also swept away and destroyed, with their frames tossed and bent, one of which was thrown 100 yards (91\u00a0m). An RV camper was thrown 30 yards (27\u00a0m) in this area as well, landing upside down, while tractors and large hay bales were also thrown considerable distances.[29][60] Damage of up to high-end EF2 intensity occurred beyond this point as the tornado crossed Humble Valley Road, Halls Creek Road, and Mount Vernon Road before passing north of Olaton. Homes were significantly damaged, barns and mobile homes were destroyed, a cow was killed, and thousands of large hardwood trees were downed. The tornado paralleled the Ohio\u2013Grayson county line, and very briefly crossed a bend in the Rough River into Grayson County. Hundreds of trees were downed along Cane Ford Road, and an abandoned trailer home was destroyed. The tornado then crossed KY 54, where the last area of EF2 damage occurred, as a frail home was destroyed and left with only a few walls standing, and large trees were snapped, one of which fell on and destroyed a car. Some outbuildings were also damaged or destroyed in this area. Entering Breckinridge County at EF1 intensity, it paralleled the Breckinridge\u2013Grayson county line and passed over KY 110 northwest of Falls of Rough. Hundreds of trees were downed in this area, and a couple of structures sustained minor damage. It downed power lines as it crossed KY 79 at EF0 strength, where it damaged a large boat storage facility and scattered sheet metal debris 300 yards (270\u00a0m) to the northeast, across the runway of a small airport. Some additional minor tree damage occurred before the tornado finally dissipated near Park Drive in Grayson County at 11:48\u00a0p.m. CST (5:48 UTC) as it entered Rough River Dam State Resort Park near Rough River Lake, approximately four miles (6.4\u00a0km) west of McDaniels.[29] The tornado reached a peak width of 2,600 yards (2,400\u00a0m), and was on the ground for nearly three hours, tracking 165.6 miles (266.5\u00a0km) from Woodland Mills to Rough River Dam State Resort Park.[29][60][61] The path was the ninth longest in recorded history.[62] It was rated high-end EF4, with an estimated peak wind speed of 190\u00a0mph (310\u00a0km/h). With a confirmed death toll of 57, it was the deadliest single tornado in the United States since the Joplin, Missouri tornado on May 22, 2011, ten years earlier. A 58th fatality was the result of a heart attack while clearing debris and is listed as indirect.[1]"

Describing the damage as \"almost beyond belief,\" his brief remarks there included an announcement that the disaster declaration had been amended to have the federal government cover the entire cost of debris removal, as well as overtime for law enforcement and emergency personnel for the next month.[70] The tornado's major impacts on Graves County Court operations\u2014including the destruction of the courthouse in Mayfield\u2014led the Kentucky Supreme Court to suspend the county's court operations (including physical and electronic court filings) between December 13, 2021, and January 11, 2022.[71] The Mayfield Messenger, the city's main newspaper, began printing an extra 2,000 copies per printing run of its paper, distributing them for free around the town.[72] By February 14, 2022, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had cleared more than 280,000 cubic yards of debris in Graves County alone, including Mayfield;[73] by April 4, that number had risen to 265,453 cubic yards of debris removed in Mayfield and 433,408 cubic yards in total in Graves County.[74] By May 2022, using excavators, barges, and volunteers, 1.2 million pounds (540,000\u00a0kg) of tornado debris had been removed from Kentucky Lake by the Tennessee Valley Authority and the environmental nonprofit Living Lands and Waters.

Although flooding at its peak between 16 and 18 June affected almost all rivers and streams across the island, in the rest of the state, the flooding did not approach the extent of the better-known 1929 floods. Floods on rivers such as the Derwent and Huon were the largest on record and caused considerable damage."

        "content": "The year 1946 had been one of the wettest on record throughout Tasmania: Hobart's annual rainfall of 1,004 millimetres (40\u00a0in) is the second highest in 130 years of record and featured two record wet months in March and August[1] but the first few months of 1947 were relatively dry. However, an east coast cyclone on 24 and 25 May set in motion a sequence of low pressure systems that produced almost continuous rainfall over southern and western Tasmania that extended occasionally to the rest of the island, especially on the third and fourth of June when falls reached 70 millimetres (2.8\u00a0in) for two days in Hobart and 60 millimetres (2.4\u00a0in) in Swansea. These systems produced only localised flooding, but when a strong frontal system that had produced extremely heavy rain in the far south of Western Australia with record daily falls at Manjimup[2] moved rapidly eastwards and intensified, rainfall over Tasmania, which had been consistent ever since the beginning of the month, intensified to the extent of general falls of over 8 inches (200\u00a0mm) on the highlands and 3 inches (80\u00a0mm) on the southeast coast during the three-day period ending 17 June, a day after the King's Birthday holiday[3] On ground that was already saturated, rivers in the south of Tasmania reached almost unprecedented levels, for instance it is estimated that the Huon reached flows as large as 4,000m3/s,[4] larger than the flow of the Sepik River in New Guinea, whilst the flood on the Derwent was the highest of the twentieth century and not exceeded since at least the 1870s at around 3,500m3/s.[4][5] At Butler's Gorge, hydroelectric operations were completely washed out[6] and it was notable that without energy for heating in most homes during wet weather with maxima around 10\u00a0\u00b0C (50\u00a0\u00b0F) there were no deaths,[6] in part because Lake St. Clair stored enough water to reduce the level of the Derwent by four feet.[7] However, despite the damage to existing hydroelectric services, the floods did not halt operations to develop the hydroelectric potential of more remote parts of the Central Plateau for the reason noted in the previous paragraph. Nonetheless, the flooding persisted so severely throughout the south of Tasmania that no reports reached the outside world as major towns like Huonville and Geeveston were completely isolated from the sixteenth to the nineteenth of the month and the populations of towns such as Bushy Park were evacuated.[5] Most of southern Tasmania's hop crop was completely lost (replanting was not possible for some time afterwards due to extreme soil erosion in the valley), and it is estimated that over a thousand prime beef cattle drowned in the Huonville district.[6]"

        "content": " Potential Tropical Cyclone Seventeen-E was a tropical disturbance that caused damaging floods in Southern Mexico, Guatemala, and El Salvador in mid-October 2019. A tropical wave entered the Eastern Pacific Ocean during October 13\u201314, and a low-pressure area developed by October 14 to the west of Nicaragua. Convection, also known as thunderstorm activity, associated with the system increased in both intensity and extent during October 15, while the system was south of Guatemala. The National Hurricane Center initiated advisories on the system as Potential Tropical Cyclone Seventeen-E on October 16, anticipating that the system would become a tropical cyclone before reaching the southern coast of Mexico. During its existence as a potential tropical cyclone, Seventeen-E had winds of 35\u00a0mph (55\u00a0km/h) and a pressure of 1,005\u00a0mbar (29.68\u00a0inHg). As the storm tracked northwestward towards the coast, its structure decayed, and the chance of tropical cyclogenesis decreased markedly. The disturbance made landfall between Bahias de Huatulco and Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, during mid-day October 16 and dissipated a few hours later. A tropical storm watch was issued for the southern coast of Mexico on October 16. Torrential rainfall occurred throughout the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, Guatemala, and El Salvador. The highest rainfall occurred in the state of Oaxaca, where 445\u00a0mm (17.5\u00a0in) was recorded. There, rainfall flooded and damaged roads and caused rivers to spill their banks; hundreds of homes and other structures were inundated by floodwaters. Several communities were left isolated as a result of rivers flooding roads and bridges. A river also overflowed in Ometepec, Guerrero, sending floodwaters into Talapa. Plan DN-III-E, a disaster relief and rescue plan, was activated in Oaxaca, Guerrero, and Tabasco states. Troops from the Mexican Army were called in to assist with cleanup and rescue efforts in Oaxaca. The storm left a total of 7 people dead in Central America; 6 people were killed in El Salvador and 1 in Guatemala. Nearly 2,000 people were forced to evacuate in El Salvador. There, over 100 homes were inundated and more than 100 schools were damaged. Over 100 landslides occurred and nearly 5 dozen trees fell, damaging roads and homes. Around 10 percent of the country's seasonal bean crop was destroyed. In Guatemala, the streets of several towns were flooded, and landslides and felled trees blocked roads and damaged structures. The Guatemalan government readied emergency supplies for those affected by the storm."

        "content": "A tropical wave located in the Caribbean Sea tracked westward, crossing over Central America and entering the Eastern Pacific Ocean around October 13\u201314.[1] The National Hurricane Center (NHC) first forecast on October 11 that a broad low-pressure area would form within the next few days.[2] By October 14, an area of low pressure had formed to the west of Nicaragua. Atmospheric convection, also known as thunderstorm activity, increased in organization as the system tracked northwestward, located to the south of Guatemala, on October 15.[1] At the same time, the system was elongated and lacked a defined circulation center.[1][3] The NHC initiated advisories on the disturbance as Potential Tropical Cyclone Seventeen-E early on October 16 after having assessed the chance of tropical cyclone formation to be high.[1][4] The NHC expected the system to become a tropical storm before reaching the southern coast of Mexico as the latter was located within a favorable environment of warm sea surface temperatures and low-to-moderate northeasterly wind shear.[1][5] The system advanced towards the northwest, moving along the southwestern boundary of a mid-level ridge which was located over the Gulf of Mexico.[1][5] Seventeen-E was estimated to have had maximum sustained winds of 35\u00a0mph (55\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 1,005\u00a0mbar (29.68\u00a0inHg) during its time as a potential tropical cyclone from 00:00 UTC to 18:00 UTC on October 16.[1] The chance of Seventeen-E becoming a tropical cyclone rapidly decreased as it approached the shoreline. Convection decreased in its extent and became less structured; the low-level circulation also decayed, with multiple swirls of low-level clouds persisting near stronger areas of convection.[1][6] The system moved ashore between Bahias de Huatulco and Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, around 13:00 UTC on October 16, and dissipated by 18:00 UTC.[1]"

A peak rainfall value of 445\u00a0mm (17.5\u00a0in) was recorded at km 51+740 in Oaxaca. Morro Mazat\u00e1n experienced 401.4\u00a0mm (15.80\u00a0in) of rain and 278\u00a0mm (10.9\u00a0in) fell in Uni\u00f3n Hidalgo. Heavy rainfall also occurred in the states of Chipas and Guerrero, with up to 70\u00a0mm (2.8\u00a0in) occurring in the former and 125\u00a0mm (4.9\u00a0in) in the latter.[7] Classes were canceled in Oaxaca on October 16 while the storm was making landfall.[8] The Uni\u00f3n Hidalgo municipal government asked the federal government to make a disaster declaration for the region. The Uni\u00f3n Hidalgo-Juchit\u00e1n highway was severely damaged by the storm.[9] In Juchit\u00e1n de Zaragoza, at least 100 homes, as well as schools, public buildings, and a library were inundated with water up to 500\u00a0mm (20\u00a0in) deep, exacerbating damage from the 2017 earthquake.[9] Seawater flooded palapas and streets in Playa Vicente.[10] The R\u00edo de los Perros rose to a level of 4.7\u00a0m (15\u00a0ft) and spilled its banks in multiple sections.[11] A school was closed in the city as a result of the swollen river and flooding.[12] Near the source of the river, in the Sierra Mix-Zapoteca neighborhood, water overtopped a bridge. River currents dragged garbage and tree branches downstream, forming a dam at the bridge; the river overflowed and flooded two streets. Police closed the bridge and the flooded streets. The river also overflowed in Juchit\u00e1n's 8th section, with floodwaters submerging streets.[11] The communities of Barrio de La Soledad, Santa Mar\u00eda, and Santo Domingo Tehuantepec were cut off after the Chapala River spilled its banks. Floodwaters topped three bridges leading to Barrio de La Soledad. The 99th Infantry Battalion of the Mexican Army was called in to assist people affected by the storm. Floodwaters inundated homes in Santo Domingo Tehuantepec and forced the closure of Highway 200 near Morro Mazatl\u00e1n. In Guelaguichi, floodwaters isolated the community and damaged homes in one neighborhood. Drainage systems collapsed in Ciudad Ixtepec, allowing water to enter homes.[13][14][15] A sewage canal overflowed in El Pitayal, damaging the homes of 50 families. Floodwaters up to 500\u00a0mm (20\u00a0in) inundated homes in the Lieza neighborhood. Multiple power outages were reported in the Santiago Astata and San Pedro Huamelula communities.[13][15] Floodwaters also inundated homes in Rinc\u00f3n Moreno.[13][15] Plan DN-III-E, a disaster relief and rescue plan, was activated in the states of Guerrero, Oaxaca, and Tabasco after the passage of Seventeen-E.[16][13][15] A river overflowed in Ometepec, Guerrero, sending floodwaters into the community of Talapa. A highway connecting the Ometepec and Igualapa municipalities was damaged and several streets were flooded. A vehicle was partially submerged in water; it was unknown whether people were inside it.[17]"

Totals of 91.6\u00a0mm (3.61\u00a0in) and 91\u00a0mm (3.6\u00a0in) occurred in Ahuachap\u00e1n and La Libertad, respectively, for the same time period.[18] At least six people were killed in El Salvador.[1][19][20] In San Marcos, a 28-year-old man and a 21-year-old woman were killed after their house was buried. Likewise, a 68-year-old man and a 48-year-old woman died in Chiltiup\u00e1n after a landside buried their house. A 61-year-old fisherman and another person were killed after being swept away by river currents.[19][20][21] One person was reported missing in the country.[22] Heavy rainfall forced the evacuation of at least 1,850 people to 17 shelters.[19][20] A landslide in Mejicanos buried three homes; however, no fatalities occurred there. The Las Ca\u00f1as river overflowed in Apopa, trapping a cargo truck, but the driver managed to escape.[23] In Ilopango, one of the evacuated areas, at least 250 families were threatened by a 70\u00a0m (230\u00a0ft) deep gully. Over a hundred homes were flooded in the villages of La Ca\u00f1ada, El Icaco, and El Lim\u00f3n. At least 118 schools sustained damage, with 20 experiencing severe damage;[18] classes were canceled for five days.[19][20] The rainfall prompted authorities to issue orange alerts for municipalities near the Salvadorian coast and yellow alerts for others.[19][20] After the storm, a green alert was issued at the national level.[24] Authorities worked to clear 135 landslides and 58 felled trees, moving over 4,000\u00a0m3 (140,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft) of debris. At least 19 sections of road were damaged by the landslides. Bean crops sustained damage throughout the country, with 183,060 quintals or 10 percent of the seasonal production having been destroyed.[21] In Guatemala, a peak rainfall total of 150\u00a0mm (5.9\u00a0in) was reported in Puerto de San Jos\u00e9, and 133\u00a0mm (5.2\u00a0in) occurred in Flores, Pet\u00e9n.[25] Throughout the nation, 1 person was killed,[26] 2 people were wounded, and 216 people were evacuated. At least 302 houses had moderate damage and 2 were severely damaged. Multiple regions in the country were left without power.[25] Villa Nueva was placed on alert after heavy rainfall caused a significant increase in the height of the Villalobos River. Several trees were felled and several landslides occurred in the area. Over 400 schools were closed nationwide during the storm.[27] Quetzaltenango and Sacatep\u00e9quez experienced downed trees and flooding. Floodwaters impeded traffic in Guatemala City and inundated areas in Chimaltenango.[28] A three-car accident occurred in Ciudad de Plata, with one vehicle damaging an under construction metro line stop. Winds felled a tree near San Lucas Sacatep\u00e9quez, causing it to damage a dining room at a hotel, killing one person and injuring two more.[29] The streets of several other towns were flooded, including Palajunoj, El Tejar, San Crist\u00f3bal, Villalobos, Escuintla, and Amatitl\u00e1n. Municipal employees worked to remove a tree that fell on a residence in Mixco. A family was evacuated from their home after a wall partially collapsed. A landslide blocked two streets in the town. Rockslides and fallen trees impeded traffic in multiple locations along the Inter-American route. In Peronia City, 27 people were evacuated after rainfall damaged three homes; the structures were at risk of falling into a ravine. A landslide damaged a home in Bosques de San Lucas Sacatep\u00e9quez. An orange alert was issued for Puerto San Jos\u00e9 as a result of flooding.[25] At least 13 departments were placed under yellow alerts and Escuintla was placed under an orange alert.[29] Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales stated that the country had readied 127.9 metric tons (141 US tons) of emergency supplies. The town of Nueva Concepci\u00f3n received emergency aid after the storm.[25]"

Four days later, Favio was named as intensified to a moderate tropical storm while moving southwest. On 18 February, the storm was upgraded into a severe tropical storm. Then, it turned west in the general direction of Mozambique. Continuing to intensify, Favio was upgraded to a tropical cyclone early on 19 February. Subsequently, the storm began to undergo rapid deepening; the small storm reached intense tropical cyclone status the next day before peaking in intensity. However, the cyclone had weakened somewhat prior to making landfall on 22 February in the Inhambane Province in Mozambique. It rapidly weakened over land and dissipated the next day. While strengthening, Favio brought heavy rains to southern Madagascar. After making landfall, Intense Tropical Cyclone Favio brought widespread damage to Vilanculos in Mozambique, where the cyclone killed four people and injured at least 70 in the town. About 80% of the town was destroyed. Overall, a total of ten people were killed by the storm and nearly 100\u00a0others were injured, and combined with an earlier flood, the storm caused $71\u00a0million (2007\u00a0USD) in damage. Around 130,000\u00a0homes suffered damage and 130\u00a0schools were leveled by the tropical cyclone. Across the nation, a total of 33,000 people were left homeless during the system. Cyclone Favio destroyed 277,000\u00a0ha (684,480 acres) of crops. In Zimbabwe, 400 electricity poles were downed. During the aftermath of the storm, a number of agencies provided assistance to victims of Cyclone Favio in Mozambique. One agency donated $626,500, helping transport 50,000\u00a0mosquito nets to the devastated area. A total of 5,500\u00a0bars of soap, 1,600\u00a0buckets, 50\u00a0baths, and over 180\u00a0latrines were distributed to the victims of the devastated area. In all, the government was praised for how well they handled the disaster."

        "content": "Cyclone Favio originated from a zone of disturbed weather that was first classified by the M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France office on R\u00e9union (MFR) at 1200 UTC 11 February 2007.[2] Twelve hours later, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued their first advisory on the system.[1][3] Midday on 12 February, the MFR upgraded the system into a tropical disturbance and noted that its rating at that time on the Dvorak technique was 2.0.[2] According to the JTWC, an area of convection developed 340\u00a0mi (545\u00a0km) south-southwest of Diego Garcia.[1] Initially, however, the convection was not very concentrated near the center. However, sea surface temperatures in the area were somewhat warm so gradual intensification was predicted and the storm was projected to become a severe tropical storm within 48 hours.[4] Situated in an environment of low wind shear and good outflow, thunderstorm activity soon increased and thus started to consolidate around the storm's atmospheric circulation. Continuing to encounter more favorable conditions, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on 14 February.[1] Meanwhile, MFR upgraded the system into a tropical depression.[2] Eighteen hours later, the system was named Favio by the Meteorological Services of Mauritius[1] as the system; according to MFR, had intensified into a moderate tropical storm.[2] Moving very steadily southwest,[1] the storm gradually intensified.[2] Early on February 15, the JTWC announced that that system had intensified into a tropical storm. After intensifying slightly (based on JTWC data) that evening, the storm briefly weakened overnight, only to re-intensify the next morning.[3] On 16 February, Favio turned southwest in response to a large subtropical ridge.[1] Despite low wind shear,[5] Favio remained a moderate tropical storm for several days; however, on 18 February, MFR announced that Favio had intensified into a severe tropical storm.[2] Subsequently, the storm turned west as the ridge merged with another one centered over South Africa.[1] Two days later, the agency then upgraded the system into cyclone status.[2] At 00:00\u00a0UTC on 19 February, the JTWC upgraded the system into a Category\u00a01 hurricane-equivalent on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS)[3] though not much additional intensification was predicted.[6] Upon becoming a hurricane, thunderstorm activity began to develop around an eye.[7] Favio turned west-northwest, traversing the Mozambique Channel while beginning to deepen.[1] At 00:00\u00a0UTC 20 February, the JTWC declared that Favio had intensified into a Category\u00a02 hurricane-equivalent on the SSHWS.[3] Several hours later, Favio was then upgraded into an intense tropical cyclone by MFR[2] as the system developed a very small eye.[8] Simultaneously, Cyclone Favio was upgraded into a Category 3 hurricane on the SSHWS via the JTWC. During the afternoon hours of 20 February, the JTWC reported that Favio had developed winds equivalent to Category 4 intensity.[3] That evening, MFR noted that Cyclone Favio had peaked in intensity, with winds of 120\u00a0mph (195\u00a0km/h),[2] becoming the most intense tropical cyclone south of the 25th\u00a0parallel over the Mozambique Channel since the satellite era began.[9] Six hours later, the JTWC announced that Favio had peaked in intensity, with 140\u00a0mph (225\u00a0km/h) winds. This made Favio equal to a mid-level Category\u00a04 hurricane.[3] At the time of its peak, Favio had developed a well-defined eye.[10] Shortly after its peak, Cyclone Favio began to weaken;[3] the core of the storm started to become disrupted on the northwestern quadrant.[11] The JTWC expected Favio to continue to weaken, and dissipate within 48\u00a0hours over land.[12] The eye disappeared off of satellite imagery,[13] though by the early hours of 22 February, this feature had re-developed.[14] That afternoon, the storm was estimated to have made landfall in southern Mozambique. At that time, the JTWC reported winds of 105\u00a0mph (170\u00a0km/h), a Category\u00a02 system on the SSHWS.[3] On the other hand, MFR estimated winds of 105\u00a0mph (170\u00a0km/h) (an intense tropical cyclone).[2] Upon making landfall, it did so on the seventh anniversary of the last intense tropical cyclone, Eline, to strike Mozambique.[15] Favio was also the first tropical cyclone to hit the country since Cyclone Japhet did during the 2002\u201303 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season.[9] By early 23 February, the winds had dropped below hurricane-force according to the JTWC, while the storm dissipated later that day.[3] Around that time, MFR stopped monitoring the system as well.[2]"

The floods escalated in February\u00a02007 when the Zambezi River broke its banks, flooding the surrounding areas in Mozambique.[17][18] A total of 80,600 people were evacuated from their homes in the Tete, Manica, Sofala and Zambezia provinces on 14 February.[19] Twenty-nine people were confirmed dead due to the pre-Favio flood.[20] While at peak intensity, the storm threatened Mozambique and forcing authorities to put the country on high alert.[21] The British Foreign Office also issued a travel warning to Britons who were planning visits along the Bazaruto Archipelago.[22] Additionally, the South African disaster management team was on full alert in the eastern portion of Mpumalanga.[23] In addition, thousands of volunteers were placed on stand by.[24] Some residents of Vilankulo attempted to flee the area carrying belongings and children as the government urged residents to seek shelter on higher ground further inland before the storm hit. They evacuated many of the people who remained, taking them to tent camps.[25] Officials said that Favio could also bring heavy rains to Zambia, Malawi and Zimbabwe.[26] Authorities in the latter issued a flood warning.[27] Because of the topography of the region, meteorologists noted the potential for flooding in Zimabawe.[28]"

Within 48\u00a0hours following Intense Tropical Cyclone Favio, roofs were being repaired, and power lines were gradually being restored.[31] Hundreds of local red cross staff and volunteers were utilized; they worked around the clock to assist survivors. Thirty-one recovery centers opened, hosting 400\u00a0first aid volunteers.[37] According to a South African website, the government was praised for how well and quickly they handled the crisis.[21][45] Key food items (rice, beans, corn meal, cooking oil, soap, and sugar) were distributed to the affected areas.[46] On March\u00a05, a plan was launched to provide victims for a total of $71\u00a0million worth of aid, of which $773,000 was expected to be directed towards the health. Meanwhile, water levels began to recede throughout the affected region.[47] Moreover, a total of 28,000\u00a0lb (12,700\u00a0kg) of aid were distributed through the central part of the nation, and provided clean water for 6,000\u00a0people.[48] About 200\u00a0tents were provided for victims whose roofs of their homes were blown off.[36] Furthermore, concerns rose about the potential outbreak of diseases like HIV.[49] Within three months after the cyclone, 85% of homes had used the aid they were given.[50]"

Bondo developed on 15 December in the central Indian Ocean, west of Diego Garcia. After strengthening into a moderate tropical storm on 18 December, the storm rapidly intensified while moving westward, taking advantage of favorable atmospheric conditions. Within 18 hours of being named, Bondo intensified to tropical cyclone status, or the equivalent of a minimal hurricane. The M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France office on R\u00e9union (MFR) estimated peak 10-minute sustained winds of 205\u00a0km/h (125\u00a0mph), although the American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center estimated stronger 1-minute winds of 250\u00a0km/h (155\u00a0mph). While near peak intensity, Bondo passed just south of Agal\u00e9ga island, before weakening slightly and moving through the Farquhar Group of islands belonging to the Seychelles, becoming the strongest cyclone to affect that island group in decades. Bondo turned southwestward, and after brushing the northern coast of Madagascar, the cyclone made landfall near Mahajanga on 25 December. The storm continued southward, and was last tracked by the MFR on 28 December. Due to its small size, Bondo's winds did not exceed 100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph) on Agal\u00e9ga, despite passing close by near peak intensity. In the Seychelles, Bondo severely damaged buildings and vegetation on Providence Atoll. High waves caused flooding elsewhere in the archipelago. In Madagascar, Bondo killed 11 people when it struck the island's west coast. The storm's high winds, reaching 155\u00a0km/h (96\u00a0mph) in Mahajanga, damaged buildings and left around 20,000 people homeless."

        "content": "An area of convection, or thunderstorms, persisted west of Diego Garcia in the central Indian Ocean on 15 December. That day, the M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France meteorological office in R\u00e9union (MFR)[nb 1] classified the weather disturbance as Tropical Disturbance 3. Over the next two days, the disturbance became more organized, with increasing convection over the center. This was due to the system moving into an area of lower wind shear. On 18 December, the MFR upgraded the system to Moderate Tropical Storm Bondo. On the same day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)[nb 2] began issuing advisories on Bondo, designating it Tropical Cyclone 05S.[2][3][4] Steered by a ridge to the south, Bondo moved westward into an area conducive for strengthening, including low wind shear, warm waters of around 29\u00a0\u00b0C (84\u00a0\u00b0F), and favorable outflow. Within 18 hours of being named, Bondo intensified to tropical cyclone status, or the equivalent of a minimal hurricane, and continued to rapidly intensify. Late on 19 December, the JTWC estimated peak 1-minute winds of 250\u00a0km/h (155\u00a0mph). Early on 20 December, the MFR estimated peak 10-minute winds of 205\u00a0km/h (125\u00a0mph), making Bondo an intense tropical cyclone. At 02:30 UTC that day, Bondo passed about 20\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi) south of Agal\u00e9ga, one of the Outer Islands of Mauritius. Despite the close approach at peak intensity, the cyclone's small size spared the strongest winds from affecting the island.[2][3][5] Increasing wind shear and an eyewall replacement cycle caused Bondo to weaken, beginning on 20 December. On the same day, the track shifted to the west-northwest.[3][5] On 21 December, Bondo passed over Providence Atoll and Farquhar Atoll, part of the Outer Islands of Seychelles. It was the most intense tropical cyclone in several decades to strike that part of the Seychelles.[6] On 22 December, Bondo weakened to a moderate tropical storm as its track shifted to the southwest. The storm re-intensified due to warmer waters, regaining tropical cyclone intensity late on 23 December near the northern tip of Madagascar. On the next day, the JTWC estimated a secondary peak intensity of 215\u00a0km/h (135\u00a0mph), while the MFR estimated a secondary peak of 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph). Land interaction and drier air caused the storm to weaken slightly. Around 12:00 UTC on 25 December, Bondo made landfall in northwestern Madagascar near Mahajanga as a severe tropical storm. The storm weakened to a tropical disturbance while continuing southward through the country. On 26 December, Bondo emerged into the Mozambique Channel. The MFR continued tracking the disturbance for two more days, by which point Bondo was located off the southwest coast of Madagascar.[2][3][5]"

While passing nearby, wind gusts did not exceed 100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph). However, rainfall from the storm occurred on Agal\u00e9ga, reaching about 287\u00a0mm (11.3\u00a0in) over 24 hours.[5] Due to its proximity to the equator, the Farquhar Atoll is rarely affected by tropical cyclones.[5] Bondo was the first cyclone to affect Farquhar since Tropical Storm Honorine in 1974.[7] The MFR described Bondo as \"shaking the immemorial peacefulness of the islets of the Farquhar Archipelago and wreaking havoc on the northernmost ones.\"[8] On 21 December, officials in Seychelles evacuated 35 of its 43 residents. The remaining eight stayed on Providence Atoll in a concrete bunker, unable to be evacuated due to limited time and resources.[9][6] Bondo destroyed most of the buildings and about 60% of the coconut trees on Providence, decimating the island's copra industry. The island's human population was evacuated following the storm and not returned, due to the inability for emergency evacuations.[10] The storm killed native pigs, birds, hens, and cats on Providence, while also wrecking vegetation.[11] The cyclone also produced 1.8\u00a0m (5.9\u00a0ft) tides higher than normal in the Inner Islands of Seychelles, along with 3\u00a0m (9.8\u00a0ft) waves. Rough seas caused flooding, beach erosion, and coastal damage on Mah\u00e9, Praslin, and La Digue. One person was injured on Mah\u00e9.[6] In northern Madagascar, Cyclone Bondo produced gusty winds and heavy rainfall. Eleven people were killed as a result of Bondo and another was reported as missing. A total of 20,001 people were left homeless.[12] One of the fatalities took place in Mahajanga after a wall collapsed on a man. Another fatality occurred offshore after a man went missing while taking his family canoeing. Roughly 300 people were affected in the city of Mahajanga alone.[13] The city recorded 179\u00a0mm (7.0\u00a0in) of rainfall in 24 hours, as well as peak wind gusts of 155\u00a0km/h (96\u00a0mph).[8] Bondo knocked out the power, water, and phone service in Mahajanga,[14] hampering rescue efforts.[15]"

The improvements failed to withstand the winds from a stronger storm, Cyclone Fantala, which affected the same group of islands in 2016.[16] In conjunction with the International Red Cross, rescue teams in Madagascar were deployed to the hardest hit regions on 27 December. These teams traveled by road to the region while a third team was set to arrive by helicopter several days later.[15] Bondo was the first in a series of six storms to affect Madagascar in the 2006-07 season, followed by Severe Tropical Storm Clovis, which struck southeastern Madagascar in January; Cyclones Favio and Gamede, which brushed the island in February, Indlala in March, and Jaya in April.[17] In late-February, 2007, the Government of Norway provided $800,000 in relief funds for the combined effects of Cyclones Bondo, Favio and Clovis.[18] On 15 March, the United Nations announced a funding program after three other storms had struck Madagascar. The goal was to provide roughly $9 million to about 300,000 of the millions of affected population. However, upon the announcement, only $3 million of this fund had been allocated.[19] Following the widespread damage from Cyclone Indlala in March, 2007, the Government of Madagascar launched an appeal to the United Nations for $246 million in relief funds for damage wrought by all five cyclones.[20] The appeal ultimately raised 76% of its target, which was spent on food, shelter, and other emergency items.[21]"

The seventh named storm of the 2006\u201307 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season, Gamede[nb 1] formed south of Diego Garcia on February\u00a019 as a tropical disturbance. It tracked generally westward and steadily intensified, reaching tropical cyclone status on February\u00a023. For two days, Gamede stalled northwest of the Mascarene Islands as an intense tropical cyclone, during which it reached 10\u00a0minute maximum sustained winds of winds of 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph), according to the M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France meteorological office in R\u00e9union (MFR).[nb 2] The American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)[nb 3] estimated peak 1\u00a0minute winds of 195\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph), equivalent to a Category\u00a03 on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale. For four days, Gamede remained within 400\u00a0km (250\u00a0mi) of R\u00e9union before accelerating southward. On March\u00a02, Gamede transitioned into an extratropical cyclone to the southeast of Madagascar. The MFR tracked the storm for four more days. Cyclone Gamede first passed near St. Brandon, where its 160\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph) wind gusts damaged a few windows. When the storm stalled for a few days, it resulted in a prolonged period of heavy rainfall and high tides for the Mascarene Islands. A pluviometer at Commerson Crater recorded worldwide record rainfall amounts over a period of 3\u20139\u00a0days, with a total of 5,512\u00a0mm (217.0\u00a0in). Only Cyclone Hyacinthe in 1980 had a higher recorded rainfall total. The deluge from Gamede caused flooding damage across R\u00e9union, washing out a bridge in the southern portion of the island. Monetary damage on R\u00e9union was estimated at over \u20ac165\u00a0million (US$120\u00a0million).[nb 4] Two people each were killed on R\u00e9union and nearby Mauritius. The storm's outer rainbands affected southeastern Madagascar, becoming the fourth tropical cyclone to affect the country in two months. Later, high waves from Gamede flooded coastal portions of the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal."

        "content": "The Intertropical Convergence Zone was active across the Indian Ocean in the middle of February 2007, which spawned a low-pressure area southeast of Diego Garcia on February\u00a018.[4] The system developed convection, or thunderstorms, over a weak, but well-defined low-level circulation.[5] The MFR first began tracking the system as a tropical disturbance on February\u00a019.[6] An anticyclone over the nascent system provided weak wind shear and outflow to the north and east, both favorable conditions for development. With a subtropical ridge to its south, the disturbance tracked generally westward for the first few days of its duration.[5] By late on February\u00a020, the system had organized enough for the MFR to upgrade the disturbance to a tropical depression,[6] and for the JTWC to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert.[3] On the next day, the MFR upgraded the depression to Moderate Tropical Storm Gamede, and the JTWC began issuing advisories on the storm as Tropical Cyclone 15S. At that time, the storm was located about 785\u00a0km (488\u00a0mi) south-southwest of Diego Garcia, or about 995\u00a0km (618\u00a0mi) northeast of Rodrigues.[4][3] As Gamede continued to intensify, its track shifted to the west-southwest.[5] On February\u00a022, the MFR upgraded the system to a severe tropical storm, and the JTWC upgraded Gamede to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane.[6] An eye became evident on satellite imagery, a sign of the storm's development.[7] The MFR upgraded Gamede to tropical cyclone status on February\u00a023, noting that the system was \"very broad\".[8] Soon after, the cyclone moved over St. Brandon, one of the Outer Islands of Mauritius; the island recorded a minimum barometric pressure of 955\u00a0mbar (28.2\u00a0inHg), and estimated the eyewall diameter at 50\u00a0km (31\u00a0mi).[4] On February\u00a024, Gamede passed north of Mauritius and R\u00e9union, approaching within 300\u00a0km (190\u00a0mi) of the latter island. The storm later slowed and stalled, trapped between the subtropical ridge to the south and a ridge to its northeast. For over 90\u00a0hours, the cyclone remained within 400\u00a0km (250\u00a0mi) of R\u00e9union, resulting in torrential rainfall in the island's mountainous region. During this time, Gamede executed a small loop, and the cyclone attained its peak intensity. The MFR estimated peak 10\u00a0minute winds of 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph) late on February\u00a025. At the same time, the JTWC estimated peak 1\u00a0minute winds of 195\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph).[6][5] While remaining nearly stationary northwest of the Mascarene Islands, Gamede lost some of its deep convection due to upwelling, the process in which a stationary storm causes the water temperatures to decrease by bringing the cooler, deeper waters to the surface.[5] Early forecasts suggested the possibility that the cyclone would turn westward and strike Madagascar near Toamasina.[9] Instead, a passing trough steered the system to the south-southwest. On February\u00a027, Gamede passed west of R\u00e9union, about halfway between the island and Madagascar.[5] On the next day, the convection near the eye increased slightly.[10] This trend was temporary, as cooler waters and stronger wind shear began affecting Gamede on March\u00a01, leaving the center exposed from the convection. That day, the MFR downgraded Gamede to a severe tropical storm.[11] On March\u00a02, the JTWC discontinued advisories,[3] and the MFR reclassified the storm as an extratropical cyclone. A ridge to its south caused the remnants of Gamede to slow again and execute a small loop southeast of Madagascar. The MFR discontinued advisories on March\u00a04, and the agency tracked the weakening low for two more days at it drifted westward.[5][6]"

Initially a tropical disturbance, Indlala moved generally westward in its formative stages, attaining tropical cyclone status on 13 March. A day later, the M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France office on R\u00e9union (MFR) estimated peak 10\u2013minute sustained winds of 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph), although the American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center estimated stronger 1\u2013minute winds of 220\u00a0km/h (135\u00a0mph). Early on 15 March, the cyclone made landfall in northeastern Madagascar on the Masoala Peninsula near Antalaha, still at its peak intensity according to the MFR. Indlala rapidly weakened over land and turned southward, eventually re-emerging into the Indian Ocean on 18 March; it was last noted by the MFR on 19 March. Indlala first affected the sparsely populated islands of St. Brandon and Agal\u00e9ga, producing wind gusts of 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph) on the former island. The cyclone struck Madagascar a few months after the country experienced a series of deadly floods and other cyclones. Indlala killed 150\u00a0people and injured another 126. Monetary damage was estimated at over US$240\u00a0million. Severe flooding, strong winds, and heavy rainfall wrecked cities in the immediate vicinity of its landfall point. Farther inland and along the country's northwest coast, flooding cut access to roads, which disrupted the response to the storm. Individuals, national governments, United Nations agencies, and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies helped residents affected by the cyclone cope with its aftermath."

        "content": "The Intertropical Convergence Zone spawned an area of convection, or thunderstorms, on 9 March, located southwest of the Chagos archipelago in the central Indian Ocean. A circulation developed within the system, situated in a favorable area of low wind shear beneath an anticyclone. On 10 March, the M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France meteorological office in R\u00e9union (MFR) designated the system as Tropical Disturbance 12. On the same day, the American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert, after a further increase in convection. The nascent system moved generally westward, steered by a ridge over the Mascarene Islands. On 11 March, the MFR upgraded the system to Tropical Depression 12, after an expansion of outflow and an increase in banding features. A day later, the MFR upgraded the system to a tropical storm, naming it Indlada first, before correcting the name to Indlala. Also on 12 March, the JTWC initiated advisories on the system, designating it Tropical Cyclone 19S.[1][2] With favorable atmospheric conditions, Indlala continued to strengthen as its convection organized, becoming a severe tropical storm late on 12 March. A trough over South Africa disrupted the ridge, causing the storm to turn toward the southwest. The next day, the MFR upgraded Indlala to tropical cyclone status \u2013 with 10\u2013minute sustained winds of at least 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph), the equivalent of a hurricane. A small, well-defined eye formed in the center of the storm as it approached northeastern Madagascar. On 14 March, the MFR upgraded Indlala further to an intense tropical cyclone, estimating peak 10\u2013minute winds of 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph), and a minimum barometric pressure of 935\u00a0mbar (27.6\u00a0inHg). The JTWC's intensity estimate was higher, with peak 1\u2013minute winds of 220\u00a0km/h (135\u00a0mph).[1][2][3] Indlala underwent an eyewall replacement cycle around the time of its peak intensity. Around 00:00\u00a0UTC on 15 March, the cyclone made landfall in northeastern Madagascar on the Masoala Peninsula near Antalaha, still at its peak intensity according to the MFR. Indlala rapidly weakened as it progressed inland. The JTWC discontinued advisories on 16 March, by which time the MFR had downgraded the cyclone to a tropical depression. The system moved southward through Madagascar, eventually re-emerging into the Indian Ocean on 18 March near Manambondro. The weak system continued to the south-southeast, and was last noted by the MFR on 19 March.[1][2][3]"

        "content": "In its formative stages, Indlala passed north of the sparsely-populated St. Brandon. Rainfall on the island reached 25.5\u00a0mm (1.00\u00a0in), and winds reached 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph). Later, the storm passed south of Agal\u00e9ga, producing gusts of 48\u00a0km/h (30\u00a0mph) there.[1] Indlala was the fifth tropical cyclone to hit or affect Madagascar in the span of three months, after Bondo, Clovis, Favio, and Gamede.[4] The series of floods diminished the country's stock of supplies from United Nations agencies,[5] spurring an appeal for international assistance and a declaration of a national emergency.[6] Across northern Madagascar, Cyclone Indlala dropped heavy rainfall and produced hurricane-force wind gusts.[1] At Antalaha near where it moved ashore, a station recorded 355.2\u00a0mm (13.98\u00a0in) of rainfall over 24\u00a0hours. The same city recorded gusts of 245\u00a0km/h (152\u00a0mph). Antsohihy in northern Madagascar recorded 585.4\u00a0mm (23.05\u00a0in) of rainfall over 48\u00a0hours. The cyclone killed 150\u00a0people across Madagascar, with another 126 injured.[7] Damage in the country was estimated at over US$240\u00a0million.[8] Across Madagascar, Indlala damaged or destroyed 54,000\u00a0houses,[9] leaving 188,331\u00a0people homeless.[7] Houses with iron roofs fared better than traditionally built houses.[10] The regions of Madagascar hardest hit by Indlala were Diana, Analanjirofo, Atsinanana, Atsimo-Atsinanana, and Vatovavy-Fitovinany along the country's east coast; Sava, Sofia, and Boeny along the northwest coast; and the inland regions of Betsiboka and Alaotra-Mangoro. Indlala affected vital institutions, with 228\u00a0schools and 71\u00a0hospitals damaged to some degree.[9] High winds and heavy rainfall damaged roads in northern Madagascar, with 103\u00a0bridges damaged, while landslides blocked access to some communities.[9][11] Throughout Madagascar, the cyclone wrecked about 90,000\u00a0ha (220,000 acres) worth of crops.[12] This included about 20,877\u00a0ha (51,590 acres) of lost rice, leaving residents without food.[13] Flooding from Indlala affected a 131,700\u00a0km2 (50,800\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) area of northern Madagascar, notably in the cities of Antalaha, Maroantsetra, and Sambava, where the cyclone severed phone lines and caused power outages.[12][14] In Maroantsetra, the cyclone destroyed the roof of a prison; ten prisoners escaped, and three were re-arrested.[14] The entire town of Maroantsetra was flooded, as were 90% of surrounding villages, reaching at least 0.8\u00a0m (2.6\u00a0ft) deep.[10] Rising rivers forced families to flee their homes and gather in the city hall. Small communities lost radio contact for two days.[4] Most of the water wells in Maroantsetra were contaminated, leaving 25,000\u00a0people without access to clean drinking water.[15] North of its landfall point, Indlala wrecked about 40% of Antalaha's buildings. The storm washed away boats, blew away roofs, contaminated wells, and decimated crops. The local vanilla crop was finally starting to mature after Cyclone Gafilo's destructive landfall in 2004. Indlala wrecked about 90% of the vanilla orchids in and around Antalaha, and about 80% of the country's vanilla production.[4][14][10][16][17] East of the country's capital Antananarivo, the cyclone damaged a power station, causing power outages.[18] In Ambanja along Madagascar's northwest coast, flooding displaced about 9,000\u00a0people, after a rapid rise of water 3\u00a0m (9.8\u00a0ft) high.[10] In Sofia region in northwest Madagascar, floods were the region's worst since 1959.[12] Flooding in the Diana and Sofia regions killed 95\u00a0people, with 20,000\u00a0people left homeless.[13]"

The 24-hour rainfall of 29\u201330 March in the Black Forest saw more than 60 litres per square metre (1.2\u00a0imp\u00a0gal/sq\u00a0ft) fall.[1] The Niklas storm was preceded by the low pressure named Mike by the Free University of Berlin, which brought hurricane strength winds to Germany on 30 March. Gust reports from this low pressure at the high-altitude stations of Brocken were of 152\u00a0km/h (94\u00a0mph) (force 12) and Zugspitze 137\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph).[5] The Niklas storm began to develop on 29 March off the Newfoundland coast.[6] Powerful air temperature differences across Europe led to a strong upper air flow at 2.5\u00a0km altitude. Embedded in this was a shortwave trough, which promoted the intensification of the surface low Niklas as it came across Scotland.[1] A plume of colder air from area of Iceland and Greenland also formed a strong temperature gradient with warmer air masses from the Atlantic circulating around high pressure centred to the west of Iberia which helped intensify the storm.[1] Together with an area of low pressure over Scandinavia, which formed a strong air pressure gradient across north-west Europe, The approach of the low pressure saw a tightening of the air pressure gradient especially in the German Bight and north west Germany. The pressure difference being between 1,035\u00a0hPa (30.6\u00a0inHg) in the high pressure situated to the west of Iberia, to a low of 971.4\u00a0hPa (28.69\u00a0inHg) recorded at the Ekofisk platform in the North Sea.[1] This situation was coupled with a powerful jet stream above the developing storm.[7] Niklas developed as it crossed the UK reaching a low pressure 971.4\u00a0hPa (28.69\u00a0inHg) as it crossed the North Sea, and in the course of a day moved to southern Denmark before continuing to the southern Baltic Sea and on towards the Baltic States. The storm field drew across Western Europe on 30 and 31 March 2015, reaching the Netherlands and large areas of Germany on 31 March 2015. Hurricane-force winds were reported in Germany, according to the German Weather service (DWD) with a peak gust at altitude on the mountains of Zugspitze (192\u00a0km/h\u00a0[119\u00a0mph]), the Brocken (162\u00a0km/h\u00a0[101\u00a0mph]), Feldberg in the Black Forest (151\u00a0km/h\u00a0[94\u00a0mph]) and on Weinbiet in Neustadt (148\u00a0km/h\u00a0[92\u00a0mph]). At lower elevations on the North Sea coast peak gusts of 140\u00a0km/h (87\u00a0mph) were reported.[1] The storm was absorbed by windstorm Oskar on 6 April."

        "content": "The Royal Dutch Meteorological Institute, KNMI ranked the storm at 27th place in the Netherlands since 1971, displacing Cyclone Xaver to 28th place which was of comparable strength in the country.[6] The wind speeds encountered in Germany from the Niklas storm were comparable to the strongest wind speeds (in both the peak gusts and in the highest 10-minute average wind speeds) recorded during March over the 1981-2010 reference period.[1] The Niklas storm is thus one of the most violent storms encountered in Germany during March. which is particularly noteworthy as the storm occurred so late in March and after the beginning of meteorological spring.[1] According to the German Weather Service, DWD the Niklas storm is akin to Cyclone Emma (1 March 2008), which was one of the strongest storms witnessed in Germany during March, and was especially damaging in Bavaria, which reported winds up to 220\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph) on the Wendelstein Mountain and rainfall totals up to 60\u00a0mm (2.4\u00a0in).[1] In comparison with other recent storms in Germany, the St. Jude storm of October 2013 and the Kyrill storm of January 2007 affected the northern half of Germany, with the St. Jude storm particularly affecting the far north of Germany, where it was stronger than Niklas.[1] In the southern half of Germany the Niklas storm was stronger than either of these two winter storms.[1] Cyclone Niklas is regarded as being not quite as strong in Germany as the Kyrill storm which had a slightly higher peak gust speed and longer duration.[8] MeteoSwiss reported that in March winds over 100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph) would be expected to recur on the Swiss Plateau approximately once every four years.[9] Between the mid-1980s and 2001 the return period for these winds was approximately one in three years, but has been less commonly observed in recent years.[9] Considered throughout the year (not just for the month of March) the wind gusts measured on 31 March 2015 were not exceptional.[9] In the Swiss lowlands such a wind event occurs about once in every two years, though locally, there were gusts which only occur at that location once every 5 to 6 years, for example at Affoltern, Z\u00fcrich.[9] In the Swiss mountains a gust of 160\u00a0km/h (99\u00a0mph) was measured on S\u00e4ntis, which occurs approximately every 1 to 2 years, and on Mount Pilatus a gust of 150\u00a0km/h (93\u00a0mph) was recorded, which is expected about every 4 to 5 years.[9] Niklas was not thought to represent an insurance loss in the league of that seen following the catastrophic damages of Cyclone Lothar and Martin in France 1999, where peak gusts of over 270\u00a0km/h (170\u00a0mph) were measured.[10]"

        "content": "The environmental conditions leading up to the April 2011 Super Outbreak were among the \"most conducive to violent tornadoes ever documented\".[2] On April\u00a025, a vigorous upper-level shortwave trough moved into the Southern Plains states.[3] Ample instability, low-level moisture, and wind shear fueled a significant tornado outbreak from Texas to Tennessee; at least 64\u00a0tornadoes touched down on this day.[2] An area of low pressure consolidated over Texas on April\u00a026 and traveled east while the aforementioned shortwave trough traversed the Mississippi River and Ohio River valleys.[4] Another 50\u00a0tornadoes touched down on this day.[2] The multi-day outbreak culminated on April\u00a027 with the most violent day of tornadic activity since the 1974 Super Outbreak. Multiple episodes of tornadic activity ensued with two waves of mesoscale convective systems in the morning hours followed by a widespread outbreak of supercells from Mississippi to North Carolina during the afternoon into the evening.[2] Activity on April\u00a027 was precipitated by a 995\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.39\u00a0inHg) surface low situated over Kentucky and a deep, negatively tilted (aligned northwest to southeast) trough over Arkansas and Louisiana. A strong southwesterly surface jet intersected these systems at a 60\u00b0 angle, an ageostrophic flow that led to storm-relative helicity values in excess of 500\u00a0m2s\u22122\u2014indicative of extreme wind shear and a very high potential for tornadic supercells. Ample moisture from the Gulf of Mexico was brought north across the Deep South, leading to daytime high temperatures of 77 to 81\u00a0\u00b0F (25 to 27\u00a0\u00b0C) and dewpoints of 66 to 72\u00a0\u00b0F (19 to 22\u00a0\u00b0C). Furthermore, convective available potential energy (CAPE) values reached 2,500\u20133,000\u00a0J/kg\u22121.[2] The Smithville supercell itself existed along a thermal boundary in northeastern Mississippi. This was an east\u2013west oriented outflow boundary left behind by the morning squall line. This boundary is also assumed to be the same boundary that the Hackleburg tornado developed on. Conditions were locally enhanced by more easterly surface winds generated along the residual boundary, allowing for a corridor of enhanced tornado potential.[2]"

        "content": "After producing a long-tracked EF3 tornado that passed near New Wren, the same supercell produced this tornado that began 3 miles (4.8\u00a0km) west-southwest of Smithville along the Tennessee\u2013Tombigbee Waterway near the Glover Wilkins Lock at 3:42\u00a0p.m. CDT (2042 UTC), snapping numerous trees near the Smithville Recreation Area. The fast-moving tornado then rapidly intensified as it approached town, reaching EF5 intensity. As the storm crossed Davis Road South, the ground was deeply scoured in a nearby field, leaving a trench in the ground that was still visible in aerial photographs taken more than a year later.[5][6] The tornado began producing remarkably intense damage and swept away multiple homes and structures as it moved northeast, following MS 25. The first fatality from the tornado occurred in this area as a bed and breakfast was obliterated and swept from its foundation, with debris from the structure scattered long distances downwind. Cinder blocks from the structure were broken into small pieces of concrete and strewn throughout a nearby field. A semi-truck was thrown 300\u00a0yd (270\u00a0m) and destroyed in this area, and an RV was thrown 250\u00a0yd (230\u00a0m) and partially embedded into the ground nearby. A second semi-truck was completely torn apart, with its bumper later found hanging from the struts of the Smithville water tower, located 1.4-mile (2.3\u00a0km) to the northeast. One brick residence was swept away along this segment of the path as well, and part of its concrete foundation slab was pulled up and slightly dislodged, with extensive ground scouring and debarking of trees noted on the property. The tornado scoured the topsoil to a depth of one foot (30\u00a0cm). Some metal storage buildings and 14 mobile homes were obliterated nearby, with metal framing from some of the mobile homes thrown and twisted into pieces.[6][1][5] The tornado then entered Smithville at maximum intensity, producing EF5 damage as it moved through both commercial and residential areas. Dozens of large, anchor-bolted, well-built brick homes were completely swept away in town, and many large hardwood trees were completely debarked and denuded. One large brick home had its foundation partially dislodged and shifted, with intense hardwood debarking and shredded low-lying vegetation visible. All furniture, appliances, and plumbing from homes in the tornado's direct path of were either shredded or missing, and some homes had floor tiles scoured from their foundations. Shrubbery along the perimeters of some homes was shredded and/or stripped as well, and debris from many of the obliterated homes was finely granulated into small pieces. An SUV was thrown a 1\u20442-mile (0.80\u00a0km) into the top of the Smithville water tower, then bounced off of it, and was hurled an additional 1\u20444-mile (400\u00a0m) before impacting the ground and eventually coming to rest on the opposite side of the city, where it was later found crushed and flattened. The city hall, the post office, four churches, several businesses, the water system, and the police station were all destroyed as the tornado moved through town. Tar and chip pavement was torn from a road in town and rolled into piles, intense ground scouring was noted in several areas, and a 1965 Chevrolet pickup truck was thrown from one residence and never found. Several other vehicles in town were thrown hundreds of yards, torn into multiple pieces, stripped down to their frames, or wrapped around trees as well.[7] Some instances of damage show that many of the vehicles wrapped around trees encountered extreme sub-vortices, with some sections of sheet metal having been wrapped around trees multiple times. The local medical clinic was destroyed as well, with supplies being scattered around the city.[8] The large brick E.E. Pickle Funeral Home was reduced to a bare slab as the tornado exited at the northeast side of the city, with the debris scattered and wind-rowed into an adjacent wooded area. Extreme debarking of trees was noted in this area, and pieces of vehicles and structures were strewn long distances throughout the woods. The mangled remains of the SUV that impacted the water tower was found in a ditch at the edge of this wooded area. Around this area, it's possible that a \"secondary core\" existed, this is evident by nearby granite tombstones from a cemetery being blown over in the opposite direction of the tornado's passage, with some being broken and thrown.[9] Overall, the tornado destroyed 117 structures in Smithville and damaged 50 others, killing 16 people.[10] The tornado weakened as it continued through rural areas northeast of town and moved into Itawamba County, where it uprooted numerous trees and power lines and caused roof damage to a house before exiting the county.[5][11][6] The tornado then continued across the Alabama state line into Marion County, where it caused EF1 damage to outbuildings and mobile homes near Bexar. Continuing northeast, the tornado re-intensified as it struck the rural community of Shottsville at high-end EF3 intensity, where homes and mobile homes were destroyed, hundreds of trees were snapped and debarked, and seven more people were killed. The tornado produced additional high-end EF3 damage as it continued north of Hamilton, where several mobile homes and frame homes were destroyed, including one frame home at the bottom of a ravine that was swept clean from its foundation (though lack of road access prevented close inspection of the home's construction, precluding a potential higher rating at that location).[12] Several additional homes were damaged and a chicken house was destroyed as the tornado approached Franklin County. The tornado then crossed the county line and weakened to EF2 strength, where it snapped and uprooted numerous large trees, damaged or destroyed several chicken houses, totaled a car, destroyed a mobile home, tore much of the roof off of a two-story house, and caused significant roof damage to several other homes before dissipating near the town of Hodges at 4:23\u00a0p.m. CDT (2123 UTC). The damage path was 37.3 miles (60.0\u00a0km) long and 3\u20444 mile (1.2\u00a0km) wide at its widest point, and it killed a total of 23 people along its path. 137 other people were injured.[12][13]"

A tropical disturbance formed near Diego Garcia on 3 April 1984 and subsequently moved westward, intensifying into a moderate tropical storm two days later. Given the name Kamisy, the storm gradually intensified into an intense tropical cyclone by 9 April. Kamisy reached winds of 170\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph) before making landfall in extreme northern Madagascar near Diego Suarez. It weakened upon entering the Mozambique Channel, but briefly re-intensified on 10 April. That day while passing near Mayotte, the cyclone turned to the southeast, striking Madagascar again near Majunga. Kamisy quickly crossed the country. After emerging into the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Madagascar, the system reintensified into a moderate tropical storm before dissipating on 16 April. In northern Madagascar, Kamisy produced wind gusts of 250\u00a0km/h (155\u00a0mph), which destroyed 80% of the city of Diego Suarez. About 39,000\u00a0people were left homeless in the area, and there were five deaths. In western Madagascar, the cyclone dropped 232.2\u00a0mm (9.14\u00a0in) of rainfall in 24\u00a0hours in Majunga, which damaged rice fields in the region after causing widespread river flooding. Additionally, the storm destroyed about 80% of Majunga. Throughout the country, Kamisy caused $250\u00a0million in damage and 68\u00a0deaths, with 215\u00a0people injured and 100,000\u00a0left homeless. Fifteen people were killed and 30 others were injured in Mahajanga. Following the storm, emergency food and medical supplies were rushed into the nation. In addition to the impact to Madagascar, one death and severe damage was reported in the Comoros Islands, where all of the banana crop was destroyed."

        "content": "Cyclone Kamisy originated from an area of convection that formed in early April. On 3 April, the system was assigned a Dvorak rating of T2.0[1] and was respectively upgraded into a moderate tropical storm by the M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France office on Reunion (MFR). However, the storm was not classified by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) until that evening.[nb 1] The storm initially tracked west-southwest, but after briefly weakening into a tropical depression, Kamisy began to turn west. On 5 April, the storm was upgraded into a moderate tropical storm for the second time; the JTWC followed suit and upgraded Kamisy into a tropical storm several hours later while located about 1,000\u00a0km (620\u00a0mi) west of Diego Garcia.[3] Kamisy steadily intensified and on 6 April, the JTWC reported that it attained hurricane-force winds despite MFR estimating winds of 80\u00a0km/h (50\u00a0mph). Early on 7 April, however, Kamisy was upgraded into a severe tropical storm[3] as it had earned a rating of T4.0 on the Dvorak scale.[1] Thereafter, the storm began to undergo rapid deepening. Later that day, the JTWC announced that Kamisy attained winds of 170\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph), equivalent to a mid-level Category 2\u00a0hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Meanwhile, MFR upgraded the system into cyclone intensity. After briefly leveling off in intensity, the storm attained peak intensity of 170\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph) later that day. Early on 8 April, the JTWC estimated that it reached its peak intensity of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph).[3] Around this time, Kamisy was assigned a T6.0 rating via the Dvorak technique.[1] After maintaining peak intensity for less than a day, it weakened slightly. On 9 April, the storm brushed the northern Madagascar coast as a severe tropical storm, though the JTWC suggested that Kamsiy was considerably stronger. However, the afternoon to storm emerged into the extreme northern Mozambique Channel, where it passed near Mayotte, with little change in strength. After sharply turning south-southwest, Kamisy briefly regained tropical cyclone intensity, but resumed weakening as it approached the coast. While still a moderate tropical storm, it made landfall along the north-central part of the nation on 12 April,[3] near Tamative.[1] At the time of landfall, the JTWC noted that Kamisy was a minimal hurricane. The storm quickly weakened overland and was a tropical depression by the time it had emerged into the Indian Ocean. Shortly thereafter, the storm restrengthened into a moderate tropical storm, but this trend was short-lived. The JTWC downgraded Kamisy into a tropical depression at 06:00\u00a0UTC on 14 April. The agency issued the last warning on the system the following day, even though MFR kept tracking the system until the morning hours of 16 April. At this time, Kamisy was located about 500\u00a0mi (805\u00a0km) southwest of the southern tip of Madagascar.[3]"

Kamisy was considered the worst system to strike Madagascar since 1911.[6] According to Relief Web, 7,000\u00a0buildings were at least partially destroyed, including 1,020 schools[7] and 450 hospitals.[8] Approximately 215 people were injured due to the storm.[9] Overall, Kamisy was the strongest storm to hit the nation between 1980 and 1993.[10] In Diego Suarez, the storm caused significant damage, especially in residential areas. Warehouses, schools, and other public buildings suffered extensive damage.[11] Throughout the city, 80% of the buildings were damaged[6] and the town was 85% destroyed.[12] Electrical and water supplies were cut in Diego Suarez.[7] Nearby, in Befaria, a leprosarium, which housed 200 patients and their families, was damaged. The small village of Mangaoka was forced to move inland 100\u00a0m (330\u00a0ft).[13] In Tamatave, a daily peak rainfall total of 294\u00a0mm (11.6\u00a0in) was measured, and 711\u00a0mm (28.0\u00a0in) fell in a six-day period.[14] Due to the rainfall, 70% of the town's population moved to high ground.[15] In Antsiranana, 30,000 of the 40,000\u00a0inhabitants were left homeless and were left with little food or water.[16] Throughout northern Madagascar, about 39,000\u00a0people were left homeless in the area; there were five deaths.[1] After making its second landfall, 80% of the port of Mahajanga was destroyed,[16] where 42,120\u00a0people were reportedly homeless.[15] Many neighborhoods of the town, whose population was 45,000, were completed washed away.[16] Many rice fields in the region were destroyed due to widespread river flooding.[1][4] In Mahajanga alone, 15\u00a0people were killed while 30\u00a0others were majorly hurt.[16] Several schools throughout the city were destroyed.[17] Winds greater than 112\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h) were reported in Mahanjanga as well.[18] Elsewhere, the town of Movoya was also mostly destroyed.[15]"

The United States provided $25,000 in cash and $15,000 worth of other  items. Moreover, Italy donated $41,500 to Madagascar. Netherlands provided $65,000 worth of supplies[7] while the nations' the League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies decided to send a disaster team to the devastated area.[26] The United Kingdom provided $74,000 is cash; France provided 2.2 short tons (2.0\u00a0t) of medicine, 500 short tons (450\u00a0t), and 4\u00a0tents.[7] The government asked for 60,000 short tons (54,000\u00a0t) of rice, 5,000 short tons (4,500\u00a0t) of flour, 200 short tons (180\u00a0t) of edible oil, and 20 short tons (18\u00a0t) of milk and canned food.

This would officially make Mahina the most intense cyclone recorded to have hit the Australian mainland, and the most intense tropical cyclone recorded making landfall anywhere in the world,[1] as well as the most intense tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Southern Hemisphere, a title currently held by Cyclone Winston.

        "content": "Tropical Cyclone Mahina struck Australia on 4 March 1899,[4] with a likely minimum central pressure of 880 hectopascals (26\u00a0inHg).[5][1] Mahina ranks among the most intense cyclones ever observed in the Southern Hemisphere and almost certainly as the most intense cyclone ever observed off the Eastern states of Australia in recorded history.[6][3] Clement Lindley Wragge, Government Meteorologist for Queensland, pioneered the naming of such storms and gave this storm its name, Mahina. Storms of such intensity occur extremely rarely. Scientists identified two other Category 4 or 5 super-cyclones that struck Australia, in the first half of the 19th century, from their effects on the Great Barrier Reef and the Gulf of Carpentaria. This same research shows that on average, such super-cyclones occur in the region only once every two or three centuries.[7] A pearling fleet, based at Thursday Island, Queensland, was anchored in or near the bay before the storm. Within an hour, the storm drove much of the fleet ashore or onto the Great Barrier Reef; other vessels sank at their anchorages. Four schooners and the manned Channel Rock lightship were lost. A further two schooners were wrecked but later re-floated. The fleets lost 54 luggers, and a further 12 were wrecked but re-floated. People later rescued more than 30 survivors of the wrecked vessels from the shore; however, the storm killed more than 400 people, mostly non-European immigrant crew members.[8][9] A depiction of the schooner Crest of the Wave in the storm was later sketched in a painting.[10] A large storm surge, reportedly 13 metres (43\u00a0ft) high, swept across Princess Charlotte Bay and then inland about 5 kilometres (3.1\u00a0mi), destroying anything left of the Bathurst Bay pearling fleet and the settlement.[11] An eyewitness, constable J. M. Kenny, reported that a 48-foot (15\u00a0m) storm surge swept over their camp at Barrow Point atop a 40-foot (12\u00a0m)-high ridge and reached 3 miles (4.8\u00a0km) inland, the largest storm surge ever recorded. However, reviewing the evidence for this surge, some scientists modeled a surge only 2 metres (6\u00a0ft 7\u00a0in) to 3 metres (9.8\u00a0ft) in height,[12] based on the official 914-hectopascal (27.0\u00a0inHg) central pressure. They also surveyed the area, seeking wave-cut escarpments and deposits characteristic of storm events, but found none higher than 5 metres (16\u00a0ft). Of the 48-foot (15\u00a0m) surge, they suggested an incorrectly cited ground level or an involvement of freshwater (rain) flooding. A later study considers this conclusion likely premature and questions the barometer reading as unreliable and not representative of the actual lowest pressure. This subsequent study also examined new evidence of exceptionally high storm surge and inundation.[13] The cyclone continued southwest over Cape York Peninsula, emerging over the Gulf of Carpentaria, before doubling back and dissipating on 10 March.[14]"

One of the pearling fleet owners estimated another 30 people not officially registered as crew were killed and not reported to the Cooktown Registrar.[15] Eleven crew members of the ship Sagitta were killed.[16] Around 100 Aboriginal Australians were killed[17] but not recorded, as Aboriginal people were not counted as part of the population at the time. They had tried to help shipwrecked men, but the back surge caught them and swept them into the sea. Only eight Aboriginal people were recorded among the casualties, all of whom died on shore.[15] The Queensland Historical Atlas reported the death toll as \"307 pearl divers and sailors and an unreported number of Aborigines\".[18]"

The pressure recorded on the schooner Olive reasonably consistently show her lowest pressure recorded: 29.60 inches of mercury (1,002\u00a0hPa) to 29.10 inches of mercury (985\u00a0hPa)[21] or between 29.00 inches of mercury (982\u00a0hPa) and 29.10 inches of mercury (985\u00a0hPa).[22] In a further variant, \"during the lull in the hurricane, the barometer on the Olive recorded\" 29.70 inches of mercury (1,010\u00a0hPa) to 29.10 inches of mercury (985\u00a0hPa).[23] Most sources record the schooner Crest of the Wave observation as 27 inches of mercury (914\u00a0hPa).[24][25][26] More modern reports of an 18 inches of mercury (610\u00a0hPa) observation on a vessel in the eye of Mahina are unrealistic (the most intense tropical cyclone, Typhoon Tip, had a central pressure 260 hectopascals (7.68\u00a0inHg) higher).[27] One author[8] accepted the 29.1 inches of mercury (985\u00a0hPa) report from the Olive and the 27 inches of mercury (914\u00a0hPa) report from the Crest of the Wave, seemingly unaware of the discrepant reports. He estimated the track of the cyclone from the damage reports, placing it directly over the position of the Crest of the Wave. The Olive to the north missed the centre. The separation between these schooners explains the difference between their respective pressure measurements. He calculated the centre pressure, standardised for temperature, as 914 hectopascals (13.26\u00a0psi).[8] A study in 2014 found that the actual lowest pressure of the storm was around 880 hectopascals (26\u00a0inHg), based upon modeling of meteorological variables needed to induce the potentially world-record-setting surge height of 13 metres (43\u00a0ft). This surge closely matches new evidence on storm depositions and accounts actually reported to two other captains, and in a letter from an eyewitness to his parents, of a reading of 26 inches of mercury (880\u00a0hPa). This study considers the apparently third-hand report of 27 inches of mercury (914\u00a0hPa) an unreliable measurement made possibly five hours prior to passage of the eye.[13] In comparison, the tiny Cyclone Tracy devastated Darwin in 1974, with a central pressure of 950 hectopascals (28\u00a0inHg). Barometric pressure this low at mean sea level also likely caused Cyclone Mahina to create such an intense, phenomenal, claimed world-record storm surge that was not immediately known afterward."

        "content": " Typhoon Hato, known in the Philippines as Severe Tropical Storm Isang, was a strong tropical cyclone that struck South China in August 2017.[nb 1] The thirteenth named storm and the fourth typhoon of the Pacific typhoon season, Hato formed as a tropical depression over the east of Luzon on 19 August. The system further developed and became a tropical storm the next day. On 21 August, Hato emerged over the northern portion of the South China Sea and reached typhoon intensity. Rapid intensification ensued on 23 August, and Hato became a Category 3-equivalent typhoon before making landfall over Jinwan, Zhuhai. The storm further weakened over land and dissipated on 24 August. One of the strongest typhoons to impact Macau and Hong Kong in the past 50 years, Hato caused significant damage totaling US$6.82\u00a0billion along its path. The bulk of the losses were incurred in Mainland China, where Hato brought a storm surge that caused severe flooding in several provinces along the Pearl River, in addition to wind gusts that reached 240\u00a0km/h (150\u00a0mph). Both Hong Kong and Macau had their tropical cyclone signals raised to the highest category in anticipation of the storm, which inflicted more than US$1\u00a0billion worth of damage in each of those areas. Also, while weakening, Hato brought heavy rain and a tornado to Vietnam. A total of 24 fatalities occurred due to Hato. Hato made landfall along the southern coast of Zhuhai with a Category-3 intensity (both 1-min and 2-min sustained wind speed of 185\u00a0km/h), strong but not stronger than other more powerful storms. Three other major typhoons, Wanda (1962), Ruby (1964), and Vicente (2012), followed a similar trajectory as that of Hato (from ESE to WNW), making landfall on slightly different parts of the coast. Hato's forward speed was the fastest of these typhoons, reaching 32.5\u00a0km/h (20.2\u00a0mph), nearly twice as fast as the speed of Wanda.[1]"

Furthermore, a field survey of urban flooding revealed evidence of a 2.25-m inundation in downtown Macau and a 0.55-m inundation on Lantau Island, Hong Kong, which were likely exacerbated by a combination of storm surge, heavy rainfall, and surface water runoff over a complex hilly terrain.[1]"

Noting this increase in organization, the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical storm as well.[18] By 12:00 UTC, the JMA found that Tembin had intensified further to a severe tropical storm.[19] Three hours later, the JTWC reported 1-minute sustained winds had increased to 75\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph).[20] Later, the PAGASA announced that Tembin made landfall in Cateel, Davao Oriental around 17:45 UTC.[21] Within the JTWC's next advisory on 21:00 UTC, they mentioned that feeder bands was wrapping in a central dense overcast feature that was obscuring its LLCC.[22] While Tembin traversed Mindanao, convection warmed and the storm slightly weakened, and the JMA downgraded the system back to a tropical storm at 03:00 UTC on December 22.[23][24] However, Tembin strengthened back into a severe tropical storm several hours later, just after making its second landfall near Balabac, Palawan.[25] Following the course of Severe Tropical Storm Linda, impact in Vietnam and the Mekong Delta was presumed.[26] As a weak late-season tropical cyclone, Tembin dissipated near Cape C\u00e0 Mau on December 26.[27]"

On 23 July 2021, NDTV reported that Maharashtra saw the highest in the month of July in 40 years.[4] Climate change could have played an important role in causing large-scale floods across Maharashtra.[5] The observed data shows a three-fold rise in widespread extreme rainfall events across India, including those regions where the floods occurred. The local meteorological conditions showed the presence of a low so boring system in the Bay of Bengal, anchoring the monsoon westerlies blowing from the Arabian Sea. These westerlies brought in an anomalous amount of moisture from the warm Arabian Sea, releasing them as heavy-to-extreme rains across Maharashtra over a week's time.[6] In April 2021, Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research reported about climate change heavily impacting the monsoon seasons in India.[3]"

The twenty-sixth named storm of the 2017 Pacific typhoon season, Kai-tak started as a tropical depression near Palau on December 11. Slowly intensifying, the system became a tropical storm on December 14. Due to its slow motion, Kai-tak made landfall in Samar on December 16 and traversed the Philippine Islands. Kai-tak later moved in a west-southwestward direction until it dissipated on December 23 near Malaysia. The storm caused 83 deaths and US$74.3 million[a] in damage. Massive floods and landslides led to extensive rescue operations and aid operations. The effects of the storm caused the retirement of the name Kai-tak, and later Urduja."

The storm expanded, though the storm was offset by moderate vertical wind shear.[2] The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a weak tropical depression the next day,[3] and began issuing advisories on 00:00 UTC of December 12, also reporting the storm as stationary.[4] Nine hours later, Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) declared that the system had intensified into a tropical depression and was immediately given the local name Urduja,[5] located 480\u00a0km (300\u00a0mi) northeast of Hinatuan, Surigao del Sur.[6] The system barely moved from the following days because of weak steering currents between a subtropical ridge over the western Pacific and another over the Bay of Bengal, plus another one to its south.[7] On December 13, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert.[8] On 21:00 UTC of that same day, the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical depression and also began issuing advisories, giving the identifier 32W.[9] Despite the system being poorly organized with loose banding, the system also was located in an area of very low wind shear.[10] Three hours later, both the JTWC and JMA[11] upgraded the system to a tropical storm after better organization and deep banding,[12] with the latter assigning the storm the international name Kai-tak.[13][14] On December 14, the storm started expanding, with better convection and proper maintenance after the convective maximum, even with strong wind shear.[15] At approximately 12:00 UTC, Kai-tak reached its peak intensity, with 75 kilometres per hour (45 miles per hour) winds estimated by the JMA.[16][17] A few hours later, the storm started moving towards Samar Island, going back east. The storm went back and forth over the following days in a circle-like manner, eventually moving back towards Northern Samar.[18] The storm had strong poleward outflow and weak equatorward outflow, though the system still was expected to intensify.[19] On December 15, Kai-tak weakened[18] because of strong wind shear.[20] The storm later remained stationary after subtropical ridges were spotted to the north and northeast.[21] Seven hours later, the system had undergone deep convective diurnal maximum, covering the low-level circulation center.[22] On December 16, the storm weakened even more, turning into a tropical depression, later making landfalls in San Policarpo, Eastern Samar[23] on approximately 13:30 PHT (5:30 UTC) on December 16. The next day, landfalls were recorded in the northern part of the Visayas archipelago, on Mobo, Masbate on approximately 10:00 PHT (2:00 UTC), and then over Sibuyan Island on approximately 12:00 PHT[b] (4:00 UTC), and then on Malay, Aklan on 18:00 PHT (10:00 UTC). The storm later made landfall on Cuyo, Palawan on 23:00 PHT (15:00 UTC) and on Taytay, Palawan the next day, leaving the Philippines.[24]:\u200a26\u200a After a decrease in wind shear, the thunderstorms increased and Kai-tak became a tropical storm again on December 20.[25] However, stronger wind shear weakened it back to a depression on December 21. Despite weakening, the storm affected Malaysia and Brunei before dying out in the South China Sea on December 23.[18][26][27][28]"

On December 15, PAGASA also announced the possibility of a storm surge of 4.1\u201314 metres (4.5\u201315.3 yards) over in Samar.[31] Suspension of classes in the Bicol Region were also declared in all six levels. With all the Local Government Units in Mimaropa were placed on Red Alert.[32] On December 17, 17 areas were downgraded from Signal No. 2 to Signal No. 1.[d][33] The storm resulted in at least 728 families (1,418 individuals) brought to evacuation centers or schools,[34] The storm also created the suspension of classes in 14 provinces.[35]"

The storm also destroyed 2,000 hectares (4,900 acres) of rice fields, or about 90% of Tacloban's rice.[47] Sea travel near the affected areas were later cancelled because of the storm.[31] The storm later flooded some parts of the Philippines and caused some landslides, with 23 people dying in the sole province of Biliran,[48] which included a landslide killing 27 people in the Naval barangay of Lucso-on.[49] Two people also died in Mimaropa, and 78 people were injured from the storm.[50] Three people also died in the province of Leyte, with a boy who drowned in the town of Mahaplag, a woman buried by a landslide, and another person who drowned in Ormoc. Vice-Governor of Eastern Samar Marcelo Picardal also stated that half the towns in Eastern Samar was flooded.[51] Classrooms in Catbalogan were also used to evacuate families.[52] Because of the storm, 52 vessels and 1,322 cargoes were stranded.

Some local government units initiated their response and distributed shelter materials and aid. The local Municipal Social Welfare and Development Offices (MSWD) offered 40 people to help aid projects and other needs.[43] Php184 million (US$3 million) worth of aid was also given to affected residents, coming from the Department of Social Welfare and Development, local government units, and other charities.

It struck the Ha'apai islands the next day between Tongatapu and Vava'u, according to the Director of Emergencies Leveni Aho. He also said that 23 islands that are a part of Ha'apai were unreachable by telephone and that patrol boats were traveling from island-to-island to get information. As a result of the cyclone, homes were flattened and at least one person was dead. Ha'apai governor Tu'i Ha'angana said that he was able to see from one side of the island to the other and \"that's how devastated it is.\"[11] By 13 January, contact with the islands was restored.[12] The electrical grid on Ha'apai sustained tremendous damage, with 90\u00a0percent of power lines being lost or severely damaged. Approximately 1,000\u00a0customers lost power during the storm. Estimates placed the cost to repair the system at NZ$4\u00a0million (US$3.5\u00a0million). By January\u00a023, only 100\u00a0residences had power back and Tonga Power Limited (TPL) stated it could take a further two months to fully restore the system.[13] In addition to the severe disruption to power, 80\u201390\u00a0percent of the region's water supply was lost. Most residents in Ha'apai rely on rain water collection, and the collection tanks were largely destroyed by the storm.[14] The nation's tourism industry also experienced moderate to severe losses, with damage to facilities amounting to T$1.6\u00a0million (US$861,000).[15] Throughout the archipelago, 1,130\u00a0buildings were affected, half of which were completely destroyed. Of those structures not destroyed, 34\u00a0percent sustained major damage, including 13\u00a0schools. Approximately 2,300\u00a0people were left homeless by the storm.[16] Total damage from the storm amounted to an estimated T$90.2\u00a0million (US$48\u00a0million).[17]"

In addition, six electricians, a front end loader, and a tractor were sent to assist in restoration and debris removal efforts.[18] Australia provided A$50,000 in emergency supplies including blankets, water containers, tarpaulins, kitchen sets and hygiene kits.[19] On January\u00a022, the director of Tonga's National Emergency Office, Leveni Aho, announced that the scale of damage was beyond Tonga's ability to handle on its own and made a formal request for internal aid. Following this, China sent 400\u00a0tents to house displaced persons while France provided a cargo plane for supply transport.[14] In accordance with the FRANZ agreement, enacted in 1992, the Government of France established an air route from Nuku'alofa to Ha'apai and deployed an aircraft carrier from New Caledonia. The carrier, loaded with supplies from the French Red Cross, arrived in Tonga on January\u00a017.[20] The Government of Turkey made a contribution of US$50,000 to assist Tonga with relief operations.[21] The Japanese Government provided 600\u00a0jerrycans and 30\u00a0water tanks (3,700\u00a0litre capacity), collectively worth \u00a513\u00a0million (US$127,000).[22] Recovery from the cyclone was slow with over 80 families still living in tents over a year after the system had affected the islands.[23]"

        "content": " The October 2008 Central America floods were caused by a series of low-pressure areas including Tropical Depression Sixteen, a short-lived tropical cyclone in the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season that made landfall in Honduras. Heavy rainfall began in early October 2008 while a tropical wave passed through the region. On October\u00a014, Tropical Depression Sixteen formed just off the northeast coast of Honduras, and at the same time a low-pressure system was on the Pacific coast. Both systems increased rainfall across the region, although the depression dropped heavy rainfall close to its center when it moved ashore on October\u00a015. Although Tropical Depression Sixteen quickly dissipated over land, its remnants persisted for several days. Another low-pressure area interacted with a cold front on October\u00a021, adding to the rainfall in the region. Heavy rainfall extended from Costa Rica to southeastern Mexico, causing what was considered the worst natural disaster in the region since Hurricane Mitch in 1998. In the former country, rainfall totaled 2,100 millimetres (83\u00a0in) over several weeks, making the week ending October\u00a017 the wettest in San Jos\u00e9 since 1944. Floods in Costa Rica damaged 32\u00a0bridges and roads in 174\u00a0locations, while 1,396\u00a0homes were damaged, killing seven people. In Nicaragua to the north, weeks of heavy rainfall killed 16\u00a0people and damaged or destroyed 1,333\u00a0houses. In Honduras where the tropical depression made landfall, rainfall reached 1.2 metres (3.9\u00a0ft) in some areas, although the highest official total there related to the depression was 360 millimetres (14\u00a0in) on the offshore Roat\u00e1n over six days. About 40% of municipalities in the country experienced flooding, forcing over 50,000\u00a0people to leave their homes. The floods damaged about 50% of roads in Honduras, and over 10,000\u00a0houses were damaged or destroyed. Damage totaled about 3\u00a0billion lempiras (HNL, $225\u00a0million USD),[nb 1] and there were 60\u00a0deaths. In northern Guatemala, the floods damaged about 67,000\u00a0ha (170,000 acres) of crop fields, accounting for Q128.9\u00a0million (2008\u00a0GTQ, US$16.8\u00a0million) in crop damage. There were 17\u00a0deaths and about 4,000\u00a0damaged houses in Guatemala. In neighboring El Salvador, the rains contributed to October 2008 being the third-wettest month across the country, after Hurricane Stan in 2005 and Hurricane Mitch in 1998. One person died, and hundreds were forced to evacuate their houses. In Belize, the rains flooded about 1,000\u00a0homes, forcing the evacuation of one entire town for health reasons. The rains caused additional flooding following Tropical Storm Arthur striking the country in May, damaging a bridge that was rebuilt after Arthur. Nationwide, the floods caused BZ$54.1\u00a0million (BZD, US$27.1\u00a0million) in damage and two deaths."

        "content": "Widespread rainfall occurred throughout Central America in early October 2008 due to the passage of a tropical wave through the region.[1] Later, another tropical wave approached the region, which was believed to have left the west coast of Africa on September\u00a017. The wave developed a low-pressure area on October\u00a010 in the southwestern Caribbean, with sporadic convection.[2] On October\u00a013, the system consisted of a large area of convection drifting northward offshore eastern Central America,[3] and Dvorak classifications began, indicating gradual organization.[2] At that time, there was another low-pressure area on the Pacific coast, and both systems were producing rainfall across Central America.[4] At 1200\u00a0UTC on October\u00a014, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) indicated that Tropical Depression Sixteen developed about 85 kilometres (53\u00a0mi) northeast of Cabo Gracias a Dios, a point where the border of Nicaragua and Honduras meet the Caribbean.[2] In the hours after the depression's formation, the convection decreased, and hurricane hunters indicated that the small low-level circulation was rotating around a broader circulation. Shortly after 1200\u00a0UTC on October\u00a015, the weak tropical depression made landfall just west of Punta Patuca in northern Honduras,[2] with a broad and ill-defined circulation.[5] Continuing west-southwestward over land, the circulation dissipated on October\u00a016 over the mountains of central Honduras, although the depression's remnants continued to produce rainfall across the region for several days.[2] On October\u00a021, a cold front was moving through the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, interacting with a newly formed low in the Gulf of Honduras to produce additional rainfall.[6][7]"

A tropical storm warning was also issued for the coast of Belize.[2] When the NHC began issuing advisories on the depression, the agency anticipated the depression would intensify into a strong tropical storm, based on low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures; however, the agency noted uncertainty in the track. A ridge to the north was expected to steer the nascent depression westward, and two tropical cyclone forecast models predicted the storm would continue west-northwestward to strike Belize. Other models forecast a more immediate landfall, which would limit intensification.[8] While the storm was active, officials in Honduras issued a yellow alert for seven departments where heavy rainfall had occurred.[9] A nationwide yellow alert was also issued for El Salvador, meaning there was potential for flooding and landslides,[10] although alerts were dropped on October\u00a021 when the threat of rainfall diminished.[11]"

        "header": "Impact",
        "content": "Although a weak tropical cyclone, the depression and its remnants dropped heavy rainfall across Central America for several days, spreading into Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, and Belize. In Honduras where it made landfall, rainfall peaked at 360 millimetres (14\u00a0in) on the offshore Roat\u00e1n over six days.[2] A member from Mercy Corps estimated the rainfall in October to have totaled around 1.2 metres (3.9\u00a0ft) in some areas.[12] On the mainland, rainfall reached 266 millimetres (10.5\u00a0in) at El Empalme.[2] In El Salvador, the depression dropped heavy rainfall, mainly in the southern coastal portion, with a 24-hour peak of 239 millimetres (9.4\u00a0in) in Puerto Parada en La Uni\u00f3n.[13] Over a period of eight days, rainfall in Belize reached 547 millimetres (21.5\u00a0in) at Baldy Beacon.[2] Rainfall extended as far north as southeastern Mexico.[14] Throughout the region, the flooding destroyed about 10,000\u00a0homes and left about 250,000\u00a0people homeless. News agencies considered the flooding the worst in the region since Hurricane Mitch in 1998.[15] According to Costa Rica's National Meteorology Institute, the week ending on October\u00a017 was the wettest in San Jos\u00e9 since 1944.[16] Over a period of several weeks, rainfall reached about 2,100 millimetres (83\u00a0in).[14] The influence between the precursor to the depression and a low-pressure area in the eastern Pacific caused flooding in Costa Rica that killed seven people.[2][17] In Guanacaste Province, a landslide covered three cars, and in Monteverde, another landslide knocked over a power line that killed two people.[18] In Parrita, an ambulance carrying four people was struck by a fallen tree, while in Puntarenas, another vehicle was struck by a tree, killing one of its occupants.[19] Transport was disrupted in widespread areas in the north and south of the country due to landslides blocking roads.[14] Across the country, the floods compromised roads in 174\u00a0locations and damaged 32\u00a0bridges.[20] Flooding isolated about 6,900\u00a0people in 75\u00a0communities,[21] and about 77,000\u00a0people were forced to leave their homes.[22] Power outages affected 89\u00a0communities,[23] and 424\u00a0water wells along the Pacific coast were polluted. Nationwide, the floods damaged 1,396\u00a0houses and 39\u00a0schools.[20] In early October, heavy rainfall began affecting Nicaragua, causing mudslides and flooding.[24] The tropical depression added to weeks of heavy rainfall that killed 16\u00a0people,[25] many caused by people attempting to cross swollen rivers.[26] Toward the end of October 2008, Lake Managua overflowed, causing flooding in the capital city of Managua.[27] Across the country, 2,273\u00a0people evacuated to storm shelters after the floods damaged or destroyed 1,333\u00a0houses.[28] Transportation was disrupted when the floods wrecked four bridges and 154 miles (248\u00a0km) of highways.[25] Classes were canceled in Le\u00f3n and Chinandega departments.[16] The crops in the latter department were almost entirely destroyed.[29] Following months of drought conditions, the heavy rainfall in Honduras caused flooding, initially in the southern and central portions,[30] although the entire country experienced rainfall,[23] with 40% of municipalities experiencing flooding.[31] The rains caused widespread landslides, particularly in the western and central portions.[23] In the capital city Tegucigalpa, the rainfall in October was estimated to have been twice the average annual total.[32] In two locations, the Pan-American Highway was disrupted by either landslide or flooding,[33] and widespread areas were isolated nationwide by flooded roads.[34] According to Reuters, about 50% of the roads in Honduras were damaged during the floods,[31] with 227\u00a0roads and 106\u00a0bridges damaged.[35] A landslide near Corqu\u00edn blocked a river and created a natural dam, forcing hundreds of nearby residents to leave.[36] In Col\u00f3n Department, the Tocoa River overflowed, while flooding in Atl\u00e1ntida damaged crop lands.[37] A total of 101,107\u00a0ha (249,840 acres) of crops were damaged,[38] mostly in Comayagua Department. 14\u00a0water systems were damaged,[23] and 150,000\u00a0people lost power in Olancho Department.[38] Landslides in Tegucigalpa killed six and displaced about 500\u00a0people.[39] In El Progreso, 375\u00a0inmates from a jail had to be evacuated to another facility.[40] A total of 50,676\u00a0people were forced to evacuate in the country, most of whom stayed in shelters.[41] 2,474\u00a0homes were destroyed in Honduras, with another 8,688 damaged or flooded.[41] In addition, at least nine schools were damaged or destroyed.[42] Nationwide, the floods killed 60\u00a0people,[43] and damage was estimated at about 3\u00a0billion lempiras (HNL, US$225\u00a0million).[41] The low death toll compared to Hurricane Mitch was largely due to the widespread evacuations.[44] Floods in Guatemala overflowed rivers and caused landslides in Izabal and Pet\u00e9n departments, blocking many roads.[45] The rising rivers damaged about 175\u00a0houses, forcing hundreds of people to leave their homes.[46] About 67,000\u00a0ha (170,000 acres) of crop fields were damaged or destroyed, including corn, rice, and beans,[43] and crop damage nationwide was estimated at Q128.9\u00a0million (2008\u00a0GTQ, US$16.8\u00a0million). About 2.5% of the national corn crop and 3.7% of the rice crop were wrecked during the floods.[47] Nationwide, about 4,000\u00a0houses and 82\u00a0roads were damaged or destroyed,[23] and 17\u00a0people died in the country from the floods.[43] In neighboring El Salvador, floods affected the houses of about 600\u00a0families.[10] High levels forced officials to release water from several dams, causing urban flooding. Along the coastline, the floods damaged maize and bean crops.[23] The average rainfall across El Salvador for the month of October was 475 millimetres (18.7\u00a0in). This was the third-highest for October since such record keeping began in 1971, after 2005 when Hurricane Stan struck and 1998 when Hurricane Mitch crossed the area.[48] The tropical depression killed one person in the country.[2] In Belize, the rainfall in one week represented the average monthly values at some stations.[6] Heavy rainfall from the depression caused levels to rise along rivers and creeks. A bridge that had been rebuilt following earlier Tropical Storm Arthur was flooded, prompting the Belize Defence Force to assist in crossings.[49] This isolated much of Cayo District from the rest of the country until the bridge was repaired. On the western portion of the district, flooding along the Macal River damaged a bridge crossing into northern Guatemala, which restricted traffic only to people returning home.[50] Levels along the Macal and the Belize River were higher than the floods of Hurricane Mitch in 1998, but less than that of Hurricane Keith in 2000.[6] The floods caused residents to evacuate after over 1,000\u00a0homes were flooded;[51] 311\u00a0people stayed in shelters, while the remainder stayed with families and relatives.[52] Of the affected houses, 12 were destroyed and 802 were severely damaged.[6] Most of the affected population was in rural areas of western Belize.[6] One village in Orange Walk District had to be quarantined due to the health threat from the floods for 25\u00a0days.[53] Many roads were closed,[52] and there were widespread school closures.[50] Overall, the floods killed two people in the country and caused BZ$54.1\u00a0million (BZD, US$27.1\u00a0million) in damage. Most of the damage was agricultural, accounting for BZ$28.2\u00a0million (BZD, US$14.1\u00a0million), or 25% of the country's agricultural gross domestic product. Other damage included BZ$11.7\u00a0million (BZD, US$6.3\u00a0million) to roads and bridges. The ongoing floods caused BZ$2.7\u00a0million (BZD, US$1.5\u00a0million) in tourism losses, due to closed facilities and water damage.[6]"

The Belize National Emergency Management Organization provided meals to about 9,000\u00a0people following the floods.[51] Across the affected areas, the Red Cross spent about $247,000 to provide food and blankets.[63] In the weeks and months following the flooding, various international groups provided aid totaling nearly $11\u00a0million. The United States donated $622,732 worth of assistance, mainly to help with logistical work and relief efforts.[64] The United States military also worked to purify drinking water in Honduras.[65] Canada donated $412,201 worth of assistance, including providing shelter in Honduras and rebuilding schools. The country of Brazil donated about $1.68\u00a0million worth of food. The Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection department of the European Commission provided nearly $2.2\u00a0million for relief efforts. Other European country donations included nearly $500,000 from Ireland for hygiene and food supplies, $675,675 from the Netherlands for general relief efforts, $154,570 from Spain through the World Food Programme, $159,559 from Germany for shelters, and $892,468 from Sweden. Several Asian countries donated to the relief efforts, including $123,810 from Japan to Honduras to purchase emergency goods, $22,000 from South Korea, and $10,000 from Singapore to Honduras. Non-governmental organizations and other groups providing aid included $1.5\u00a0million from the Central Emergency Response Fund, $300,000 from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, $120,000 from Catholic Relief Services, and $289,000 from ACT Alliance.[64] In November, weeks after the tropical depression struck Honduras, Tropical Storm Paloma formed in the western Caribbean and caused additional rainfall in the region.[66]"

Murjan became the first cyclonic storm of the season.[11] The cyclone continued tracking westward at 14 knots (26\u00a0km/h; 16\u00a0mph). Microwave satellite imagery depicted that most of the convection remained to the south of the system. At that time, Murjan was tracking just south of a subtropical ridge in an environment with low vertical wind shear.[12] The storm crossed the coast of Somalia by late 25 October and gradually weakened into a depression.[13] The India Meteorological Department issued their final bulletin for Murjan at 06:00\u00a0UTC of 26 October 2012.[14] There were reports of severe flooding in Bosaso city in Somalia.[15] The storm brought strong winds and heavy but beneficial rains within the areas of Bari region (Bossasso, Ishkushban and Bandar Beyla) according to the Somalia Water and Land Information Management.[16]"

The storm made landfall at peak intensity near Mahabalipuram on 31 October,[22] and started weakening. Reporting that the storm reached a peak intensity of 55 knots (102\u00a0km/h; 63\u00a0mph) (1-min sustained winds), the JTWC issued their last advisory on the system.[23] In the early hours of November 1, Nilam weakened into a Deep Depression.[24] As it moved further inland into the Rayalaseema region of Andhra Pradesh, Nilam further weakened into a Depression.[25] Nilam dissipated on November 2, over north interior Karnataka.[26] The storm brought torrential rains to Sri Lanka. The Puttalam \u2013 Mannar road was submerged under about a meter of water near Eluwankulama due to the overflowing of the Kala Oya river. According to the police, a 27-year-old woman was killed when a sand rock fell on her house during heavy rains at Habaraduwa in Galle District. Rail services were temporarily suspended when electricity lines fell on the railway track.[27] In Chennai, all schools and colleges were closed as 282 schools and 52 community hallwereve been converted into cyclone shelters. Danger signal 7 was hosted in Chennai, Ennore, Cuddalore and Nagapattinam ports of Tamil Nadu and in Puducherry, and danger signal 3 in Krishnapatnam, Vadarevu, Machilipatnam and Nizampatnam ports of Andhra Pradesh.[28]"

In an environment with weak to moderate vertical wind shear and high sea surface temperatures, the depression intensified further. The same night, the JTWC initiated advisories on the system, classifying it as a tropical storm with one minute sustained winds of 35 knots.[32] On November 18, BOB 03 encountered strong wind shear from the south west that diminished most of its convection. Soon, the LLCC became fully exposed, as a result of the wind shear. Located just north of a subtropical ridge, BOB 03's inflow was affected by dry air that wrapped the center of the storm.[33] The following day, IMD reported the storm had weakened into a depression and was predicted to weaken further.[34] At the same time, JTWC stopped tracking BOB 03, stating that the storm's wind speeds had diminished to below warning criteria.[35] By 1800 UTC of 19 November 2012, IMD reported the storm had weakened into a well marked low-pressure area and issued their last bulletin for the system. The system later had a few bursts of convection, before dissipating completely off the coast of southern India, on November 20.

Over the following few days, the depression gradually intensified into a deep depression, and subsequently a cyclonic storm by October 30. It made landfall near Mahabalipuram on October 31 as a strong cyclonic storm with peak winds of 85\u00a0km/h (55\u00a0mph).[1] In Chennai's Marina Beach, strong winds pushed piles of sand ashore and seawater reached nearly a 100\u00a0m (330\u00a0ft) inland. Schools and colleges in the city remained closed for more than three days.[2] More than 3000\u00a0people were evacuated around Mahabalipuram in the wake of the storm. Schools and colleges in Chennai declared holidays until November\u00a01 as 282\u00a0schools had been converted into relief centers. Government offices and private organizations closed their operations by 3\u00a0p.m. to ease traffic congestion. Cyclone shelters had been arranged in Nagapattinam and Cuddalore districts. Mahabalipuram faced power outages and 90 trees were uprooted and two huts were damaged.[3] While damages to property were considerable, human casualties were very few.[4] Nilam was initially estimated to have caused economic losses of around \u20b9700 million (US$8.4\u00a0million) to \u20b9800 million (US$9.6\u00a0million).[5] The figures soon went up to \u20b9100 crore (US$12\u00a0million).[6] Later, as the Andhra Pradesh government conducted their review on the storm, it was revealed that the state suffered huge economic losses of \u20b9200 crore (US$24\u00a0million).[7] In Bangalore, heavy rains and strong winds felled over 86\u00a0trees. One fell on the compound wall of a police commissioner's residence, causing structural damage. In Basava Road, a tree pulled down power lines, along with six electric poles outing power in the locality. Over 3,000 tonnes of debris was cleared out using 285\u00a0trucks. 87.5 millimetres (3.44\u00a0in) of rainfall was recorded in the city with a maximum sustained windspeed of 47\u00a0km/h (29\u00a0mph).[8]"

The ninth tropical depression, eighth named storm, and fourth hurricane of the 2016 Atlantic hurricane season, Hermine developed in the Florida Straits on August\u00a028 from a long-tracked tropical wave. The precursor system dropped heavy rainfall in portions of the Caribbean, especially the Dominican Republic and Cuba. In the former, the storm damaged more than 200\u00a0homes and displaced over 1,000\u00a0people. Although some areas of Cuba recorded more than 12\u00a0in (300\u00a0mm) of rain, the precipitation was generally beneficial due to a severe drought. After being designated on August\u00a029, Hermine shifted northeastwards due to a trough over Georgia and steadily intensified into an 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) Category 1 hurricane just before making landfall in the Florida Panhandle during September\u00a02. After moving inland, Hermine quickly weakened and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September\u00a03 near the Outer Banks of North Carolina. The remnant system meandered offshore the Northeastern United States before dissipating over southeastern Massachusetts on September\u00a08. In preparation of Hermine, multiple tropical cyclone warnings and watches were issued in the Southeastern United States, while state of emergencies were declared in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, and New Jersey. Storm surge and heavy rainfall along the Florida Gulf Coast caused significant damage. In Citrus County, one of the worst areas impacted, 2,694\u00a0structures sustained damage, of which 531 suffered major damage, while damage reached about $102\u00a0million. Similar coastal and freshwater flooding occurred in Pasco County, where 7\u00a0homes were destroyed, 305\u00a0sustained major damage, and 1,564\u00a0received minor damage. Winds primarily left power outages and downed trees, some of which fell onto buildings and vehicles. About 325,000\u00a0people were left without electricity, including 80% of Tallahassee. One death occurred in the state after a tree fell on a homeless man's tent near Ocala. Flooding and fairly strong winds in other states such as Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina caused further damage, but to a lesser degree. One fatality each occurred in South Carolina and North Carolina. In New York, two fishermen drowned near the Wading River on Long Island due to rough surf. Overall, Hermine caused about $550\u00a0million (2016\u00a0USD) in damage in the United States."

Environmental conditions were expected to be favorable for continued organization.[3] Dry and stable air was an initial inhibiting factor in development,[4] with deep convection waning on August\u00a020 and August\u00a021.[2] However, the convection and circulation had become better defined by August\u00a021.[5] By August\u00a023, the system had developed an elongated and poorly-defined circulation, as indicated by the Hurricane Hunters,[6] though convention continued to expand.[2] On the next day, the low pressure area crossed Guadeloupe into the Caribbean Sea while producing gale-force winds.[7][8] By this point, the NHC noted that the system could develop into a tropical depression at any time, as the system was only lacking a well-defined circulation.[9] Marginal wind shear disrupted the system's organization, and it passed north of Puerto Rico without further development,[10] with winds dropping below gale-force on August\u00a025.[11] Initially, the system moved quickly westward with a forward speed averaging about 23\u00a0mph (37\u00a0km/h), but slowed down considerably after the northern portion of the wave split off on August\u00a026.[2] The low pressure area crossed the southern Bahamas with scattered convection,[12] becoming more defined on August 27 while moving near the northern Cuban coast.[13] Wind shear prevented quicker development,[14] although conditions became more favorable closer to the Gulf of Mexico. On August 28, the convection increased and became more organized.[15] Later that day, the Hurricane Hunters observed a well-defined circulation.[16] Based on the observations and the convective organization, it is estimated that Tropical Depression Nine developed at 18:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a028 while situated about 60\u00a0mi (100\u00a0km) south-southeast of Key West, Florida.[2] Deep convection increased further as the depression moved more into the Gulf of Mexico,[17] steered by a ridge over southern Florida,[18] although it remained ragged and displaced from the circulation.[19] Dry air to the system's west negated the otherwise favorable warm waters.[18] The depression failed to organize more on August 30 as the low- and mid-level circulations remained misaligned.[20] A large plume of convection developed over the system on August 31 as outflow improved and wind shear decreased.[21] Later that day, reports from the Hurricane Hunters indicated that the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Hermine about 395\u00a0mi (640\u00a0km) southwest of Apalachicola, Florida.[22] Late on August 31, Hermine began accelerating to the northeast, influenced by a developing mid-level trough over the southeastern United States.[23] Lessening shear and water temperatures around 86\u00a0\u00b0F (30\u00a0\u00b0C) allowed the storm to intensify.[24] Although outflow was restricted to the northwest, curved rainbands increased over the eastern half of the system,[25] increasing the extent of tropical storm-force winds.[26] Additionally, a ragged eye became visible on satellite imagery on September\u00a01, and at 18:00\u00a0UTC, Hermine intensified into a Category\u00a01 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale.[2] The hurricane strengthened slightly further to a peak intensity of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) by 00:00\u00a0UTC on September 2.[27] At around 05:30\u00a0UTC (1:30\u00a0a.m.\u00a0EDT) that day, Hermine made landfall just east of St. Marks, Florida, at peak intensity, with a minimum pressure of 981\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.00\u00a0inHg).[2] Hermine became the first hurricane to make landfall in Florida since Wilma on October 24, 2005.[28] Within four hours of landfall, the winds dropped below hurricane force as the appearance on radar imagery degraded.[29] The convection diminished while Hermine crossed into Georgia, with the strongest winds near the Atlantic coast.[30] The center elongated as it continued quickly northeastward ahead of the trough.[31] With the convection far ahead of the circulation, Hermine transitioned into an extratropical cyclone at 12:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a03 as it emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the Outer Banks of North Carolina.[2] Dry air wrapped into the eastward-moving center,[32] while convection pulsed north of the former hurricane, possibly due to the warmer waters of the Gulf Stream.[33] By September\u00a05, the system devolved into several rotating circulations as the overall system slowed and turned to the northwest, steered by a ridge to the north.[34] The convection began waning on the next day,[35] as the storm turned due westward.[36] At 18:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a06, the NHC ceased issuing advisories on the post-tropical cyclone as Hermine continued to weaken amid cooler waters and convective stability.[37] The remnants continued to meander offshore New Jersey and Long Island, eventually dissipating near Chatham, Massachusetts late on September\u00a08.[2]"

        "content": "On August 30, the NHC began issuing tropical cyclone warnings and watches for the Florida Gulf Coast. By the time Hermine reached hurricane status, a hurricane warning was in place from the mouth of the Suwannee River to Mexico Beach. A tropical storm warning extended southward to Englewood, which included the Tampa Bay Area, and westward to the Walton\u2013Bay county line. A hurricane watch was also in effect from the mouths of the Suwannee and Anclote rivers. On August 31, a tropical storm watch was added for the Atlantic coast between Marineland, Florida, to the Altamaha Sound in Georgia. As Hermine approached and moved up the coast, tropical storm warnings were in place as far south as Marineland, and as far northeast as Sagamore Beach, Massachusetts, including portions of the Tidal Potomac River, the Chesapeake and Delaware bays, Long Island Sound, New York City, Block Island, Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket, and Cape Cod. All tropical storm warnings were dropped when the NHC discontinued advisories at 18:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a06.[2] Florida Governor Rick Scott declared a state of emergency for 51\u00a0counties.[38] In response to the then-developing storm, early voting for the primary election on August 30 was extended by one day in Bradford, Broward, Charlotte, Duval, Hillsborough, Miami-Dade, Orange, Osceola, Palm Beach. and Pinellas counties.[39] In six counties, school was canceled on September 1 and 2, while twenty-nine other counties had no school on September 2.[38][40] Mandatory evacuations were ordered for portions of Dixie, Franklin, Taylor, and Wakulla counties.[38] States of emergencies were declared in Georgia,[28] North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, and New Jersey due to the storm.[41] Hermine affected the east coast of the United States during the busy Labor Day weekend, causing many beaches to be closed in Delaware, New Jersey, and New York.[41] Amtrak canceled or altered train lines due to the threat from the storm.[28] In Savannah, Georgia, Bacon Fest was cancelled, and a beer fest was moved indoors.[42] In Charleston, South Carolina, the city government provided 3,000\u00a0sandbags to residents, preparing less than a year after damaging floods hit the state. Outer Banks ferry service was cancelled[43] and bridges in Dare County, North Carolina, were closed due to the high winds. Officials deployed or readied swift water teams, helicopters, and the North Carolina National Guard in the eastern portion of the state. The Virginia National Guard utilized 270\u00a0members to help prepare for the storm's potential flooding and power outages.[43] A Bruce Springsteen concert in Virginia Beach, Virginia, was postponed two days,[41] and several performances for the town's American Music Festival were cancelled or moved indoors.[44]"

Primarily, streets were inundated with water, though at least one house was flooded.[47] In the Dominican Republic, some areas received nearly 4\u00a0in (100\u00a0mm) of rain on August 25 alone from Hermine's precursor. In 19 provinces, residents and authorities were on alert due to rapidly rising rivers and expectations of flooding.[48] Throughout the country, the storm damaged more than 200\u00a0homes and displaced over 1,000\u00a0people.[49] While in its developmental stages, the precursor low dropped 3 to 5\u00a0in (76 to 127\u00a0mm) of rainfall across northern Cuba.[13] Candelaria in western Cuba recorded 12.24\u00a0in (310.8\u00a0mm).[50] At Cienfuegos, 4.25\u00a0in (108\u00a0mm) of precipitation fell in only three hours.[2] The rains alleviated drought conditions and helped replenish reservoirs, while also causing landslides.[50] The Zaza Reservoir \u2013 the largest in Cuba \u2013 increased its total water volume by 495,000,000 cubic feet (14,000,000\u00a0m3), bringing the levels to 30% capacity. In Bataban\u00f3 on Cuba's southern coast,  8.5\u00a0in (215\u00a0mm) of rainfall caused moderate flooding.[51] Near Havana, the electric company shut off power to prevent accidents, while damage occurred to gas lines.[50]"

On the ground for 1.2\u00a0mi (1.9\u00a0km), the twister damaged about 100\u00a0trees, along with several fences and windows.[58] The storm spawned three other EF0 tornadoes, all in Taylor County, none of which caused damage.[59] High winds from the hurricane knocked down many trees in northwestern Florida, some of which fell onto power lines and roofs. The resulting power outages affected about 325,000\u00a0people,[28] roughly 1% of all homes and businesses in the state.[43] In Leon County, where the state capital Tallahassee is, 57% of homes lost power,[43] including approximately 80% of the city proper, as well as Florida State University.[28] Of the 145,000\u00a0homes and businesses that lost electricity, 3,685\u00a0were still without power six days after the storm.[59] Strong winds in the Tallahassee area caused trees to fall onto several houses, injuring a number of people.[28] Hermine was the first hurricane to directly affect the city since Hurricane Kate in 1985.[43] Throughout Leon County, 45\u00a0homes or businesses were destroyed, 187\u00a0suffered severe damage, and 259 experienced minor damage.[59] Losses across Leon County reached $10.3\u00a0million.[60] Storm surge and abnormally high tides caused significant damage along the Gulf Coast of Florida. In Franklin County, coastal flooding occurred in Alligator Point, Apalachicola, and Carrabelle. A total of 27\u00a0homes or businesses were demolished, 43\u00a0suffered major damage, and 102\u00a0others sustained minor damage.[59] Winds in Wakulla County downed a number of trees, with 133\u00a0falling on roadways and 7\u00a0falling on homes.[59][28] A total of 115\u00a0power lines were downed, with about 14,759\u00a0customers losing electricity.[59] The Gulf Specimen Marine Laboratory in Panacea suffered extensive damage, especially to their educational Living Dock.[61] The Wakulla River at Wakulla Springs reached its second highest level recorded, behind only Hurricane Dennis in 2005. One business was destroyed and four homes sustained severe damage, while an additional forty-three dwellings experienced minor damage.[59] In Jefferson County, much of the impact consisted of downed trees and power lines.[62] About 62% of residents were left without electricity.[63] Strong winds in Madison County left similar impact, but little structural damage. However, the Madison Creative Arts School suffered severe roof damage, while a mansion was damaged by a large falling tree.[64] Twelve people were rescued in Taylor County due to storm surge,[65] including six in Steinhatchee. Throughout the county, approximately 75\u00a0homes or businesses were inflicted major damage, while 60\u00a0suffered minor impact.[59] At Dekle Beach, the storm damaged several buildings and wrecked a 300\u00a0ft (91\u00a0m) fishing pier.[28] In Dixie County, storm surge heights generally ranged from 8 to 9\u00a0ft (2.4 to 2.7\u00a0m) and peaked just inches below observations during the 1993 Storm of the Century. A total of 61\u00a0homes or businesses that were demolished, 540\u00a0sustained major damage, and 322 suffered minor impact.[59] Much of the damage in Levy County was also due to storm surge, with 6 to 8\u00a0ft (1.8 to 2.4\u00a0m) above average tides observed.[59] In Cedar Key, storm surge washed across the entire island. The only grocery store suffered wind and coastal flood damage, with food scattered on the floor. At a motel, water swept away air conditioners and left seaweed and mud inside. The storm caused an electrical fire that burnt down the clam processing plant. On Dock Street, which contains several restaurants on stilts, the decks and interiors of the restaurants were damaged.[66] The post office and city hall were severely damaged.[67] Storm damage in Cedar Key was estimated at over $10\u00a0million.[66] Additionally, over 40\u00a0homes and businesses in west Yankeetown were damaged by coastal flooding. Throughout Levy County, one structure was destroyed, 68\u00a0suffered major damage, and 51\u00a0others received minor impact.[59] Coastal areas of Citrus County suffered from significant flooding; 2,694\u00a0structures sustained damage, of which 531 suffered major damage. Total losses in the county reached $102\u00a0million.[68] In Hernando County, the storm destroyed two houses and severely damaged 18 more, with 179 sustaining minor damage; the county damage toll was estimated at $7.8\u00a0million.[69] Heavy rainfall in the Tampa Bay Area flooded streets, causing cars to stall, and forced people to evacuate their homes.[56] Power outages affected the local wastewater treatment plant, causing 938,000 US gallons (3,550,000\u00a0L) of partially treated sewage to flow into Hillsborough Bay.[70] In Pasco County, 18\u00a0people required rescue from high-water vehicles and were transported to nearby shelters.[28] Property damage totaled $111\u00a0million,[71] making Hermine one of the costliest storms on record in the county. Of the 2,672\u00a0households affected, 7 were destroyed, 305 sustained major damage, and 1,564 sustained minor damage.[72][73] Damage incurred by roads was estimated at $30\u201350\u00a0million.[74] Much of the impact in Hillsborough County was caused by wind, with a gust up to 58\u00a0mph (93\u00a0km/h) observed at Port Tampa. Throughout the county, 8\u00a0homes sustained minor damage, 7\u00a0dwellings experienced major damage, and 9\u00a0homes were destroyed. Damage was estimated at $800,000.[75] In Hillsborough and Pinellas counties, about 39,000\u00a0people lost electricity.[59] Numerous trees were uprooted or snapped in Alachua County, with several damaging homes in Gainesville. A number of power lines were also downed. In Marion County, trees were reported downed in several areas. A falling tree damaged a house, while another fell on a road and was later hit by a car, causing two people to be hospitalized.[76] Additionally, a homeless man camping near Ocala was killed when a tree fell on his tent.[75] In Lake County, wind gusts estimated at 58\u00a0mph (93\u00a0km/h) downed trees and power lines in several cities, including Clermont, Eustis, Groveland, Mascotte, Mount Dora, and Tavares.[59] In Manatee County, precipitation totals generally ranged from 5 to 10\u00a0in (130 to 250\u00a0mm), inundating streets in the eastern parts of the county. Residents in Bradenton, located in the western side of the county, evacuated their homes due to freshwater flooding.[59] Coastal flooding also occurred due to tides of 2\u20133\u00a0ft (0.61\u20130.91\u00a0m) above average. Winds reached tropical storm force at the Sarasota\u2013Bradenton International Airport, with damage to roofs and porches, especially in Brandenton and Ellenton. Throughout the county, impacts from the storm left 72\u00a0homes with minor damage and 21\u00a0others with major impact. Damage in Manatee County reached $5.1\u00a0million. Heavy rain fell across Sarasota County, ranging from 4 to 7\u00a0in (100 to 180\u00a0mm) during the three day period. Widespread street flooding occurred in the eastern portions of the county, while some residents in Sarasota evacuated their homes. Damage caused by flooding reached about $250,000. Along the coast, tides 2 to 3\u00a0ft (0.61 to 0.91\u00a0m) above normal left major or moderate damage to 34\u00a0homes and minor impact to another. Additionally, beach erosion damage occurred at Lido Beach and Turtle Beach. Coastal flooding damage in Sarasota County reached about $4.75\u00a0million. In Collier County, coastal flooding left docks and low-lying streets under water, including State Road 92 near Goodland Bay. Everglades Airpark in Everglades City was closed after high water reached the runway.[59]"

The first, with a 4.83\u00a0mi (7.77\u00a0km) path, knocked down or broke thousands of trees in Liberty County, some of which fell onto homes. The other struck Skidaway Island and downed hundreds of trees, causing damage to 20\u00a0roofs.[84] On St. Simons Island, the storm sank up to five boats at the Morning Star Marina.[76] In southwestern Georgia, impact in several counties was limited to down trees and power lines, including in Berrien, Colquitt, Cook, Dougherty, Grady, Tift, Thomas, Lanier, Mitchell, and Worth counties.[59] A pecan farm near Ray City, located in Berrien County, suffered roughly US$4\u00a0million in damage as winds of 40 to 55\u00a0mph (64 to 89\u00a0km/h) felled about 1,000\u00a0trees and ruined 1\u00a0million pounds of fruit.[85] In Grady County, about 2,800\u00a0customers lost electricity. The storm left power outages in Colquitt County, where a tree fell on a house. Winds in Dougherty County downed tree limbs that damage two roofs, while 200\u00a0electrical service losses occurred. In Tift County, trees and power lines were downed on many roadways, including Route 41 and Route 125.[59] It was estimated that Lowndes County experienced sustained winds near 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h).[86] The storm downed a number of trees and power lines, with hundreds falling in Valdosta, resulting in the closure of about 90\u00a0roads throughout Lowndes County.[59] Some of the trees also fell on houses.[86] Another road was closed after a box culvert washed out.[87] A bridge along Old Quitman Road was damaged and required repairs.[88] Additionally, about 31,000\u00a0customers were left without electricity. The winds downed approximately 1,000\u00a0pecans trees, leaving about $3\u00a0million in damage to the pecan crop. Property damage totaled around $1\u00a0million. Sewer systems were overwhelmed by heavy rainfall, causing up a sewage spillage of up to 117,000\u00a0gallons.[59] The storm flooded roads and downed trees in South Carolina, mostly in Beaufort, Bluffton, and Hilton Head Island.[43] At Hilton Head Island, falling trees severely damaged 13\u00a0homes, one of which just over two weeks after a tree had fallen in the same manner upon the same house. Damage to the dwellings reached about $250,000. Falling trees damaged at least two homes in Edisto Beach, while strong winds deroofed and ripped sidings off several other residences. In Cottageville, a man was killed after being hit by a car while he was removing a fallen tree from the highway.[89] In the Charleston area, the airport observed a daily rainfall record of 2.32\u00a0in (59\u00a0mm) on September\u00a02. A number of roads were flooded in downtown Charleston and North Charleston. In Dorchester County, high winds downed a number of trees, some of which caused roads to be closed. A tree also struck a liquid oxygen tank at the medical center in Summerville, causing a leak that forced the closure of all entrances to the complex. Nearly 7,000\u00a0people in the county were left without electricity at the height of the storm.[90] Strong winds in eastern North Carolina resulted in sporadic power outages. Hermine spawned two EF1 tornadoes and one EF0 tornado over Outer Banks.[59] One knocking over two trailers and injuring four people.[91] The tornadoes collectively left about $30,000 in damage.[59] High winds knocked over an 18-wheeler tractor-trailer crossing the Alligator River bridge on U.S. Route 64, killing the driver.[41][42] Flooding covered portions of Highway 12, the main roadway through the Outer Banks.[43] Bands of heavy rain associated with Hermine produced rainfall totals of 4 to 8\u00a0in (100 to 200\u00a0mm) over most of the region, with the highest amounts near the coast. Widespread poor drainage flooding occurred, with a few reports of flash flooding. Damage across Dare County reached $5.5\u00a0million;[59] most of the damage was concentrated on Hatteras Island with flooding in Frisco and Hatteras.[92] In Virginia, abnormally high tides resulted in coastal flooding, particularly in the Norfolk area. A number of low-lying and flood prone neighborhoods were inundated, while Willoughby Spit became impassable. Cars parked at Hague Tower apartments were submerged up to their windows. In Virginia Beach, winds downed signs and branches and ripped siding from a hotel. At another hotel, some rooms suffered roof leaks.[93] On eastern Long Island, two fishermen drowned after being swept into the ocean near the Wading River due to rough surf.[94] Their bodies were later recovered in Shoreham.[95] Nantucket offshore Massachusetts recorded sustained winds of 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h) on September\u00a05, with gusts to 52\u00a0mph (84\u00a0km/h).[96] Royal Caribbean's Anthem of the Seas encountered 40\u00a0ft (12\u00a0m) seas and 112\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h) winds on its trek from New Jersey to Bermuda, leaving several passengers seasick.[97] In Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, minor wind damage occurred because trees were still fully leaved in those states. Coastal flooding was limited due to storm surge peaking at low tide.[59]"

        "content": "After Hermine exited the state, Florida governor Rick Scott took an aerial tour of the damage in Cedar Key and Steinhatchee, pledging that affected businesses would receive assistance from the state government.[43] On September\u00a020, Governor Scott submitted a request to the federal government for individual disaster assistance in 12\u00a0counties and public assistance in 15\u00a0counties. United States president Barack Obama issued a disaster declaration on September\u00a028. Residents and households in Citrus, Dixie, Hernando, Hillsborough, Leon, Levy,\nPasco, and Pinellas counties became eligible for aid. In Citrus, Dixie, Franklin, Jefferson, Lafayette, Leon, Levy, Liberty, Madison, Pasco, Pinellas, Suwannee, Taylor, and Wakulla counties, money was allotted to state and local governments as well as some private, nonprofit\norganizations on a cost-sharing basis; this fund allowed for emergency work on or replacement of buildings damaged by the storm. Additionally, the state of Florida received money from the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program for hazard mitigation.[98] However, the disaster declaration was eventually expanded to several other counties. By November\u00a02, Alachua, Baker, Columbia, Gadsden, Gilchrist, Manatee, Marion, Sarasota, Sumter, and Union counties were eligible for public assistance or both public and individual assistance.[99] In addition to federal aid, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) opened five disaster recovery centers, with one in Citrus County, one in Dixie County, one in Leon County, and two in Levy County. These disaster centers were staffed by representatives of FEMA, the Florida Division of Emergency Management, the Small Business Administration, and other state agencies. FEMA agents also went door-to-door in Tallahassee to ask residents about damage to their property.[100] In Lee County, crews were deployed to collect plant debris.[101] Due to storm damage, officials in Hernando County provided curbside debris removal, and two parks were closed.[102] The post office in Cedar Key was damaged severely enough to remain closed for repairs until February,[103] while the city hall has yet[as of?] to reopen. In the meantime, city business has been conducted in a double-wide trailer near the city hall.[104] In Franklin County, the St. George Island Bridge was reopened just 15\u00a0hours after its closure to allow access to cleanup crews.[105]"

        "content": " The 2007 Brooklyn tornado was the strongest tornado on record to strike in New York City. It formed in the early morning hours of August 8, 2007, skipping along an approximately 9 miles (14\u00a0km)-long path, from Staten Island across The Narrows to Brooklyn.[2] The worst damage was in and around Sunset Park and Bay Ridge, in Brooklyn. The U.S. National Weather Service estimated its strength there as an EF2 on the Enhanced Fujita scale.[3] No serious injuries or fatalities were reported as a result of the tornado, but several people were treated at area hospitals for flying glass injuries. At least 40 buildings and 100 cars were damaged. New York State Senator Martin Golden\u2019s office estimated damage in the tens of millions of U.S. dollars.[4] The storm system produced severe street flooding, and disrupted all modes of transportation throughout the city. Service was delayed or suspended on all 24 New York City Subway services during the morning rush hour, and nine services were still not running by the evening rush.[5]"

        "content": "The typical summer storm system that spawned the tornado gathered strength over Pennsylvania, caused heavy rain over New Jersey and continued its eastward movement, reaching New York City at sunrise.[6] According to the National Weather Service, the first tornado first touched down in Staten Island at approximately 6:22 am EDT (1022 UTC) in the vicinity of St. Austins Place in the Livingston - Randall Manor area, before moving east, with additional damage occurring in the Tompkinsville area, probably from a subsequent tornado that formed from a new area of circulation just north of the first tornado. Most of the damage on Staten Island was to trees, and was rated EF1 intensity with estimated winds of 86\u2013110 miles per hour (138\u2013177\u00a0km/h). The circulation intensified, and headed east across The Narrows tidal strait, just north of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, and the tornado re-developed and touched down again in Brooklyn, at Bay Ridge at 6:32 am EDT. It continued on an east-northeast path across 68th Street between Third and Fourth Avenues, damaging the roofs of 11 homes. The storm continued to move east-northeast into Leif Ericson Park Square, where severe damage to trees occurred, and where winds blew out a 15-foot-tall (4.6\u00a0m) stained glass window valued at $300,000 at the nearby Fourth Avenue Presbyterian Church.[7] It then crossed the Brooklyn Queens Expressway. The tornado touched down farther northeast with scattered tree damage along Sixth Avenue. Based on the assessed damage this stage of the tornado was classified EF2 with wind speeds of 111 to 135\u00a0mph (179 to 217\u00a0km/h). The tornado returned to the ground with another pocket of significant damage on 58th Street between Sixth and Seventh Avenues. Roofs were ripped off 5 homes, with tree damage indicating strong EF1 damage. The tornado then headed east and touched down again in Kensington and the Flatbush neighborhood of Prospect Park South at approximately 6:40 am EDT. Approximately 30 trees were uprooted along Ocean Parkway.[2] The National Weather Service had issued a tornado warning for portions of Staten Island and Brooklyn at 6:28 am. Tornado warnings were also briefly issued for eastern Brooklyn and Southern Queens and Nassau County on Long Island, but no tornadoes were reported in those areas.[8]"

Hansen of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies at Columbia University in New York City cautioned against linking any single event with global warming, but did say that the probability of severe weather events is related. \"You cannot blame a single specific event, such as this week's storm, on climate change. However, it is fair to ask whether the human changes have altered the likelihood of such events. There the answer seems to be 'yes.'\", he was quoted as saying.[6]"

As the result, price of picking a boat taxi rise up to between Rp 100,000,-  to Rp 300,000,-, far above its usual price.[10][11] Katingan Regency Resort Police has urged owners of boats to avoid setting prices too high during the floods.[12][10] Prices of groceries such as chicken meat, fish, and vegetables rose in Sampit due to isolation caused by roads being cut off by the flood.[13] Road between city of Palangka Raya and town of Buntok in South Barito Regency were also cut off, trapping many cars and trucks.[14] The flood also began to affect the city of Palangka Raya, particularly in Jekan Raya and Pahandut district.[15][16] The flood hampered daily economic activities in the city, resulting in many stores owned by city residents to be closed. Several have taken refuge in Panarung subdistrict.[16] On 10 September, the mayor of the city declared a state of emergency.[17] Due to continuous high-intensity rain and overflow of Kahayan River, some city residents that refused to take refuge started to contract illness. As the result, city government has to set up free emergency healthcare posts.[18] Floods in the city is reportedly to be as deep as one meter. It also caused clean water crisis as parts of city's electricity has been cut off, making electric pumps which most of city's residents relied on could not be used.[19] The Indonesian government with National Board for Disaster Management had begun distributing aids and evacuating people in the affected regions.[20][21][22] Many environmentalist organizations and activists cited environmental destruction and deforestation in the province as the main cause of the flood.[23][24] Governor of Central Kalimantan Sugianto Sabran said the cause of the flood was logging from designated industrial forest areas in his province.[25] The South Kalimantan government dispatched personnel to assist affected regions as a sign of solidarity, as many people of Central Kalimantan helped and donated to victims of 2021 South Kalimantan floods in early February.[26] On 16 September, Ministry of Social Affairs, Tri Rismaharini visited the city and affected regions. During her visit on several public kitchens, she received complaints that they have not yet received aid from Minister of Social Affairs. She stated soon they will begun distributing aid to affected families.[27][28]"

        "content": "The March 20\u201322, 2018 nor'easter, dubbed the \"Four'easter\" in some media outlets,[3] brought additional significant late-season snowfall to the Northeastern United States, after three previous such nor'easters had struck the general region on March 1\u20133, 6\u20138, and 12\u201315, respectively. affected the Mid-Atlantic states and New England with over 18\u00a0in (46\u00a0cm) of heavy snow and whiteout conditions. It also affected areas of the Southeastern and Midwestern United States with both snowfall and severe weather. The nor'easter was also one of the heaviest spring snowstorms on record in some areas in the Mid-Atlantic, especially Philadelphia and New York City.[4] Originating from a surface low that formed over the Rocky Mountains, the system tracked across the central United States, bringing some wintry weather to surrounding areas as well as severe weather in the South. It then reached the Northeastern U.S. on March 20\u201321 and, while moving slowly near the shorelines of Delaware, New Jersey, and Long Island, dropped heavy snowfall with rates of up to 5 inches (13\u00a0cm) an hour in some spots. The storm was given unofficial names such as Winter Storm Toby and Nor'easter 4. The storm caused hundreds of flights to be cancelled in advance, and caused many school districts to close for the following day or two. Over 100,000 power outages were reported as a result of the nor'easter. At least 3 people have been killed in the nor'easter as of March 21. In addition, the system produced a tornado outbreak in the Southeast, spawning at least 20 tornadoes on March 19, one of which was a long-tracked EF3 that hit Jacksonville, Alabama causing considerable damage."

        "content": "On March 18, an area of low pressure consolidated over the Rocky Mountains, bringing moderate to heavy snow to those locations.[5] Over the next day or two, this low slowly moved eastward across the Central United States, while also interacting with a stationary front located in the Southeast. This ultimately resulted in a severe weather outbreak in the South late on March 19, producing at least nineteen confirmed tornadoes, one of which was rated an EF3. As the system moved eastwards towards the Eastern United States, it was still somewhat uncertain how much snow the storm would produce, which depended on its track and intensity; as the impending storm grew closer it became increasingly likely a major snowstorm would occur. Precipitation began to spread into the Mid-Atlantic states by early March 20.[6] This first phase of the nor'easter brought freezing rain and snow to much of the Tri-State area, before it began dissipating later that night while snow continued over the Appalachian Mountains from an associated but weakening low. At the same time, a new surface low formed off the Chesapeake Bay around 03:00\u00a0UTC on March 21, prompting the Weather Prediction Center (WPC) to begin issuing storm summaries on the developing nor'easter.[7] After forming, the storm began intensifying as it slowly moved northward parallel to the East Coast, with a large swath of moderate to heavy snow covering the area of New Jersey and Long Island in the morning hours of March 21.[8] Contrary to the previous nor'easters, there was colder air further south then in other storms, which allowed accumulating snow to stick more quickly in areas near southern New Jersey throughout the day. Due to moving slowly near the coast, bands of heavy snowfall (with some embedded rates of up to 4 inches (10\u00a0cm) per hour) hammered the coastline as it continued to slowly move eastward.[9] By the following day, the system attained a minimum pressure of around 988\u00a0mbar (29.2\u00a0inHg). Shortly afterwards however, at 15:00\u00a0UTC, the WPC terminated storm summaries on the nor'easter as most of the snow in New England had tapered off.[10]"

The national weather service said Belgium had as much rainfall in two days (13th and 14th) as it normally gets in a month.[27] Belgium was badly flooded and Li\u00e8ge was cut off on the 14th.[24][28] The flood defences[29] failed in places.[24] The River Dendre flooded Brussels heavily, reaching 46\u00a0cm above alarm level along with several canals on 14 November. 200 houses were evacuated. The Meuse basin also rose 2 metres above the mean level.[21] Floods and heavy rainfall also began in the Netherlands on the 14th.[30] Heavy rains flooded out the centre of the seaside town of Granville in northern France after 2\u00a0inches of rain fell on the region within 24 hours, according to Radio France Internationale.[26] At least one death occurred in Granville during the storm.[26]"

One person was swept away by the floods as she tried to cross a bridge in the south.[31] Army rescue teams helped with emergency evacuations, including a hospital, as many of Belgian's roads were blocked or flooded.[31] Several Belgian regions put disaster emergency plans into operation as a canal burst its banks in several places near Brussels leading to more than 200 houses being evacuated and a pharmaceutical factory closed down due to local flooding.[31] Though the weather had improved, flooding remained a problem in Belgium. A staggering 80 litres per square metre were recorded in a few locations.[32] Despite the 4 deaths and heavy material losses involved, the Belgian government refused to take any responsibility for the state's lack of preparedness for flooding.[32] Both the heavily flooded southern Netherlands and wind-ravaged Luxembourg had no deaths at all in the same period.[32] In the Netherlands, the River Maas broke its banks, causing flooding in several towns. In Limburg, even hilly regions were affected.[30] In the east of North Brabant province, the local water board deliberately flooded fields the size of 50 football pitches to keep the river from rupturing its crumbling embankments.[30] At the town of Baarlo, three rivers rose from 2 to 50 meters at their junction and ran through the town on the 15th.[30] Luxembourg was affected by the same weather complex, but received little, if any damage.[30] Similar scenes occurred in the north of Par.[30]"

This included a \u00a3100,000,000 plan to protect Leeds,[37] though the \u00a314,250,000 Banbury flood prevention scheme would continue.[50] Total relief funds were cut from \u00a3335,000,000 a year to \u00a3261,000,000 for the next 4 years despite climate change Secretary Chris Huhne saying that extreme weather would become more common over time.[37] There were also plans to build permanent flood defences in Upton-upon-Severn, Worcestershire at an estimated cost of \u00a34,500,000.[51]  In Ireland, on the other hand, flooding policies helped reduce storm-related damage.[37] Several businesses in Lostwithiel were badly damaged by the mudslide there. Mud ruined several \u00a33,000 ball gowns in a clothes shop, and a bakery was destroyed.[39] The repairs and flood defences were estimated to cost millions of pounds and take about a year to complete.[52] European insurers agreed on 25 October that they needed to hold up to 37,000,000 euros ($51,480,000) of extra capital under new fiscal solvency rules to cover potential losses from windstorm damage in Europe, in the light of events such as Windstorm Emma, according to loss and exposure aggregator PERILS.[53] Windstorms are expected to increase in air pressure and strength over Europe and the Americas over the next 5\u201310 years.[54] The Eurowind probabilistic risk assessment model that quantifies the prospective risk from windstorms in Europe and is part of WORLDCATenterprise, EQECAT's catastrophe-event-modelling software platform, and would be used to calculate future prospective windstorm and flooding losses.[55][56] The Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) and CloudSat satellite would be used to assess the extent of any future storms as they first emerge in the atmosphere.[57] The insurance company AXA sponsored a three-year-long \u20ac275 million catastrophe bond from 2 November 2, 2010 to cover European windstorm risks in the event of a disaster like Windstorm Emma earlier that decade. The nations covered by the bond scheme are Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.[58] Axa closed its upsized \u20ac275,000,000 catastrophe bond on 2 November to cover itself against potential losses from European windstorms, after upsizing the insurance bond twice in 2010 to meet heavy investor demand. The Irish firm Calypso Capital will be used to cover against potential windstorm insurance claims in its nine Western European member countries between 1 January 2011 and 1 January 2014.[59]"

As a result of this rainfall, flash flooding began to occur over southeastern Texas and southwestern Louisiana.[8][9] Throughout the day, several areas of low pressure and outflow boundaries developed over the Texas Hill Country.[10][11] This caused severe thunderstorms to form over the region, which brought gusty winds, rainfall, and even some reports of hail.[12] The next day, showers and thunderstorms began to develop over South Texas, which brought further rainfall to the area.[13] On May 19, another round of severe thunderstorms moved through both Texas and Louisiana, worsening flooding across both states, and even causing impacts as far away as Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Mississippi.[14] These storms exited into the Gulf of Mexico, and began to be monitored by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) on May 21 for potential tropical cyclogenesis. Initially only given a low chance to develop, the NHC did note that conditions were slightly favorable for a short-lived tropical depression or storm to form in the western Gulf of Mexico, before the disturbance moved ashore back into Texas.[15] By 12:00 UTC that day, a low-level circulation formed in association with the disturbance, however, the system lacked convection needed to designated as a tropical cyclone.[16] Winds near the center reached up to 35\u00a0mph (56\u00a0km/h), with the NHC stating that any increase in thunderstorm activity would warrant the upgrade to a tropical depression, with the chance of doing so being raised to about 60%.[17] Although at 0:00 UTC on May 22 while the disturbance was located roughly 150\u00a0mi (240\u00a0km) east-southeast of Corpus Christi, Texas, the probability of tropical cyclogenesis was lowered to around 50%.[18] Had the system developed into a tropical storm, it would have either received the name Ana or Bill, if the former had not been taken by another more-organized disturbance near Bermuda.[19]"

The tenth named storm and fifth hurricane of the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season, Julia formed from a tropical wave over the southern Caribbean Sea on October\u00a07, just off the coast of South America. Only one storm on record, Tropical Storm Bret in 1993, has tracked further south over South America.[2] On October\u00a09, it became a hurricane and proceeded to make landfall in Nicaragua. It emerged into the Pacific Ocean as a tropical storm late that same day, becoming the eighteenth tropical storm of the 2022 Pacific hurricane season, and the second storm of the season to survive the crossover between the Atlantic\u2013Pacific basin, after Bonnie in July. The storm then briefly moved along the coast of El Salvador, before moving inland and degenerating into an open trough over Guatemala on October\u00a010. Julia brought heavy rains to much of Central America, causing life-threatening flash floods and deadly mudslides, exacerbating an already devastating rainy season. Floods, storm surge and the total or partial collapse of houses forced the evacuation of thousands of people.[3] Its precursor disturbance triggered similar impacts in northern Venezuela.\u00a0Altogether, Julia was responsible for 35 direct deaths, 54 indirect deaths,[1] and at least US\u00a0$406 million in damage."

A few hours later, the westward moving depression traversed the Paraguan\u00e1 Peninsula and then the Guajira Peninsula.[1] During this time, a strong burst of deep convection developed near the center of the depression and its central banding features became better developed, resulting in it strengthening into Tropical Storm Julia soon afterwards, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Julia.[7] That afternoon, the storm began to gain strength as it moved through the warm southwest Caribbean in an environment with moist air and low wind shear. Julia became a hurricane 00:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a09, about 80\u00a0mi (130\u00a0km) east of the coast of Nicaragua. At 06:00\u00a0UTC that morning, the hurricane attained peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 85\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 982\u00a0mbar (29.00\u00a0inHg), and made landfall a little over an hour later near Laguna de Perlas, Nicaragua, at peak intensity.[1] The system then gradually weakened to a tropical storm as it moved westward across Nicaragua, while maintaining a well-defined circulation and deep convection persisting near the center.[8] Late on October\u00a09, Julia, severely weakened, moved off the western coast of Nicaragua and into the East Pacific basin. At 11:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a010, the center of the storm crossed the coast of El Salvador, near Acajutla, with sustained winds of 40\u00a0mph (65\u00a0km/h). It quickly weakened to a Tropical depression inland, and then dissipated later that same day. Residual energy from Julia subsequently contributed to the formation a few days later, of Tropical Storm Karl.[1]"

Initially subtropical, the storm slowly acquired tropical characteristics as it tracked across warmer sea surface temperatures and within an environment of decreasing vertical wind shear. Late on May\u00a027, Beryl transitioned into a tropical cyclone less than 120 miles (190\u00a0km) from North Florida. Early the following day, the storm moved ashore near Jacksonville Beach, Florida, with peak winds of 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h). It quickly weakened to a tropical depression, dropping heavy rainfall while moving slowly across the southeastern United States. A cold front turned Beryl to the northeast, and the storm became extratropical on May\u00a030. The precursor to Beryl produced heavy rainfall in Cuba, causing flooding, mudslides and two deaths. Torrential rain also affected south Florida and the Bahamas. After forming, Beryl produced rough surf along the southeastern U.S. coast, leaving one person from Folly Beach, South Carolina missing. Upon making landfall in Florida, the storm produced strong winds that left 38,000\u00a0people without power. High rains alleviated drought conditions and put out wildfires along the storm's path. A fallen tree killed a man driving in Orangeburg County, South Carolina. In Carteret County, North Carolina, Beryl spawned an EF1 tornado that snapped trees and damaged dozens of homes near Peletier. Overall damage was minor, estimated at $148,000.[nb 1]"

        "content": "The origins of Beryl were from a trough that developed over the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula on May\u00a016. It drifted eastward into the northwestern Caribbean Sea, spawning a low pressure area on May\u00a018. For the next three days, it remained nearly stationary without development, until the system became better defined on May\u00a022 when it began moving to the northeast.[1] On May\u00a023, the elongated low had an area of disorganized convection. While passing over the Cuban Island of Isla de la Juventud, an exposed center of circulation and transient convection was noted due to the effects of high wind shear across the region.[2] The next day, the system moved through the Florida Keys,[1] and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) noted the potential for increasingly favorable conditions over the next two days.[3] The low became better defined as its cloud pattern consolidated. It moved further into the western Atlantic over the next 24 hours, and a band of convection extended across the Bahamas and Cuba to wrap around the southwestern edge of the circulation.[4][5][6] On May\u00a025, the system interacted with a mid- to upper-level low, causing the center to reform further to the northeast. After the system attained gale-force winds near the center and sufficiently organized convection,[1] the NHC initiated advisories on Subtropical Storm Beryl at 0300\u00a0UTC on May\u00a026, while the cyclone was 305\u00a0mi (490\u00a0km) east of Charleston, South Carolina.[7] Post-season analysis indicated that Beryl developed three hours prior.[1] Following Beryl's formation, there was a receding trough over New England that initially created a weak steering environment. Marginally warm waters and dry air were expected to prevent significant intensification,[7] and convection remained minimal through May\u00a026. Later that day, a building ridge caused Beryl to begin a steady southwest motion.[8] By that time, the low-level center became vertically aligned with the upper-level center.[1] The environment near the storm's center became moister and the system began to pass over warmer sea surface temperatures, allowing convection to increase.[9] On May\u00a027, the storm began a transition into a tropical cyclone,[10] which it completed by 1800\u00a0UTC that day.[11] As Beryl approached northeastern Florida, it became better organized, with increased convection in bands around the center.[12] Late on May\u00a027, the Hurricane Hunters observed flight-level winds of 92\u00a0mph (148\u00a0km/h), suggesting maximum sustained winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h); this would be Beryl's peak intensity.[13] It is possible, however, that Beryl briefly reached hurricane intensity early in the evening of May\u00a027 based on Doppler weather radar velocities, although the data is inconclusive according to the post-season report.[1] At roughly 0410\u00a0UTC on May\u00a028 (just after midnight local time), the storm made landfall near Jacksonville Beach, Florida,[14] with winds of about 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) after weakening slightly on the final approach.[1] After moving ashore, Beryl quickly weakened to a tropical depression. It slowed due to the weakening ridge to its north, and an approaching cold front turned it to the north and northeast on May\u00a029.[15][16] Despite being well inland, Beryl retained enough convection to remain a tropical cyclone.[16] As Beryl approached the Atlantic Ocean on May\u00a030, its convection increased to the south and east of the center, although the intrusion of dry air resulted in a ragged appearance on satellite imagery.[17] Based on reports from ships, Beryl was upgraded to a tropical storm on May\u00a030 near the South Carolina coastline.[1] The approaching front caused the storm to accelerate northeastward. Beryl's circulation became elongated and its associated convection spread northward, suggesting the transition into an extratropical cyclone.[18] By late on May\u00a030, Beryl became extratropical, prompting the NHC to discontinue advisories.[19] The storm continued to the northeast, later turning to the east-southeast. On June\u00a02, a larger extratropical storm absorbed the remnants of Beryl to the southeast of Newfoundland.[1]"

Miami Dade College was forced to cancel morning classes on May 23.[29] When the NHC issued their first advisory, the agency also issued a tropical storm warning from the Brevard/Volusia county line in Florida to Edisto Beach, South Carolina. A tropical storm watch was issued northward to the mouth of the Santee River in South Carolina.[30] A state of emergency was issued in Jacksonville, Florida, causing the early ending of a jazz festival and Memorial Day events.[31] When Beryl moved ashore, airports around Jacksonville canceled all flights except for JetBlue Airways and Delta Air Lines.[32] A teenager died in high seas in Daytona Beach, Florida.[33] High surf and rip currents caused lifeguards in the region to restrict swimming in the ocean.[31] The highest storm surge was 3.73\u00a0ft (1.14\u00a0m) at Fernandina Beach.[1] When the storm moved ashore, Beryl produced strong winds along the coast, peaking at 54\u00a0mph (87\u00a0km/h) at Huguenot Park in Jacksonville; nearby Buck Island reported a peak wind gust of 72\u00a0mph (117\u00a0km/h).[34] The winds prompted the Mathews Bridge and Wonderwood Bridge to close.[34][35] Toppled power lines left about 38,000\u00a0residences in Jacksonville without power.[32] In Jacksonville, flash flooding affected areas along Hogans Creek, and waves damaged a seawall and some docks. The waters entered a condominium and three vehicles. Flash flooding covered a portion of U.S. Route 129 in Suwannee County.[34] Damage in Jacksonville was estimated at $20,000.[36] South of Jacksonville, the outer circulation of Beryl spawned a short-lived EF0 tornado in Port Saint Lucie that caused minor damage to two homes.[37] Damage from the tornado was estimated at $20,000.[36] Another tornado was reported in Yankeetown.[1] Due to its slow motion, Beryl dropped heavy rainfall across Florida, peaking at 15.0\u00a0in (380\u00a0mm) in Wellborn.[38] Just South of Wellborn, a motorcyclist in Taylor County, Florida[39] was killed when a car hydroplaned on the flooded highway and struck him head-on. First responders noted that it took them 20 minutes to cover the ten miles due to the nonexistent visibility. Gainesville reported 3.25\u00a0in (83\u00a0mm) on May 28, which broke the previous daily rainfall record.[40] Hernando County Airport broke its daily rainfall record on May 29 with a total of 3.65\u00a0in (93\u00a0mm), which was also the greatest daily rainfall to date in 2012.[41] The rains extinguished 80\u00a0percent of the 25\u00a0wildfires in northern Florida.

        "content": "On 22 March 2017, a well-defined but weak area of low pressure developed over the Coral Sea, near the Louisiade Archipelago of Papua New Guinea. Strong wind shear aloft kept the accompanying convection poorly organised and displaced west of the surface circulation.[3] With environmental conditions forecast to improve and favour cyclogenesis, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology's (BOM) Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre in Brisbane classified the system as a tropical low on 23 March.[4] Throughout the following day, decreasing shear enabled convection to wrap around the low;[5] however, convective activity remained largely transient. A mid-level ridge to the east and an approaching trough over the Tasman Sea steered the low generally south.[6] High sea surface temperatures of 29\u201330\u00a0\u00b0C (84\u201386\u00a0\u00b0F) and excellent dual-channel outflow fuelled rapid consolidation on 24 March. This prompted the United States-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert, indicating the system was likely to acquire gale-force winds within 24\u00a0hours.[7] A scatterometer pass at 11:56\u00a0UTC revealed surface winds of up to 75\u00a0km/h (47\u00a0mph) and subsequent satellite intensity estimates supported gale-intensity, and the JTWC accordingly classified the system as Tropical Cyclone 13P by 21:00\u00a0UTC. With exceptionally favourable environmental conditions ahead of the storm, the agency noted a high probability for rapid deepening before landfall in Queensland.[8] The BOM followed suit soon thereafter, classifying the system as a Category\u00a01 tropical cyclone on the Australian cyclone intensity scale at 00:00\u00a0UTC on 25 March. Concurrently, they assigned it the name Debbie.[9] The cyclone continued to track generally southwards, developing into a Category 2 cyclone later that day. After attaining that strength, Debbie assumed a generally southwestwards track\u2014a track it would maintain, with minor fluctuations, until about 14 hours after landfall.[1] After a day-long period of arrested development, environmental conditions became highly favourable for renewed intensification. Beginning early on 27 March, Debbie strengthened rapidly from Category 2 to a Category 4 severe tropical cyclone in just 12 hours, and achieving peak sustained winds of 175\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph) and a minimum pressure of 949\u00a0hPa (28.02\u00a0inHg).[1] After that, the Dvorak intensity given that the storm weakened slightly. Debbie passed over the Whitsunday Islands in the morning of 28 March local time with winds of 165\u00a0km/h (103\u00a0mph), still at Category 4 intensity. Nonetheless, the cyclone weakened to Category 3 before making landfall in Airlie Beach at 02:40 UTC with winds of 150\u00a0km/h (93\u00a0mph).[1][10] Following landfall, Debbie began to weaken steadily while interacting with North Queensland's rugged terrain. The cyclone weakened below severe tropical cyclone status while passing Collinsville at 12:00 UTC on 28 March.[1] The system was downgraded to Category 1 in the early hours of 29 March local time, and then weakened further to a tropical low six few hours afterwards.[1] The tropical low then executed a long turn to the southeast, and proceeded towards South East Queensland, moving roughly parallel to the coast.[1] The remnants of Debbie brought heavy rainfall\u2014torrential rains in many areas\u2014that resulted in flooding in large parts of the land areas across which it tracked, before moving out over the Pacific Ocean on Friday 31 March.[1]"

Late on 27 March, just over 12 hours prior to landfall, 25,000 residents in low-lying areas of Mackay were ordered to evacuate.[12] Approximately 5,500\u00a0people in the Bowen area were also urged to leave.[11] Across Queensland, more than 400 schools and education centres were closed.[13] All flights at Townsville Airport, Proserpine/Whitsunday Coast Airport, Mackay Airport, Hamilton Island Airport and Moranbah Airport were cancelled from 27 March,[11] and Queensland Rail suspended train services between Rockhampton and Townsville. North Queensland Bulk Ports closed the ports at Mackay, Abbot Point and Hay Point.[14] A total of 1,000\u00a0emergency personnel and more than 200\u00a0Energex workers were deployed to the region to assist with Ergon Energy's preparations and clean up operations.[15][11] The Australian Defence Force formed Joint Task Force 661, dubbed \"Operation Queensland Assist\", to provide assistance with aeromedical evacuation, search and rescue, road clearance, restoration of essential services, emergency accommodation and the delivery of stores if required.[16] The Royal Australian Navy landing ship HMAS Choules set sail from Sydney to Queensland to support post-storm recovery. Normally, HMAS Canberra and HMAS Adelaide would be deployed; however, propulsion issues with the two vessels kept them docked for repairs.[17] Three MRH-90 helicopters from HMAS Albatross were also deployed to Queensland.[18] The Royal Australian Air Force put transport aircraft on standby at Townsville, RAAF Base Amberley and RAAF Base Darwin.[19] The Australian Defence Force's pre-deployment of resources was the largest in the nation's history in advance of a natural disaster;[13] approximately 1,200\u00a0personnel were deployed.[20]"

Many animals would have been left to die.[27] Major damage was reported across Bowen, where most homes had been built before stricter building codes were enforced.[28] Approximately 300\u00a0people, primarily tourists, on Daydream Island were left stranded and in dire need of supplies.[27] Attempts were made to evacuate residents from the island; however, ships were unable to dock as the jetty was destroyed.[20] A flock of cockatoos was caught in the storm near Airlie Beach, and many died while clinging to tree branches. One particular bird, later nicknamed Debbie, was found stripped of its feathers by Townsville Bulletin photographer Alix Sweeney and rescued as the cyclone's eye passed through. The story of Debbie became a viral headline.[29] Although seemingly in good spirits once the storm cleared,[30] the bird died during the overnight of 29\u201330 March likely due to internal injuries.[31][32] Inclement weather and evacuations associated with the cyclone were blamed for a fatal car accident near Proserpine on 27 March, where one person died on-scene whilst two others were hospitalised.[33][34] A man in Proserpine also suffered an injury and was hospitalised after a wall collapsed on him on 28 March.[35] Torrential rains\u2014described by the Bureau of Meteorology as \"phenomenal\"[36]\u2014affected large portions of Queensland, particularly in the Pioneer Basin. Forty-eight-hour accumulations in the area exceeded 1,000\u00a0mm (39\u00a0in)\u2014these areas see an average of 1,500 to 2,000\u00a0mm (59 to 79\u00a0in) of rain per year.[20] West of Mackay, the Kinchant and Middle Creek dams overflowed, prompting additional evacuation of residents.[36] Multiple sections of the Bruce Highway between Townsville and Mackay were submerged by floodwaters, prompting its closure.[37] The ex-tropical cyclone went on to cause damage further south, particularly around the Logan and Albert Rivers, flooding infrastructure such as the Beenleigh railway station and resulting in the death of a 77-year-old man in Eagleby.[38] Damage to Queensland's sugar industry is expected to cost A$150\u00a0million (US$114.5\u00a0million). The majority of these costs lie in Proserpine and Mackay. 35% of all sugarcane in the Proserpine region and 20% of all sugarcane in the Mackay region were damaged, costing A$50\u00a0million (US$38.2\u00a0million) and A$81\u00a0million (US$61.8\u00a0million) respectively.[39] Damage to winter crops in the Bowen\u2013Gumlu region reached A$100\u00a0million (US$76.4\u00a0million).[40] Insured losses across Australia reached A$1.65\u00a0billion (US$1.26\u00a0billion), with 73,000 damage claims being filed.[41] Total economic losses reached A$3.5\u00a0billion (US$2.67\u00a0billion).[1] In addition, a total of eight deaths were reported throughout Queensland.[42]"

        "content": " On May 1, 2016, a wildfire began southwest of Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada. On May\u00a03, it swept through the community, forcing the largest wildfire evacuation in Alberta's history, with upwards of 88,000 people forced from their homes.[14][7] Firefighters were assisted by personnel from both the Canadian Armed Forces and Royal Canadian Mounted Police, as well as other Canadian provincial agencies, to fight the wildfire. Aid for evacuees was provided by various governments and via donations through the Canadian Red Cross and other local and national charitable organizations. Sweeping through Fort McMurray, the wildfire destroyed approximately 2,400 homes and buildings. Another 2,000 residents in three communities were displaced after their homes were declared unsafe for reoccupation due to contamination. The fire continued to spread across northern Alberta and into Saskatchewan,[15] consuming forested areas and impacting Athabasca oil sands operations. With an estimated damage cost of C$9.9\u00a0billion, it was the costliest disaster in Canadian history. The fire spread across approximately 590,000\u00a0ha (1,500,000 acres) before it was declared to be under control on July\u00a05, 2016. It continued to smoulder, and was fully extinguished on August\u00a02, 2017. It is suspected to have been caused by humans in a remote area 15\u00a0km (9.3\u00a0mi) from Fort McMurray, but no official cause has been determined to date. Author John Vaillant documented a detailed account of the fire, its progression, and aftermath within the context of global warming in his best-seller book Fire Weather: On the Front Lines of a Burning World.[16]"

First responders arrived 45 minutes later.[17][18] An official cause of the fire has not been determined, but it was suspected to be human caused.[19] During the start of the fire, an unusually hot, dry air mass was in place over Northern Alberta, which brought record-setting temperatures to Fort McMurray. On May\u00a03, the temperature climbed to 32.8\u00a0\u00b0C (91\u00a0\u00b0F),[20] accompanied by relative humidity as low as 12%.[21] The situation intensified on May 4 when temperatures reached 31.9\u00a0\u00b0C (89\u00a0\u00b0F)[20] and winds gusted to 72\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph).[22] A natural El Ni\u00f1o cycle also led to a dry fall and winter season along with a warm spring, leaving a paltry snowpack, which melted quickly. Combined with the high temperatures, this created a \"perfect storm\" of conditions for an explosive wildfire, and significantly contributed to the fire's rapid growth.[23][24][25][26] Climate change was also cited as a potential contributor to the start and spread of the fire. Debate occurred as to whether it was \"insensitive\" to discuss it during the crisis, or whether the crisis made it \"more important\" to talk about a correlation between human-influenced climate change and wildfires.[27] Canada's politicians and scientists both cautioned that individual fires cannot specifically be linked to climate change, but agree that it is part of a general trend of more intense wildfires.[28]"

These communities had accepted over 8,000 people during the initial evacuations.[17][41][44] The Government of Alberta announced a plan to airlift approximately 8,000 of 25,000 people who had evacuated to oil sands work camps north of Fort McMurray, with assistance from a Royal Canadian Air Force Hercules aircraft, and other planes owned by energy companies operating in the oil sands.[17][45] 1,110 personnel, 145 helicopters, 138 pieces of heavy equipment and 22 air tankers were employed to fight the fire.[44] On May\u00a06, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police began leading convoys to move 1,500 vehicles from oil sand work camps north of Fort McMurray, south along Highway\u00a063 to Edmonton.[46] The fire continued to grow out of control, spreading to 100,000\u00a0ha (250,000 acres) by May\u00a06,[46][47] and 200,000\u00a0ha (490,000 acres) by May\u00a07.[48] As the fire grew to the northeast, the community of Fort McKay, which hosted 5,000 evacuees from Fort McMurray, was itself put under an evacuation notice. Albertan officials anticipated that the fire would double in size, and reach the Saskatchewan border to the east.[49][50]"

Alberta Premier Rachel Notley vowed to address the issue and ensure that the firefighters were paid a minimum of C$11.20 per hour as required by the province's labour laws, rather than the C$15 per day allowance specified in their contract with their South African employer.[68] The Alberta government provided an initial $1,250 per adult and $500 per dependent to cover living expenses for those who had evacuated.[69] On May 4, the provincial government committed to match donations made to the Canadian Red Cross, as well as to donate an additional $2\u00a0million as seed money;[70] the federal government pledged to match all donations to the Canadian Red Cross the next day,[17] with a deadline set to May 31. As of May 9[update], $54\u00a0million has been donated to the Red Cross, not including matching government contributions.[71] On May\u00a04, Public Safety Canada activated the International Charter Space and Major Disasters, thus providing for the charitable and humanitarian re-tasking of the diverse satellite assets of 15 space agencies.[72] Later, Edmonton's Capital Region Housing Corporation (CRHC), along with the City of Edmonton, the Alberta Residential Landlord Association, and Yardi Canada Ltd., announced a partnership to create a registry of rental properties for Fort McMurray evacuees.[73] The non-profit initiative would offer this service free of charge to landlords for the next six months. Some landlords had offered incentives to wildfire evacuees, including reduced security deposits, reduced rent, or free rent for a month or more.[74] Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visited Fort McMurray on May\u00a013 to survey the damage and promised ongoing aid from the federal government in the coming months.[75][76] The Governor General, David Johnston, and Sophie, Countess of Wessex, met with first responders and visited the ruins of the Beacon Hill neighbourhood of Fort McMurray on June 24, 2016.[77]"

While Premier Rachel Notley contended that wildfires were paid by emergency funds that would not be limited to combat a wildfire, local air tanker companies argued that the cuts created a personnel issue, and would make it more difficult to keep staff on duty during the wildfire season. Cuts were also made to fire preparation budgets, which funded activities such as creating fire breaks, but it is not certain that those activities would have been beneficial against a wildfire powerful enough to traverse the Athabasca River.[78][79] The federal government was criticized after international assistance from Australia, Israel, Mexico, the Palestinian Authority, Russia, Taiwan, and the United States was offered in battling the fire, and turned down by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Russia specifically offered Ilyushin Il-76 firefighting aircraft that could handle up to 42 tons of fire suppression at one time. Trudeau said that while the offers were appreciated, they were unnecessary as firefighters from other Canadian provinces were gaining control of the situation.[78][80][81] Trudeau was also criticized on May 6, 2016, for not visiting Fort McMurray and showing support, less than a week after the fire started. Trudeau responded that \"showing up in Fort McMurray, when firefighters are busy trying to contain a massive raging wildfire, is not a particularly helpful thing,\" and comparisons were drawn to former Prime Minister Stephen Harper's visit to Kelowna, British Columbia the previous year. Trudeau visited Fort McMurray a week later on May 13, 2016.[78][82][83]"

Alternative means to collect data from its residents were to be determined at a later date.[88] Some census data was received early, and some residents sent their census data online after the evacuation. Statistics Canada was able to create an accurate 2016 census profile for Fort McMurray using this information, as well as Canada Revenue Agency income tax records, local birth and death records, and long-form census information collected by surveyors going door to door.[89] The neighbourhoods of Waterways, Abasand, and Beacon Hill saw the heaviest damage from the wildfire.

Shell also provided its landing strip to fly employees and their families to Calgary or Edmonton and provided two teams to support firefighting efforts in the area.[93] Suncor Energy and Syncrude Canada also scaled back operations. Suncor's Millennium and North Steepbank mines were two of the largest and oldest oilsands mining operations in the Fort McMurray area, and Syncrude's Mildred Lake oilsands mine is located 35\u00a0km (22\u00a0mi) north of Fort McMurray. The companies accommodated another 2,000 evacuees each at their work camps.[93] On May\u00a07, Syncrude shut down all site and processing operations, removing 4,800 employees from the area.[94] On May\u00a016, all 665 rooms at Blacksands Executive Lodge, a work camp, burned in the wildfire. Earlier that day, about 8,000 people were ordered out of 19 camps; about 6,000 remained. By May\u00a017, the fire appeared to reach the Noralta Lodge, a few kilometres east of Blacksands.[95] Approximately one million barrels of oil a day, equal to a quarter of Canada's oil production, was halted as a result of the fire in May 2016.[96] This continued into June at a rate of 700,000 barrels per day.[97] The lost output was estimated to cost the Albertan economy $70\u00a0million per day, and was a contributing factor to rises in global oil prices.[51] The scaled back operations, along with a refinery outage in Edmonton, caused many gas stations to run out of gas throughout Western Canada.[98] Oil companies restored production and anticipated all financial impacts would wear off by the end of the third fiscal quarter.[97]"

Between, August 31 and October 24, 2016, residents of 470 homes within the three neighbourhoods were able to move home.[90][91][9] In the wake of the wildfire impact on Fort McMurray, the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo created a wildfire recovery plan, establishing a framework and governance structure for recovery efforts. Recovery funding was estimated to be above $4.5\u00a0billion: $615\u00a0million from federal, provincial and municipal governments; $319\u00a0million from the Canadian Red Cross; and $3.58\u00a0billion from the insurance industry.[106][100] As of January 2018, 90% of wildfire claims have been processed according to the Insurance Bureau of Canada.[107] Reconstruction of impacted communities is ongoing, and as of May 2018, 20% of the homes destroyed have been rebuilt.[107][108] The Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo updated their Wildfire Mitigation Strategy in January 2018, which conducted a risk assessment for wildfire behaviour. It also proposed clearing 867 hectares of vegetation, various access and safety standards for planned infrastructure and land development, educating members of the public on wildfire threats, cooperation and joint training between the municipal and provincial departments, and updates to emergency plans.[109] The Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo also raised awareness about rebuilding homes to ensure they are more resilient to fire.[110][111] However, insurance companies only provide funds to restore pre-fire conditions, and an independent review by KPMG found that it was unlikely that this would occur.[112]"

It was first noted over the central North Atlantic Ocean by the Met Office. It then later reached peak intensity just northwest of Ireland and then crossed the north of Scotland hours later. It hung around the coast of Norway for the next week before being absorbed by another strong windstorm named Joachim. Hergen was not the first storm to strike Western Europe during the last week as Cyclone Friedhelm brought widespread damage and very strong winds on 8 December. Hergen was followed by Joachim a few days later, then Oliver /Patrick (Cato/Dagmar) during the Christmas holiday. Cyclone Ulli then brought major damage and flooding to Northern Europe during the early part of January 2012."

At least 212 people died,[2][3][4] 161 people have been injured (including several rescuers),[5] while at least 15,000 people have been made homeless.[6] A further 10,000 homes are thought to be at risk from mudslides, most of them in the favelas, the shanty towns built on the hillsides above downtowns.[7][8] Damage from the flooding has been estimated at $23.76\u00a0billion reais (US$13.3bn, \u20ac9.9bn), about 8% of the gross domestic product (GDP) of Rio de Janeiro State.[9] The flooding particularly affected the city of Rio de Janeiro, where at least 60 people died, and its surrounding area. Deaths were also reported in the cities of Niter\u00f3i (132), S\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alo (16), Paracambi (1), Engenheiro Paulo de Frontin (1), Mag\u00e9 (1), Nil\u00f3polis (1) and Petr\u00f3polis (1).[5][10] Several municipalities, including Niter\u00f3i and municipalities to the east such as Maric\u00e1 and Araruama, have declared states of emergency or of public calamity.[11] The Governor of Rio de Janeiro State, S\u00e9rgio Cabral, declared three days of official mourning for the dead.[11] Heavy rain started at around 5\u00a0p.m. local time (2000 UTC) on Monday April 5th in Rio de Janeiro city, and continued for 24\u00a0hours, with a total of 28.8\u00a0cm (11\u00bd\u00a0in.) of rain falling,[10] more than was predicted for the whole of April[7] and the heaviest rainfall for 30 years.[8] The Brazilian TV station Globo said the rainfall was equivalent to 300,000 Olympic swimming pools of water.[12] There were drivers who were forced to sleep in their cars. There were also firemen who used rubber dinghies to rescue passengers from stranded buses, and shopkeepers who worked very quickly to prevent the rainfall from destroying their businesses.[12] Rio de Janeiro mayor Eduardo Paes admitted that the city's preparedness for heavy rainfall had been \"less than zero,\"[10] but added \"there isn\u2019t a city that wouldn\u2019t have had problems with this level of rainfall.\"[13] A further landslide hit a slum in Niter\u00f3i late on April 7. It is thought to have killed at least 150 people.[14] Around 200 people were missing in the town as of April 13th, 2010.[2] After nearly 300 landslides hit the area, the statue of Christ the Redeemer was cut off from traffic for the first time in history.[2] More than 300 homes were bulldozed after the landslides, and it is estimated that close to 12,000 families will need to be relocated by 2012 due to the damage from the floods.[2]"

They also blame on decades of negligence for this disaster, since Rio de Janeiro has the highest proportion of people living in poverty.[15] Although there were many complaints, the storm itself was not \u201cextraordinary\u201d.

The fire ignited on August 17, 2013, amid the 2013 California wildfire season, and burned 257,314 acres (402\u00a0sq\u00a0mi; 104,131\u00a0ha; 1,041\u00a0km2) in largely remote areas of the Sierra Nevada, including a large portion of Yosemite National Park. The Rim Fire was fully contained on Thursday, October 24, 2013, after a nine-week suppression effort by firefighters. Due to a lack of winter rains, some logs smoldered in the interior portion of the fire footprint throughout the winter, and more than a year passed before the fire was declared totally extinguished in November 2014. The fire was caused by a hunter's illegal fire that got out of control, and it was named for its proximity to the Rim of the World vista point, a scenic overlook on Highway 120 leading up to Yosemite. A total of 112 structures\u2014largely outbuildings\u2014were destroyed in the fire. During suppression efforts, which cost more than $127 million (2013 USD), a total of ten injuries from the wildfire were reported, but there were no fatalities. The Rim Fire grew to be (at the time) the third-largest wildfire in California's recorded history and the largest recorded in the Sierra Nevada. As of 2023[update], the Rim Fire was California's 11th-largest recorded wildfire."

Highways 140 from Merced and 41 from Fresno remained open throughout the fire, providing access to the national park.[34] Law Enforcement Command Posts were set up in the communities of Groveland and Tuolumne City, with hundreds of local and mutual aid Law Enforcement Officers from dozens of agencies responding to assist in evacuations, patrols, and road closures in the affected areas. The event is credited for being the single largest Law Enforcement mutual aid event in the history of the California Law Enforcement Mutual Aid System. At the height of the danger, an estimated 15,000 residents were under evacuation order or advisory, with plans drafted by a Search & Rescue Incident Management Team [35] to evacuate the communities of Groveland, Pine Mountain Lake, Big Oak Flat, Tuolumne City, Tuolumne Rancheria, Ponderosa Hills, Sherwood Forest, Sugar Pine, and Miwuk Village. Several commendations and citations were issued by the county and state for these efforts to the Tuolumne County Sheriff's SAR Team, SAR Field Training Officer Jonathan Rodriguez, and Volunteer Tornado Paul Carlson.[35] On April 17, 2014, Stanislaus National Forest issued an order closing the majority of the burn area to the public through November 18, 2014, citing safety issues from potential falls of heavily burned trees, rock falls, and uneven ground.[36] The decision was met with disappointment by morel mushroom hunters who had looked forward to extensive post-fire fruiting of this highly sought-after mushroom.[37][38][39] The safety rationale was questioned, as Yosemite National Park, which largely prohibits mushroom collecting, had opened up the burn areas within its boundaries to the public earlier in the month.[39][40] Some mushroom hunters stated that they would be willing to sign liability waivers in order to enter the area, but the Forest Service rejected this idea, stating they were ultimately responsible for the safety of those entering the area.[37][38] Extensive harvesting of morels in the Rim Fire area nevertheless took place in May 2014, in a few cases legally by special permit, but in most cases through illegal harvesting.[37][38][41] The closure of the burn area was also criticized by the Tuolumne County Board of Supervisors for, among other reasons, causing the cancellation of grazing allotments by local ranchers.[42] Affected areas of Yosemite National Park reopened on April 2, 2014.[43]"

Researchers estimate that the Rim Fire burned nearly one-fifth of known great gray owl nesting sites, but post-fire surveys found no significant difference in owl detection at burned versus unburned sites.[57] A study of how pre-fire forest conditions affected fire severity found that weather, time since the last fire, and shrub cover had strong positive associations with fire severity, and that under extreme weather conditions, as is often the case with fires that escape initial attack, large areas of high-severity fire are created even in fuels-reduced forests with restored fire regimes.[5]"

Many scientists and conservation groups opposed the logging plan, contending that the removal of trees from this area would harm species such as black-backed woodpeckers and affect other cavity-nesting birds that follow in the wake of the woodpeckers.[58] Other species of wildlife were also considered be at risk from salvage logging, such as frogs that inhabit forested streams and deer.[59][60] Native plants and basic ecological succession of the forest are also reportedly harmed by salvage logging.[61][62] However, some environmental groups endorsed the salvage logging plan.[63] On August 28, 2014, Stanislaus Forest supervisor Susan Skalski signed a Record of Decision approving the Rim Fire Recovery Project.[64] The plan allowed logging within an area of 52 square miles (130\u00a0km2), including interior portions of the burned area and along roadways.[65] Its goals were to: \"Salvage dead trees to capture economic value; remove roadside hazard trees to protect public and worker safety; reduce fuels for future forest resiliency; improve roads for hydrologic function; and, enhance wildlife habitat. A portion of the money captured from the salvage logging was ear-marked for additional projects following the fire.\"[66] The plan attempted to balance competing interests. Instead of the 660 million board feet initially proposed for logging, the final plan included salvage logging of 210 million board feet. The plan left small areas untouched as snag habitat for Black-Backed Woodpeckers and other snag-dependent wildlife. Instead of building permanent new roads, the plan eliminated permanent new road construction and reduced the mileage of temporary roads as part of the salvage logging plan. The Forest Service said that the final plan reflected a collaboration between the timber industry and various environmental groups, who had joined in an attempt to find consensus on the recovery process. Skalski cited that collaborative agreement as being influential in her decision to significantly reduce the amount of salvage material. Forestry officials praised the plan, but some environmental groups denounced it.[65] In August 2016, Stanislaus Forest supervisor Jeanne M. Higgins signed a Record of Decision approving the Rim Fire Reforestation Project.[67] This plan allows 13,000 acres of logging (thinning) and 6,000 acres of herbicide (glyphosate) spraying to kill native and non-native plants."

        "content": " The Mendocino Complex Fire was a large complex of wildfires that burned in northern California for more than three months in 2018.[9] It consisted of two wildfires, the River Fire and Ranch Fire, which burned in Mendocino, Lake, Colusa, and Glenn Counties in California, with the Ranch Fire being California's single-largest recorded wildfire at the time until the August Complex fire in 2020. The Ranch Fire burned eight miles northeast of Ukiah, and the River Fire burned six miles north of Hopland, to the south of the larger Ranch Fire. First reported on July 27, 2018, both fires burned a combined total of 459,123 acres (1,858\u00a0km2), before they were collectively 100% contained on September 18,[1] though hotspots persisted until the complex was fully brought under control on January 4, 2019.[3] The Ranch Fire alone burned 410,203 acres (1,660\u00a0km2), making it the largest wildfire in modern California history at the time until the August Complex fire that occurred in 2020.[3] The Ranch Fire also surpassed the size of the 315,577-acre Rush Fire, which burned across California and Nevada,[10] as well as the Santiago Canyon Fire of 1889, which was previously believed to have been California's all-time largest wildfire.[11][12][a] The fires collectively destroyed 280 structures while damaging 37 others;[1] causing at least $257 million (2018 USD) in damages, including $56 million in insured property damage and $201 million (2018 USD) in fire suppression costs.[6][7] The city of Lakeport, communities of Kelseyville, Lucerne, Upper Lake, Nice, Saratoga Springs, Witter Springs, Potter Valley, and Finley, parts of Hopland, and the tribal communities of Hopland Rancheria, Big Valley Rancheria, and Habematolel Pomo of Upper Lake were evacuated. The smaller River Fire was the first fire in the complex to be contained, reaching full containment on August 13,[13] while the Ranch Fire continued to burn for more than a month after that, with flames on the northern flank of the Ranch Fire pushing eastward from the Snow Mountain Wilderness into Glenn County.[14] The Ranch Fire finally reached full containment during the evening of September 18.[1][15] However, the Ranch Fire continued to burn deep within containment lines until November 7, when the fire was declared to be inactive.[1]"

        "content": "The Mendocino Complex comprised two vegetation fires that burned within miles of each other near Clear Lake, in Northern California. The first of the two fires reported was the Ranch Fire, which was reported on July 27, 2018, at 12:05 PM PDT, off Highway 20 near Potter Valley. Within hours of being reported, the fire had injured two firefighters.[16][17] Approximately one hour later, the River Fire was reported on Old River Road, six miles north of Hopland, located south of the Ranch Fire. By the evening, the River Fire had burned 4,000 acres (16\u00a0km2) and destroyed two buildings, including a home.[18] According to a 2019 report, the Ranch Fire was started by a rancher who had inadvertently sparked dry grass while hammering a metal stake while trying to find a wasp nest.[8][19] The fire threatened the University of California Hopland Research and Extension Center.[18] High heat, low humidity, and rugged terrain challenged control of the fires, with gusty winds causing both to grow. Overnight, five more firefighters were reported injured. By the next morning, the two fires were organized under the \"Mendocino Complex\" name. The River Fire had grown to 3,500 acres (14\u00a0km2), the Ranch Fire had burned 6,000 acres (24\u00a0km2), and both were at two percent containment, with 386 structures being threatened. With Red Flag Warnings in effect, the first mandatory evacuations began in Hopland and with residents along Highway 175. Mendocino College was named an evacuation center.[20] By the afternoon, the community of Lakeport and additional areas of Lake County were placed under mandatory evacuation and, later that evening, Potter Valley and parts of Upper Lake were evacuated.[21][22] By the morning of July 29, three more structures had been destroyed, all houses. Dry and windy conditions persisted, and the lack of available firefighters due to other fires burning in the state slowed attempts at containment.[23] The communities of Witter Springs, Finley, Saratoga Springs, Nice, Bachelor Valley, Scotts Valley, and Big Valley Rancheria were evacuated.[24][25] The fires rapidly grew overnight, with the Ranch Fire totaling 35,076 acres (142\u00a0km2) and the River Fire reaching 20,911 acres (85\u00a0km2) by the morning of July 30, with the fires at 10 percent containment.[26][27] Later in the afternoon of July 30, evacuation orders were lifted for Hopland, the Hopland Rancheria, and the area just north of Largo, while evacuation orders were put in place for Kelseyville and Finley.[28][29] Containment of the fire declined to five percent as the fires grew in size. One more home was destroyed and one damaged.[30] Evacuation orders were lifted for Potter Valley in the afternoon of July 31.[31] By the evening of July 31, the fires had burned a combined total of 80,408 acres (325\u00a0km2) and were 12% contained.[32]"

The Ranch Fire remained at 15 percent containment, while the River Fire was at 38 percent containment. Containment line improvement remained the focus of fire crews, with some crews directly fighting the fire when conditions permitted. Additional crew support arrived from the US Forest Service.[33] Throughout the day, both fires grew, with the Ranch Fire burning into the Mendocino National Forest and south of Lake Pillsbury.[34] Overnight, the fires remained most active in higher elevations. By the morning of August 2, the two fires had burned a combined total of 110,168 acres (446\u00a0km2) and were 39 percent contained.[35] Mandatory evacuations were put in place in Western Lake County, particularly for areas west of Lucerne and north of Clear Lake. On the evening of August 4, the combined acreage was 229,000 acres.[36] By the morning of August 5, the combined acreage was 271,172 acres (1,097\u00a0km2), with 152 buildings destroyed.[37] On the morning of August 6, the combined acreage was 273,664 acres (1,107\u00a0km2), with 169 buildings damaged or destroyed. By the night of August 6, the combined acreage of the Mendocino Complex Fire was 283,800 acres (1,148\u00a0km2), thus surpassing the Thomas Fire to become the largest wildfire complex in modern California history.[38] On August 7, 2018, officials announced that they predicted the Mendocino Complex would last through August and into early September, compared to the earlier prediction of mid-August.[39] By then, the fire complex had destroyed 143 structures, 75 of them residences.[40] By late August 7, the fire complex was 34% contained. Of the two fires, the Ranch and River Fires, the River Fire was 78% contained, while Ranch Fire was only 20% contained, with flames on the northern flank still pushing towards Snow Mountain Wilderness.[14] By the night of August 7, the combined acreage was 283,800 acres (1,148\u00a0km2), with 169 buildings damaged or destroyed. By the morning of August 8, the fire had destroyed 221 buildings, while damaging another 27. By Wednesday morning, on August 8, 2018, the Mendocino Complex Fire had burned 300,086 acres (1,214\u00a0km2) and was 47% contained. Cal Fire estimated that containing the entire fire complex could take until September 1, over a month after it ignited on July 27.[41] By Thursday, August 9, 2018, the total area burned had grown to 302,086 acres. By Saturday morning, on August 11, 2018, the Mendocino Complex Fire had burned 325,226 acres (1,316\u00a0km2), was 67% contained, and had destroyed 258 buildings. On the morning of Sunday, August 12, the Ranch Fire grew to 282,479 acres (1,143.15\u00a0km2) and was only 62% contained, surpassing the Thomas Fire as California's single-largest modern wildfire. Meanwhile, the River Fire remained at 48,920 acres (198.0\u00a0km2), with 93% containment, with the Mendocino Complex Fire having burned a total of 331,399 acres (1,341.12\u00a0km2).[42] During the evening of Monday, August 13, the River Fire was fully contained at 48,920 acres (198.0\u00a0km2), leaving the Ranch Fire as the only active fire within the Mendocino Complex.[13] However, the larger Ranch Fire continued to expand. By the evening of August 14, the Ranch Fire had grown to 305,990 acres (1,238.3\u00a0km2), with only 64% containment, increasing the size of the Mendocino Complex Fire to 354,910 acres (1,436.3\u00a0km2), with a collective containment of 64%.[4] Around that time, it was reported that the Ranch Fire had killed a firefighter from Utah.[4] On August 16, the Ranch Fire grew to 317,117 acres (1,283.33\u00a0km2), increasing the total burn area of the Mendocino Complex Fire to 366,037 acres (1,481.30\u00a0km2);[11] this allowed the Ranch Fire to surpass the size of the massive Rush Fire in 2012, which burned across California into Nevada,[10] as well as the Santiago Canyon Fire of 1889, which was believed to have been California's all-time largest wildfire, estimated at 300,000 acres (1,200\u00a0km2).[12] By the morning of August 18, the Ranch Fire had reached 331,770 acres (1,342.6\u00a0km2), with 76% containment, increasing the size of the Mendocino Complex Fire to 380,690 acres (1,540.6\u00a0km2).[43][44] August 19 was a day of chaos wherein LAFD firefighters were surrounded and had to scramble through the forest to safety. A firefighter was flown to a burn center and another four were treated for burns. Another firefighter was treated for a dislocated shoulder.[45] On August 28, the Ranch Fire reached 410,182 acres (1,659.95\u00a0km2) and was at 93% containment, increasing the Mendocino Complex Fire's burn area to 459,102 acres (1,857.92\u00a0km2). On the same day, it was reported that the Ranch Fire had stopped its forward spread.[46]"

It passed through the Lesser Antilles on October\u00a01, and later stalled in the eastern Caribbean Sea. On October\u00a08, the depression crossed over the Dominican Republic, and subsequently it accelerated to the northeast. It was declassified as a tropical cyclone on October\u00a012, although its remnants persisted for another week before dissipating in the westerlies near the Azores. The depression produced heavy rainfall in the Lesser Antilles, reaching 12\u00a0in (300\u00a0mm) on Barbados; it left three deaths and moderate damage on the island. Another death was reported in the United States Virgin Islands. Torrential rainfall on Puerto Rico inflicted heavy damage, totaling $65 million (1970 USD, $489\u00a0million 2024\u00a0USD). The highest precipitation total was 41.68\u00a0in (1,059\u00a0mm) in Jayuya, of which 17\u00a0in (430\u00a0mm) fell in a 24\u2011hour period. Most of the damage can be attributed to damaged sugar cane and coffee crops. At least 18\u00a0people were killed on the island, and the system was considered one of the worst disasters in Puerto Rican history."

The depression moved generally westward, gradually intensifying to attain peak winds of 35\u00a0mph (56\u00a0km/h) by September\u00a025.[3] A nearby upper-level trough \u2014 an elongated area of low pressure \u2014 hindered further strengthening, and on October\u00a01 the depression struck the island of Saint Lucia. As it crossed the Lesser Antilles, its winds and barometric pressure approached the values of a tropical storm.[2] In the Caribbean, the trough caused the depression to slow to a westward drift, resulting in several days of heavy rainfall in the region, particularly Puerto Rico.[2] One forecast on October\u00a05 anticipated a continued westward track toward Jamaica.[4] Instead, the depression turned to the north the next day under the influence of the upper-level westerlies.[2] On October\u00a07, the depression attained its lowest pressure of 1000\u00a0mbar (29.53\u00a0inHg), off the southern coast of Hispaniola.[3] The next day, it made landfall in Peravia Province in the Dominican Republic.[1] After crossing the country and exiting into the Atlantic Ocean, the depression accelerated to the northeast, followed by an eastward turn on October\u00a010 before another turn to the northeast.[2] By October\u00a012, the depression could no longer be classified as a tropical cyclone, although satellite imagery indicated that its remnants continued northeastward.[3] On October\u00a015 the system turned to the west, suppressed by a strong high-pressure area to its north. It re-intensified while crossing through the Azores, attaining a pressure of 994\u00a0mbar. It turned to the northwest and was absorbed into the westerlies on October\u00a020.[2]"

A girl was also swept by the floods and drowned.[10] The desalination plant on Saint Croix was damaged during the floods, temporarily stopping the supply of drinking water; water from Puerto Rico had to be shipped to provide the 700,000\u00a0gallons needed daily.[11] On St. Thomas, the main airport was closed for several days.[12] For six days, the depression dropped rainfall across the northern Caribbean, particularly in Puerto Rico.[2] The highest overall rainfall total was 41.68\u00a0in (1,059\u00a0mm), recorded at a station near Jayuya in the center of the island.[1] This was the highest rainfall total from a tropical cyclone on record in Puerto Rico, surpassing that of the deadly hurricanes of 1928 and 1899,[1][2] which produced 29.6\u00a0in (750\u00a0mm) and 23.0\u00a0in (580\u00a0mm), respectively.[13] The station at Jayuya also recorded 17\u00a0in (430\u00a0mm) in 24\u00a0hours.[2] Four other locations reported over 30\u00a0in (760\u00a0mm).[14] Such heavy rainfall caused 20\u00a0rivers to swell above flood stages.[15] The depression left 10,000\u00a0people homeless across Puerto Rico,[16] with 3,000 housed in emergency shelters in San Juan.[6] At least 600 houses were destroyed and another 1,000 damaged.[17] Damage was particularly severe in Barceloneta, Aibonito, and Coamo.[16] Across the island, the depression affected at least 40\u00a0state roads,[15] with fifteen blocked by landslides, and eleven bridges destroyed.[18] Flooding forced the closure of Puerto Rico Highway 2 between Manat\u00ed and Barceloneta.[6] The depression left more than $40\u00a0million (1970\u00a0USD, $301\u00a0million 2024\u00a0USD) in crop damage, primarily to sugarcane and coffee, as reported by William R. Poage, the chair of the House Agricultural Committee.[16] Throughout Puerto Rico, the depression caused damage estimated at $65\u00a0million (1970\u00a0USD, $489\u00a0million 2024\u00a0USD),[2] as well as at least 18\u00a0confirmed fatalities. A report six months after the depression indicated there were 34\u00a0people missing, although their status is unknown.[2] In the aftermath of the disaster, Luis A. Ferr\u00e9, the Governor of Puerto Rico, declared a state of emergency over the whole island,[19] asking for $10 million (1970 USD) in federal aid.[16] On October\u00a012, two days after the rains subsided, President Richard Nixon declared the territory as a disaster area.[20] Ferre also appeared in a telethon to raise funds for the homeless. The National Guard, the Red Cross, and other volunteer groups helped the displaced persons.[16] In all, the disaster was described as one of the worst in Puerto Rico history.[18] The Governor of the Virgin Islands, Melvin Evans, requested aid similar to Puerto Rico,[17] and that territory was also declared a federal disaster area about a week after the rains ended.[21] The heavy rainfall in the Virgin Islands caused a marked dinoflagellate algal bloom in the days after the rains ended.[22]"

        "header": "Hurricane Joaquin",
        "content": " Hurricane Joaquin (Spanish: [xwa\u02c8kin], wah-KEEN)[1] was a powerful tropical cyclone that devastated several districts of The Bahamas and caused damage in the Turks and Caicos Islands, parts of the Greater Antilles, and Bermuda. It was also the strongest Atlantic hurricane of non-tropical origin recorded in the satellite era.[2][3] The tenth named storm, third hurricane, and second major hurricane of the 2015 Atlantic hurricane season, Joaquin evolved from a non-tropical low to become a tropical depression on September 28, well southwest of Bermuda. Tempered by unfavorable wind shear, the depression drifted southwestward. After becoming a tropical storm the next day, Joaquin underwent rapid intensification, reaching hurricane status on September 30 and Category 4 major hurricane strength on October 1. Meandering over the southern Bahamas, Joaquin's eye passed near or over several islands. On October 3, the hurricane weakened somewhat and accelerated to the northeast. Abrupt re-intensification ensued later that day, and Joaquin acquired sustained winds of 155\u00a0mph (250\u00a0km/h), just short of Category 5 strength. Hurricane warnings were hoisted across most of The Bahamas as the hurricane threatened the country. Battering the nation's southern islands for over two days, Joaquin caused extensive devastation, most notably on Acklins, Crooked Island, Long Island, Rum Cay, and San Salvador Island. Severe storm surge inundated many communities, trapping hundreds of people in their homes; flooding persisted for days after the hurricane's departure. Prolonged, intense winds brought down trees and powerlines, and unroofed homes throughout the affected region. As airstrips were submerged and heavily damaged, relief workers were limited in their ability to quickly help residents affected by Joaquin, one of the strongest storms on record to affect the nation. Offshore, the American cargo ship El Faro and her 33 members were lost to the hurricane. Coastal flooding also impacted the nearby Turks and Caicos, washing out roadways, compromising seawalls, and damaging homes. Strong winds and heavy rainfall caused some property damage in eastern Cuba. One fisherman died when heavy seas capsized a small boat along the coast of Haiti. Storm tides resulted in severe flooding in several departments of Haiti, forcing families from their homes and destroying crops. The weakening hurricane passed just west of Bermuda on October 4, attended by strong winds that cut power to 15,000 electric subscribers but caused only minor damage otherwise. After passing near Bermuda, Joaquin ultimately curved northeastward and accelerated, weakening further and becoming extratropical as it entered colder waters. After dissipating, its remnants traveled eastward, reaching Portugal before being absorbed by a frontal system. Collectively, Joaquin killed 34 people and caused US$200\u00a0million in damage.[4][5] With all 34 deaths attributed to the storm occurring at sea, Joaquin has the highest offshore death toll for any Atlantic hurricane since the Escuminac hurricane in 1959, which killed 35 people in the Northumberland Strait.[6] Although Joaquin never directly affected the United States, another large storm system over the southeastern states drew tremendous moisture from the hurricane, resulting in catastrophic flooding in South Carolina."

        "content": "On September 25, 2015, the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring an upper-level low, accompanied by a surface trough, several hundred miles south-southwest of Bermuda for possible tropical cyclogenesis.[7] The system gradually consolidated as it drifted north-northwest, acquiring a closed surface low late on September 26.[8] Convective showers and thunderstorms steadily increased on September 27, and at 03:00\u00a0UTC on September 28 the NHC assessed the system to have become a tropical depression, situated roughly 405\u00a0mi (650\u00a0km) southwest of Bermuda.[9][10][11] Although the depression featured a well-defined low, strong wind shear displaced convection and exposed the circulation. A ridge to the north was forecast to steer the system slowly northwest into a region of higher shear; meteorologists at the NHC initially depicted the system dissipating within 96\u00a0hours based on modeling depictions.[10] Convection developed and persisted closer to the circulation centre throughout September 28,[12] and early on September 29, Dvorak satellite classifications indicated the system became a tropical storm. Accordingly, it was assigned the name Joaquin, becoming the tenth named storm of the season.[13][14] Strengthening of the mid-level ridge prompted a sudden shift in Joaquin's trajectory to the southwest, directing it towards the Bahamas.[13][15] Forecasters at the NHC noted considerable uncertainty in the future of Joaquin, with forecast models depicting a wide range of possibilities.[16] Throughout September 29, the storm steadily intensified as its circulation became embedded within deep convection and upper-level outflow became increasingly prominent.[17] High sea surface temperatures and decreasing shear aided strengthening, and early on September 30, the storm achieved hurricane status.[18][19] Rapid intensification ensued thereafter, with an eye developing within a symmetric central dense overcast. Data from aircraft reconnaissance indicated that Joaquin reached Category\u00a03 status on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale by 03:00\u00a0UTC on October 1.[20] Around 12:00\u00a0UTC the eye of Joaquin passed over Samana Cay, Bahamas, with winds of 130\u00a0mph (215\u00a0km/h), making it a Category\u00a04 hurricane.[21] Around this same time, its eye contracted from 41 to 27\u00a0mi (66 to 43\u00a0km) in diameter, representing significant intensification.[22][23] At this time Joaquin was located just 15\u00a0mi (25\u00a0km) northwest of Crooked Island.[24] The storm's central pressure bottomed out at 931 mbar (hPa; 27.49\u00a0inHg) around 00:00\u00a0UTC on October 2.[25] As the ridge previously steering Joaquin southwest began retreating north, the hurricane's movement slowed and shifted west, and later north, early on October 2.[26][27] An eyewall replacement cycle\u2014a process whereby a second, larger eye develops while the inner eye collapses\u2014began that morning;[28] its eye became increasingly ill-defined in satellite imagery.[27] Slight weakening took place accordingly,[29] and the hurricane passed over Rum Cay and San Salvador Island around 16:00\u00a0UTC and 21:00\u00a0UTC with winds of 125\u00a0mph (205\u00a0km/h);[21] a pressure near 944 mbar (hPa; 27.88\u00a0inHg) was observed on San Salvador Island.[30] An amplifying trough over the Southeastern United States enhanced southwesterly flow over Joaquin on October 3 and prompted the hurricane to accelerate northeast away from the Bahamas.[31] Throughout the day the storm's eye became increasingly defined and re-intensification ensued.[32] Aircraft reconnaissance found a considerably stronger system that afternoon; based on flight-level winds of 166\u00a0mph (267\u00a0km/h), it is estimated that Joaquin attained surface winds of 155\u00a0mph (250\u00a0km/h)\u2014a high-end Category\u00a04 hurricane\u2014by 16:00\u00a0UTC.[33] This made Joaquin the strongest Atlantic hurricane of non-tropical origin recorded in the satellite era.[21] Shortly after peaking, the hurricane's overall structure began to deteriorate, signalling a weakening trend.[34] On October 4 the storm curved towards the north-northeast between a large low-pressure system to its west and a mid-level ridge to its east.[35] As deep convection over its core continued to wane,[36] Joaquin passed about 70\u00a0mi (110\u00a0km) west-northwest of Bermuda near 00:00 UTC on October 5, with winds of 85\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h).[21] The weakening trend slowed that day as the storm's satellite presentation improved slightly, marked by brief reappearances of a distinct eye feature. Joaquin gradually turned northeastward around the periphery of the weak ridge, and subsequently accelerated toward the east-northeast as it entered the prevailing westerlies.[37] The system maintained hurricane intensity until 15:00 UTC on October 7, by which point strengthening wind shear and an increasingly colder environment began to take their toll.[38] The cloud pattern became lopsided as colder, drier air infiltrated the circulation, forming the first stages of a frontal structure.[39] With its extratropical transition well underway, Joaquin lost its identity as a tropical cyclone at 03:00 UTC on October 8, about 850\u00a0mi (1,370\u00a0km) southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland.[40] During the next several days, Joaquin's extratropical remnant continued heading eastward across the Atlantic, before reaching Portugal on October 10.[41] During the next 5 days, Joaquin's remnant slowly moved southward along the coast of Portugal, until the system was absorbed by another frontal system located east of Spain, on October 15.[42]"

        "content": "Tropical cyclone watches and warnings were posted throughout the Bahamas starting early on September 30 (UTC);[43] by October 1, hurricane warnings extended from Grand Bahama Island in the northwest to Mayaguana in the southeast.[44] As the storm moved away, the last advisories were discontinued by the morning of October 3.[45] All schools on Exuma, Cat Island, San Salvador, and Rum Cay closed on the afternoon of October 1 until further notice.[46] Bahamasair cancelled multiple domestic flights,[47] and most airports throughout the island nation were closed, pending post-storm runway inspections.[48] Several cruise ships scheduled to arrive at New Providence were diverted to other ports on October 2.[49] Residents on Mayaguana were advised to evacuate.[50] The nation's National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) activated its Emergency Operations Center.[51] As conditions worsened, residents in southern islands of the Bahamas criticized the government for providing inadequate warning, with no emergency preparations taking place on Acklins. NEMA refuted the claim and stated people were given ample warning but many residents refused to evacuate. In some instances, police were called in to forcibly move people to shelters.[52] In the Turks and Caicos Islands to the southeast of the Bahamas, the storm forced the closure of schools and government offices.[53] Two cruise ships were redirected from the island, and Providenciales International Airport suspended operations for a time.[54] The islands were placed under a tropical storm warning on October 1.[44] On October 2 (UTC), tropical storm warnings were hoisted along coastal Camag\u00fcey, Las Tunas, Holgu\u00edn, and Guant\u00e1namo provinces in Cuba.[55] On September 30, Virginian governor Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency for the entire state owing to heavy rains, unrelated to the hurricane, and the threat of Joaquin.[56] The City of Norfolk also declared an emergency.[57] Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy advised residents to be prepared for potential impacts from the hurricane,[58] as did Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York.[59] On October 1, Governors Larry Hogan, Chris Christie, Pat McCrory, and Nikki Haley declared a state of emergency for Maryland, New Jersey, North Carolina, and South Carolina respectively.[60] Ocracoke Island, North Carolina, was placed under a mandatory evacuation at 3:00\u00a0p.m. EDT (19:00\u00a0UTC).[61] In New Jersey, the state of emergency caused the annual Bike MS: City to Shore Ride to be canceled for the first time in its 35-year history.[62] On the afternoon of October 2, a tropical storm watch was issued for Bermuda,[63] and a hurricane warning was in effect late on October 3.[64] As a precaution, Royal Bermuda Regiment soldiers were placed on standby, and some emergency equipment was stationed on the east end of the Causeway to prepare for the possibility of the road becoming impassable;[65] officials ultimately closed the Causeway late on October 4, near the height of the storm, and partially reopened it the next morning.[66][67] By October 3, two cruise ships had canceled their scheduled stops to Bermuda.[68] Most commercial flights to and from the island on October 4 were canceled, and L.F. Wade International Airport suspended all operations that afternoon. Public and private schools were scheduled to close on October 5, though one institution was prepared for use as an emergency shelter. The approaching hurricane halted ferry and bus services.[69]"

        "content": "Large swells ahead of the storm's arrival in the Bahamas washed out a main road on San Salvador Island.[50] Widespread power outages affected several islands as the hurricane closed in.[70] Reports of flooding and people in need of assistance were received from Acklins, Crooked Island, Exuma, and Long Island.[51] Power and communication failures plagued the nation's southeastern islands, leaving several islands effectively isolated in the immediate aftermath of Joaquin.[71] The hurricane took all 59 of BTC's cell sites offline, most of them being returned to service within two weeks.[72] By October 21, the Bahamas Electricity Corporation had remedied about 80% of its power outages, aided by crews from New Providence and the Caribbean Association of Electric Utilities group.[73] Early aerial surveys revealed that Acklins, Rum Cay, Crooked Island, and San Salvador Island were \"completely devastated\".[74] Throughout the archipelago, flooding from the hurricane trapped over 500\u00a0residents.[75] Floodwaters up to 5\u00a0ft (1.5\u00a0m) deep submerged at least 70% of nearby Crooked Island, where the storm left widespread structural damage.[76] The hurricane \"completely destroyed\" a Bahamas Electricity Corporation power plant, where two large diesel tanks were shifted off their bases, allowing more than 10,000 gallons of fuel to leak into the ground.[77] In the days following the storm, about 100 evacuees\u2014including 46 from Crooked Island\u2014were flown to New Providence, where several of them sought medical attention.[78][79] On Long Island and Crooked Island, septic tank seepage contaminated residential wells, leaving residents without clean drinking water. Both areas still had extensive standing water on October 7.[80] Acklins endured severe flooding, with many homes inundated and numerous calls for rescue; the island's sea barrier was breached by 9:00\u00a0a.m. local time. Some residents reported the entire island to be under water.[52] A bridge in Lovely Bay was completely destroyed.[76] Long Island was subject to an immense 18\u00a0ft (5.5\u00a0m) storm surge that flooded homes with up to 12\u00a0ft (3.7\u00a0m) of water.[80][81] Southern areas of the island suffered considerable devastation; the surge washed out coastal roadways and drove numerous fishing boats ashore.[82] The district's Member of Parliament, Loretta Butler-Turner, estimated that 75% of all fishing vessels there were destroyed. This, combined with heavy losses to farms and crops, threatened the livelihoods of many residents.[81] About 20 individuals required rescue on Long Island, while some hurricane shelters became compromised by water entrance.[83] The bodies of dead animals were seen floating in the water.[84] Strong winds unroofed dozens of homes,[75] and many structures were fully destroyed.[85] Northern parts of the island fared better in comparison.[80] The winds and flooding took a large toll on native vegetation, even well inland.[80] Powerful winds brought down trees and utility poles on Rum Cay, clogging roadways.[85] A number of homes were damaged or destroyed in the district; two grocery stores and a municipal dock also sustained damage. A church housing 32 evacuees became flooded and structurally compromised, forcing the inhabitants to relocate.[86] Joaquin also damaged power lines in Exuma, where \"extreme\" flooding was reported. There was modest structural damage on Mayaguana, the easternmost island of the Bahamas.[87] Joaquin was one of the strongest known hurricanes to impact the Bahamas,[88] and directly affected nearly 7,000 people there.[87] Several weeks after the storm, officials estimated that 836 residences had been destroyed, including 413 on Long Island, 227 on San Salvador, 123 on Acklins, 50 on Crooked Island, and 23 on Rum Cay.[72] The storm's effects were considered comparable to the destruction wrought by Hurricane Andrew in 1992, which struck the northwestern Bahamas as a Category\u00a05.[89] Initial claims of numerous casualties throughout the island chain proved unsubstantiated,[74] and although one man died during the storm on Long Island, his death was unrelated to the hurricane.[90] In the aftermath of the hurricane, one person was reported missing on Ragged Island, which escaped with relatively minor effects.[76][80] Initial analysis determined that Joaquin resulted in $120.6\u00a0million in damage. However, one year later it was revealed that the storm actually caused $200\u00a0million in damage across the Bahamian archipelago.[4][5] Due to low insurance penetration, insured losses were expected to account for no more than half of that total.[91] Airports in the hardest-hit districts were damaged, flooded, and carpeted in debris,[76] forcing storm victims to rely on helicopters, seaplanes, and watercraft to deliver storm relief.[82][92] Workers gradually cleared runways for emergency use in the days following the storm,[76] and all airports were open for normal operations by October 9.[72] By October 4, the Government of Jamaica and the United States Agency for International Development had donated 50 tonnes and just over 32 tonnes, respectively, of emergency supplies to the Bahamas.[93] Private groups, local businesses, and non-governmental organizations, such as the Bahamas Red Cross, started donation drives and began distributing goods to storm victims.[94] The Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency arranged for three response teams to evaluate the situation on Acklins, Crooked Island and Long Island.[76] BTC established communication centers on Ragged Island, Inagua, and Long Island, giving affected citizens the opportunity to contact family members for free.[95] A special committee was formed to oversee reconstruction efforts, while government officials began considering new laws to enact stricter building codes.[96] The government pledged to help eligible homeowners rebuild and repair their property.[97] On October 6, Prime Minister of the Bahamas Perry Christie signed an order waiving import duties on materials needed for rebuilding by storm victims and registered charities on 12 islands. Local leaders called for an extension of the three-month exemption period, which many saw as inadequate.[98] In what residents feared to be a major economic setback, storm-related damage forced Club Med to delay the annual opening of its San Salvador resort\u2014the largest employer on the island\u2014by two months.[99] At the end of October, the National Emergency Management Agency began to shift its focus from emergency relief distribution to permanent rebuilding efforts.[100] Parts of the Bahamas were affected by Hurricane Matthew the following year, Hurricane Irma in 2017, and Hurricane Dorian in 2019."

The Coast Guard called off search operations at sunset on October 7, with the ship and her crew presumed lost.[108][109] One body, presumed to be from El Faro, was spotted but could not be recovered.[110][111] A Navy salvage team was requested, at the behest of the National Transportation Safety Board, to search for the wreckage.[112]"

In Cuba, the station at Guant\u00e1namo Bay recorded gusts of 55\u00a0mph (89\u00a0km/h).[25] The storm caused coastal flooding and damage to roofs in Granma Province;[113] more than 100\u00a0homes were affected in the province.[114] Rain from the storm somewhat alleviated conditions from a record drought in Granma, Guant\u00e1namo, and Santiago de Cuba provinces, though many reservoirs remained below 30\u00a0percent capacity in the latter.[115][116] Niquero, Granma, saw 6.2\u00a0in (157\u00a0mm) of rain.[117] Along the northern coast of Haiti's Tiburon Peninsula, high waves from the hurricane capsized a boat with two occupants, killing one of them. Many communes experienced significant coastal flooding from storm tides and active seas, which drove water up to half a kilometer inland. More than 100 homes in Artibonite were inundated, and the main road to Anse-Rouge was impassable.[76][118] Strong winds brought down multiple trees in the commune of Grand-Saline, where severe flooding was also reported. In Nippes and Nord-Ouest, four emergency shelters housed nearly 300 individuals. Joaquin damaged banana and millet fields, killed a small number of livestock, and triggered several landslides.[76] In the four hardest-hit departments, about 900 households were directly affected by the storm. The Haitian government distributed nearly 500 hygiene kits to 200 families in Nippes, while evacuees in Port-de-Paix received mattresses, bed sheets, hygiene kits, food kits, and clean water; Action Against Hunger also donated water purification tablets.[118] North of Haiti, the 212\u00a0ft (65\u00a0m) cargo vessel Minouche began to sink in heavy weather. The U.S. Coast Guard safely rescued all 12 crew members from a life-raft late on October 1.[119]"

The seawall along Front Street on Grand Turk Island was damaged, prompting officials to close part of the road. Multiple homes along the coast faced flooding and leaking roofs. In several areas, pounding surf brought about coastal erosion and deposited large volumes of seaweed. Providenciales International Airport remained closed for two days while its storm-damaged weather station awaited replacement. Additionally, the territory lost fruit and vegetable crops to the storm, especially at the government farm on North Caicos.[127] Although Joaquin ultimately tracked far to the east of the United States, a non-tropical low over the Southeast tapped into the hurricane's moisture. An atmospheric river developed between the two systems, resulting in record-shattering rains and flooding across North and South Carolina. Several areas of South Carolina saw accumulations exceeding the threshold for a 1-in-1,000-year event. The subsequent floods inundated large areas of the state\u2014with areas around Charleston and Columbia hardest-hit\u2014and killed 19 people.[128][129] This storm caused an additional $2 billion (2015 USD) in damage.[130]"

Through the end of August 2018, Cal Fire alone spent $432 million on operations.[21] The catastrophic Camp Fire alone killed at least 85 people, destroyed 18,804 buildings and caused $16.5 billion in property damage, while overall the fires resulted in at least $26.347 billion in property damage and firefighting costs,[13][15][16][17][14] including $25.4 billion in property damage and $947 million in fire suppression costs.[13][14] In mid-July to August 2018, a series of large wildfires erupted across California, mostly in the northern part of the state. On August 4, 2018, a national disaster was declared in Northern California, due to the extensive wildfires burning there.[22] The Carr Fire in July and August 2018 caused more than $1.5 billion (2018 USD) in property damage.[17][23][24][25] The Mendocino Complex Fire burned more than 459,000 acres (186,000\u00a0ha), becoming the largest complex fire in the state's history at the time, with the complex's Ranch Fire surpassing the Thomas Fire and the Santiago Canyon Fire of 1889 to become California's single-largest recorded wildfire.[26][27] In September 2020, the August Complex surpassed the Mendocino Complex to become California's single-largest recorded wildfire.[28] In November 2018, strong winds aggravated conditions in another round of large, destructive fires that occurred across the state. This new batch of wildfires included the Woolsey Fire and the Camp Fire. The Camp Fire destroyed the town of Paradise and killed at least 85 people, with 1 still unaccounted for as of August 2, 2019.[29] The Camp Fire destroyed more than 18,000 structures, becoming both California's deadliest and most destructive wildfire on record. AccuWeather estimated the total economic cost of the 2018 wildfires at $400 billion (2018 USD), which includes property damage, firefighting costs, direct and indirect economic losses, as well as recovery expenditures.[30] Another study, published two years after the fires, estimated the total damages at $148.5 billion, including capital losses, health costs and indirect losses.[31]"

Primary causes of wildfire vary geographically based on many factors, such as topography.[32] For example, characteristically dense forests in the Sierra Nevada Mountains harbor fuel-driven fires while the open central valley from the south Bay Area to San Diego County are more prone to wind-driven fire over dry grasslands.[32]"

One study expresses a lack of sufficient data to confidently determine the rate of coniferous tree decay in the Sierra Nevada.[38] Nonetheless, it is a gradual process, and the remaining dead tree matter is an optimal fuel source for future wild fires."

Global warming has led to higher temperatures and longer summers, creating a drier landscape that gave fires more fuel to burn longer and stronger. [39] Research published August 2018 predicted an increase in the number of wildfires in California as a consequence of climate change.[40] However, from a historical perspective, it has been estimated that prior to 1850, about 4.5 million acres (17,000\u00a0km2) burned yearly, in fires that lasted for months.[41]"

In some areas, the amount of new residences in those areas is 80%.[43] In the past, when these areas burned, no residences were lost, but now residences are present, which end up being destroyed.[44] Furthermore, a \"century of successful fire suppression\" performed in an attempt to protect forests and those living in WUIs has also disrupted natural cycles of disturbance and renewed succession of an ecosystem by allowing fuel to reach abnormal density levels discussed above.

While 6,255 fires occurred,[1] about two-thirds as many as in 2007, the total area burned\u2014 1,593,690 acres (6,449.4 square kilometres)[2]\u2014far exceeded that of previous years.[3] By July 5, 2008, 328 wildfires were burning, and those fires were only 81% contained.[7] For the first time since 1977, the US military helped with ground-based firefighting, when Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger dispatched 400 California National Guard troops, including Chief Medical Officer Susan Pangelinan, to manage fire lines.[8] He said the number of fires had stretched the state's fire-fighting resources thin. \"One never has resources for 1,700 fires. Who has the resources for that?\" Schwarzenegger said, adding, \"Something is happening, clearly. There's more need for resources than ever before... it's fire season all year round.\"[9]"

Over 3,596 individual fires were burning at the height of the period, burning large portions of forests and chaparral in California, injuring at least 34 individuals and killing 32.[5] The majority of the fires were started by lightning from dry thunderstorms on June 20,[11] although some earlier fires ignited during mid-May. International aid from Greece, Cyprus, Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Australia, Canada, Mexico, and New Zealand helped fight the fires.[12] The first of the wildfires was the Big Horn Fire, which ignited on May 13.[13] Three other minor wildfires ignited subsequently, but were extinguished by May 17. On May 20, the Avocado Fire ignited in Fresno County, only to be extinguished 2 days later.[14] On May 22, 2008, the human-caused Summit Fire broke out in the Santa Cruz Mountains, which became the first major fire.[15] On July 5, 2008, California Governor Schwarzenegger commented that \"I've been driving up and down the state of California going to all the various fires, and you can imagine, this state is very prepared for fire, but when you wake up one morning and have 500 fires across the state, it was a real shock to me... only to find the next morning there were 1,000 fires, and the next morning 1,400 fires, and then 1,700 fires igniting over 14 days.\"[16] The Gap Fire near Goleta in Santa Barbara County burned 8,357 acres (3,382 hectares).[17] The fire was contained on July 29, after several weeks of activity.[18] By July 11, 2008, it was reported that a total of 793,483 acres (321,111 hectares) was burned, a total exceeding the initial estimate of 510,000 acres (210,000 hectares) burned by the October 2007 California wildfires.[19] On July 12, 2008, the area burned reached 801,726 acres (324,447 hectares), exceeding the estimated 800,000 acres (320,000 hectares) burned by the 2003 California wildfires, making the Summer 2008 wildfires the greatest wildfire event in Californian history, in terms of burned area. On that date 20,274 personnel had been committed to fight the fires. Total resources included 467 hand crews, 1,503 engines, 423 water tenders, 291 bulldozers, 142 helicopters, 400 soldiers and numerous air tankers. The fire was responsible for the deaths of 23 individuals.[20][21] On July 25, a blaze sparked by target shooting broke out in Mariposa County, in the Sierra Nevada foothills of central California.[22] By the following day, the Telegraph Fire had gone from 1,000 to 16,000 acres (400 to 6,470 hectares), and within days had destroyed 21 homes in the community of Midpines. Residents were evacuated from approximately 300 homes that were immediately threatened, with an additional 4,000 homes placed on standby for evacuation in Midpines, Greeley Hill, and Coulterville.[23] During August, wildfire activity began to diminish, although there were still hundreds of wildfires still burning. On August 29, wildfire activity had largely ended, although three more wildfires ignited after September 1,[24] beginning with the Gladding Fire.[25] On September 10, the Colony Fire was 100% contained, ending the last of the Summer 2008 California wildfires.[26] The Summer 2008 wildfires burned a total of 1,162,197 acres (4,703.24\u00a0km2) between May 2008 and September 2008, comprising the vast majority of burned land by wildfires in California in 2008.[27][16][28] In total, the Summer 2008 wildfires burned a total of 1,161,197 acres (469,920\u00a0ha), which accounts for 84% of the total area burned during the 2008 wildfire season.[29][16][28] In addition, the Summer 2008 fires cost over $92.38 million (2008 USD) to fight.[6] The Basin Complex Fire in the Ventana Wilderness became the third largest wildfire in California's history based on size (until it was surpassed in size by the 2013 Rim Fire), and also the second-costliest wildfire to extinguish in U.S. history.[citation needed]"

        "content": "The fires broke out after three years of below-normal rainfall dehydrated much of California's forests and woodlands, making them prone to wildfires. Spring 2008 for California was the driest on record for many locations; for example, San Francisco registered only 0.67 inches (17\u00a0mm) of rain out of a normal of 5.18 inches (13\u00a0cm) from March to May.[11][30]  As vegetation turned into bone-dry tinder in early June, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger declared a statewide drought for the first time in 17 years.[31] Dry thunderstorms and lightning, rarely seen on the California coastline in June, rolled onshore on the weekend of June 20\u201321. The storm unleashed 25,000 to 26,000 dry lightning strikes across Northern and Central California, igniting more than 2,000 fires.[32][33] The number of wildfires skyrocketed in the days after the thunderstorms and high daily daytime temperatures of over 120\u00a0\u00b0F (49\u00a0\u00b0C) dramatically increased the various fires' growth.[11] The same thunderstorms also caused fires in Oregon.[citation needed] A heat wave commenced on July 7, with temperatures in inland locations, such as the Central Valley soaring above 115\u00a0\u00b0F (46\u00a0\u00b0C). Lake Berryessa recorded a high temperature of 126\u00a0\u00b0F (52\u00a0\u00b0C), prompting weather agencies like the National Weather Service to issue high fire danger warnings.[34] These near to record-breaking temperatures concerned many firefighters, who feared that the high heat, low humidity, and high-elevation winds could make firefighting more strenuous.[35][36]"

The bad air quality also forced the cancellation of the 100-mile (161\u00a0km) Western States Endurance Run, the first in the race's 31-year history.[38] Air quality began to improve on June 28,[38] followed by decreased smoke and improved visibility a day later.[43] By June 30, residents in the Sacramento Valley saw blue skies and good air quality, as a result of onshore winds and the Delta breezes.[44] However, air quality in Oregon degraded as plumes of smoke drifted northward instead of concentrating in the Central Valley.[45]"

They found that monkeys exposed to wildfire smoke as infants had \"significantly reduced inspiratory capacity, residual volume, vital capacity, and functional residual capacity per unit of body weight.\" There was also a trend of reduced total lung capacity in animals exposed to wildfire smoke as infants. Adolescent monkeys exposed to wildfire smoke as infants were also found to have a lessened PBMCs responses to TLR Ligands. TLR5 has been linked with the asthma phenotype experimentally and in human subjects. An important finding in the study was that monkeys over 200 miles away from the combustion were still found to have significant immune and respiratory changes.[48] The findings were consistent with many other human group studies and suggest that children who underwent the same experience as the monkeys in the study have a high chance of exhibiting similar health problems but, that because normal development of rhesus monkeys is accelerated compared to human children the relative impact of this amount of wildfire smoke exposure might differ.[48]"

The Tea Fire ignited in the Cold Springs section of Montecito at approximately 17:50 PST on November 13, 2008. The fire started at a Mar Y Cel historic structure called the \"Tea House\" above Mountain Drive,[5] giving the fire its name. Spreading rapidly, it was fanned by offshore winds, known as Sundowner winds, that blow down the Santa Ynez Mountains, gusting up to 85\u00a0mph (137\u00a0km/h). These winds caused the fire to spread into the city of Santa Barbara.[6] The fire was 40% contained on the 15th,[7] 75% on the 16th,[8] and by November 17, 2008, it was 95% contained after burning 1,940 acres (785 ha),[3] and on November 18, it was 100% contained.

Serban, President of Santa Barbara City College, issued a statement noting that \"nine of the ten individuals identified as allegedly responsible for the Tea Fire have been confirmed as Santa Barbara City College students.\"[12] That same day, Dr. Gayle Beebe, president of Westmont College, noted in a press release the college's relief to learn that none of the ten was enrolled at Westmont. Although the individuals were found guilty of trespassing and holding an illegal bonfire, the DA's office felt there was not enough evidence to convict them of starting the blaze. \"After a months-long investigation by several agencies, the District Attorney\u2019s Office decided it could only charge the group with the misdemeanor crimes, the DA felt as though she would be unable to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the campfire they had started\u00a0\u2014 and, according to group members, extinguished\u00a0\u2014 more than 12 hours earlier had led to the Tea Fire.\"[13]"

The gated community, most of which was reduced to ash by a roaring wildfire that swept through the Sylmar hills late Friday and early Saturday, featured a putting green, an Olympic-size swimming pool and tennis courts. 'It wasn't just a mobile home (park),' said Linda Pogacnik, 63, whose home was destroyed. 'It was the Beverly Hills of mobile homes.'[17] After the effort in Oakridge, a firefighter produced a burned U.S. flag on a broken stick taken from a home that was destroyed in Oakridge.  The firefighter offered it as a sign of hope and bravery for firefighters. The flag was presented by Los Angeles Fire Department Acting Fire Chief Emile Mack to Oakridge Mobile Home Park manager Jinny Harmon.  It was later framed and hung in the new clubhouse at Oakridge, where it can still be seen today.[13] In a press briefing on November 16, 2008, Governor Schwarzenegger noted that the homes in the Oakridge community had ignited \"like matches,\" and called for a review of fire retardancy standards applicable to mobile homes and mobile home parks.[1][18]"

In the UK, the gales brought down power lines, leaving 300,000 homes without electricity in the UK alone. Transportation of all kinds was affected in the UK, France, Germany, Austria and The Netherlands. Damaged power lines and tracks blocked by falling trees affected rail services throughout Europe, while on the roads, commuters faced long delays.[11] The Eurostar service between London and the continent was halted due to a technical problem, as salt from the sea picked up by the wind was deposited on the isolators that connect the trains to the power cables. The conductive salt left trains unable to operate until after a thorough cleaning operation had been completed after the storm's passage.[11] In the far north, a ferry carrying 80 passengers was stranded for 80 hours after it failed to land at Lerwick in the Shetland Isles.  Heathrow airport saw over 60 flights cancelled on 27 October.[11] Jeanett's winds gusted up to 160\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph; 87\u00a0kn), causing widespread damage to the electricity distribution network in England and Wales. Up to two million customers were affected by loss of electricity supply at some point because of the storms, with supplies in East Anglia, South West England and West Wales being particularly disrupted. Most customers were reconnected within 18 hours, but the Department of Trade and Industry estimated that nearly 10,000 customers were still without power on 1 November. Supplies were not fully restored in the worst affected area, served by EDF Energy's subsidiary company 24seven, until Tuesday 5 November, 10 days later.[12] The catastrophe risk modeling firm EQECAT estimated the insured loss for \"Jeanette\" to be in excess of \u20ac1 billion. The most severe losses were expected in the United Kingdom, Germany and The Netherlands, with further substantial losses in the UK, France, Austria, Poland, Czech Republic and Slovakia. Total economic losses from the storm were estimated to be twice this figure.[11] Damage caused by the stormy weather in the United Kingdom was estimated to cost up to \u00a350 million (US$75 million), according to the Association of British Insurers. The British Insurance Brokers\u2019 Association (BIBA) estimated that claims could reach \u00a3200 million ($300 million).

Over the course of the year, 8,648 fires burned 4,304,379 acres (1,741,920\u00a0ha),[1][2] more than four percent of the state's roughly 100 million acres of land, making 2020 the largest wildfire season recorded in California's modern history.[4][5] However, it is roughly equivalent to the pre-1800 levels which averaged around 4.4 million acres yearly and up to 12 million in peak years.[6] California's August Complex fire has been described as the first \"gigafire\", burning over 1 million acres across seven counties, an area larger than the state of Rhode Island. The fires destroyed over 10,000 structures[1] and cost over $12.079 billion (2020 USD) in damages, including over $10 billion in property damage and $2.079 billion in fire suppression costs.[3][2] The intensity of the fire season has been attributed to a combination of more than a century of poor forest management[7][8] and higher temperatures resulting from climate change.[9][10] On August 18, Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency,[11] and on August 19, 2020, reported that the state was battling 367 known fires, many sparked by intense thunderstorms on August 16\u201317 caused by moisture from the remnants of Tropical Storm Fausto. Response and evacuations were complicated by a historic heatwave and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.  On August 22, President Donald Trump issued a major disaster declaration (DR-4558), which provides Individual Assistance and/or Public Assistance. In early September 2020, a combination of a record-breaking heat wave and strong katabatic winds, (including the Jarbo, Diablo, and Santa Ana) caused explosive fire growth.  The August Complex became California's largest recorded wildfire.[12] The Creek Fire expanded in the Big Creek drainage area, temporarily trapping hundreds of campers near the Mammoth Pool Reservoir. The North Complex explosively grew in size as the winds fanned it westward, threatening the city of Oroville, triggering mass evacuations, and causing 16 fatalities.[13] Governor Newsom's request for a federal disaster declaration for six major wildfires was approved on October 17 after having been rejected the previous day.[14][15]"

Despite this, Northern California was still expected to have severe wildfire conditions due to the moderate or severe drought conditions in the area, whereas Central and Southern California were expected to have serious fire conditions later in the year due to the late wet season and precipitation.[18] On June 18, climate scientist Daniel Swain predicted  the 2020 Arizona wildfire season was a sign of what was to come in California, due to similar drought and weather conditions between Arizona and Northern California.[19]"

Scott Stephens, a professor of fire science at UC Berkeley, estimated that prior to 1850, about 4,500,000 acres (1,800,000\u00a0ha) burned yearly, in fires that lasted for months. Activity peaked roughly every 30 years, with up to 11,800,000 acres (4,800,000\u00a0ha) burning during peak years.[7][8][20] The indigenous peoples of California historically set controlled burns and allowed natural fires to run their course.[7][6] The peak of the wildfire season usually occurs between July and November when hot, dry winds are most frequent. The wildfire season typically does not end until the first significant rainstorm of autumn arrives, which is usually around October in Northern California, and early November in Southern California.[citation needed] As wildfire becomes more frequent, the wildland\u2013urban interface has increasingly become more dangerous when it comes to property damage and risk to life.[21]"

        "content": "Scientists believe that, prior to development, California fires regularly burned significantly more acreage than has been seen in recent history.[22] Wildfires have been aggressively suppressed in recent years, resulting in a buildup of fuel, increasing the risk of large uncontrollable fires. There is broad scientific consensus that there should be more controlled burning of forests in California in order to reduce fire risk.[22] A 2020 ProPublica investigation blames a combination of climate change and a history of insufficient controlled burning for the increase in \"megafires.\"[8] A sharp increase in the population and development of fire-prone areas has also contributed to the increase in flammable tinder.[23]"

Absolutely yes. Were they made significantly hotter, more numerous, and drier because of global warming? Yes, likely yes, and yes.\"[10] Similarly, Friederike Otto, acting director of the University of Oxford Environmental Change Institute states, \"There is absolutely no doubt that the extremely high temperatures are higher than they would have been without human-induced climate change. A huge body of attribution literature demonstrates now that climate change is an absolute game-changer when it comes to heat waves, and California won't be the exception.\"[25] Susan Clark, director of the Sustainability Initiative at the University at Buffalo argues, \"This is climate change. This increased intensity and frequency of temperatures and heat waves are part of the projections for the future. [...] There is going to be more morbidity and mortality [from heat.] There are going to be more extremes.\"[25] The National Interagency Fire Center's (NFIC) National Interagency Coordination (NICC) reported that monthly outlooks for the entire country will still drive wildfires across the country but especially California. The main drivers through fall and winter seasons will be La Nina, and drought conditions are going to continue through California, causing the wildfires to continue. The shift will start from Northern California to Southern California as precipitation will lessen the impact of wildfires across northern California.[citation needed][needs update]"

        "content": " The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season is the ongoing Atlantic hurricane season in the Northern Hemisphere. The season officially began on June\u00a01, and will end on November\u00a030. These dates, adopted by convention, historically describe the period in each year when most subtropical or tropical cyclogenesis occurs in the Atlantic Ocean. The first system, Tropical Storm Alberto, developed on June\u00a019, making it the latest first named storm since 2014. The second storm of the season, Hurricane Beryl, was an extremely rare June major hurricane, the earliest Category 5 Atlantic hurricane on record, and only the second recorded in July. Next came Tropical Storm Chris, which formed on the last day of June and quickly made landfall in Veracruz. Activity then quieted down across the basin for most of July after Beryl dissipated, with no new tropical cyclones forming due to the presence of the Saharan air layer (SAL) across much of the Atlantic. In early August, Hurricane Debby developed in the Gulf of Mexico before making landfall in Florida and South Carolina. Shortly thereafter came Hurricane Ernesto, which impacted the Lesser Antilles, Puerto Rico and Bermuda in mid-August. After an unusual lull in activity in late August and early September, Hurricane Francine formed in the Gulf, then made landfall in Louisiana. Later, on September\u00a024, Hurricane Helene formed over the Western Caribbean before moving toward the Big Bend region of Florida. It made landfall there on September\u00a026, at Category\u00a04 strength. As of early October, there are at least 284 fatalities and over $38.36\u00a0billion in damage, mostly from Beryl and Helene."

        "content": "In advance of, and during, each hurricane season, several forecasts of hurricane activity are issued by national meteorological services, scientific agencies, and noted hurricane experts. These include forecasters from the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s Climate Prediction Center, Tropical Storm Risk (TSR), the United Kingdom's Met Office (UKMO), and Colorado State University (CSU). The forecasts include weekly and monthly changes in significant factors that help determine the number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a particular year.[22] According to NOAA and CSU, the average Atlantic hurricane season between 1991 and\u00a02020 contained roughly 14\u00a0tropical storms, 7\u00a0hurricanes, 3\u00a0major hurricanes, and an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index of 72\u2013111 units.[1][23] Broadly speaking, ACE is a measure of the power of a tropical or subtropical storm multiplied by the length of time it existed. It is only calculated for full advisories on specific tropical and subtropical systems reaching or exceeding wind speeds of 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h). NOAA typically categorizes a season as above-average, average, or below-average based on the cumulative ACE index, but the number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a hurricane season is sometimes also considered.[1]"

They predicted that moderate La\u00a0Ni\u00f1a conditions would occur in the summer and persist into fall and above average sea surface temperatures would also persist into summer.[6] On the same day, the University of Arizona (UA) posted their forecast calling for a very active season featuring 21\u00a0named storms, 11\u00a0hurricanes, 5\u00a0major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 156\u00a0units.[7] On April\u00a012, University of Missouri (MU) issued their prediction of 26\u00a0named storms, 11\u00a0hurricanes, and five\u00a0major hurricanes.[8] On April\u00a016, NCSU issued their prediction of 15\u201320\u00a0named storms, 10\u201312\u00a0hurricanes, and 3\u20134\u00a0major hurricanes.[9] On April 24, the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) issued their prediction of a record-breaking season, predicting an unprecedented 33 (\u00b16) named storms. They cited expected moderate La Ni\u00f1a conditions and record-warm sea surface temperatures in the tropical Atlantic tied to large-scale warming.[10] On May\u00a06, the Servicio Meteorol\u00f3gico Nacional (SMN) issued their forecast of 20\u201323\u00a0tropical storms, 9\u201311\u00a0hurricanes, and 4\u20135\u00a0major hurricanes.[11] On May 22, UKMO published their forecast for the 2024 season, calling for 22 named storms, 12 hurricanes, and 4\u00a0major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 212 units.[12] One day later, NOAA published their hurricane season prediction, forecasting an above-average season of 17\u201325\u00a0named storms, 8\u201313\u00a0hurricanes, and 4\u20137\u00a0major hurricanes with an 85% chance of being an above-average season.[13] TSR updated their predictions on May\u00a030 with 24\u00a0tropical storms, 12\u00a0hurricanes, and 6\u00a0major hurricanes with an ACE of 226.[14]"

        "content": "Though the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June\u00a01, it had its slowest start since 2014. This was due to a large stationary heat dome over Central America and Mexico, as tropical cyclogenesis in June often occurs over the Gulf of Mexico and northern Caribbean Sea.[27] The season's first named storm, Tropical Storm Alberto, formed in the western Gulf of Mexico on June\u00a019,[nb 2][29] then proceeded to make landfall on the northeastern coast of Mexico the following day.[30] Next came Hurricane Beryl, the earliest-forming Category 4 and Category 5 Atlantic hurricane on record in a season and the strongest June and July hurricane on record in the basin. After forming on June\u00a028 in the MDR, the storm rapidly intensified as it approached the Windward Islands,[31][32][33] peaking as a Category\u00a05 hurricane early on July\u00a02.[34] Short-lived Tropical Storm Chris developed in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico on June 30,[35] quickly moving ashore in Mexico the following morning.[36] Beryl continued on, impacting Jamaica and landfalling on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula and Texas.[37][38][39] After Beryl dissipated on July 11, the Atlantic basin would fall under a period of inactivity due to the Saharan air layer, which suppresses tropical activity, persisting over the open Atlantic alongside dry air typically occurring during this period of the season.[40] Activity resumed at the start of August, with Hurricane Debby developing in the Gulf of Mexico on August\u00a03,[41][42] before making landfall in Florida as a Category\u00a01 hurricane two days later. It then slowed down over land afterwards and dropped heavy rain and caused widespread flooding in the Southeastern United States. A few days after Debby dissipated, Hurricane Ernesto formed on August\u00a012 in the Western Main Development Region.[43] Ernesto caused damage to the Lesser Antilles on August\u00a014 as a Category\u00a01 hurricane.[44] Two days later on August\u00a016, it peaked as a Category\u00a02 hurricane.[45] The next day it made landfall at Bermuda as a weakening Category\u00a01 storm.[46]"

        "content": "Despite the unseasonably warm temperatures in the North Atlantic, the equatorial Atlantic cooled rapidly into an \"Atlantic Ni\u00f1a\" due to upwelling caused by shifts in the trade winds and the Atlantic zonal mode. The effects of an Atlantic Ni\u00f1a is not certain but it is contrary to the assumptions that the NOAA used in their forecast of seasonal activity.[47] CSU associated the quietness of the Atlantic during the month of August and the period after Ernesto dissipated\u2013despite predictions of an extremely active peak period\u2013to tropical waves forming too far north, warm upper-level winds causing destabilization, wind shear in the East Atlantic, and factors associated with the Madden\u2013Julian oscillation.[48] After nearly three weeks of inactivity, the longest in over fifty years at that point in the season,[49] Hurricane Francine formed on September\u00a09.[50] Tropical Storm Gordon followed suit two days later on September\u00a011,[51] with Francine making landfall in Louisiana as a Category\u00a02 system later that day.[52] Four systems developed during the final week of September. Hurricane Helene formed on September\u00a024.[53] The system affected the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula on September\u00a025, before making landfall in the Big Bend region of Florida late on September\u00a026 as a Category\u00a04 hurricane, where it rapidly weakened into a tropical depression by noon of September\u00a027.[54] Hurricane Isaac formed on September\u00a026 and later peaked as a Category\u00a02 hurricane. On September\u00a027, Tropical Storm Joyce formed just west of the Cabo Verde Islands.[55] On September 29, Tropical Depression Twelve formed. It strengthened into Tropical Storm Kirk the next day, and later became a Category\u00a01 hurricane on October\u00a01."

As the convective activity progressed northward over southeastern Mexico and exited into the Bay of Campeche, an area of low pressure gradually developed on June 17 about 105 miles (169\u00a0km) northwest of Ciudad del Carmen, Mexico. The system gradually became better organized, though still remained rather broad, developing into Tropical Storm Alberto by 12:00 UTC on June 19. Under the influence of light vertical wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures, Alberto intensified up to landfall, attaining peak winds of 50\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 992\u00a0mbar (29.29\u00a0inHg) by the morning of June 20. Alberto moved ashore at 09:00 UTC that day near Tampico, Mexico. Alberto rapidly weakened over land, dissipating just nine hours later.[56] Alberto brought heavy rainfall to the states of Coahuila, Nuevo Le\u00f3n, and Tamaulipas in northeast Mexico. Rainfall from Alberto resulted in four deaths in Mexico, all in Nuevo Le\u00f3n: one in Monterrey due to river flooding, one in El Carmen, and two in Allende (the latter three were indirect electrocution deaths).[57][58] Damage reported in Nuevo Le\u00f3n exceeded MX$1 billion (US$53.7 million).[59] Alberto's large wind field produced tropical storm-force winds along the coastline of Texas, despite the center being located over northeastern Mexico. A 3\u20134 feet (0.9\u20131\u00a0m) storm surge inundated coastal communities between Corpus Christi Bay and Galveston.[56][60] Storm surge and coastal flooding damaged piers, roads, and sand dunes, as well as causing several high water rescues.[56] One person drowned at Galveston due to rip currents generated by the storm.[61]\nAlberto brought significant rainfall to the Galveston area, leading to freshwater flooding. Additionally, an EF1 tornado touched down near Bellville, causing some property damage along its 2\u00a0mi (3.2\u00a0km) long path,[62] and two EF0 tornadoes occurred near Rockport.[63][64] To the east, coastal communities in Louisiana, especially Grand Isle, also received some flooding.[65]"

        "header": "Hurricane Beryl",
        "content": "On June\u00a025, the NHC began monitoring a tropical wave producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms just south of Cabo Verde.[66] The following day, the wave began showing signs of organization, with modest thunderstorm activity, curved bands, and some spin development.[67] The disturbance further organized, becoming Tropical Depression Two over the central tropical Atlantic on June\u00a028.[68] Located south of a strong subtropical ridge, the depression moved generally westward through an unusually favorable environment for the time of year with warm sea surface temperatures (SST) and minimal wind shear, consequently beginning a period of rapid intensification. The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Beryl six hours after formation,[69] and the thunderstorms quickly organized into a central dense overcast, with a symmetric cloud pattern surrounded by rainbands.[70] Late on June\u00a029, Beryl intensified into a hurricane. The inner core of the thunderstorms organized into an eye,[71] which became clear and symmetrical. Observations from the Hurricane Hunters indicated that Beryl became a major hurricane on June\u00a030.[72] The hurricane strengthened further into a Category\u00a04 hurricane. Beryl maintained an initial peak intensity with winds of 130\u00a0mph (215\u00a0km/h).[73] Beryl then underwent an eyewall replacement cycle and briefly weakened to a Category\u00a03 hurricane early on July\u00a01,[74] but regained Category\u00a04 strength six hours later once the cycle was completed.[75] At 15:10\u00a0UTC the same day, Beryl made landfall in Carriacou, Grenada, with sustained winds of 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h).[76] At 03:00 UTC the next day, Beryl further intensified into a Category 5 hurricane,[34] peaking a few hours later with winds of 165\u00a0mph (270\u00a0km/h), while moving to the west-northwest at about 20\u00a0mph (35\u00a0km/h).[77] Later that same day, Beryl passed south of Isla Beata, Dominican Republic, where it weakened to Category\u00a04 strength[78] as a result of wind shear.[79] Moving generally west-northwestward under the influence of the strong ridge to its north, Beryl's center passed very near the southern coast of Jamaica on the afternoon of July\u00a03. It remained a Category\u00a04 hurricane, despite continued westerly shear.[39] At 06:00 UTC on July\u00a04, while southeast of the Cayman Islands, Beryl weakened to Category\u00a03 strength.[80] Beryl continued to weaken, and was downgraded to a Category\u00a02 hurricane that afternoon.[81] Late that same day though, data from an Air Force reconnaissance team showed that Beryl had re-strengthened to a minimal Category\u00a03 hurricane.[82] It weakened once more to Category\u00a02 intensity, however, a few hours later.[83] At 11:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a05, the system made landfall just northeast of Tulum, Quintana Roo, with sustained winds of 110\u00a0mph (175\u00a0km/h).[38] Inland, Beryl quickly weakened into a Category\u00a01 hurricane,[84] and then a tropical storm a few hours later.[85] The tropical storm then emerged into the Gulf of Mexico as it was steered by a mid-level ridge located over the southeastern U.S.[86] That night and into the next day, in addition to a broader inner core, Beryl was beset by an infusion of dry air and by moderate wind shear, which kept the storm from strengthening appreciably.[87] Even so, by the afternoon of July\u00a06, its convective structure had improved some and had become more persistent.[88] At 04:00\u00a0UTC on July 8, Beryl regained hurricane intensity whilst approaching the Texas coast.[89] Shortly thereafter, Beryl made its final landfall near Matagorda, Texas with sustained winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h).[37] The system quickly weakened inland, transitioning to a post-tropical cyclone early on July\u00a09.[90] By the following day, the storm's remnants were moving through the Lower Peninsula of Michigan, tracking northeastward into Ontario before dissipating on July 11.[91] On June 29, the prime minister of Saint Lucia ordered a national shutdown in anticipation of Beryl's impacts on the island nation.[92] Caribbean Airlines postponed several flights between Barbados, Grenada, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago the next day.[93] A Caribbean Community meeting in Grenada, scheduled to run from July 3 to 5, was canceled.[94] Effects and casualties from the hurricane were widespread. Beryl caused catastrophic damage on Grenada's northern islands of Carriacou and Petite Martinique and on several of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines' southern islands such as Union Island and Canouan where an estimated 95% of buildings were damaged or destroyed.[95][96] In Venezuela, six people were killed and several were missing.[97] Sustained damage was also recorded in the Yucat\u00e1n as well, although it was generally limited to downed trees and power lines, and damage to roofs; there was also widespread flooding.[98] In the United States, the state of Texas experienced severe flooding and wind damage, with reports of at least 22 dead in the Greater Houston area.[99][100] Additionally, the outer bands of the hurricane produced a prolific three-day tornado outbreak, with 68 tornadoes confirmed in Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, Indiana, Kentucky, New York, and Ontario.[101][102] A total of 70 fatalities have been confirmed, and preliminary damage estimates are more than US$5.06\u00a0billion.[103][104][105]"

Tropical Depression Three formed later that day,[109] and strengthened into Tropical Storm Chris six hours later.[35] Shortly thereafter, the system made landfall in the municipality of Vega de Alatorre, Veracruz, at peak intensity.[36] Chris rapidly weakened over the rough terrain of Mexico, dissipating early on July\u00a01.[110] Chris generated heavy rains in the states of Chiapas, Hidalgo, Morelos, San Luis Potos\u00ed, and Veracruz, causing flooding, overflowing rivers, and mudslides.[111] Consequently, local authorities in Veracruz closed schools in 41\u00a0municipalities and opened 9\u00a0temporary shelters, which housed 86\u00a0people.[36][111] Flooding also damaged numerous homes, including almost 2,000\u00a0in Huiloapan alone.[111] In Hidalgo, flooding forced the evacuation of around 200 families in Yahualica.

On August\u00a08, Debby made a second landfall in South Carolina, approximately 20 miles (32\u00a0km) northeast of Charleston.[117] Steadily weakening once inland, later that day, Debby weakened into a tropical depression.[118] Early the next day, Debby became a post-tropical cyclone.[119] Rainfall impacted nations across the Caribbean, especially Cuba and Puerto Rico.[120][121][122] States of emergency were declared for the states of Florida, Georgia, and North and South Carolina ahead of the storm. Heavy rains fell as a result of the storm moving slowly, with accumulations peaking near 20\u00a0in (510\u00a0mm) of rain near Sarasota, Florida. Altogether, 10 fatalities have been attributed to the storm. Preliminary damage reports are estimated to be at near US$2 billion.[123] Rain also severely impacted Quebec, with Debby causing the heaviest one-day rain in the history of Montreal[124] and becoming the most costly climate event in Quebec history, with more than CAD $2.5 billion in insured damages.[125]"

One of the most significant fires of California's record-setting 2020 wildfire season, it began on September 4, 2020, and burned 379,895 acres (153,738\u00a0ha) over several months until it was declared 100% contained on December 24, 2020. The Creek Fire is the sixth-largest wildfire in recorded California history and the third-largest single fire\u2014i.e. not part of a larger wildfire complex\u2014following the 2021 Dixie Fire.[4] Tens of thousands of residents in Fresno and Madera counties were forced to evacuate, and the fire also necessitated the helicopter rescue of hundreds of people by the California National Guard after they became trapped at Mammoth Pool Reservoir. Despite this, the fire caused zero fatalities, though there were more than twenty injuries. The Creek Fire destroyed hundreds of structures in Sierra Nevada communities, adding up to 856 buildings destroyed and dozens more damaged. The combined cost of the months-long firefighting effort and damage to private and county property exceeded $500 million."

        "header": "Background",
        "content": "The Creek Fire occurred amid an already quite active wildfire season in California, which until early September had largely been driven by an outbreak of dry thunderstorms in mid-August. Between August 15 and September 9 alone, more than 1.6 million acres (650,000\u00a0ha) had burned, more than five times California's average acreage burned by that date.[5] Over Labor Day weekend, the state suffered \"one of its hottest weekends in memory\", leading the National Weather Service to issue widespread heat advisories and red flag warnings. The first two days of the Creek Fire's growth saw abnormally hot and dry conditions for the region.[6][7] The Creek Fire burned largely in the Sierra National Forest, which spans more than 1.3\u00a0million acres (530,000\u00a0ha) at an elevation range of ~900\u201314,000 feet (270\u20134,270\u00a0m).[8][6] The burn area largely comprised mixed coniferous forest containing ponderosa pine, sugar pine, white fir, incense-cedar, and California black oak trees.[6] Bark beetle infestation and California's drought between 2012 and 2016 killed almost 150 million trees in the Sierra Nevada,[9] including more than 36 million trees in the Sierra National Forest alone between 2015 and 2019\u2014the most of any national forest in California. Tree mortality rates reached 80% in what became the Creek Fire footprint.[10] The U.S. Forest Service estimated that dead stands of trees that burned in the fire contained 2,000 tons of fuel for every one acre (0.40\u00a0ha).[9]"

The fire had burned 2,000 acres (810\u00a0ha) by the following morning and 5,000 acres (2,000\u00a0ha) by that afternoon.[11] Driven by powerful diurnal up-canyon winds within the San Joaquin River drainage, the Creek Fire quickly became a firestorm. Roughly eighteen hours after the fire had begun, the Creek Fire began producing a pyrocumulonimbus cloud, which, observed by radar and satellite, became one of the largest such events on record in the United States, or even North America.[12][13][14][a] The fire was fed in part by these cloud formations, which generated downdrafts that supplied the fire with additional oxygen and pushed it across fire lines.[15] The fire has been characterized as a plume-dominated blaze, where the environment allows for the continued upward blowing of smoke and the vertical transfer of heat, causing extreme fire behavior, such as multiple fire tornadoes observed using Doppler weather radar data.[5] The Creek Fire also spawned two fire tornadoes on September 5; the first was rated EF2 near Huntington Lake with approximately 125\u00a0mph winds, and the second was rated EF1 near Mammoth Pool with approximately 100\u00a0mph winds. Damage included uprooted pine trees as well as stripped bark. These \"firenadoes\" formed due to the intense heat the fire had generated, which pulled in air, creating rotational vortices.[16] The Mammoth Pool firenado trapped hundreds of campers in the area, while the Huntington Lake one caused severe damage to trees in the Camp Silver Fir, B.S.A. & Kennolyn Camps area, and continued to attack their root systems a week later, burning underground at over 1,500\u00a0\u00b0F (820\u00a0\u00b0C).[17] The fire had initially trapped about 1,000 people near Mammoth Pool Reservoir after it jumped the San Joaquin River, with at least 200 individuals trapped at a boat launch.[5] The California National Guard, using CH-47 Chinook and UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters and night goggles, flew multiple sorties to evacuate people from near Mammoth Pool Reservoir.[18] The Chinook flew three flights, carrying 67, 102, and 37 people each time (not including crew). The Black Hawk flew another three times, carrying 15, 22, and 21 people each time. Evacuees were taken to an airfield in Fresno.[citation needed]"

According to Dean Gould, the supervisor of the Sierra National Forest, investigators \"spent countless hours hiking rugged terrain to determine the cause, interviewed numerous leads, and eliminated multiple potential causes.\" The Forest Service ruled out that the fire had been sparked by equipment use, an escaped campfire, powerlines, or spontaneous combustion, among multiple other discarded possibilities. Investigators judged that the \"most probable cause\" of the fire was a lightning strike, but noted that they could not rule out arson or smoking.[24][25] The lightning strike assessment was substantiated by a Douglas fir snag, bearing signs of lightning damage, that early-arriving firefighters had seen going up in flames.[26] The Creek Fire's cause is officially listed as \"undetermined\".[4]"

On September 8, strong winds caused the Bear/Claremont Fire to explode in size, rapidly spreading to the southwest. On September 8, 2020, the towns of Berry Creek and Feather Falls were immediately evacuated at 3:15\u00a0p.m. PDT with no prior warning. By September 9, 2020, the towns of Berry Creek and Feather Falls had been leveled, with few homes left standing. The fire threatened the city of Oroville, before its westward spread was stopped. The fire killed 16 people and injured more than 100. The complex burned an estimated 318,935 acres (129,068\u00a0ha), and was 100% contained on December 3.[1] The fire was managed by the U.S. Forest Service in conjunction with Cal Fire, with the primary incident base in Quincy. The North Complex Fire is the eighth-largest in California's history,[3] and was the deadliest fire in the 2020 California wildfire season.[4]"

On August 20 an evacuation advisory was issued for East Quincy[10] which was quickly changed to a mandatory evacuation for East Quincy and residents along Quincy-La Porte Road. On August 22 the fire jumped California State Route 70 at the Massack Rest Area southeast of Quincy.[5] On August 23, aided by high winds, the fire began advancing rapidly east forcing Spring Garden and Greenhorn to be evacuated.[11] The fire threatened State Route 70 and the Union Pacific Railroad tracks, shutting both down intermittently for several days. On August 27, the Claremont Fire was at 20,697 acres (8,376\u00a0ha) and 47\u00a0percent contained.[12] Mandatory evacuations were lifted in East Quincy, but with continued strong west winds, Greenhorn and Sloat to the east were evacuated on August 28.[13] On August 30 crews conducted backfire operations on the eastern side of the fire and prevented it from spreading towards Spring Garden and Cromberg.[14] On September 1 mandatory evacuations were lifted for Quincy-La Porte Road.[15] On September 5, with fire activity much lower on the eastern sides, evacuation orders were lifted for Spring Garden, Greenhorn, Sloat and Cromberg.[16] On the morning of August 31, the North Complex Fire was at 22,780 acres (9,220\u00a0ha), and 59\u00a0percent contained.[17] On the morning of September 4 it had grown to 24,330 acres (9,850\u00a0ha), and containment had dropped to 49\u00a0percent.[18]"

The fire started in rough, roadless country along the Wild and Scenic section of the Middle Fork. An effort was made to staff the fire on August 18, but an increase in fire activity forced fire crews to withdraw. After that point, because of limited firefighting resources, the Bear Fire was left unstaffed because it wasn't immediately a threat to people or property, it was in steep, rugged terrain, and resources were scarce due to the fires burning across the state. Efforts were concentrated on the Claremont Fire.[20] By August 23, it was at 1,661 acres (672\u00a0ha).[21] On August 26, some areas around Bucks Lake were placed under evacuation advisory due to increased fire activity on the Bear Fire.[22] Crews also were working on containment line to the northeast as the fire expanded slightly towards Quincy.[23] By August 31 it had grown to 9,570 acres (3,870\u00a0ha), and was still 0\u00a0percent contained.[17] On the morning of September 4 it was at 12,154 acres (4,919\u00a0ha), and was 29\u00a0percent contained.[18]"

A total of 1,386 personnel were assigned to the fire.[26] The southern boundary of the fire was mostly held along the Middle Fork, and crews worked to build secondary containment lines south of the river.[27] Flames crossed the river in a few areas but were quickly contained. On the morning of September 8 a dry cold front moved in, bringing strong northeast winds and threatening the incomplete containment line along the river.[28] At about 10:00\u00a0a.m., the fire jumped the river near Horshoe Bend and began heading rapidly southwest. With winds gusting to 45 miles per hour (72\u00a0km/h), the spot fire had grown to 1,000 acres (400\u00a0ha) within an hour, and by 3:00\u00a0p.m. it had grown to more than 20,000 acres (8,100\u00a0ha). At 11:50\u00a0a.m., mandatory evacuations were issued for La Porte and Little Grass Valley Reservoir.[29] As winds picked up throughout the day, evacuation orders were issued by 3:25\u00a0p.m. for several communities in Butte County including Feather Falls, Clipper Mills, Berry Creek, Brush Creek, Woodleaf and Forbestown, and around Miners Ranch Road and California State Route 162.[30] Evacuation orders were also effective in Yuba County for residents along La Porte Road, New York Flat Road, and around Brownsville and New Bullards Bar Reservoir.[31][32]  By the afternoon of September 8 the fire had burned more than 58,000 acres (23,000\u00a0ha). At 11:00\u00a0p.m. PDT, Kelly Ridge and Copley Hills, near Lake Oroville, were evacuated, as officials predicted strong winds would lead to continuing extreme fire behavior.[33] On the early morning of September 9, evacuation warnings were issued for more areas around Lake Oroville, Concow and Paradise[34][35] and in Plumas County, a mandatory evacuation order was issued for Bucks Lake[36] and an evacuation advisory for Meadow Valley.[37] As predicted, high winds continued to drive the fire rapidly downhill and southwest, traveling 20 miles (32\u00a0km) to Lake Oroville in a few hours, threatening the city of Oroville.[38] By 8:35\u00a0a.m., the fire was estimated at more than 150,000 acres (61,000\u00a0ha).[20] The entire town of Berry Creek was destroyed,[39] with only 3 houses left standing in the town of 1,200.[40] Homes were also burned in several nearby communities, such as Feather Falls. Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at University of California Los Angeles, compared the explosive wind-driven spread with the 2018 Camp Fire, which occurred just north of this area.[41] At 4:00\u00a0p.m. PDT on September 9, the fire had jumped the southern arm of the lake and was burning in the hills above Oroville. It had also traveled as far west as the North Fork Feather River, threatening Paradise, although the burn scar from the Camp Fire slowed fire activity.[42][43] On the south, the fire reached the South Fork Feather River, burning around the north side of Little Grass Valley Reservoir and approaching Forbestown. The city of Oroville and surrounding foothill communities were under an evacuation warning. As of 5:00\u00a0p.m., at least three people were dead and twelve missing; at least 100 people were rescued. An estimated 2,000 buildings had been destroyed.[44] On the evening of September 9, the fire was estimated at 252,163 acres (102,047\u00a0ha) 24\u00a0percent containment.[45] On September 10, the section of the fire that had burned into the Cal Fire protection zone was labeled as the North Complex West Zone. The approximately 70,000 acres (28,000\u00a0ha) section mostly outside of the Plumas National Forest was managed by Cal Fire. On September 10 authorities reported the number of confirmed deaths had increased to ten, and 16 people were reported missing.[46] Due in part to a reversal of wind direction, the fire did not burn significantly more acreage on September 10. On the same day, the burn area was revised to 244,203 acres (98,825\u00a0ha), with 23\u00a0percent containment.[47] By September 11, winds had shifted to the southwest, blowing the fire front and smoke back over the burn area and towards Quincy. Fire activity was significantly decreased from the previous day, allowing crews to work on containment lines protecting homes around Bucks Lake and Little Grass Valley Reservoir.[48] By the morning of September 12, the fire was at 252,313 acres (102,107\u00a0ha) and 21\u00a0percent contained. A total of 3,282 personnel were assigned to the fire.[49] On September 14, the fire had increased in size to 264,374 acres (106,988\u00a0ha), with most growth along the north flank of the fire. Containment was increased to 38\u00a0percent.[50] On September 15 continued southwest winds caused the fire to jump containment lines near Red Mountain, moving northeast towards Bucks Lake.[51] On September 16 high fire activity continued near Red Mountain, with spot fires starting in the Grizzly Lake area. The fire was also active and growing in Onion Valley south of Quincy. In the meantime, firefighters made progress on containment lines along the southeast flank of the fire, between Sly Creek Reservoir and Little Grass Valley Reservoir. The fire was at 273,335 acres (110,615\u00a0ha) and 36\u00a0percent contained.[52] On the morning of September 17, evacuation orders were issued for Meadow Valley and Tollgate as fire activity continued to pick up on the north side.[53] By September 18, firefighters had extended containment lines up from Sly Creek Reservoir to Onion Valley. The spot fire at Grizzly Lake was contained, but not before burning 200 acres (81\u00a0ha). The fire was at 287,354 acres (116,288\u00a0ha), and containment was increased to 54\u00a0percent.[54] On September 22, the North Complex reached 300,204 acres (121,488\u00a0ha), and was 75\u00a0percent contained. Most of the growth had occurred on the northwest side of the fire as it continued to expand towards Bucks Lake.[55] On September 27, strong sustained winds picked up once again, starting spot fires outside of containment lines, including one on French Hotel Creek.[56] An evacuation order was issued for Pulga, Concow, Big Bend and Yankee Hill as the fire moved west towards the North Fork Feather River Canyon.[57] By the morning of September 29, the fire was within a few hundred yards of Highway 70, which was closed between Greenville Wye (west of Quincy) and Cherokee Road (east of Oroville).[58] The North Complex was at 308,995 acres (125,046\u00a0ha) and 76\u00a0percent contained.[59] On December 3,  the North Complex was declared 100% contained at 318,935 acres.[60]"

The Caldor Fire destroyed 1,005 structures and damaged 81 more, primarily in the US Highway 50 corridor and in the community of Grizzly Flats, 2/3 of which was destroyed by the fire.[3][2][4] On August 30, it became the second fire known to cross the Sierra Nevada mountain range, following the Dixie Fire, which crossed a few days earlier on August 18.[5] It then threatened the communities of Meyers and South Lake Tahoe, causing evacuations to be ordered for more than 20,000 people before the fire's progress was halted.[6] The Caldor Fire was the third-largest and second-most-destructive of the 2021 season in California, and is the seventeenth-largest and sixteenth-most destructive in recorded California history. The U.S. Forest Service determined that the fire was caused by a bullet. A father and son who had called 911 to report the fire were accused of starting it by reckless use of firearms.

By August 20, the fire had burned nearly to Highway 50, forcing a closure of the highway.[15] Over the next few days, the fire crossed Highway 50 in the vicinity of Kyburz. Starting on August 27, winds drove the fire rapidly east towards the Lake Tahoe Basin, devastating the once picturesque backdrop to the historic Strawberry Lodge near the Twin Bridges area.[16] By August 30, it had reached Echo Summit, less than five miles (8.0\u00a0km) from South Lake Tahoe. While South Lake Tahoe remained at the evacuation warning stage during early morning briefings that day, the entire city of 22,000 people was ordered to evacuate at 10:59 a.m.[17] Due to the focused efforts of fire crews aggressively thinning nearby forests, reducing earlier crown fires (typically 100\u2013150 feet (30\u201346 meters) flames) to surface fires (typically 15 feet (4.6 meters) flames) and developing a fire perimeter, evacuation orders were lifted about one week later.[18][19] By October 2, the fire was at 221,775 acres and 91% containment. By that date, 782 structures were destroyed, 81 structures damaged, with 35 structures still threatened. Staffing was still at 1,589 personnel, with ten helicopters assigned to the incident.

The increase of urban developments among the communities also drives deforestation.[21][22] Cropping on fragile soil without observation of conservation practices and the burning of grasslands further illustrate the effects of deforestation in perpetuating soil erosion and the potential for increased risk of flooding.[23] Large areas of the Fijian coastlands are made more susceptible to erosion by inappropriate disposal of animal waste, pesticides and fertilizers being dumped into international waters by farm run-offs during excessive rainfall.[24]"

It is essential to have a second system or disaster response plan, especially in areas prone to disasters. At the same time, the medical system needs to buffer the direct harm caused by floods and prevent diseases after the flood period. In January and March 2012, consecutive tropical depressions caused two extreme flooding events in western Fiji, leading to the largest outbreak of leptospirosis in the Pacific region, with 44 deaths and hundreds of confirmed cases.[30] Post-disaster disease prevention needs more attention, and the medical system needs strengthening."

Once in the Gulf of Mexico, the combination of increasing wind shear and cooler waters caused Ida to weaken. The system eventually moved over the southeastern United States on November\u00a010 before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone. Ida's remnant low later dissipated over the Florida Panhandle on November 11.[1] However, Ida's mid-level circulation led to the formation of a new low over southeastern Georgia, which eventually moved off the coast of North Carolina.[2] This new low quickly intensified and became a powerful nor'easter that caused substantial damage throughout the Mid-Atlantic States.[1] Due to the rapid succession of these systems, United States media referred to the nor'easter as \"Nor'Ida\".[3] By November\u00a012, the system attained a minimum pressure of 992 mbar (hPa; 29.29\u00a0inHg) along with winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h).[4] In combination with a large area of high pressure, a long stretch of easterly, onshore winds impacted areas from Virginia to southern New England.[5] Tracking parallel to the North Carolina coastline, the system eventually moved onshore near Cape Hatteras by November\u00a013. Due to the high-pressure system situated over Vermont, the low turned southeastward, bringing its center back over water. Gradual weakening took place during this period, though heavy rains continued to fall across much of the Chesapeake Bay area. On November\u00a014, a brief secondary low developed within the system, off the coast of Delaware.[2] Continuing to weaken, the cyclone resumed a northward track after the high weakened and persisted through November\u00a017, by which time it had moved over Atlantic Canada.[6]"

On Tuesday, June 23, due to worsening weather conditions, a \"red\" level of danger was declared in Prykarpattia and Bukovina. As a result of heavy downpours, mountain rivers in the Carpathians damaged local roads.[3] In the Ivano-Frankivsk region, the Dniester river flooded the city of Halych,[4] in particular, the district hospital in the city, where patients with coronavirus infection are treated.[5] According to Vitaly Fedoriv, the head of the Regional State Administration, the peak of bad weather will occur on June 24.[6] Due to the flood, a road collapse occurred in Yaremchi, which destroyed the main water pipeline, as a result of which the city was left without water supply.[7] In the Chernivtsi region, the Cheremosh River broke through two dams and cut off the entrances to several villages on its banks. An increase in the water level was also recorded on the Prut and its tributaries. Near the village In the Ustya-Zeleny Monastyris district in Ternopil Oblast, the Dniester overflowed the dam, as a result of which local residents were partially resettled, agricultural lands were flooded, and there is a threat of Koropets, Ustya-Zeleny and Luka being flooded.[8] As of June 25, the following were flooded: The head of the Chernivtsi Regional State Administration Serhii Osachuk noted that the water level in the Prut River has started to decrease in recent hours, in particular, at 7:00\u00a0p.m. on June 24, the water level in the Prut near Chernivtsi reached 6.56 m, and at 1:00\u00a0a.m. on June 25, it reached 5.89 m.

At the peak of the flood, 14,500 houses were flooded, as of June 27, 4,500 houses were flooded, and 8 settlements in the Ivano-Frankivsk region were also cut off.[11] In general, according to the prime minister, at least 250 settlements in five regions were affected, the Ivano-Frankivsk region was the most affected. On June 28, 20 days' worth of rain fell in two hours after lunch in Mizhhirsky district. In the villages, the flow of water and the landslide destroyed the road and damaged the houses.[12] As of June 29, 70 settlements in Ivano-Frankivsk, Chernivtsi, Lviv, and Ternopil regions were flooded, the flood destroyed 150.5\u00a0km of highways, 83 bridges and damaged 582\u00a0km of highways and 220 bridges.[13]\nIn the Ivano-Frankivsk region, rescuers completed the search for the driver of the car that fell into the White Cheremosh River during the flood. The man's body was found in a nearby area by local residents.[14] As of June 30, as a result of worsening weather conditions (rain, gusts of wind) due to the operation of power transmission line protection systems, power was cut off in 35 settlements in two oblasts: 31 in Zakarpattia, 4 in Volyn. In the western oblasts (Ivano-Frankivsk, Chernivtsi, Lviv and Ternopilsk) works are ongoing to eliminate the consequences of the flood.[15] On July 2, it became known that the floodplains along the lower Dniester were filled with water, the water level reached dangerous levels and continued to rise. In the low sections of the Odesa-Reni highway, the water rose to the road surface.[16] As of July 7, 5 settlements in the Chernivtsi region remain flooded.[17] As of July 9, four people became victims of floods in the Ivano-Frankivsk region.[18] On July 15, the flooding of residential premises was eliminated, more than 750\u00a0km of roads and almost 300 bridges remained damaged.[19]"

A plaque at 112 West Main Street marks the site of the cabin.[7] In 1853 Anson named the town Marshall, after Marshall, Michigan, a former residence of his.[8] The town became Marshalltown in 1862 because another Marshall already existed in Henry County (In 1880, Marshall's name changed to Wayland). With the help of Potawatomi chief Johnny Green, Anson persuaded early settlers to stay in the area. In the mid-1850s, Anson donated land for a county courthouse. Residents donated money for the building's construction. In 1863 the title of county seat transferred from the village of Marietta to Marshalltown. The young town then began growing. By 1900, Marshalltown had 10,000 residents. Many industries began developing in Marshalltown, like Fisher Controls, Lennox International and Marshalltown Company. Marshalltown plays a small but significant role in the life of Ebe Dolliver, a main character in MacKinlay Kantor's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel \"Andersonville\" (1955)."

He was regarded as one of the greatest players of his era and one of the first superstars of the game.[9] Baseball steadily became popular as Marshalltown grew in the mid-1800s. Adrian's brother Sturgis also became a talented baseball player and both went to play on intra-school teams at the University of Notre Dame. Both later returned to Marshalltown to play baseball for the town team. Along with their father Henry, the town's founder, they put together a team and became the most prominent team in the state of Iowa.[10] The Marshalltown team, with Henry Anson at third base, Adrian's brother Sturgis in center field, and Adrian at second base, won the Iowa state championship in 1868. In 1870 Marshalltown played an exhibition game with the talented Rockford Forest Citys. Although Marshalltown lost the game, Rockford's management offered contracts to all three of the Ansons. Adrian accepted the contract, which began his professional career in baseball in 1871. Baseball continued its popularity in Marshalltown. In the early 1880s Billy Sunday played for the town baseball team.[11] In 1882, with Sunday in left field, the Marshalltown team defeated the state champion Des Moines team 13\u20134.[12] Marshalltown later formed a minor league team naming it after the Anson family, the Marshalltown Ansons.

There are six elementary schools, one intermediate school, a Catholic school (PreK\u20136) and Christian school (1\u20138), and a middle school (7\u20138). There is also Marshalltown High School, with over 1,000 students.\nEast Marshall Community School District serves small portions of the Marshalltown city limits.[37] The district was established on July 1, 1992, by the merger of the LDF and SEMCO school districts.[38] The BCLUW Community School District serves some rural areas nearby Marshalltown.[39]"

        "content": "Environmentalism in Rio Grande do Sul refers to the movement constituted by scientists and laymen in defense of the environment of the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul. Although there are some records of protests against environmental destruction as early as the 19th century, a more consistent movement only took shape in the mid-20th century, following scientific advances and realizing that the destruction and emerging threats at this time were already significant. Since then, environmentalism has proven to be a topic of growing popular appeal. A pioneer of Brazilian environmentalism, the state has a significant history in this field, and has often presented innovative proposals. Rich in biodiversity, Rio Grande do Sul has developed a series of initiatives for the promotion of research, teaching and dissemination of ecological concepts, both in public and private spheres; the government has made and continues to make large investments in projects of various kinds, such as sanitation, the recovery of degraded areas and the creation of protected areas. There are multiple environmental associations, cooperatives and NGOs, which promote activism and present promising practical results, and the subject is developed in schools and communities, in general with good receptiveness. However, the state also faces the issues of pollution, deforestation and desertification, among others, and is suffering the impacts of progressive global warming, which pose important challenges for its future development, besides having a long list of endangered species, many of them already considered locally extinct or in the process of imminent disappearance. In addition, enforcement is often precarious, hampered by chronic shortages of human and material resources, and reports of abuses are frequent. The controversies about the theme are also great, generating deadlocks, and powerful political and economic interests that oppose it hinder the advance of the matter. In recent years, the state environmental legislation has been drastically weakened."

        "content": "Many accounts survive from travelers and explorers of past centuries about the richness of the fauna and flora, and the beauty of the landscape of Rio Grande do Sul. In the 17th century, Jesuits reported the existence of tapirs on the coast. In 1703, Domingos da Filgueira taught how to take advantage of the abundance of deer and capybaras in the fields. In 1738, government provisions tried to protect the people of the Rio Grande and Pelotas regions from the jaguars that lived there in great numbers, and in the early 19th century, the traveler Nicolau Dreys reported the existence of hunters who still sold fifty pelts of the feline per month. In 1857, Av\u00e9-Lallemant was amazed by the number of birds living on the shores of the Lagoa dos Patos, which were covered in scrub, and was delighted with the exuberance of the flora in the region of S\u00e3o Leopoldo. At the end of the 19th century, mullet were still being caught in Porto Alegre and dorado was still being fished in the Sinos River.[1] When Italian colonization began in the northeast, in 1875, the region was virgin and covered by the araucaria forest.[2][3] Much of this wealth no longer exists. Forests and animals have disappeared, pollution has taken over many rivers, and urbanization, cattle raising, and agriculture advanced, profoundly altering the primitive landscape.[4][5] Environmental consciousness was slow to form, although some of those travelers already pointed out the dangers of unbridled exploitation of the environment. Reinhold Hensel, arriving in the state in 1865, was one of them, and in his writings recorded that the birds that Lallemant had described as abundant less than a decade ago were already scarce, that the hills of Porto Alegre, also once covered with trees, were already largely taken over by undergrowth, and, in observing the way German colonization was taking place in the Sinos valley, expressed a prophetic concern:[5][6] \"In contrast to the frequently mentioned precariousness in the construction of roads and bridges is the lack of consideration with which the forests are destroyed in the establishment and expansion of the settlements, so that timber for construction, at least in the older tracks, is already becoming scarce. ... The settler cannot be forbidden to clear his land as he pleases, it would only have been the government's task to act more carefully ... and to consider the eventuality that sooner or later, with the present methods, there would be a shortage of timber and water in the forest districts intended for agricultural cultivation. With the slow but increasing clearing of the high parts of the forest comes a reduction in the regular rainfall, and now not infrequently the remains of old streams, whose sources have dried up since the founding of the colonies, are found on the hills between the tracks. ... Formerly, the forest protected the humus-rich cover of the mountain soil, but now it is exposed to the rains and is carried more and more into the valleys so that all the higher parts of the deforested forests will become unfit for cultivation, and even for forestry, ... but the shortsightedness of Brazilians in all things national economy does not allow them this look into the future.\""

        "content": "Although in the 1940s there was significant environmental legislation at the national level, notably the Forest Code (1934), in the state, awareness was practically null. At this time Father Baldu\u00edno Rambo appeared and in a monograph of 1941, he denounced the predatory action of the logging industry in the Uruguay River valley and recommended the creation of two forest parks, one in upper Uruguay and the other in the Aparados da Serra. In his work A Fisionomia do Rio Grande do Sul (1942), he dedicated his last chapter to \"Nature Protection,\" defending the protection of natural monuments, endangered species, and the integration between man and nature, stating: \"A people that neglect this element would lack an essential requirement of true total human culture, and would be unworthy of the abundance of the land, as the prodigal hand of the Creator has gifted it.\" He was a pioneer, preceding the ecological studies of Wanderbilt Duarte de Barros, the first director of Itatiaia National Park (the first national park to be founded).[7][8] Around the same time, the first ecological inspector of the state emerged, Henrique Lu\u00eds Roessler, an accountant at the State Port Delegation, who, on his initiative, dedicated himself to observing hunting and fishing activities on weekends, obtaining accreditation with the Ministry of Agriculture to officially act as an inspector. He lost it, however, by fining without authorization tanneries that polluted the rivers in the S\u00e3o Leopoldo region.[9] In 1955, he founded the Uni\u00e3o Protetora da Natureza (Nature Protection Union), the first environmentalist organization in Brazil,[9] and then began publishing pamphlets and a series of articles on ecological issues in the newspaper Correio do Povo, in Porto Alegre. To those who could not engage, he pleaded \"a prayer for dying nature, asking that the merciful Omnipotent modify the predatory mentality of our people.\"[10][11] Roessler wrote his last article in 1963, and soon afterward, with the military coup of 1964, the Brazilian social movements were disbanded, dissolving also the incipient environmental movement. However, among the organizations that supported the coup was the A\u00e7\u00e3o Democr\u00e1tica Feminina Ga\u00facha (ADFG), led in the 1970s by Magda Renner, who turned out to be an active environmental advocate. She was influenced in the direction of her ecological work by a lecture given by Jos\u00e9 Lutzenberger in 1972 at the Agronomists Association of Porto Alegre. Lutzenberger was prominent in the national movement, having published articles in newspapers and founded in 1971 the Ga\u00facho Association for the Protection of the Natural Environment (Agapan) together with other supporters of the cause, particularly Augusto Carneiro. These activists are owed mainly the resurgence of environmental awareness in the state, at a time when environmental problems in Brazil were becoming serious,[12] and making Rio Grande do Sul the pioneer of the Brazilian ecological movement.[13] The two associations would develop a long and fruitful series of awareness campaigns, linked to a larger process of building conscious citizenship when the military regime was in its most oppressive phase. According to Maria Cristina da Silva, the environmental issue played a channeling role for the population, prevented from expressing their concerns, anxieties, and insecurities: \"The ecological movement was the cause that united all the complaints.\"[13] Magda Renner recalled that it was necessary to act with a specific strategy: \"We wrapped the issues very well in 'pink paper' because we were going to the street when any street demonstration was forbidden,\" achieving important results. As an example, in 1974, ADFG and Agapan led a movement in defense of the Gua\u00edba islands that resulted in the creation of the State Park of the Jacu\u00ed Delta in 1976. In 1975, ADFG held the first national ecological meeting, bringing together more than five hundred people, and where a pioneering project for recycling household waste was presented, ten years before any similar government initiative in Brazil. In 1978, it mobilized the country, including several government agencies, when the \"red tide\" was unleashed in Hermenegildo, on the southern coast of the state.[14] Agapan, in turn, promoted weekly meetings and lectures in its headquarters, disseminating studies and distributing thousands of pamphlets, and became notorious in its fight for the preservation of Lake Gua\u00edba, particularly fighting the pulp mill Borregaard (now Riocell), receiving collaboration from government officials.[note 1][15][16][17] The case became emblematic. For Dorfman & Stanislawski, it was \"one of the most important ecological struggles in history\"[14] and, according to Lilian Dreyer, when the company was installed, while being hailed as the lever of the state developmental pull, \"Without sensing it, they solidified one of the most combative movements of ecological resistance that Brazil has ever known, and inaugurated an unprecedented process of revision of productive methods. ... In a short time, it became a kind of public enemy number one.... It would be difficult to think of any pre-deliberate campaign that would give such media exposure to an emerging movement. ... At the end of 1973, the State Health Secretary went in person to interdict the factory, from then on thrown into a cycle of sanctions that resulted in the enforcement of environmental controls.\""

        "content": "Magda's and Lutzenberger's activities earned them national and international recognition. Lutzenberger lectured all over the country and produced a number of articles. In 1976, he launched the book Fim do Futuro? or Manifesto Ecol\u00f3gico Brasileiro, which consolidated his leadership in Brazil and developed a strong style of criticism supported by scientific data. In 1977, largely due to his initiative, the Guarita State Park was founded in Torres, and in 1987, after leaving Agapan, he created the Gaia Foundation. Later he joined the Collor government as Secretary of the Environment, inviting Magda to be part of the National Council for the Environment team. She held simultaneously a seat on Bird's Brazilian NGO committee.[17] Other organizations began to emerge: In 1974, the Interdepartmental Center for Ecological Studies was created at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul;[18] in 1978, Coolm\u00e9ia was created, a cooperative of consumers and farmers that fought against the use of pesticides and offered organic products.[19] At the same time, several ecological reserves were created, such as the Lami Jos\u00e9 Lutzenberger Biological Reserve, owned by the Porto Alegre municipality,[20] and others managed by the state government, such as the Camaqu\u00e3 State Park, the Podocarpus State Park, the Espinilho State Park, and the Ibitiri\u00e1 State Park.[21] The state press was especially receptive and gave space to news on the subject, many times in an emotional tone, as can be seen in headlines from the 1970s: \"Deforestation: The Amazon could become a desert\", \"Agony of our rivers\", \"Saving nature to save human beings\", \"Pollution: death coming from the air\". Such news became frequent, and while newspapers took advantage of the problems to sell more, it also indicated a dramatic change in public opinion, which became more interested and sensitized on a large scale.[22] In the following decade, some politicians with environmentalist platforms managed to elect themselves councilmen in Porto Alegre, starting a tradition in 1982 with Caio Lustosa, affiliated with PMDB. The movement began to seek organization on a broader scale, scheduling several meetings in 1984. These meetings also took place in other states, and their keynote was the dialogue between the various sectors of society, the definition of priority actions and ways to influence the Constitutional project, also discussing the need for the foundation of a Green Party (which took place in 1986). In 1985, the Rio Grande do Sul movement managed to gain space for independent questioning of the candidates for the capital's government. The participation of university students, the press, unions, neighborhood associations, alternative rural communities, and the landless grew in this decade, which increasingly influenced the actions of the state and municipal governments.[23][24][25] A national integration of activism was articulated, which, according to Eduardo Viola and Ailton dos Santos, was showing signs of maturity, becoming multidisciplinary, and moving toward socioecology.[23] From the mid-1980s on, alternative agriculture NGOs started to structure themselves to search for new ways of cultivation, and initiatives linked to the Lutheran Church and government agencies also appeared in several regions, and in the following decade environmental associations multiplied throughout the state. A 1995 study developed by Claudia Schmitt indicated the existence of 50 entities registered in the National Fund for the Environment, but, according to the researcher, this number should be much higher, because many small associations did not formalize their registration They were largely sustained by members' contributions, often faced a chronic lack of resources, and did not present a significant degree of professionalism.[26] Still in the 1990s, the Pro-Gua\u00edba Program, conceived in the previous decade through the influence of the environmental movement, was established. With it, the government intended to improve the quality of life and restore the ecological balance of the entire Lake Gua\u00edba watershed region, the most populous and polluted in the state, with more than 250 municipalities that account for about 70% of the state's GDP. The first module invested more than 222 million dollars, 60% of which came from the Inter-American Development Bank, in sanitation, protected areas, soil, and solid waste management, among many other projects. As pointed out by Professor Andr\u00e9 Silveira, director of the Institute of Hydric Research at UFRGS, thepProgram was especially positive in that it tried to address the causes of pollution in an integrated way, in a sustainable model, but he regrets that the second stage was canceled due to lack of state resources for the necessary counterpart.[27][28]"

A 2000 survey indicated that 30% of Rio Grande do Sul municipalities had selective collection and 22% had recycling, in a much higher proportion than the national average (respectively 8.2% and 6.4%) and adding up to 31% of the total municipalities in Brazil with these services.[36]"

In 2011, 58 wind farm projects were submitted to auction, which resulted in the contracting of 42 projects, with a total installed capacity of 1,211.5 MW, about one-third of the state's average energy demand.[38][39] Other projects have foreseen the expansion of biodiesel production.[40] The state is a large producer of soy, responsible for 86% of the oil produced locally. Besides encouraging agriculture, it fixes production in the domestic market and has as a by-product soybean meal, which can be used in animal feed. Passo Fundo is the sixth largest national producer of biodiesel, with 8% of the total.[41]"

        "header": "Sustainability",
        "content": "As far as sustainable agriculture is concerned, there have been active projects since the 1980s, seeking alternative means of cultivation that are compatible with ecological concepts. In the words of Miguel Altieri, \"the discussion on sustainable development gained rapid momentum in response to the decline in the quality of rural life as well as the degradation of the natural resource base associated with modern agriculture. [...] Agricultural production is no longer a purely technical issue but is now seen as a process conditioned by social, cultural, political, and economic dimensions\".[42] In recent years, the trend has been growing due to the demand for a new consumer market and official support.[43][44][45] In 1999, the I Semin\u00e1rio Estadual de Agroecologia produced the Carta Agroecol\u00f3gica, a document that gave origin to a governmental program financed by Banrisul, with significant investments. According to Azambuja, Martins & Ferreira, the program was innovative and had the merits of qualifying the state's supply system, privileging the farmer's autonomy, lowering production costs, reducing environmental impact, and promoting health and the exercise of citizenship, through a shared management system. Among the common practices are crop rotation, the use of soil recovery plants, direct planting, organic fertilizing, riparian reforestation, and worm casting. An ecological orientation is also being noticed in livestock and poultry farming, with rotational grazing, the search for alternatives to the confined livestock model, the use of homeopathy for disease treatment, and the construction of ecological facilities.[43][44][45] Parallel to these novelties are improvements in basic sanitation, regional tourism, waste treatment, and the protection of springs.[25] The State Seminar on Agroecology, held its XII edition in 2011, and for many years has been held in parallel to the International Seminar on Agroecology, remaining an important forum for advanced debates and the birthplace of new proposals through the updates of the Agroecological Charter.[43][44][45]"

        "header": "Chemical waste",
        "content": "The treatment of chemical residues and sewage is also on the administrative agenda of several cities, to avoid the dumping of toxic and polluting materials into soils and especially rivers. In 1999, Greenpeace proposed the challenge that in ten years all Brazilian chemical industries should be treating their effluents, and the Federation of Industries of Rio Grande do Sul was the only business representative in Brazil to accept it.[64] This, however, has not been fully achieved, and despite the existence of specific legislation and control, sometimes there are violations or accidents that end up generating contamination.[65][66] Positive examples are the sewage treatment programs in Porto Alegre and Caxias do Sul, both major polluters, setting ambitious goals: The former intending to expand its treatment capacity from 27% to 77%,[67] and the latter wishing to treat 86% of its sewage by the end of 2012.[68] Several other projects are in progress. In the words of Gustavo de Mello, state superintendent of the National Health Foundation, \"the mayors want to do sanitation, but the projects were missing. We already have 63 contracted and we are going to bid for 350 more. The time of crying that nobody does anything is over. Now we are in the challenge of doing it.\"[69] However, progress has been slow. In 2013, in the cited cases of Porto Alegre and Caxias, only 24.3% and 43.6%, respectively, were being treated.[70] By 2015, the percentage in the capital had improved, rising to 33.3%.[71] Water resources in general are managed by a State System and monitored by regional committees, which have been achieving important improvements in their management and preservation.[72][73]"

The rest are designated for sustainable management.[78]"

        "content": "Despite the progress achieved, there are still multiple problems to be overcome. Many of their causes are not confined to the state but are affected by national policies and the global context. As Altieri and other authors have pointed out, the controversy over the merits of the environmentalist model still rages on, and often its proposals are considered impractical, clashing with economic and political interests. Both parties have found spokespersons in the most respected scientific community, and there is little consensus on a variety of crucial issues.[79][80][81] As an example, for Marcelo Dur\u00e3o, \"expectations are pessimistic about Rio+20 [... ] large corporations (are) the main villains of the financial crisis, which started in 2008, and of the current economic crisis that is expanding in Europe, to the extent that they manage to place their interests above (the interests of) the state [....] the strategies formulated [...] do not aim to solve problems such as those that are occurring in the world, among them the changes in labor and environmental laws\".[82] The change in the Brazilian Forest Code was harshly criticized by environmental sectors, which are supported by international organizations such as the World Wildlife Fund and Greenpeace. For them, there is already enough deforested area in Brazil to approximately double food production without cutting down another hectare of forest.[83][84][85] The rapporteur of the new text, Aldo Rebelo, was accused of favoring agribusiness and the rural caucus, allowing with the new text the invasion of untouched areas and decreasing the requirements to maintain legal reserves on properties, but defended himself saying that the changes will benefit small producers, understanding that there is a lack of arable land in the country.[81][82][86][87] His arguments were heavily contested by civil society, which was 79% opposed to the new code,[88] and also by scientists and environmentalists, denouncing the setbacks that the new law would trigger, but still, the change was approved.[89][90][91] Since then, an extensive series of other measures have been concurring to dismantle environmental legislation and regulation, through presidential decrees, ministerial acts, and legislative reforms in the National Congress, generating harsh criticism and a vast public controversy.[92][93][94][95][96][97] Economic policies that increase interest rates directly influence the rural area, forcing producers to dedicate themselves to exploitation activities with an immediate return. Programs to contain public spending also damage the environment, often considered an area of secondary importance, and make enforcement actions difficult. According to Carlos Young, \"less forest has been accompanied by less work in the areas of Atlantic forest converted for agricultural use. [...] There is a great disproportion between the area occupied by cattle ranching and its contribution to the generation of value. [...] The deforestation process was unable to generate adequate living conditions for the rural population\". It is also claimed that growing populations need new areas for settlement, but the data does not prove the theory.[98]"

Councilman Carlos Alberto da Rosa said that:[103] \"They even created a law to prevent private cars from driving on the beach, because they are worried about armadillos. [...] Instead of improving, they are diminishing our city. Our city is touristy and we can never lose sight of this. About the island of Lobos (an area of integral protection) he said that \"it is the place in Brazil with the best waves for surfing, but surfing there is forbidden. [...] The sea lions only use the island for two months of the year, so why not come to an agreement with the surfers and free the rest of the year?\""

The soil which is sandy, receives little rainfall, and has by nature sparser vegetation cover, besides suffering from the overload of cattle raising and mechanized agriculture. The director-president of the State Foundation for Agricultural Research (Fepagro), Marcos Palombini, said in 2006 that the state has 1.4 million hectares prone to desertification and that in that year 25% of this area was already compromised.[46] According to the Ministry of Environment, historically this biome (pampas) had its area decreased by 54%, and between 2008 and 2009 it lost another 331\u00a0km2. Among the main causes are the occupation of rice cultivation, cattle raising, and reforestation with exotic species, such as eucalyptus and pine.[104] Additional aggressions arise from the inadequate use of water resources, among them irrigation and occupation of swamps for cultivation, which in some regions has caused a significant alteration in the environment, with the disappearance of species, erosion, and salinization of the soil, contamination of the water table, spread of diseases, conveyance of toxic loads to rivers and aggradation of their beds, as well as the depletion of natural sources.[105]"

        "content": "In 2005, a survey indicated that about 975,000 hectares of forest were left in the state, but this corresponds to only about 7% of the original cover.[106] The problem afflicts the highland region, where the Atlantic forest, protected by law, predominates. According to the SOS Mata Atl\u00e2ntica Foundation, in 2009 the rates increased 83% compared to 2005\u20132008,[107] but reports of illegal logging are emerging in other regions.[108][109][110][111][112] For geneticist biologist Paula Corr\u00eaa, the legislation is insufficient[113] and biologist Maury Abreu stated that enforcement is precarious: \"government agencies usually defend themselves by saying that there are no resources, and this is a reality. However, even when resources are available, inspections are not effective. In the end, it seems to me that enforcement acts exclusively on researchers, who face an immense bureaucratic battery to get work done.\"[8] The araucaria forest, a subtype of the Atlantic forest, is one of the most threatened ecosystems, due to the logging industry and the expansion of the agricultural frontier.[113][114] The dominant species of this forest, the araucaria, is critically endangered according to the IUCN.[115] Despite new agreements between IBAMA and productive sectors,[116] the deforested area continues to expand. On the other hand, as pointed out by M\u00e1rcia Hirota, executive director of the SOS Mata Atl\u00e2ntica Foundation, the official numbers are misleading and the devastation should be much greater since in the northeast of the state, where the forest is located, there is a predominance of small properties, where many losses of small fragments, smaller than 3 hectares, are not considered due to technical limitations in the monitoring system.[117]"

        "content": "Pollution has reached high levels in some places of the state, which ranks last in sewage treatment in all of Brazil. According to the most recent National Survey of Sanitation, in 2008, 85% of Rio Grande do Sul's municipalities did not treat their sewage. \"The situation in Rio Grande do Sul is especially bad,\" as the executive president of the Trata Brasil Institute, \u00c9dison Carlos, stated in 2012. The government has promised major investments for the sector in the short term and some cities are developing important projects.[67][68][69][118] Rivers in all regions are contaminated in various other ways,[119] and in 2006 the number of fish that turned up dead was estimated at over eighty tons.[120][121][122][123] The Patos Lagoon is polluted by the industrial district of Rio Grande and receives water from a large watershed, whose rivers pass through major cities, including the capital. The Gua\u00edba lake channels this water and discharges it into the lagoon, which thus receives various pollutants, among them oils, urban garbage, heavy metals, sewage, and pesticides. The problems are aggravated by silting, poorly sized impoundments, drainage, embankments, and disorderly occupation of the banks, leading, in the analysis of the National Water Agency, to a critical environmental situation.[118] This polluted water, besides being harmful to the fauna and flora, is the same water that is consumed by a large population of Porto Alegre and the metropolitan region. Although it undergoes treatment and the government assures that the water distributed is safe, it still has its drinkability compromised by the bad taste and bad smell, which generates complaints from consumers. In times of drought, the problem becomes worse.[124][125] For Unisinos professor Marco Antonio Hansen, \"the water companies perform real magic to leave the water in 'potable' conditions\", considering the high pollution of the raw springs.\"[125] In 2012, Porto Alegre obtained the worst result in a survey on water quality among sixteen of the largest Brazilian capitals, showing a high concentration of caffeine, a substance that indicates contamination by more than five hundred other chemical compounds potentially dangerous to human health, and which have no regulatory legislation.[126] Air quality has been of concern in the capital and metropolitan region, in Caxias do Sul and in Rio Grande, caused by industry and the high number of circulating vehicles, although recently the state has carried out a diagnosis of the situation with a view to better management.[127]"

        "content": "According to the projections of the First National Evaluation Report on Climate Change, prepared by the Brazilian Panel on Climate Change, by 2040, in the pampas region rainfall should intensify by 5% to 10% and the average temperature of the atmosphere should rise by up to 1\u00a0\u00b0C. By the end of the century the temperature is expected to increase by 2.5\u00ba to 3\u00a0\u00b0C, and rainfall is expected to be 25% to 30% more intense. Still unpredictable, but expected variations in the El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a phenomena, which have a great impact on the state climate, should add other conditioning factors of environmental change. There is a particular risk that episodes of torrential rains will become more intense and frequent, increasing the problem of periodic flooding that afflicts several regions of Rio Grande do Sul, and is likely to adversely affect productive systems. Sea level rise and coastal erosion are likely to affect coastal populations, causing displacements and destruction of man-made structures along the beaches, and increasing the risk in the face of storms.[128][129] According to Moacir Antonio Berlato, agro meteorologist at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, an increase in the number of heat waves, a reduction in the number of days with severe frosts and a greater number of days with extreme temperatures have been observed; the number of consecutive days without rain is decreasing, the number of days with consecutive precipitation is increasing in all seasons, and the seasons are being de-characterized.[130][131] Destructive storms, tornadoes, floods, and droughts are expected to increase in number and intensity.[129] For Francisco Aquino, head of the Department of Geography at the same institution, the state is not prepared to handle climate catastrophe situations.[132][133] As the changes imposed on the climate by global warming are irregular, at the same time that the floods are getting worse, the worst droughts in history are being registered in the last years.[130] In the last 50 years, the average temperature in the state increased by 0.6\u00a0\u00b0C.[134] In the last two decades, out of every ten harvests, four are lost due to drought. In the drought of 2004/2005, the largest in the last 50 years, the loss was a record, reaching 3.64 billion reais, and 451 municipalities in the state went into a state of emergency or calamity.[130] In 2014, Porto Alegre had the hottest summer in its history.[135] Berlato states that \"in agriculture, in the South Region, the increase in minimum temperature will certainly cause a reduction in the yield of crops such as maize and wheat. The increase in temperature will also harm or reduce the areas suitable for the so-called temperate climate crops that require cold, as is the case of some fruit trees (apple, peach)\".[130] Climate change also harms pollinating animals, such as bees and mammals, on which many crops, such as fruit trees and soybeans, depend.[136][137] Droughts have also damaged water supply systems for human consumption.[138] Jefferson C\u00e1rdia Sim\u00f5es, a glaciologist, and professor at the Institute of Geosciences at UFRGS said that the incidence of endemic diseases is increasing significantly, such as dengue fever. The researcher states that an increase of 1.5\u00a0\u00b0C in the average temperature in Rio Grande do Sul would already be enough to include the state in the permanent endemic zone of the disease. Extreme heat waves make children and the elderly suffer, and floods seriously problematize sanitation issues, which in many places is in critical condition, being the origin of other diseases.[130] Mental illnesses are also expected to increase in the population due to climate imbalance, such as stress and depression.[139] There are no specific state policies for the prevention and adaptation to global warming and the mitigation of its effects, although in 2015 Fepam launched the Cycle of Debates on Climate Change.[140]"

        "header": "Political and institutional aspects",
        "content": "The state's institutional and political sectors concerning the environment have been in chronic crisis for many years, jeopardizing much of the fruits of Rio Grande do Sul's pioneerism in the environmental area. The lack of clear and consistent lines of action was reflected in the appointment of eight environment secretaries between 2002 and 2009 and the reduction of Rio Grande do Sul's role as a national reference in the area of environmental policies.[143] In 2012, the employees of Fepam, the state environmental protection foundation, \"in Assembly of Crisis\", publicly denounced the precarious state of the institution's operation: \"we must bring the fact to the attention of society because the government is trying to stifle the gravity of the situation. [...] What shocks us is that the fact has practically no repercussions in society and the press in general. As if everything was working well. Or even worse, as if the system were dispensable.\" Among the difficulties faced, were the lack of vehicles to carry out field inspections, obsolete equipment, a significant reduction in the technical exchange with other states, the Federal Government, and international agencies, lack of qualified personnel, great pressure to speed up licensing processes, and the public discredit of the institution.[144] The Permanent Assembly of Entities in Defense of the Environment of Rio Grande do Sul (Apedema/RS) joined Fepam's protests, forwarding to the governor a document condemning \"the current situation of political and institutional crisis of the State Government's environmental administration\". For the Assembly, the dismantling of the Secretariat of Environment was occurring, demonstrating \"the absence of a political will by the government to keep open the main channel of technical and political society in the environmental area.\"[145][146] It added: \"Unfortunately, after four decades of the emergence of the environmental paradigm, the current development project in the state of Rio Grande do Sul remains at the opposite of history, promoting an unsustainable and environmentally obsolete infrastructure, besides not bringing, in fact, a better quality of life to the citizens of Rio Grande do Sul. Thus, we see that investments continue to be made in an outdated energy matrix with high socio-environmental impact (mineral coal, hydroelectric plants); in an agricultural model that exports commodities (soy, rice, pulp, tobacco, etc.), based on the intensive use of pesticides and GMOs; in the primacy of the automotive sector that prioritizes the use of individual automobiles, associated with planned obsolescence, to the detriment of public transportation, among other problems.\" In 2013, the crisis was aggravated when the Federal Police dismantled a large network of corruption that operated in the state, involving politicians, businessmen, technicians, and public officials, and that, through bribery, facilitated the environmental licensing of enterprises disregarding requirements provided by law, favoring especially real estate companies in Porto Alegre and the northern coast of Rio Grande do Sul, as well as mining projects.[147][148][149] Jos\u00e9 Ivo Sartori, governor sworn in in 2015, has signaled that the environment is an important aspect of his government's policy but stated that it is necessary to reconcile nature with economic growth, defending agribusiness, one of the biggest villains in the view of environmentalists but one of the main bases of the Rio Grande do Sul economy. A few months after taking office, he formalized the Rural Environmental Registry, a compulsory register of all rural properties, where their physical and environmental characteristics and use are described, and it is expected that this mechanism will improve monitoring, reduce bureaucracy, and help control aggressions against the environment.[150] In 2016, Bill 145 was passed, which changed the management of the State Environmental Fund and introduced changes in the conceptualization of native forest and forestry areas, generating protests and a lawsuit by several associations, pointing out unconstitutionality and accusing the government of hurting several competencies and procedures \"consolidated for many years in the State environmental agencies,\" ignoring the restrictions of the Forestry Zoning and undermining the policy of recovery of degraded areas, potentially causing \"irreparable damage to the environment.\"[151] The choice of Environment Secretary, Ana Pellini, was another cause for apprehension and considered a disaster by nine environmental entities, who delivered a letter of protest, citing that when Pellini managed Fepam between 2007 and 2009 the courts received many complaints of irregularities in environmental licensing, and they feared \"an avalanche of setbacks.\"[152][153] Also generating protests and concern was the declared intention to commercially exploit the 23 Conservation Units existing in the state, through concessions to the private sector. For Gabriel Ritter, director of the Department of Biodiversity of the Secretary of Environment, the protected areas \"are being used very little\". During the public hearing that debated the issue, Deputy Altemir Tortelli criticized the project:[109] \"Perhaps the majority of the population is not aware of what is at stake, of the gravity of the pre-announcements that have been made by the Sartori government. This means the deconstruction of fundamental instruments for scientific research and the environment in the state. This is a mercantile strategy that threatens to throw a decades-long history into the trashcan.\" Deputy Manuela d'\u00c1vila pointed out the lack of information about Sartori's global policy for the environment: \"We live in an environment of permanent suspense. We are not debating anything concrete, because so far we don't know what the government intends\". The well-known environmentalist and former municipal secretary for the Environment of Porto Alegre, Caio Lustosa, was more incisive, warning that concessions of this kind are vetoed by the state constitution, and criticized the current secretary as completely inadequate for her position.[109] Also controversial was the extinction of the Zoobotanical Foundation of Rio Grande do Sul (FZB), as part of the plan to streamline the administrative machine to save resources. The Foundation was responsible for maintaining the Zoological Park of Rio Grande do Sul, the Natural Science Museum, and the Botanical Garden of Porto Alegre, which are important research centers and carried out important works.[154][155] The Secretary of the Environment stated that the proposal was harmful to public interests.[156] Representative Altemir Tortelli, of the group that disagrees with the extinction, said: \"We cannot accept that the Piratini Palace (state government) simply put an end to an institution that is fundamental for scientific research and the preservation of biodiversity in Rio Grande do Sul. [...] The Sartori government wants, in thirty days, the Assembly to decide on the end of an institution that has more than 40 years of history, full of contributions to science and the environment. We will not accept this aberration.\"[154] The extinction of the FZB was temporarily suspended by a determination of the State Court of Justice until the case is reassessed.[157] Also in 2018, the governor issued a decree that weakened the legislation on pesticides, contested by the Permanent Assembly of Entities in Defense of the Environment of Rio Grande do Sul for removing the legal basis that existed to reject approval of products that do not have registration in the country where their active ingredient was synthesized.[158] Another measure that triggered controversy was the merger of the Secretary of Environment with the Secretary of Infrastructure in Eduardo Leite's government, which was criticized by Agapan as \"a huge setback in the state's environmental management,\" mainly because of the conflict of interests between the two areas.[159] The Ga\u00facho Institute for Environmental Studies stated that the state with this merger risks suffering an \"environmental blackout,\" pointing out \"a negative environmental picture neglected by several governments, especially the predecessor state government, where there were tremendous setbacks, via laws, decrees and ordinances with a profound weakening of the technical sector of the environmental area.\"[160] In 2020, Governor Leite had the Legislative Assembly approve a new wording for the State Environmental Code, changing 480 points of the previous legislation, virtually revoking it in its entirely, without going through the Health and Environment Commission and with only one public debate. Some of the changes were: In addition, the new law revoked 13 articles of the Rio Grande do Sul Forest Code. The text received several criticisms for technical and legal errors, inconsistencies, and the great weakening of the protective legislation.[161] Although the current period presents difficulties deficiencies in many aspects regarding environmental protection, the government has carried out actions and implemented projects.The former governor, Tarso Genro, by word and deed, expressed his interest in the issue several times.[162][163][164][165] The former state secretary of the Environment, Jussara Cony, a few months before the crisis at Fepam became public, had stated that the government is attuned to the environmental problems and was taking action.[166] In order to improve the matter, education also requires further investments: According to biologist Sidney Grippi, \"there can be no environmental conservation or preservation without education, as it builds in the individual and in the collectivity an awareness of changing behavior and attitudes, which aim to prioritize the environment.\"[167] For researchers Scheren & Ferreira, the change of socio-cultural-environmental paradigms \"is just a matter of education.... the population is receptive to the new environmental policy, requiring only work and investment in the area.\"[168]"

        "content": " Hurricane Fred was the easternmost Atlantic hurricane to form in the tropics, and the first to move through Cape Verde since 1892.[1] The second hurricane and sixth named storm of the 2015 Atlantic hurricane season, Fred originated from a well-defined tropical wave over West Africa in late August\u00a02015. Once offshore, the wave moved northwestward within a favorable tropospheric environment and strengthened into a tropical storm on August\u00a030. The following day, Fred grew to a Category\u00a01 hurricane with peak winds of 85\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) as it approached Cape Verde. After passing Boa Vista and moving away from Santo Ant\u00e3o, it entered a phase of steady weakening, dropping below hurricane status by September\u00a01. Fred then turned to the west-northwest, enduring increasingly hostile wind shear, but maintained its status as a tropical cyclone despite repeated forecasts of rapid dissipation. It fluctuated between minimal tropical storm and tropical depression strength through September\u00a04\u20135 before curving sharply to the north. By September\u00a06, Fred's circulation pattern had diminished considerably, and the storm dissipated later that day. Under threat from the hurricane, all of Cape Verde was placed under a hurricane warning for the first time in the nation's history. Gale-force winds battered much of the Barlavento region throughout August\u00a031, downing trees and utility poles. On the easternmost islands of Boa Vista and Sal, Fred leveled roofs and left villages without power or phone services for a few days. About 70\u00a0percent of the houses in Povoa\u00e7\u00e3o Velha suffered light to moderate damage. Across the northernmost islands, rainstorms flooded homes, washed out roads, and ruined farmland; S\u00e3o Nicolau endured great losses of crops and livestock. Material damage across Cape Verde totaled US$2.5\u00a0million,[nb 1] though the rain's overall impact on agriculture was positive and replenishing. Swells from the hurricane produced violent seas along the West African shoreline, destroying fishing villages and submerging swaths of residential areas in Senegal. Between the coasts of West Africa and Cape Verde, maritime incidents related to Fred resulted in nine deaths."

        "content": "Early on August\u00a028, the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring an unusually vigorous tropical wave\u2014an elongated area of low air pressure\u2014inland over West Africa.[1][3] Trailed by widespread cloudiness, the wave tracked toward the open Atlantic as it developed a broad cyclonic rotation within the lower atmosphere near Guinea's coastline.[4] The disturbance veered toward the northwest and entered the ocean off Conakry around 18:00\u00a0UTC, August\u00a029. By that time, the NHC was predicting favorable conditions for the development of a tropical cyclone within the next 48\u00a0hours.[5] Strong thunderstorms thrived overnight and consolidated near a well-defined low-pressure center;[6][7] around midnight August\u00a030, satellite images and scatterometer data confirmed that a tropical depression with sustained winds of 35\u00a0mph (55\u00a0km/h) had formed about 300\u00a0miles (480\u00a0km) west-northwest of Conakry.[1][8] Although tropical cyclones in the extreme eastern Atlantic are typically propelled westward by high pressures from the North Atlantic subtropical ridge,[9] this depression took an atypical northwestward path along a breach in the ridge from a previous disturbance.[1][8] Its cyclonic structure steadily improved as a sharply curved rainband tightened around the center, resembling the precursor to an eye.[10] At 06:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a030, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Fred while 390\u00a0mi (625\u00a0km) east-southeast of Praia, Cape Verde[1]\u2014among the four easternmost locations for a tropical storm to form since modern record-keeping began in 1851.[10] A steady trend of intensification ensued while Fred moved through a region with ample tropical moisture, light upper winds, and above-average sea surface temperatures.[11] The storm developed a thick, circular central dense overcast with good outflow, and the eye feature became well established at all levels of the circulation.[12][13] Based on these characteristics, as well as satellite intensity estimates of 75\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h) winds, Fred was upgraded to a Category\u00a01 hurricane at 00:00\u00a0UTC, August\u00a031. Then centered 165\u00a0mi (270\u00a0km) east-southeast of Sal, Cape Verde,[1] it became the easternmost tropical cyclone ever to attain hurricane status in the tropical Atlantic.[nb 2][15] A compact cyclone, Fred quickly reached its peak strength as a hurricane, with a minimum central pressure of 986\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.12\u00a0inHg) and 85\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) winds.[1] Through the rest of August\u00a031, the hurricane traversed the Barlavento Islands of Cape Verde, barely skirting the southern coast of Boa Vista around 12:00\u00a0UC.[16] Gradually decreasing in definition, the eye passed north of S\u00e3o Nicolau and then north-northeast of Santo Ant\u00e3o over the next 12\u00a0hours.[17][18] On September\u00a01, drier air and stronger wind shear aloft dispersed the convection around the cyclone's core, causing Fred to diminish to a tropical storm.[19] The weakened storm turned slightly toward the west-northwest, over considerably cooler waters, in response to high pressure rebuilding to its north.[20][21] Through much of September\u00a01\u20134, Fred produced limited convective activity, with intermittent flares of thunderstorms that were continuously blown away from the center by the strong upper winds. Despite the adverse environment and the storm's lack of stable convection, Fred maintained a robust spiral of low-level clouds and gales during this period, defying the NHC's repeated forecasts of its dissipation.[22] At 12:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a04, the NHC downgraded Fred to a tropical depression as its wind circulation waned; though its winds briefly picked up back to tropical storm force the next day, Fred continued as a depression with minimal convection throughout the remainder of its existence.[1] Concurrently, a deep-altitude disturbance a few hundred miles east of Bermuda began to erode the southern edge of the high-pressure ridge that Fred had circumnavigated for most of its journey.[23] This changed the steering pattern in the region, turning the depression abruptly to the north on September\u00a06.[23][24] Over the next hours, Fred became increasingly diffuse because of its progressively worsening surroundings.[25] It officially lost its status as a tropical cyclone at 18:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a06, degenerating into a surface trough about 1,200\u00a0mi (1,950\u00a0km) to the southwest of the Azores before merging with the disturbance off Bermuda.[1]"

Along the shorelines between Dakar and M'Bour, rough surf devastated entire fishing districts and harbor towns, stranding boats and damaging roads and bridges. About 200\u00a0houses were demolished in the district of Hann, many of which experienced total wall collapse; dwellings in the town of Bargny endured similar destruction.[26][27] In the suburb of Rufisque, the waves overtopped dams, entered homes and cemeteries, and destroyed a mosque.[28] Several villages outside the capital area were completely cut off from their surroundings.[28] Victims across the affected region received more than 100\u00a0tons (220,000\u00a0lbs) of rice and 12\u00a0million CFA francs (US$20,000) in government relief funds.[29] Farther south, in Guinea-Bissau, a storm surge flooded roads and low-lying establishments, such as offices and military barracks. The sea water submerged vast amounts of cropland in the Tombali Region, resulting in great losses of rice.[30] Offshore, waves as high as 23\u00a0feet (7\u00a0m) capsized a fishing boat with a crew of 19; twelve members were rescued, but the remaining seven disappeared at sea and were presumed dead.[31]"

When Fred showed definitive signs of strengthening, the alerts were replaced by a hurricane warning,[1] marking the first occasion of a hurricane-level advisory in the nation's history.[32] On the morning of August\u00a031, TACV Cabo Verde Airlines suspended its flights from the capital of Praia to Dakar;[33] all operations at the airports of Boa Vista, Sal, and S\u00e3o Vicente were halted when squalls began to spread across the islands.[34] Officials urged shipping interests on all islands to secure their vessels and remain in port.[35] A national music festival was canceled in Porto Novo, on the northernmost island of Santo Ant\u00e3o.[36] Throughout Cape Verde, Hurricane Fred displaced more than 50\u00a0families[37] and caused CVE$250\u00a0million ($2.5\u00a0million) in damage,[27][38] primarily to the agricultural and private sectors of the Barlavento Islands.[37] It was the first hurricane to move through Cape Verde with a documented impact,[nb 3] as well as the nation's only record of onshore hurricane-force winds.[27] Although there were no casualties on land,[37] two fishermen navigating through the storm never returned to port in Boa Vista and were presumed dead.[39] Despite the losses in crops and livestock in the Barlavento region, the rainfall from Fred had a generally positive effect on the large-scale agriculture of Cape Verde, refilling rivers and reservoirs and irrigating drought-stricken farmland across the Sotavento Islands.[40][41]"

Along the island's southern shore, Fred's storm surge sunk or stranded dozens of vessels and destroyed the island's main tourist pier in Santa Maria.[46] Restoration efforts had not yet been completed by May\u00a02017, about 1.5\u00a0years after the hurricane; the delay led to concerns over the island's precarious, tourism-reliant economy.[47][48] Hotels, restaurants, and beach facilities were flooded, and roads in the town became impassable. Gusts leveled the roof of a high school gym,[42] which had initially been set up as a storm shelter to 100\u00a0citizens.[46] Elsewhere on the island, the winds knocked out power to homes in Palmeira,[42] and caused minor structural damage to Sal International Airport.[49] At the height of the storm, floods forced nearly 130\u00a0people living in the impoverished outskirts of Terra Boa and Espargos to relocate to shelters.[42][50] Fred destroyed 80\u00a0percent of the Loggerhead sea turtle nests on the beaches of Sal, crucial nesting sites for the species.[51] Overall, the hurricane left CVE$30\u00a0million ($300,000) in damage across Sal.[27] Fred produced strong winds and downpours across the mountainous northern islands of Barlavento. S\u00e3o Nicolau experienced sustained hurricane-force winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h)\u2014the highest official wind speed recorded during hurricane. Rainfall there was moderate, peaking at 3.5\u00a0in (90\u00a0mm) at Juncalinho.[27] The blustery weather uprooted many old trees, triggered landslides, and left the villages on the island without power.[27][52] The strong winds downed power poles and wrecked the roof of a church in the village of Cabe\u00e7alinho.[53] In Ribeira Brava, S\u00e3o Nicolau's most populous town, the storm damaged 70\u00a0homes, destroyed greenhouses, and leveled a farmhouse, leaving some families homeless and others without a source of income.[54] In Carri\u00e7al, the torrential rainfall flooded homes, washed out roads, and ruined fruit and hydroponic crops.[55] Much of S\u00e3o Nicolau's livestock, including cattle from Hortel\u00e3, was lost in the storm.[53][56] Damage to agriculture\u2014primarily banana and sugarcane[52]\u2014and private property on the island reached CVE$50\u00a0million ($500,000).[27] On the neighboring islands of S\u00e3o Vicente and Santo Ant\u00e3o, the storm's impact was limited to power outages, floods, and damaged crops.[57] Santo Ant\u00e3o recorded light winds and 8\u00a0in (200\u00a0mm) of rain,[41] although higher elevations received greater quantities.[27] In Porto Novo, 35\u00a0people were relocated as floods swept through neighborhoods.[58] The rain washed out the island's carrot, cabbage, and tomato plantations, especially in the vicinity of Alto Mira.[59] On S\u00e3o Vicente, roads were closed in and around Laginha. Gusts toppled two trees, one striking a car and lightly injuring the driver.[60] Hurricane-related costs for the two islands, mainly infrastructural repair, totaled CVE$16\u00a0million ($160,000).[27]"

        "content": " Hurricane Helene (/h\u025b\u02c8li\u02d0n/ \u24d8 hehl-EEN)[1] was a large, catastrophic, and fast-moving tropical cyclone that caused widespread destruction and fatalities across the Southeastern United States. It was the strongest hurricane on record to strike the Big Bend region of Florida, the deadliest for the United States since 2017, and the deadliest in mainland US since 2005.[2] The eighth named storm, fifth hurricane, and second major hurricane[a] of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, Helene developed gradually from a mid-September disturbance in the western Caribbean Sea within a broad area of low pressure known as the Central American gyre.  By September\u00a024, the disturbance had consolidated enough to become a tropical storm as it approached the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, receiving the name Helene from the National Hurricane Center. Favorable conditions led to the cyclone's gradual intensification, and it became a hurricane early on September\u00a025. More pronounced and rapid intensification ensued as Helene traversed the Gulf of Mexico the following day, reaching Category\u00a04 intensity on the evening of September\u00a026. Late on September\u00a026, Helene made landfall at peak intensity in the Big Bend region of Florida, near the city of Perry, with maximum sustained winds of 140\u00a0mph (220\u00a0km/h). Helene weakened as it moved quickly inland before degenerating to a post-tropical cyclone over Tennessee on September\u00a027. The storm then stalled over the state before dissipating on September\u00a029. In advance of Helene's expected landfall, the governors of Florida and Georgia declared states of emergency due to the significant impacts expected, including very high storm surge along the coast and hurricane-force gusts as far inland as Atlanta. Hurricane warnings also extended further inland due to Helene's fast motion. The storm caused catastrophic rainfall-triggered flooding, particularly in western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee, and spawned numerous tornadoes. As of October\u00a02, a total of 191 deaths have been attributed to Helene, making it the deadliest hurricane to affect the United States since Hurricane Maria in 2017 and the deadliest to strike the continental United States since Hurricane Katrina in 2005.[4][5]"

        "content": "On September\u00a017, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) highlighted the potential for tropical cyclogenesis in the western Caribbean Sea.[6]  Conditions conducive for development of a tropical cyclone resulted from the interaction of the Central American gyre\u2014a broad monsoon low pressure system\u2014and the Madden\u2013Julian Oscillation, which reinforced the large-scale cyclonic flow extending from the eastern Pacific Ocean to the western Caribbean Sea.[7]  Several days later, on September\u00a022, a broad low-pressure area developed within the western Caribbean.[8]  As the system traversed an environment conducive for tropical cyclone development,[9] showers and thunderstorms associated with the disturbance gradually consolidated.[10] Due to the system's imminent threat to land, it was designated Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine on September\u00a023.[11] The next day, Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunters aircraft found that the system was producing flight-level winds of 52\u00a0mph (84\u00a0km/h) and had developed a better-defined center; the NHC accordingly upgraded the system to Tropical Storm Helene at 15:00\u00a0UTC.[12] The system continued strengthening, with NOAA and Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunters finding that Helene's maximum winds had increased to 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h). As a result, NHC upgraded the system to a hurricane by 15:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a025 as it began to enter the Gulf of Mexico while turning to the north. An upper-level trough to its west and a ridge of high pressure located off the Southeastern United States both served to steer the cyclone towards the U.S. Gulf Coast.[13] Helene was a very large system,[14] with the NHC noting in multiple forecast discussions that the forecast storm radii were \"at the 90th percentile of hurricane size at similar latitudes\".[15] After remaining steady in intensity for a while due to its broad size and some entrainment of drier air to its west, Helene recovered quickly and began its rapid intensification early on the morning of September\u00a026\u00a0\u2013 aided by low mid-level wind shear, high relative humidity values and sea surface temperatures (SSTs) exceeding 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F) near the Loop Current\u00a0\u2014 as an increasingly well-defined eye developed, reaching Category\u00a02 intensity at 12:00\u00a0UTC.[16] Quickly strengthening, by 18:25\u00a0UTC Helene was found to have become a major hurricane by Hurricane Hunters,[17] and four hours later, a Category\u00a04 hurricane.[18] The hurricane attained its peak intensity later that night with maximum sustained wind of 140\u00a0mph (220\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 938 millibars (27.70\u00a0inHg) at 3:10\u00a0UTC on September 27 as it made landfall east of the center of the Aucilla River about 10 miles (16\u00a0km) west-southwest of Perry, Florida,[19] becoming the strongest hurricane to strike Florida's Big Bend region.[20] Rapid weakening occurred as the storm tracked inland, and by the time it reached Georgia at 05:00\u00a0UTC the next day, it had weakened into a Category\u00a02 hurricane.[21] Weakening further, it became a tropical storm over east central Georgia a few hours later.[22]"

More than 9,000 residents were without power in as of September\u00a027. In Edgewater, a carport blew over while a tree fell through the roof of a mobile home in the Sea Horse Mobile Home Park. In Seminole County, which was affected only by outer bands of the storm, a large tree fell into a duplex style home through the roof.[153] Seminole County saw 2,427 people without power, while neighboring Orange County saw 4,476 customers without power. In Apopka, the outer bands tore the roof off of a home.[154][155] Elsewhere, in Flagler County, the highest gusts recorded were in Marineland, which had winds of 63\u00a0mph (101\u00a0km/h). Approximately 20,000 residents lost power from September\u00a026 and 27.

Fox Weather meteorologist Bob Van Dillen was caught on live television saving a woman from her Toyota RAV4 with flood waters up to the windows.[160] Localized urban flooding was also reported on multiple interstates like I-285, I-85, I-75 [161] and many other interstate systems encompassing Atlanta. More significant flooding occurred in Buckhead due to overflowing of the Peachtree Creek which flooded multiple surrounding apartment complexes. Other flooding occurred in areas around Metro Atlanta.[162] The Chattahoochee River overflowed its banks in multiple areas around Fulton County, Georgia and in downstream counties which prompted a water rescue in Coweta County.[163] Three tornadoes were spawned by Helene in the state,[164][165] including one that killed two people in Wheeler County when it overturned their mobile home.[166] The Wheeler County tornado has not been rated yet, while the other two have been rated EF0.[167] In Columbus, a daily rainfall record was set with around 4\u00a0in (100\u00a0mm) of rain on September 26. Wind gust in the city reached 38\u00a0mph (61\u00a0km/h), with gusts reaching 59\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h) in Macon and 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) in Augusta.[159] Rabun County officials ordered the evacuation of people living below a dam at Lake Rabun after officials were forced to open a third floodgate, inundating several roads and trapping people in their communities in the southern part of the county. Four homes were destroyed by falling trees in White County and Habersham County, but no injuries were reported.[168] Rabun County's Emergency Management department many roads were left \"impassable\" by the storm and that most residents were without power into September\u00a027, urging them to stay home in order to allow rescue and cleanup personnel to work uninterrupted.[168] The Hiwassee River in Towns County crested at over ten feet (3.0\u00a0m), just one foot (0.30\u00a0m) below the record, and flooded pastures and a campground.[169] Over a million customers lost electric power in the state during Helene due to trees falling on power lines across the state and high wind speeds. There are over over 400,000 people still without electricity as of September\u00a029.[170][171] At least 115 structures in Valdosta were heavily damaged.[172] Helene would cause major damage to Georgia's poultry farms, causing damage or total destruction to 107 facilities.[173] Georgia and surrounding regions produce almost half of the 9 billion chicken consumed across the United States, and manure run off from the damaged facilities would raise alarms about the quality of streams and groundwater.[173] Injuries and deaths were reported throughout the state, including the two fatalities from the aforementioned tornado in Wheeler County.[166] Six people died in Richmond County from falling trees.[174] Four people, a mother and her twin infants and another individual, died in McDuffie County.[175][174] A person was killed in Colquitt County after their vehicle crashed into a fallen tree.[176] Two deaths were reported in Laurens County, when a person was killed by a tree falling on their house and the other person was killed in a car crash, and in Blackshear, a firefighter also died when a tree fell on their vehicle.[177] In Jeff Davis County, two people were killed by falling trees.[178] In Liberty County, one person was killed after a tree fell onto a camper.[179] In Washington County, a 4-year-old girl and a 7-year-old boy were killed while trapped inside their home due to a tree hitting the residence, starting a fire.[180] In Columbia County, one person was killed after a tree fell onto their mobile home.[181] In Pierce County, a firefighter was killed after a tree fell on his vehicle.[182]"

Lake Lure Dam was later evaluated with no imminent failure expected, although erosion on both sides of the dam and compromisation of the structural supports were reported.[190][191] One woman in the town of Lake Lure was rescued with her dog after being stranded inside a collapsed house along a riverbank.[192] Seven tornadoes were spawned by Helene in the state.[167] This included a brief, but intense low-end EF3 tornado that impacted the north side of Rocky Mount, damaging 14 buildings and injuring 15 people, including four critically.[193] Five of the other tornadoes were rated EF1, while the remaining one was rated EF0.[167] Areas in the Black Mountains region in the western part of the state were particularly devastated. Residents of Swannanoa also reported that no search and rescue operations had reached their location as of September\u00a029, leaving several residents who had not prepared for the degree of flooding without food or drinkable water.[194] Data from the National Weather Service indicated that over 19\u00a0in (480\u00a0mm) of rain fell in areas upstream of Chimney Rock, leading to devastating floodwaters that destroyed half of the village, including half of the businesses on the South side of the village near the Broad River.[195] The downtown of Elkin was heavily damaged by floodwaters from the Yadkin River.[196] The Catawba River flooded Morganton and left thousands of residents without power.[197] The Oxford Dam, at Lake Hickory on the Catawba River, spilled over.[198] More than 400 roads were closed in the western part of the state, and over 200 people had to be rescued from floods.[172] A curfew was issued for Asheville due to the damage that occurred inside the city.[199] The city broke their record for two-day rainfall, recording 9.87\u00a0in (251\u00a0mm) of rain.[200] There were sporadic reports of looting with theft of non-essential items such as sports apparel and athletic shoes during the height of the storm.[201] The French Broad River crested at 24.67\u00a0ft (7.52\u00a0m), and the Swannanoa River reached 26.1\u00a0ft (8.0\u00a0m), both higher than in the Flood of 1916.[202][203]  Almost the entirety  of Biltmore Village and the River Arts District were flooded, and the city was largely isolated due to loss of power and cell service.[204][205] Landslides around Asheville forced sections of I-26 and I-40 to close, and triggered a flash flood emergency for the location.[206][207] Access to Asheville was cut off from September 27\u201328 via I-26 to South Carolina.[208] A curfew was also issued for Boone after high winds and torrential rain caused flooding, sink holes, and power outages throughout Watauga County.[209] Appalachian State's football game against Liberty was canceled due to flooding and was not rescheduled.[210] A mudslide and floodwaters from the Pigeon River washed out a section of I-40 at the North Carolina\u2013Tennessee border, forcing another closure.[211] The Pigeon River rose to more than 25 feet (7.6 metres) in Canton,[202] higher than during Hurricane Frances in 2004 and Tropical Storm Fred in 2021.[212] In Busick, rainfall totals reached 30.78\u00a0in (782\u00a0mm).[213] The University of North Carolina at Asheville canceled all classes through October\u00a09, along with Appalachian State campuses of Boone and Hickory through October\u00a011, and Western Carolina University through October\u00a04.[214] Warren Wilson College and Blue Ridge Community College announced they would remain closed for at least a week.[215] The Asheville School, a boarding school in Asheville, evacuated its students and announced the campus would remain closed until October 14.[216] Christ School, an all-boys Episcopal boarding school in Arden, was not evacuated and the campus was left without power.[217] The North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) issued a statement on their website that all roads in western North Carolina should be considered closed.[218] Lees-McRae College in Banner Elk evacuated their campus and as of September 29, all students were successfully evacuated with the assistance of the North Carolina National Guard.[215]"

Later on September 28, Clemson University announced that it would be opening some of its powered facilities and offering free food, drinks, ice, charging stations and showers to the community for members in need of respite following the storm, though many criticized the university for not doing so sooner.[229] Criticism continued when Clemson University announced that classes would be cancelled on Monday, September 30, seemingly contradicting the earlier assertion that the area was recovered well enough to host a game.[230] In addition to Clemson, Erksine College was forced to postpone their football match against University of West Alabama and reschedule the matchup to November 16.[231] 45,000 chickens were lost in one South Carolina poultry facility, and the storm is expected to have a major impact on local agriculture; South Carolina is a major supplier of chicken nationally to the United States.[173] Manure run off from the damaged chicken facilities poses a potential risk to groundwater and streams.[173]"

[Biden] just said, 'Hey, what do you need?' And I told him, 'You know, we got what we need, we will work through the federal process.' He offered that if there's other things we need, just to call him directly, which, I appreciate that. But we've had FEMA embedded with us since, you know, a day or two before the storm hit.\"[282][283][284] Trump also baselessly claimed on his social media platform, Truth Social, that the federal government and North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper were \"going out of their way to not help people in Republican areas\".[285] President Biden was criticized for visiting Rehoboth Beach, Delaware over the weekend instead of being at the White House commanding the federal response. Biden disputed claims that he was not helping to command the federal response to the disaster, and stated that he had been doing so over phone. Biden also said that he might have to ask Congress to return to Washington, D.C. to pass supplemental funding for the federal government's response to Helene. Biden promised to visit the emergency operations center in Raleigh on October\u00a02 before embarking on an aerial tour of Asheville before visiting Georgia and Florida \"as soon as possible after that\". Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris also promised to be \"on the ground\" as soon as possible without interrupting emergency response operations. On September 30, Harris boarded Air Force Two en route to Joint Base Andrews to visit FEMA headquarters in Washington, D.C. for a briefing on support for emergency response and recovery efforts from the results of Hurricane Helene.[286] In response to reporters questions about the relation between climate change and the hurricane's severity, the head of FEMA, Deanne Criswell, said climate change made the storm significantly worse.[287][288] Later, when reporters asked President Biden if climate change is to blame for the damage done by the hurricane he answered: \"Absolutely, positively, unequivocally, yes, yes, yes, yes.\"[289] On October 1, all senators from North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Tennessee, and Virginia wrote a letter to the Senate leadership urging them to act to help their states, even if it were to mean returning early from recess in October.[279] However, a day later, House Speaker Mike Johnson said that lawmakers would not return from recess saying that, \"We wouldn't even conceivably have the request ready before we get back in November\" due to uncertainties about the cost of the disaster and that there was \"no necessity\" for a return. Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas said that the costly relief effort would use most of FEMA's funding for the year and that the agency would be unprepared for another major disaster.[290] On October 2, President Joe Biden met with South Carolina officials such as Senator Lindsey Graham and Governor Henry McMaster to discuss the federal response to Helene before traveling to North Carolina to embark on an aerial tour of Asheville and Lake Lure. Biden was joined by North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, Asheville Mayor Esther Manheimer, FEMA director Deanne Criswell, and Homeland Security Advisor Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall.[291] According to Alejandro Mayorkas, the tour was done from the air using Marine One so as to not impede the emergency response on the ground. Biden also ordered the Department of Defense to deploy up to 1,000 active-duty troops to assist with aid efforts.[290] Vice President Kamala Harris visited Augusta, Georgia and spoke with residents of the city impacted by Helene. Harris personally comforted Augusta residents and handed out supplies, spoke about relief efforts underway, and thanked local and state officials such as Augusta Mayor Garnett Johnson. Harris also visited a Red Cross relief center where she received a briefing from local officials about the situation.[292]"

Cars were swept away by the waters and ended up in the sea or streams, and in some of them the passengers drowned. The old highway was turned into a river,[8] as were the streets of Athens. There have been cases of theft in homes and shops damaged by the floods.[9] Many areas were left without electricity for hours. Victims were hosted on a cruise ship.[10] Three days of mourning were declared in the country.[10] The death toll was 24 people,[11] of whom 23 in Mandra and one in Nea Peramos.[12] In Mandra 1064 buildings, and in particular 794 houses, 126 business premises, 8 public buildings and 136 warehouses and basements, were damaged. In the area of Megara and Nea Peramos at least 448 buildings were destroyed, of which 228 were residential, 38 business premises, 6 public buildings and 123 warehouses and basements.[13] Deaths and flood damage provoked political reactions.[14] The Municipality of Athens sent significant material assistance to the victims of West Attica, while the Ministry of Labor, Social Security and Social Solidarity decided to provide facilities to companies, employers or insured persons who had a professional establishment or activity in the areas and suffered damages.[10]"

        "content": "Mount Tsukuba has been a place of pilgrimage since at least the Heian period. During the Edo period, parts of what later became the city of Tsukuba were administered by a junior branch of the Hosokawa clan at Yatabe Domain, one of the feudal domains of the Tokugawa shogunate. With the creation of the modern municipalities system after the Meiji Restoration on April 1, 1889, the town Yatabe was established within Tsukuba District, Ibaraki. Beginning in the 1960s, the area was designated for development. Construction of the city centre, the University of Tsukuba and 46 public basic scientific research laboratories began in the 1970s. Tsukuba Science City became operational in the 1980s. The Expo '85 world's fair was held in the area of Tsukuba Science City, which at the time was still divided administratively between several small towns and villages. Attractions at the event included the 85-metre (279\u00a0ft) Technocosmos, which at that time was the world's tallest Ferris wheel.[6] On November 30, 1987 the town of Yatabe merged with the neighboring towns of \u014cho and Toyosato (from Tsukuba District)) and the village of Sakura (from Niihari District) to create the city of Tsukuba. The neighboring town of Tsukuba merged with the city of Tsukuba on January 1, 1988. Followed by the town of Kukizaki (from Inashiki District) on November 1, 2002. Therefore, Yatabe, \u014cho, Toyosato, Sakura, Tsukuba and Kukizaki, correspond to the ancient towns and villages. By 2000, the city's 60 national research institutes and two national universities had been grouped into five zones: higher education and training, construction research, physical science and engineering research, biological and agricultural research, and common (public) facilities. These zones were surrounded by more than 240 private research facilities. Among the most prominent institutions are the University of Tsukuba (1973; formerly Tokyo University of Education); the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK); the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology; the Electrotechnical Laboratory; the Mechanical Engineering Laboratory; and the National Institute for Materials Science. The city has an international flair, with about 7,500 foreign students and researchers from as many as 133 countries living in Tsukuba at any one time. Over the past several decades, nearly half of Japan's public research and development budget has been spent in Tsukuba. Important scientific breakthroughs by its researchers include the identification and specification of the molecular structure of superconducting materials, the development of organic optical films that alter their electrical conductivity in response to changing light, and the creation of extreme low-pressure vacuum chambers[citation needed]. Tsukuba has become one of the world's key sites for government-industry collaborations in basic research. Earthquake safety, environmental degradation, studies of roadways, fermentation science, microbiology, and plant genetics are some of the broad research topics having close public-private partnerships. On April 1, 2007 Tsukuba was designated a Special city with increased autonomy. Following the Fukushima I nuclear accidents in 2011, evacuees from the accident zone reported that municipal officials in Tsukuba refused to allow them access to shelters in the city unless they presented certificates from the Fukushima government declaring that the evacuees were \"radiation free\".[7] On May 6, 2012, Tsukuba was struck by a tornado that caused heavy damage to numerous structures and left approximately 20,000 residents without electricity. The storm killed one 14-year-old boy and injured 45 people. The tornado was rated an F-3 by the Japan Meteorological Agency, making it the most powerful tornado to ever hit Japan. Some spots had F-4 damage.[8]"

The idea of constructing the science city was by the late Ichiro Kono, former minister of construction, and Kuniomi Umezawa, former vice minister of the science and technology agency.[11] Another key figure for the development of the Science City is Leo Esaki.[12] What sets Tsukuba apart from other town developments in Japan is the large scale and fast pace of its development into a place with high quality of scientific innovation.[12]"

        "content": "In September 1963, the national government of Japan, led by Ichiro Kono and Kniomi Umezawa, ordered the development of a science city in the area around the mountain Tsukuba.[11] Reasons behind this decision included the overcrowding in Tokyo, the overflow of applicants to Japanese elite universities, a desire of conservative politicians to decrease the influence of liberal teachers and students, and a need to catch up with the West in terms of scientific knowledge.[12] Furthermore, it was already clear that there was a demand for new research facilities and a fresh approach to university education. This fresh approach was prevalent in the United States; therefore, Japan's Ministry of Education decided to transfer a part of the Tokyo University of Education to the Tsukuba area. The campus of the university was modeled after the University of California, San Diego, campus.[12] After a new university structure was introduced; the power of teachers decreased and the power of administrative management increased. Furthermore, the new structure led to better research facilities, a separate independent research department and the implementation of a board for general policies and regulations.[11] In 1966, after a few years of intensive study, the government started the project by buying land in the Tsukuba area.[11] The acquiring of land to build on was done by negotiation over prices between the government and landowners. The parcels of land with the most suitable price were purchased. This is reason for the odd shape of the government-owned land in Tsukuba; it is 18 kilometers long from north to east and 6 kilometers wide from east to west.[11] Due to this shape walking is not common in the city.[12] The building of facilities started in June 1969. The initial building plan was ten years, but in 1980 it became clear that that would not be the case. However, in March 1980 all the facilities that were meant to be built were up and running to a certain extent.[11] Between 1970 and 1980 researchers and their families started to move to Tsukuba. This move was a culture shock for the families from Tokyo due to the dirt roads and open fields in Tsukuba.[12] Initially, Tsukuba was built for travel by car due to having no train station. It was actually Japan's first city that promoted automobile travel over public transport.[12] In 2005, a train station was built in the city.[13] The Tsukuba Express travels from Tokyo to the Science City in 45 minutes.[14] Tsukuba Expo 1985 In order to promote the positive aspects of science and technology, an International Science and Technology Exposition was held. This was a landmark for the science city. The reasons behind the expo were to establish a positive national image of Tsukuba Science City and to gain international recognition that Tsukuba was a place of science. The Expo attracted around 20 million Japanese and foreign visitors.[12]"

        "content": "Leo Esaki  became the president of the University of Tsukuba in 1992.[15] His presidency marked a new era of reform for the Tsukuba Science City. Leo Esaki is a Nobel prize winner and worked at IBM prior to becoming president of the University of Tsukuba. Unlike other Japanese university presidents he had no academic background and no former ties with the University of Tsukuba. This was part of the reason why he was chosen as president. Due to his history in the corporate world, he was able to create a climate were companies and graduate students could work together closely.[15] When the university was founded a good relationship between the students of the university and the nearby companies was expected. However, over the years this ambition disappeared into the background.[15] In these years there was a severe lack in interaction between the facilities of the University and the private companies in the area. This meant that there was no joint research happening.[16] In July 1994, Esaki introduced Tsukuba Advanced Research Alliance (TARA). This is a partnership between the university, foreign researchers, Tsukuba's national research labs, and corporate laboratories based in the city.[12]"

        "header": "Criticism",
        "content": "Tsukuba Science City has faced considerable criticism since its inception. The first criticism on the city was that it was not habitable. Wives of the first researchers were used to putting garbage on the side of the road in order for it to get picked up. However, this was not the case in the mid-1970s. Until that time only farmers had lived there and they would process their own garbage into mulch. Because the garbage did not get picked up, it started smelling in the streets. This enraged the housewives and they demanded a garbage service. In order to meet the demand, a pit was dug where the waste could be dumped until a garbage service would be developed in the city. In the 1990s, Tsukuba had the most innovative garbage system in Japan.[12] Another criticism levied by national government critics is that Tsukuba Science City is a waste of taxpayer's money. They also believe that Tsukuba is an example of government control of academic and research organization. In addition, social critics feel that Tsukuba's social organization is unfavorable as it lacks traditional Japanese culture.[12] Garner describes the city is described as being \u2018flat\u2019 due to a lack of city life.[17] Even though Tsukuba Science City has an impressive number of research and development facilities and various companies, it still is not able to reach the same level of innovation as science cities that do have stimulating city life. In 2006, Tsukuba Science City started focusing on creating more city life to address this problem.[17]"

        "content": "  2014 saw several notable wildfires igniting in California, especially during the month of May, when multiple fires were ablaze concurrently in Southern California, and during September, when several massive wildfires were burning in Northern California. In the context of the 2012\u201313 North American drought (especially the 2011\u201317 California drought), as well as powerful Santa Ana winds, weather conditions were ideal for wildfires. A total of 7,865 wildfires ignited throughout the year, which burned at least 625,540 acres (2,531.5\u00a0km2) of land.[5][1] The wildfires caused a total of 146 injuries and 2 fatalities, in addition to causing at least $204.05 million (2014 USD) in damage. The season began unusually early when a wildfire ignited on January 1, followed by 6 more fires igniting later within the same month. During a heat wave and dry Santa Ana conditions in May 2014, multiple wildfires broke out simultaneously in San Diego County, along with several other wildfires elsewhere in California. By mid-May, fire officials said they had already dealt with 1,400 wildfires in California in 2014 - twice the normal amount for that time of year - and a spokesman for CAL FIRE described the conditions as \"unprecedented.\"[8] The May 2014 San Diego County wildfires were estimated to have caused at least $60 million (2014 USD) in damage.[4] In late June to early August, another group of wildfires ignited across the state, some of which reached over twenty thousand acres in size. In mid-September, the largest group of wildfires erupted, with some wildfires becoming larger than 50,000 acres in size. In early September 2014, the Happy Complex Fire became the largest wildfire of the season, eventually topping out at 135,369 acres (54,782\u00a0ha) in size on September 27. On October 8, an aerial tanker crashed during a firefighting effort at the Dog Rock Fire, which killed the pilot and sparked a small wildfire.[3] From late September to late October, the latest flare-up of major wildfires were extinguished by cooler weather and precipitation. From December 10\u201313, a powerful winter storm extinguished the remaining wildfires that were present. In mid-December through late December, several more small wildfires sparked, but they were all extinguished by December 31. In 2014, a study examined the human role in growing California wildfire risks.[9] The paper is titled \"Extreme fire season in California: A glimpse into the future?\" It was published as the second chapter of \"Explaining Extreme Events of 2014\", by the American Meteorological Society.[10] The authors also projected into the future, and the predicted results showed increases in the drought index, the area under extreme threat of fires, and the days of fire danger, stating that, \"The increase in extreme fire risk is expected within the coming decade to exceed that of natural variability and this serves as an indication that anthropogenic climate warming will likely play a significant role in influence California\u2019s fire season.\"[10]"

        "content": " Hurricane Barry was an asymmetrical Category\u00a01 hurricane that was the wettest tropical cyclone on record in Arkansas and the fourth-wettest in Louisiana. The second tropical or subtropical storm and first hurricane of the 2019 Atlantic hurricane season, Barry originated as a mesoscale convective vortex over southwestern Kansas on July\u00a02. The system eventually emerged into the Gulf of Mexico from the Florida Panhandle on July\u00a010, whereupon the National Hurricane Center (NHC) designated it as a potential tropical cyclone. Early on July\u00a011, the system developed into a tropical depression, and strengthened into a tropical storm later that day. Dry air and wind shear caused most of the convection, or thunderstorms, to be displaced south of the center. Nevertheless, Barry gradually intensified. On July\u00a013, Barry attained its peak intensity as Category 1 hurricane with 1-minute sustained winds of 75\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 993 millibars (29.3\u00a0inHg). At 15:00 UTC, Barry made its first landfall at Marsh Island, and another landfall in Intracoastal City, Louisiana, both times as a Category\u00a01 hurricane. Barry quickly weakened after landfall, falling to tropical depression status on July 15. The storm finally degenerated into a remnant low over northern Arkansas on the same day, subsequently opening up into a trough on July 16. The storm's remnants persisted for another few days, while continuing its eastward motion, before being absorbed into another frontal storm to the south of Nova Scotia on July 19.[1] Barry was one of four hurricanes to strike Louisiana as a Category 1 hurricane in the month of July, the others being Bob in 1979, Danny in 1997, and Cindy in 2005.[2] Numerous tropical storm watches and warnings were issued for Mississippi and Louisiana ahead of the storm. Several states declared state of emergencies ahead of the storm. Though Barry only produced hurricane-force winds in a small area of Louisiana, more than 153,000 customers lost power in the state. As Barry drifted westward over the Gulf of Mexico, storm surge caused widespread coastal flooding in Alabama, Mississippi, and Alabama. The storm's large circulation produced heavy rainfall over a large area, reaching 23.43\u00a0in (595\u00a0mm) near Ragley, Louisiana, and 16.59\u00a0in (421\u00a0mm) near Dierks, Arkansas. The latter value was the highest amount of rainfall recorded in Arkansas related to a tropical cyclone. Many roads, including Interstate highways, were flooded. Dozens of water rescues were carried out in Louisiana and Arkansas, where the most significant flooding occurred. In parts of the Northeastern United States and Ontario, Canada, severe thunderstorms from Barry's remnants caused an additional 160,000 power outages and spawned a few weak tornadoes. The storm caused two fatalities: one in Florida from rip currents, and one in Connecticut from fallen trees and wires.[3][4] Damage from Barry was estimated to be about $600\u00a0million (2019 USD)."

        "header": "Meteorological history",
        "content": "The origins of Barry can be traced to a mesoscale convective vortex \u2013 a complex of thunderstorms \u2013 that formed over southwestern Kansas on July 2.[5] On July\u00a05, the Climate Prediction Center noted the possibility for this disturbance to interact with a trough of low pressure over the Southeastern United States, eventually triggering the formation of a low pressure area over the Gulf of Mexico.[6] The following day, the National Hurricane Center\u00a0(NHC) highlighted a low likelihood of tropical cyclogenesis while the disturbance was still centered well-inland over Tennessee, anticipating that the weather system would track into the northern Gulf of Mexico.[7] Over the next few days, the system drifted southeastward towards Georgia, steered by a low- to mid-level ridge to its west.[5] By July\u00a08, the NHC assessed a high probability of a tropical cyclone developing due to favorable conditions in the Gulf.[8] On July\u00a09, a broad area of low pressure exited the Florida Panhandle and tracked into the northeastern Gulf of Mexico, accompanied by scattered convection. It moved southwestward and curved to the west on the east side of the ridge.[5] On July\u00a010, the NHC initiated advisories on the system as Potential Tropical Cyclone Two, due to its threat the system posed to the United States. At that time, the low pressure area was experiencing some northerly wind shear, which was expected to decrease. Sea surface temperatures of 86\u201388\u00a0\u00b0F (30\u201331\u00a0\u00b0C) allowed the system to gradually organize.[9] At 00:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a011, the system developed into a tropical depression about 200\u00a0mi (320\u00a0km) south of Mobile, Alabama. The depression intensified into Tropical Storm Barry six hours later as the convection had increased to the south of the system's circulation.[5] The storm's convection organized into a large rainband south of an elongated circulation,[10] though mid-level dry air and northerly wind shear prevented thunderstorms from forming near the center.[11][5] On July 12, data from two hurricane hunter reconnaissance aircraft found that Barry had quickly intensified, with its central pressure dropping.[12] Due to a slight decrease in shear on the morning of July 13, the storm's outflow expanded and the banding increased.[13] The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer instrument also found cloud tops colder than \u221280\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221262\u00a0\u00b0C) mostly south of the center.[14] Barry attained Category 1 hurricane status by 12:00\u00a0UTC that day, with a small area of hurricane-force winds occurring east of the center.[15] Simultaneously, the storm reached its peak intensity, with a minimum central pressure of 993 millibars (29.3\u00a0inHg).[5] At 15:00\u00a0UTC that day, Barry made landfall as a Category\u00a01 hurricane on Marsh Island, Louisiana.[16] Barry was one of four hurricanes to hit Louisiana at Category 1 intensity in the month of July, the others being Bob in 1979, Danny in 1997, and Cindy in 2005.[2] The storm quickly weakened after landfall, falling to tropical storm status late on July 13.[17] The storm moved slowly, leading to widespread flooding in Louisiana and Arkansas.[18] Barry further weakened to a tropical depression at 00:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a015 just south of the Louisiana-Arkansas border.[5] Satellite imagery showed that the cyclone had become elongated by that time.[19] At 12:00\u00a0UTC that same day, Barry degenerated into a remnant low over northern Arkansas. The remnant low continued to spin down and degenerated into a trough at 12:00\u00a0UTC a day later, over southern Missouri.[5] Over the next few days, Barry's remnants continued moving northeastward and then eastward, reaching Pennsylvania on July 18 and linking up with a cold front, and moving off the coast of Long Island late that day. On July 19, Barry's remnants were absorbed into another extratropical storm to the south of Nova Scotia.[1]"

The storm forced the closure of popular beaches, including those in Orange Beach and Gulf Shores.[62] In southern Alabama, wind gusts reached 72\u00a0mph (116\u00a0km/h) on Pinto Island.[5] Around 2.8\u00a0ft (0.85\u00a0m) of storm surge was reported in coastal Alabama.[63] Floodwaters from coastal flooding reached several feet deep in some locations, causing beach erosion and leaving behind 3\u00a0ft (0.91\u00a0m) of sand on Bienville Boulevard on Dauphin Island. Floodwaters closed lanes of the Cochrane\u2013Africatown USA Bridge in Mobile.[5][63] The precursor disturbance to Barry caused severe thunderstorms across much of Florida. Numerous trees were blown down due to strong winds from downbursts.[64][65][66] In Garden City, a tree was blown down on Interstate 295 in a microburst.[67] Along the Florida Panhandle, beaches issued warnings to the public to stay out of the water to avoid rip currents and dangerous swimming conditions; however, there were still many calls of swimmers in distress. In Panama City Beach, multiple people formed a human chain in an effort to save swimmers who had gotten caught in a rip current caused by the storm. Authorities performed 38 water rescues. A 67-year-old man drowned in the waters.[3] Barry's large circulation produced gale-force wind gusts along the Gulf Coast as far east Panama City Beach, which recorded gusts of 41\u00a0mph (67\u00a0km/h).[5]"

The fifth named storm and third hurricane of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, Ernesto developed from a tropical wave east of the Leeward Islands. The storm moved towards the Antilles, impacting several nations. Ernesto then turned north, where it reached Category\u00a02 strength, before making landfall in Bermuda as a Category\u00a01 hurricane on August 17. Ernesto then weakened back to a tropical storm before intensifying back into a hurricane and brushing Atlantic Canada, becoming extratropical by August 20. At least three deaths have been tied to Ernesto, all related to rip currents from the hurricane along the East Coast of the United States."

After a brief period of re-intensification throughout August\u00a019, re-strengthening to sustained winds of 90 mph (145 km/h),[13] Ernesto began to weaken once again due to colder sea surface temperatures and environmental conditions becoming unfavorable, as it brushed the coast of Newfoundland.[14] As Ernesto continued to move to the northeast during the middle of August\u00a020, Ernesto became post-tropical as the NHC ceased issuing further advisories on the system.[15] By August\u00a021, Ernesto opened into a trough in the North Atlantic.[16]"

        "content": "  Hurricane Nicole was a sprawling late-season Category\u00a01 hurricane in November 2022. The fourteenth named storm and eighth hurricane of the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season, Nicole formed as a subtropical cyclone on November\u00a07, from a non-tropical area of low pressure near the Greater Antilles, and transitioned into a tropical cyclone the next day. Then, taking a path similar to that of Hurricane Dorian three years earlier,[2] Nicole made landfall on November\u00a09, on Great Abaco and on Grand Bahama in The Bahamas, where it strengthened into a Category\u00a01 hurricane. On November\u00a010, it made landfall twice in Florida, south of Vero Beach and then northwest of Cedar Key, after briefly emerging over the Gulf of Mexico. Nicole then weakened to a depression while moving over the Florida Panhandle, and then was absorbed into a mid-latitude trough and cold front over extreme eastern Tennessee the following day. Nicole became the third November hurricane on record to make landfall in Florida, along with the 1935 Yankee hurricane and Hurricane Kate in 1985.[3] Nicole crossed the same region in Florida devastated six weeks earlier by Hurricane Ian, and was the first hurricane to make landfall on Florida's east coast since Katrina in 2005. Despite being relatively weak, Nicole's large size produced widespread heavy rainfall and strong winds across the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, and Florida, knocking out power and inflicting significant damage in many areas. Days of strong on-shore wind flow onto the east coast of Florida produced severe beach erosion, especially in Volusia, St. Johns, and Flagler counties. Eleven indirect deaths altogether have been connected to the storm, six in the Dominican Republic and five in Florida.[1]"

        "header": "Meteorological history",
        "content": "A mid- to upper-level trough in the westerlies moved from the Mid-Atlantic states into the western Atlantic on November 3.[1] As this disturbance moved southward on November\u00a04, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring the northeastern Caribbean Sea and southwestern Atlantic Ocean where a large non-tropical low-pressure system was expected to develop within a few days.[4] This system then interacted with the Intertropical Convergence Zone over northern South America and on November\u00a05, a broad area of low pressure producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms formed over the Caribbean Sea south of Hispaniola before reforming north of Puerto Rico the next day.[1] Benefitting from the inflow of moist tropical air from the Caribbean Sea and very warm 83\u00a0\u00b0F (28\u00a0\u00b0C) sea surface temperatures, the disturbance was soon exhibiting some subtropical characteristics,[5] and gradually becoming better organized as it moved north-northwestward closer to an upper-level low. This trend continued into the next day, with a sufficiently well-defined center of circulation developing, deep convection increasing and a band of winds with speeds reaching 45\u00a0mph (75\u00a0km/h) occurring to the east of the center.[1][6] Convective organization continued to increase and at 06:00\u00a0UTC on November\u00a07, the disturbance developed into Subtropical Storm Nicole while located about 470\u00a0nmi (870\u00a0km) south-southwest of Bermuda.[1] After forming, Nicole moved erratically northwestward due to southeasterly flow on the west side of a low- to mid-level ridge as the low-level center became vertically stacked with the upper-level low. The next day (November 8), Nicole made a sharp left turn to the west-southwest due to a cold front with a low- to mid-level anticyclone to the north of it moving into the western Atlantic north of Nicole. During this time, Nicole strengthened as its inner-core convection improved and the radius of its maximum winds contracted, which resulted in the system transitioning to a tropical cyclone at 18:00\u00a0UTC.[1] Although its radius of its maximum winds became smaller, Nicole's interaction with the anticyclone caused its tropical storm wind field in the northern quadrant to grow and by November\u00a010, this wind field had grown to over 400\u00a0nmi (740\u00a0km) from the center in the northeastern quadrant.[1] Early on November\u00a09, Nicole reached its initial peak intensity with sustained winds 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 984 mbar (hPa; 29.06\u00a0inHg).[1] Strengthening was then halted when mid- to upper-level dry air entrained into the core of Nicole, disrupting the central convection and briefly weakening the storm as it continued moving west-southwestward. This weakening would be short-lived, however, and convection began to reform near the center later that day and a large, ragged eye began to form as Nicole turned westward.[7][8] At 17:00\u00a0UTC, Nicole made landfall at Marsh Harbour, Great Abaco Island, with sustained winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 985\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.09\u00a0inHg).[1] Continuing westward, the storm strengthened into a Category\u00a01 hurricane while simultaneously making landfall on Grand Bahama at 23:00\u00a0UTC that same day with sustained winds of 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 980 mbar (hPa; 28.94\u00a0inHg). This would be Nicole's peak intensity as another intrusion of dry air disrupted the storm's core convection again and prevented it from strengthening any further.[1] At 07:45\u00a0UTC on the following morning (November\u00a010), Nicole made landfall on Vero Beach, Florida, with the same strength. The NHC noted that sampling issues led to uncertainty about the minimum pressure and stated that it could have been lower. They also stated that although Nicole made landfall as a hurricane, the hurricane-force winds were in the northeastern eyewall and likely never made it to the Florida coast as the storm weakened to a tropical storm shortly after landfall.[1] Nicole continued to weaken as it turned northwestward across the Florida peninsula, though it remained well organized, with tropical storm-force winds extending out 345\u00a0mi (555\u00a0km) to the northeast of its center. As a result, heavy rains fell across central and northern Florida and southeast Georgia.[9] Later that day, a little before 18:00\u00a0UTC, Nicole emerged over the Gulf of Mexico, near Homosassa, Florida. It then made another brief landfall at 19:00\u00a0UTC at Cedar Key, in Florida's Big Bend region with sustained winds of 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h).[10] The storm continued to weaken as it moved northwestward just offshore before making its final landfall at 00:00\u00a0UTC on November 11 at the mouth of the Aucilla River with sustained winds of 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h).[1] Nicole weakened to a depression six hours later as it moved into southwest Georgia.[1][11] Nicole then turned northward and traversed western Georgia between an Atlantic high and a mid-latitude trough and cold front approaching from the west. Later that day, after turning northeastward and moving over extreme western North Carolina into eastern Tennessee, Nicole degenerated into a remnant low at 18:00\u00a0UTC before quickly being absorbed into the mid-latitude system shortly thereafter.[1]"

Nearly 50 coastal condominiums, single-family homes and hotels in Volusia County, previously damaged by Hurricane Ian six weeks earlier, collapsed or were put at danger of collapsing due to severe beach erosion caused by the two storms.[44] Additionally, in St. Johns County, the surging ocean damaged a 6-to-7\u00a0mi-long (9.7-to-11.3\u00a0km) section of State Road A1A and flooded parts of St. Augustine.[45] In neighboring Flagler County, A1A collapsed for a second time since Ian due to the dunes being eroded.[46] An initial cost estimate of property damage in Volusia and Flagler counties combined exceeds $500\u00a0million.[34] On the morning of November\u00a010, the ocean water level in Jacksonville was 3.58\u00a0ft (1.09\u00a0m) above high tide, surpassing the record of 3.21\u00a0ft (0.98\u00a0m) set by Hurricane Matthew in 2016.[9] Storm surge of 1 to 2\u00a0ft (0.61\u00a0m) also occurred on the western coast of the Florida, causing minor impacts.[1] There were five indirect deaths in Florida as a result of Nicole. Two people were killed after being electrocuted by downed power lines in Conway.[47] Two people were killed in a crash on Florida's Turnpike.[48] Another person was found dead in Cocoa on a yacht.[33] While the strongest sustained winds of Nicole likely weakened below hurricane force before reaching the coast, wind gusts at or near hurricane strength were recorded at multiple weather stations as Nicole came ashore, including 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h) at Port St. John and 72\u00a0mph (116\u00a0km/h) at Melbourne; inland, a wind gust of 66\u00a0mph (106\u00a0km/h) was recorded at Orlando.[1] The highest wind gust, 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h), was recorded atop Launch Complex 39B at the Kennedy Space Center, where Artemis\u00a01 was on the pad.[49] The rocket suffered minor damage, but was cleared for launch by NASA following repairs, and was successfully launched on November\u00a016.[50][51] Human remains at what is believed to be a Native American burial site on South Hutchinson Island were unearthed by storm erosion, near the point of landfall. Previously, hurricanes Dorian, in 2019, and Sandy, in 2012, unearthed centuries old bones of Native Americans in that same general area.[52] Much of Florida experienced heavy rains, gusty winds, and power outages as Nicole moved across the state.

The first tropical cyclone and first tropical storm of the 1960 Atlantic hurricane season, this system developed from an area of showers and thunderstorms in the Bay of Campeche on June\u00a022. Initially a tropical depression, it strengthened and was estimated to have reached tropical storm status on June\u00a023. Early on the following day, the storm peaked with winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h). Later that day, it made landfall near Corpus Christi, Texas, at the same intensity. The storm weakened slowly and moved across the Central United States, before dissipating over Illinois on June\u00a028. In Texas, the storm dropped up to 29.76 inches (756\u00a0mm) of precipitation in Port Lavaca. Thus considerable flooding occurred in some areas of south and eastern Texas. Throughout the state, more than 150\u00a0houses sustained flood damage in several counties. In addition, numerous major highways were closed, including portions of U.S. Routes 59, 87, 90, and then-185, and Texas State Highways 35 and 71. In Arkansas, a few buildings in Hot Springs were damaged from high winds. Flooding in that state resulted in three deaths from drowning. Light to moderate rainfall was recorded in at least 11\u00a0other states, though damage was minimal.[clarification needed] The storm was the rainiest tropical cyclone on record in the state of Kentucky, dropping 11.25 inches (286\u00a0mm) in Dunmor. Overall, 18\u00a0fatalities were attributed to the storm and $3.6\u00a0million (1960\u00a0USD) in damage was reported."

A reconnaissance flight into the system on June\u00a022 did not indicate a closed circulation. However, weather stations in Mexico reported a circulation and thus,[1] it is estimated that the first tropical depression of the season developed at 0600\u00a0UTC on June\u00a022. Early on June\u00a023, barometric pressures in from Tampico, Tamaulipas to Brownsville, Texas had significantly decreased, which indicated that the tropical cyclone was moving generally northward.[2] Shortly thereafter, another reconnaissance flight into the depression indicated winds of only 20\u00a0mph (32\u00a0km/h) and a barometric pressure of 1,006\u00a0mbar (29.7\u00a0inHg). However, the plane may not have flown under the most intense convection.[1] The depression gradually strengthened, and by 0600\u00a0UTC on June\u00a023, it reached tropical storm status.[2] Over Texas, airborne radars and the Dow Chemical Company radar in Freeport indicated curved convective banding associated with the storm. Though no wall cloud was reported, the Kelly Air Force Base reported a cloud center.[1] The storm continued to intensify, peaking with winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) by 0000\u00a0UTC on June\u00a024.[2] At 0400\u00a0UTC that day, the tropical storm made landfall near Corpus Christi, Texas.[1][2] After moving inland, the storm quickly weakened back to a tropical depression. Over the following 24\u00a0hours, the depression executed a small cyclonic loop over southern Texas. On June\u00a026, the depression accelerated to the north-northeast, and eventually dissipated over northern Illinois on June\u00a029 at 0000\u00a0UTC.[2]"

With a ridge of high pressure located over the southeastern United States, the depression continued tracking generally westward and intensified into Tropical Storm Elena late on August 30.[2] Elena was the sixth tropical storm of the season, as Hurricane Frederic attained tropical storm status six hours prior to Elena.[3] Unfavorable northerly vertical wind shear persisted through much of Elena's duration, which prohibited the development of convection.[4] An approaching frontal trough weakened the high pressure system to its north, which resulted in Elena turning northwestward toward the Texas coastline. The storm remained poorly organized, failing to strengthen further, and on September 1 it made landfall on Matagorda Island as a minimal tropical storm. The cyclone rapidly weakened after moving ashore, and early on September 2 Elena degenerated into a remnant low pressure area over southeastern Texas.[2] Trapped between two high pressure systems, the remnant mid-level circulation drifted southwestward just inland for several days before dissipating on September 6.[5]"

The ship was nearly split in half from the lightning strike, and oil seeped into Houston Ship Channel for several hours.

Bulgaria suffered the most damage from the storm, with $4.4 million alone incurred from losses in the country. Additionally, the Ivanovo Dam in Bulgaria burst during the deluge, flooding the village of Bisser downstream with 2.5 meters (8 feet) of water. In Bulgaria, the city of Svilengrad was also flooded after a dike collapsed near the village of Generalovo.[1] In Greece, the hardest-hit areas were located in the northeast of the country, where Evros River burst its banks and submerged multiple villages.[1] Cyclone Julia also worsened the effects of a major cold wave across Europe and North Africa, leading to more property damage and deaths.

A pre-season storm, it developed initially as a subtropical cyclone from a non-tropical low on April 20 to the west of Bermuda. It tracked east-southeastward and organized, and on April 21 it transitioned into a tropical cyclone with peak winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h). Tropical Storm Ana turned east-northeastward, steadily weakening due to wind shear and an approaching cold front, and on April 24 it became an extratropical cyclone. The storm brushed Bermuda with light rain, and its remnants produced precipitation in the Azores and the United Kingdom. Swells generated by the storm capsized a boat along the Florida coastline, causing two fatalities."

        "content": "Ana was the earliest subtropical or tropical storm to form in an Atlantic hurricane season since 1978.[1] It developed from a non-tropical low pressure area that formed about 240 miles (390\u00a0km) south-southwest of Bermuda on April\u00a018 through the interaction of an upper-level trough and a surface frontal trough.[2] The trough, which extended from the gale center to Hispaniola, brought a plume of moisture northward from the Caribbean Sea into the circulation, which caused heavy rainfall in Puerto Rico.[3] The non-tropical low tracked generally northward,[2] with a ridge to its east and west,[4] and on April 19 the system began producing sporadic convection near its center; early that day, satellite imagery indicated the presence of a tight inner core of winds. After turning to the northwest, it looped southeastward and gradually became separated from the surface frontal system,[2] due to the deepening of the upper-level trough over the system.[5] Convection became better organized over the center, and it is estimated the system developed into Subtropical Storm Ana early on April 20 while located about 250 miles (400\u00a0km) west of Bermuda.[2] Operationally, the subtropical cyclone was not classified by the National Hurricane Center until 21\u00a0hours later.[6] The subtropical storm tracked east-southeastward and continued to organize, and by late on April 20 an upper-level warm core was present over the system. Based on its organization, Ana is estimated to have become a tropical storm by 0000\u00a0UTC on April 21. Upon becoming a tropical storm, Ana attained a peak intensity of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h), which was based on estimates from the Hebert-Poteat technique and data from QuikSCAT. Shortly thereafter, it made its closest point of approach to Bermuda, when it passed about 130 miles (210\u00a0km) southwest of the island.[2] Operationally, the cyclone was first classified by the National Hurricane Center around this time, when it was considered a subtropical cyclone.[6] Strong upper-level wind shear removed much of the convection,[7] though a small area of thunderstorms persisted near the center.[8] The storm became completely separated from the upper-level system,[9] and the cyclone re-organized, developing an eye feature late on April 21. Embedded within the flow of a cyclone to its north, Ana continued eastward,[10] and early on April 22 the wind shear again removed the convection from the center.[11] Convection waxed and waned throughout the day,[12] and by April 23 the circulation had deteriorated in organization.[13] After turning to the northeast, the circulation center merged with an approaching cold front on April 24, and Tropical Storm Ana completed the transition into an extratropical cyclone. The extratropical storm accelerated east-northeastward before losing its identity within the frontal zone on April 27 southeast of the Azores.[2]"

Winds on the island did not reach tropical storm force.[16] Swells from the storm impacted the coast of Florida.[2] The combination of the swells and an outgoing tide caused a boat to capsize in Jupiter Inlet on April 20; two of its occupants drowned, and the other two were rescued.[17] As an extratropical storm, the remnants of Ana dropped 0.87 inches (22\u00a0mm) of precipitation in the city of Ponta Delgada in the Azores. Moisture from the remnants of Ana also produced beneficial rainfall in the United Kingdom.[18] Two ships recorded tropical storm force winds in association with Ana; the Atlantic Forest recorded 51\u00a0mph (82\u00a0km/h) and a pressure of 998\u00a0mbar on April 22, and the Rosa Delmas reported winds of 47\u00a0mph (76\u00a0km/h) on April 23.[2]"

They also helped dig basic latrines as a stopgap measure for people sheltering in community schools.[20] The local government distributed food rations and cooking oil as well as money (2,000 Central African Francs).[20] After years of repeated flooding, in 2012, the Niger government, with support from the World Bank, launched the PGCR-DU (Projet de Gestion des Risques de Catastrophes et de D\u00e9veloppement Urbain).

The storm reached peak maximum sustained winds of 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph) on May\u00a013, making it a very severe cyclonic storm according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), which is the official Regional Specialized Meteorological Center for the basin.[2] The cyclone drifted north over the central Bay of Bengal, gradually weakening due to heightened wind shear. Turning eastward, the storm deteriorated to a deep depression on May 16 before it curved northeastward and re-intensified into a cyclonic storm. It came ashore in western Myanmar and dissipated over land the following day. In the wake of prolonged precipitation during the first half of May, the cyclone produced torrential rains across southwest Sri Lanka while stationary in the central Bay of Bengal. The storm drew extensive moisture that coalesced in the mountainous portion of the island. A station at Ratnapura recorded 366.1\u00a0mm (14.41\u00a0in) of rainfall in 18\u00a0hours on May\u00a017, including 99.8\u00a0mm (3.93\u00a0in) in one hour. In southwestern Sri Lanka, the rainfall caused flooding and landslides that destroyed 24,750\u00a0homes and damaged 32,426\u00a0others, displacing about 800,000\u00a0people. Overall damage totaled about $135\u00a0million (2003\u00a0USD),[nb 1] and there were 260\u00a0deaths. The cyclone also produced some rainfall in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands of India and along the country's eastern coast. The storm funneled moisture away from the mainland, which possibly contributed to a heat wave that killed 1,900\u00a0people, and dropped heavy rainfall in Myanmar."

        "content": "Around May\u00a06, the monsoon trough extended across the southern Bay of Bengal, producing a vast field of thunderstorm activity.[3] A broad low-pressure area formed by the next day and remained nearly stationary.[3][4] Over the next few days, the convection varied in intensity until becoming more organized around the nascent surface low on May\u00a010.[3] At 03:00\u00a0UTC on May\u00a010, the India Meteorological Department (IMD)[nb 2] reported the formation of a depression about 535\u00a0km (330\u00a0mi) west of Banda Aceh, Indonesia. Within nine hours, the depression further intensified into a deep depression.[4] Around the same time, the system was classified as Tropical Cyclone 01B by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.[6][nb 3] With warm sea surface temperatures, a formidable anticyclone aloft,[3] and low wind shear, the system continued to mature as it tracked northwestward.[6] Early on May\u00a011, the deep depression strengthened into a cyclonic storm \u2013 marked by maximum sustained winds of at least 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph)[nb 4] \u2013 and later in the day into a severe cyclonic storm.[4] Simultaneously, the system was driven toward the north by a ridge of high pressure to the northeast.[6] At the time, the cyclone was located about 700\u00a0km (430\u00a0mi) east of Sri Lanka.[9] The storm continued to intensify, becoming a very severe cyclonic storm on May\u00a012.[4] That day, the JTWC upgraded Tropical Cyclone 01B to the equivalence of a minimal hurricane with winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph).[3][nb 5] In post-season analysis, however, the agency revised the storm's maximum winds to 110\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph).[6] At 06:00\u00a0UTC on May\u00a013, the IMD estimated that the storm attained peak winds of 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph).[11] The intensity estimate was based on a satellite-derived Dvorak number of 4.5, limited chiefly by the lack of an eye feature.[4] After peaking in intensity, the storm began weakening due to increasing easterly wind shear from the ridge to the north, displacing the center of circulation from the deepest convection.[3][6] Early on May\u00a014, the IMD downgraded the storm to a severe cyclonic storm.[4] Around this time, steering currents slackened, and the cyclone meandered northward over the central Bay of Bengal. By late on May\u00a014, convection had largely dissipated, with the exception of a small area near the center,[3] and the system weakened to minimal cyclonic storm status. Thunderstorm activity continued to wax and wane as the storm turned to the southeastward, though persistent hostile conditions caused the storm to weaken further to a deep depression on May\u00a016. As the nearby ridge translated eastward, the depression was able to move more steadily to the east and later to the northeast, passing northwest of the Andaman Islands on May\u00a018.[3][11] On the next day, the deep depression re-intensified into a cyclonic storm, reaching a secondary peak with winds of 85\u00a0km/h (55\u00a0mph).[4][11] At about 10:00\u00a0UTC on May\u00a019, the storm made landfall close to Kyaukpyu, Ramree Island, in western Myanmar.[3][6] The storm rapidly weakened into a depression and later degenerated into a low-pressure area on May\u00a020,[4] and was no longer discernible on satellite imagery by the next day.[3]"

        "content": "Due to the significant distance between Sri Lanka and the Bay of Bengal storm, no cyclone warnings were posted. The India-based National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting anticipated the flood event three days in advance.[12] However, the Sri Lankan government did not issue the first flood warnings until May\u00a017, the same day that the flooding began. Many residents learned about the impending floods through loudspeakers and word of mouth, although some were alerted by television or radio. About 8,000\u00a0people evacuated on May\u00a018, utilizing schools and public buildings as emergency shelters. The precipitation occurred in the wake of an already rainy period; a station near the Kalu River reported over 600\u00a0mm (24\u00a0in) of rainfall in the first 15\u00a0days of May.[13] While the storm was nearly stationary in the central Bay of Bengal, the southwesterly flow drew abundant moisture over Sri Lanka to produce severe flooding. In the island's mountainous southwestern portion, the winds across the island produced heavy rainfall rates through a process known as orographic lift, mostly occurring on May\u00a017\u201318. Throughout May 2003, the highest rainfall in the country was 899\u00a0mm (35.4\u00a0in) at Gonapenigala Iranganie Estate. A station at Ratnapura recorded 718\u00a0mm (28.3\u00a0in) of precipitation in the month,[9] of which 366.1\u00a0mm (14.41\u00a0in) fell over an 18\u2011hour period on May\u00a017; at the same station, there was a peak hourly rainfall total of 99.8\u00a0mm (3.93\u00a0in).[13] These were the heaviest rains on the island since 1947.[14] Rainfall was primarily concentrated in southwestern Sri Lanka, with a rain shadow farther inland that resulted in minimal precipitation in and Matale.[9] After the Kalu River overflowed, floodwaters reached 3\u00a0m (9.8\u00a0ft) deep in Ratnapura City, submerging the first floors of most homes and persisting for about three days. Landslides created a temporary natural dam on the river that washed away a bridge when it broke. Along the Gin River, flood waters inundated the surrounding terrain up to 2\u00a0m (6.6\u00a0ft) deep, covered roadways, and complicated evacuations.[13] In Hambantota District, the inundation occurred after an ongoing drought, which amplified flood-related damage.[15] Although the flooding was severe in the southwestern portion of Sri Lanka, effects were minimal in the central and north-central regions, and there was no severe flooding in the capital city of Colombo.[16] Since the previously wet conditions had saturated soils,[13] the rains related to the cyclone caused severe flooding and landslides, mostly in Ratnapura and Nuwara Eliya districts.[17][18] A landslide in Batugoda killed 81\u00a0people,[19] and at least 125\u00a0people died in Ratnapura.[20] The floods increased river levels in Hambantota, Matara, Galle, and Kalutara districts, persisting until May\u00a030 in Matara.[18] Many roads were damaged, including the one that links Ratnapura to Colombo.[14] About 100\u00a0schools were destroyed and another 200 were damaged,[21] and some health facilities lost their equipment.[22] Flooding from the cyclone destroyed 53,300 hectares (132,000 acres) of tea crops,[18] representing an estimated 20\u201330% loss for the year in the low country.[12] Farmers in the affected areas also lost some of their rice paddies to the high waters,[16] although only about 3% of the rice crop in the region was damaged, so no impact on the rice harvest was expected.[23] Many areas lost electricity and telephone service,[15] and there were disruptions to food and water supplies.[24] Throughout Sri Lanka, the floods destroyed at least 24,750\u00a0homes and damaged 32,426\u00a0others,[21] displacing about 800,000\u00a0people,[25] many of whom lost everything they owned.[26] Total damage was estimated at $135\u00a0million (2003\u00a0USD),[27] primarily to homes and roads.[13] Across the island, floods related to the cyclone killed 260\u00a0people.[12] Most of the deaths were along the nation's southern coast where the floods occurred, primarily along the Kalu River, and were mainly farmers. Levees helped drain floodwaters where systems were already in place.[13]"

        "content": "In its formative stages, the storm produced moderate rainfall in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, totaling 70\u00a0mm (2.8\u00a0in) at Mayabunder. Later, as the storm was approaching Myanmar, it dropped 89\u00a0mm (3.5\u00a0in) of rainfall on Hut Bay.[4] Several stations in Tamil Nadu reported light precipitation, including a total of 98\u00a0mm (3.9\u00a0in) at Adirampattinam.[3] Along the coast of Odisha, the fringes of the cyclonic storm dropped light rainfall, reaching 53\u00a0mm (2.1\u00a0in) at Swampatna.[4] As the storm made landfall in Myanmar, it produced heavy rainfall in Rakhine State, signalling an early start to the monsoon season.[28] The slow movement of the storm altered the atmospheric flow over southeastern India. It replaced the easterly maritime winds over southeast coast of India(TN and AP) and brought dry northwesterly winds from the North India which brought heatwave like conditions along North TN and South AP. Due to this, Chennai recorded 45C on May 31 breaking a record of 44.1C set in 1998. According to the IMD, the cyclone \"might have caused the severe heat wave conditions prevailing over the coastal Andhra Pradesh\" from May into early June, killing up to 1,400\u00a0people,[4] and increasing air temperatures to 50\u00a0\u00b0C (122\u00a0\u00b0F).[29]"

        "content": "In the immediate aftermath of the flooding in Sri Lanka, the country's air force, army, and navy, as well as police forces, operated search and rescue missions. The navy and air force collected residents stranded in trees and on roofs,[16] and were later assisted by the Indian military.[24] However, the lack of electricity and the damaged infrastructure hampered relief work.[30] In the hardest hit area of Ratnapura, there was a shortage of doctors, prompting officials to request help from adjacent towns.[16] There were increased reports of diarrhea, viral flu, and typhoid in the aftermath of the floods.[25] Mobile health crews treated over 44,000\u00a0residents, which helped reduce the spread of disease.[26] Residents in one village went without food for three days, and in the storm's aftermath, many were also without access to clean water.[31] By May\u00a019, flooding had begun to recede in the worst affected areas, allowing workers to repair roads.[14] The government released RS6\u00a0million (LKR, US$62,500) for immediate relief, and also provided RS15,000 (LKR, US$156) toward funeral expenses for each death.[14] From May 22\u201325, the country's legislature had reduced sessions so members could return to their districts.[32] By the end of May 2003, the government had allocated RS17.29\u00a0million (LKR, US$180,000) for relief measures,[25] including RS27,000 (LKR US$280) for each family to rebuild houses.[33] The Sri Lankan government also set up a four-person task force to manage flood relief.[14] The local Red Cross chapter utilized emergency supplies to distribute 10,000\u00a0food packages while also deploying trained volunteers to assist in the disaster areas.[15] The Red Cross ultimately distributed about 26,000\u00a0loaves of bread, 862\u00a0kg (1,900\u00a0lb) of sugar, and 1,775\u00a0kg (3,913\u00a0lb) of rice, among other supplies.[26] By May\u00a020, the Sri Lankan air force had distributed 35\u00a0tons of food, using eight helicopters to airdrop parcels.[24] Red Cross workers cleaned hundreds of contaminated wells in the region, thereby restoring clean water access;[34] this task was finished by August.[35] By May\u00a016, or nine days after the floods began, power was restored to about 95% of areas, and roads were gradually rebuilt.[36] Road access to most villages was restored by May\u00a026, with the exception of Matara. There, the ongoing floods prompted officials to close schools to reduce the spread of disease.[33] After the floods largely subsided, the World Socialist Web Site criticized the Sri Lankan government for not having better disaster management in place, as well as noting that deforestation and gem mining contributed to the landslides.[25] A Red Cross report in August 2003 noted the swift work to bring relief to the affected citizens, while also commenting that the floods displayed the country's problems with disaster mitigation.[35] On May\u00a019, the Red Cross launched an appeal to the international community for assistance.[14] A day prior, the Red Cross allocated CHF50,000 to buy relief supplies, while the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs provided a $50,000 grant.[19] In the days after the floods, the government of India sent a ship with inflatable dinghies and medical supplies.[16] A total of 18\u00a0countries or local Red Crosses sent Fr.2.3\u00a0million CHF worth of cash to Sri Lanka.[35] Sweden sent kr800,000 (2003 SEK) toward relief transport and distribution.[31] The government of Japan sent \u00a519.8\u00a0million yen worth of tents, sheets, and other supplies to the country,[37] The Iranian Red Cross sent $65,625 (USD) worth of blankets and tents to Sri Lanka,[38] which helped about 240\u00a0families.[35] Australia's government sent about $400,000 (AUD) to UNICEF to help rebuild the damaged schools and other social services.[39] The European Community Humanitarian Aid Office donated about \u20ac800,000 (US$944,000) to the country.[33] The World Food Programme distributed meals to about 10,000\u00a0families, while the World Health Organization provided water purification tablets, typhoid vaccines, and health kits to about 100,000\u00a0people.[40] During a peace agreement amid the ongoing civil war, the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka sent trucks with clothing and food to the affected areas.[41] In July 2004, the Asian Development Bank provided $12.5\u00a0million of the $17.5\u00a0million needed to repair the damaged infrastructure, while the Sri Lankan government provided the remaining $5\u00a0million.[42]"

        "content": " Hurricane Iota was a devastating late-season tropical cyclone which caused severe damage to areas of Central America already devastated by Hurricane Eta just less than two weeks prior. The 31st and final tropical cyclone, 30th named storm, 14th hurricane, and record-tying seventh major hurricane of the record-breaking 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, Iota originated as a tropical wave that moved into the Eastern Caribbean on November\u00a010. Over the next few days, the wave began to become better organized and by November\u00a013, it developed into a tropical depression north of Colombia. The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Iota six hours later. The storm was initially impacted by some wind shear, but a center relocation and relaxed shear allowed Iota to quickly strengthen into a hurricane on November\u00a015, after which it underwent explosive intensification, peaking as a high-end Category\u00a04 hurricane, with wind speeds of 155\u00a0mph (249\u00a0km/h). After weakening slightly, Iota made landfall in northeastern Nicaragua as a mid-range Category\u00a04 hurricane, becoming the strongest recorded hurricane to make landfall in Nicaragua in November. Iota then rapidly weakened as it moved inland, dissipating on November\u00a018. Iota's precursor disturbance generated flash flooding on several Caribbean islands. Tropical cyclone watches and warnings were first issued on November\u00a014 in parts of Colombia, Nicaragua, and Honduras, with the latter two countries still recovering from Eta. Heavy rains associated with a tropical wave and Iota brought heavy rainfall to parts of Colombia, leading to flash flooding and mudslides. Extremely heavy rain fell on much of Nicaragua, widening flash flooding caused by the hurricane's high storm surge. Mudslides caused extensive damage and multiple deaths. At least\u00a067 people were killed due to Iota, including at least\u00a028 in Nicaragua and\u00a016 in Honduras, among other countries.[1][2][3][4] As many as 41 people were reported as missing. The preliminary estimate for the damage in Nicaragua was $564 million (2020 USD).[5] Total damage estimates for the hurricane were set at $1.4 billion (2020 USD).[6] Relief efforts soon followed, which included placing tents, opening temporary hospitals, and delivering food and water to those in need. Numerous power outages were restored in the days that followed. Donations worth hundreds of millions of USD were given to affected countries. An estimated total of 5.2\u00a0million people were affected by the storm.[7]"

        "content": "On October 30, a tropical wave emerged from the west coast of Africa into the Atlantic. For the next several days, the tropical wave moved westward, while producing disorganized thunderstorms mainly east of the wave's axis.[8] At 18:00\u00a0UTC on November\u00a08, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began to monitor the tropical wave in their tropical weather outlooks, as the system was forecasted to enter the area and potentially become a low-pressure area within a few days.[9] The wave subsequently entered the Eastern Caribbean by 06:00\u00a0UTC on November\u00a010 and moved westward into a more conducive environment for development.[10][11] Late on November\u00a011, the wave started to become better organized, and by 15:00\u00a0UTC on November\u00a013, it had developed into Tropical Depression Thirty-One in the southern Caribbean, tying 2005 for the most tropical depressions recorded in one season.[11][12][13] Six hours later, the system strengthened into Tropical Storm Iota.[14] After struggling somewhat due to wind shear and dry air, Iota began to rapidly intensify over warm waters late on November\u00a014, as convection started to wrap around the storm's center.[15] At 06:00\u00a0UTC on November\u00a015, Iota reached hurricane status, before strengthening to Category\u00a02 status at 00:00\u00a0UTC on November\u00a016.[16][17] By 06:00\u00a0UTC on November\u00a016, hurricane hunters discovered that Iota had become a high-end Category\u00a03 major hurricane, marking the first time that two major hurricanes were recorded in November.[18] They also found intense lightning in Iota's southwest eyewall along with hail, which is extremely rare for a hurricane due to the warm temperatures that are present in those storms.[19][20][21] Just 40\u00a0minutes later, at 06:40\u00a0UTC, Iota reached Category\u00a04 intensity.[22] At 15:00\u00a0UTC, Iota intensified further to reach its peak intensity as a high-end Category\u00a04 hurricane, with 1-minute sustained winds of 155\u00a0mph (249\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 917\u00a0mbar (27.1\u00a0inHg), making it the second most intense Category 4 hurricane in the Atlantic basin behind Hurricane Opal.[8] Operationally, the peak winds were estimated at 160\u00a0mph (260\u00a0km/h), making Iota a Category\u00a05 hurricane. However, in the yearly post-season analysis, Iota was downgraded to a Category\u00a04 hurricane, due to some questionable SFMR readings produced by the reconnaissance flight, as well as a recalibration of the SFMR values.[8] After peaking in intensity, Iota weakened somewhat as it crossed over the cold wake created by Hurricane Eta two weeks prior.[23] At 03:40\u00a0UTC November\u00a017, Iota made landfall along the northeastern coast of Nicaragua, near the town of Haulover, with sustained winds of 145\u00a0mph (233\u00a0km/h) and a central pressure of 921\u00a0mbar (27.2\u00a0inHg). Iota's landfall location was approximately 15 miles (24\u00a0km) south of where Hurricane Eta made landfall on November\u00a03.[24] This also made Iota the strongest hurricane in recorded history to make landfall in Nicaragua within November.[25] Iota then rapidly weakened as it moved over the mountainous terrain of Central America, falling below Category\u00a03 major hurricane status at 09:00\u00a0UTC on November\u00a017, and below Category\u00a01 hurricane status at 18:00\u00a0UTC.[26][27] The inner core of the weakening system was disrupted as it moved through Honduras, and Iota weakened to a tropical depression at 09:00\u00a0UTC on November\u00a018, as it entered El Salvador.[28][29] Six hours after this downgrade, Iota's low-level circulation center dissipated, and the NHC issued their final advisory on Iota.[30][8]"

Seawater rose up to 9.8\u00a0ft (3\u00a0m). Powerful winds uprooted numerous trees, some of which fell on homes, and several homes lost their roof.[53][62] Communications with San Andr\u00e9s were temporarily lost during the storm and approximately 60 percent of the island lost power. Flooding reached a depth of 6\u00a0in (15\u00a0cm) at the Gustavo Rojas Pinilla International Airport, preventing usage of the runways.[62] One person was killed on the island.[59]"

Damage reports, however, were extremely limited due to damage the area sustained previously from Hurricane Eta. These reports were also limited due to most communications to Puerto Cabezas being knocked out during the storm.[64] An amateur radio from Club de Radio-Experimentadores de Nicaragua (CREN) reported winds of 124\u00a0mph (200\u00a0km/h) winds and damaged roofs, although it was unclear whether these were sustained winds or wind gusts.[26] The roof was torn off of a makeshift hospital that was serving as a replacement to an older hospital, requiring an evacuation of the patients there.[65] A total of 160,233\u00a0homes lost power in Nicaragua and 47,638\u00a0families lost water service. The Instituto Nicarag\u00fcense de Telecomunicaciones y Correos|es reported loss of telephone service to 35 communities.[66] Torrential rains on already saturated soils led to extensive flooding and landslides. A storm surge of at least 26 feet (7.9\u00a0m) occurred near the town of Haulover and further north near the community of Wawa Bar.[67] At least 28 people died in relation to the hurricane while 29 others are missing.[4] Two children were swept away by a river in Santa Teresa, Carazo, while three other members of their family went missing; a sixth family member was rescued. A landslide killed two people in Wiwil\u00ed de Jinotega and another person died in Quilal\u00ed. In Wiwil\u00ed, fears arose over the safety of residents who evacuated into the mountains to escape flooding as numerous landslides occurred in the region.[37] On November 17, at least 30 people were buried in a landslide in Macizo de Penas Blancas, and a boy was found buried. The next day, four more bodies were recovered, including one of a baby.[68] On November 23 a passenger truck plunged off a road in a mountainous area that had been devastated by Iota, an accident which caused the deaths of 17 people and 25 injuries.[69] A preliminary damage estimate places the damages at 12.3 billion c\u00f3rdobas (US$352.5 million).[5]"

Mudslides and uprooted trees were also reported in portions of the country.[71] La Ceiba, Honduras reported a wind gust of 58\u00a0mph (93\u00a0km/h).[72] At least 16 people have died and one other is missing as a result of impacts from Iota in Honduras.[2] Landslides were the primary cause of fatalities; one in San Manuel Colohete killed eight people and another in Los Trapiches killed five people.[2] Teonela Paisano Wood, the mayor of Brus Laguna, stated concerns that continued rainfall pose a large threat to the town. Various concrete and wooden houses were reduced to rubble.[73] As of the morning of November\u00a018, COPECO reported 366,123 people were directly affected by the hurricane.[2] 80% of Cop\u00e1n Ruinas' roads were rendered impassible due to mudslides and flash flooding.

The broad area of convection dominated the region between Swan Island and western Cuba by July 18. Some sources state that the area of convection was joined by a low-level vortex that entered the area, eventually forming a depression. Others believe that the origins of Becky can be tracked back to a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa on July 9.[1]\nA tropical depression formed on July 19, 1970. As the depression moved through the Yucat\u00e1n Channel, the convective cloud system became better organized. On July 20, in light of data from a Reconnaissance Aircraft flight, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Becky.[2] The storm moved roughly northward under the influence of the Bermuda High to the east and a low-pressure area over Mexico.[2] Reports from a Reconnaissance flight indicated that Becky was disorganized, with a minimum barometric pressure of 1,008\u00a0mbar (29.8\u00a0inHg).[3] Although a fairly strong low-level circulation developed, there was insufficient warming of the center to produce a significant drop in barometric pressure at the surface. Late on July 20, a ship reported a minimum pressure of about 1,003\u00a0mbar (29.6\u00a0inHg), and another ship reported sustained winds of 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h), which would be Becky's peak intensity. A Reconnaissance flight and weather radars suggested the development of an eye feature, and initially it was believed that the storm attained minimal hurricane status. Later it was later confirmed that Becky remained a tropical storm, and the previously forming eye failed to persist.[4] On July 21, the storm deteriorated in organization as it continued northward.[5] The lack of banding features indicated that by early on July 22, Becky was barely a tropical storm.[6] The storm made landfall near Port St. Joe, Florida shortly thereafter, and weakened rapidly as it moved inland;[5] as a rainstorm, it progressed northward into the Midwestern United States and completely dissipated over Michigan.[7]"

Along the Cape Fear River, a boat ramp was washed out.[18] Farther towards the north in Georgia and Alabama, the rainfall helped to relieve persistent drought conditions.[5] According to the Red Cross, 104 families in the Tallahassee region suffered flood-related losses, and two injuries were reported. There, winds gusted to 44 miles per hour (71\u00a0km/h). Flood waters were knee-deep around a county courthouse at Crawfordville, Florida.[19] In low-lying areas, flooding damaged homes, and to the southwest of Tallahassee, 4 feet (1.2\u00a0m) of water forced the evacuation of 15 homes by rowboat. Over 100 cars were stranded in the flooding.[20] As precautionary measures, a few secondary roads were closed in the region.[21] Damage from Becky in the state totaled $500,000 (1970 USD), mostly in Leon and Wakulla counties. Two injuries were reported.[7] Several tornadoes were reported. Near Panacea, Florida, a tornado destroyed a house and damaged two others. Another tornado in Emanuel County, Georgia killed one person and demolished two homes. However, due to the conditions that spawned the tornadoes, they are not directly attributed to Becky.[5]"

The fifteenth tropical cyclone and 9th named storm of the 1984 Atlantic hurricane season. Isidore formed as a tropical depression on September 25, while situated off the southeastern Bahamas. The  depression headed west, and was upgraded to a tropical storm in the central Bahamas the next day. It made landfall near Jupiter, Florida, and retaining tropical storm strength, Isidore curved to the northeast, emerging over water near Jacksonville, Florida. Isidore continued northeast until it was absorbed by a frontal system on October 1. Though damage was generally light, the storm affected several regions from the Bahamas to the U.S. East Coast. One death was reported in Florida, and total damage is estimated at $1 million (1984 USD)."

On September 24, a ship reported winds of about 30\u00a0mph (48\u00a0km/h) in association with the disturbance. However, satellite imagery indicated that convection was just beginning to organize. Satellite imagery and Air Force reconnaissance reports documented the formation of a tropical depression early on September 25; a special statement was later issued by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) confirming the existence of the depression, and tropical cyclone advisories were initiated at 12 pm EDT.[1] The depression moved west-northwest while tracking through the Bahamas. As it did so, it moved across Cat Island and passed near several others.[1] The cyclone attained tropical storm status on September 26, receiving the name \"Isidore\".[2] While located near the northern tip of Andros Island, Isidore reached its peak intensity. The barometric pressure fell to 999 mb, with sustained winds of 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h). The storm continued moving northwest, though it failed to strengthen significantly over the Florida Current. The cyclone made landfall near Jupiter, Florida with sustained winds of about 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) and subsequently moved inland. Previously, a large high pressure area over the eastern United States had prevented the cyclone from moving northward. The high moved away, allowing for Isidore to curve to the northeast, emerging over water near Jacksonville, Florida. The storm continued towards the northeast, passing about 80\u00a0mi (130\u00a0km) off of the Carolina coast. Isidore downgraded to a tropical depression on October 1, and was absorbed in a frontal zone later that day. Isidore was one of many storms during the 1984 season that formed in relatively cool baroclinic environments.[2]"

In Martin County, hundreds of firefighters were on standby.[7] In Miami, rain from the storm led to the cancellation of horse races at the Calder Race Course. State parks in Monroe County were temporarily closed.[8] In Indian River, Martin, and St. Lucie counties, students were sent home early, and after-school actives were canceled. The South Beach Jetty Park in Fort Pierce was closed.[7] In southern portions of the state, residents prepared their boats for the storm, and 50 F-4 Phantom fighter jets were evacuated from the Homestead Air Force Base and moved to bases in South Carolina.[9] Lumber yards, groceries stores, and hardware stores reported unusually high demand for emergency supplies, though certain smaller businesses closed early. Gasoline stations in the region \"were doing bumper-to-bumper business\".[10] Farther to the south, in the Florida Keys, an emergency operations center was opened in response to the storm.[11]"

Elsewhere, 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) winds were recorded. At Mayport, winds were sustained at 43\u00a0mph (69\u00a0km/h). In northern portions of the state, peak rainfall totals ranged from 5 to 7\u00a0in (130 to 180\u00a0mm), much of which was associated with an intense convective band to the north and east of the cyclone's center.[15] Power outages were mostly minor and scattered.[8] Tides generally ran under 3\u00a0ft (0.91\u00a0m) above normal; combined with high winds, the tides contributed to severe and widespread beach erosion along the eastern coast of central Florida, threatening structures at times.[8] A large, $500,000 beach restoration fill was washed away. Additionally, segments of State Road A1A were damaged. On Hutchinson Island, many eggs and nests of Caretta caretta and Chelonia mydas, respectively, were destroyed. One man was electrocuted as a result of the storm near Orlando.[16] Another man was injured while attempting to land his plane in high winds.[17] Throughout the state, overall damage was generally insignificant.[16] The storm also dropped heavy precipitation along the coasts of Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina, with sporadic showers in parts of Virginia.[18] In Georgia, one tornado, ranked F1 on the Fujita scale, touched down in Brunswick, damaging a metal building's roof at a steel plant and 10\u00a0cars and a garage roof at a car dealership, and demolishing a metal hut at a National Guard Armory. Several trees fell due to a tornado,[19]:\u200a23\u200a with about 2,000\u00a0power outages in Glynn County.[20] The tornado caused approximately $250,000 in damage.[21] Offshore, swells of 12 to 15\u00a0ft (3.7 to 4.6\u00a0m) extensively damaged a wooden ship, the Phoenix. The vessel \"barely escaped destruction\", though a crew member suffered a cracked rib.[22] Across its path, Isidore was estimated to have inflicted $1 million in damage.[5]"

After reaching this strength, the storm turned more westward and further intensified, nearly attaining hurricane status the next day. The storm peaked with winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) and a barometric pressure of 986\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.11\u00a0inHg). Several hours later, Delia made landfall near Freeport, Texas; however, the storm began to execute a counterclockwise loop, causing it to move back over the Gulf of Mexico. On September\u00a05, the storm made another landfall in Freeport before weakening to a depression. The remnants of Delia eventually dissipated early on September\u00a07 over northern Mexico. Due to the erratic movement of the storm along the Texas coastline, significant rainfall fell in areas near the center and in parts of Louisiana. This led to widespread flooding, especially of farmland, that left $6\u00a0million in damages. Five people were killed during the storm."

        "content": "Tropical Storm Delia originated from a tropical wave that formed over the central Caribbean Sea in late August 1973. Tracking towards the west-northwest, convective activity increased and the overall structure of the system improved. By August\u00a031, a weak area of low pressure formed over the Gulf of Honduras.[1] This system tracked northward and further organized into a tropical depression just off the southeastern coast of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula on September\u00a01.[2] Gradually intensifying, the depression became a tropical storm on September\u00a03 as it turned towards the west.[1] In accordance with its upgrade, it was given the name Delia.[2] This upgrade followed a reconnaissance mission into the system that found sustained winds of 50\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h). A complex steering pattern formed later that day, resulting in a more hostile environment for the cyclone.[1] As Delia neared the Texas coastline, it managed to intensify into a strong tropical storm with winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) and reconnaissance reported winds well in excess of hurricane-force in numerous squalls associated with the storm. The lowest pressure was recorded at 986\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.11\u00a0inHg). However, Delia was not classified a hurricane as it had not developed an eyewall around the center of circulation. Delia subsequently made its first landfall at Freeport, Texas late on September\u00a04. After executing a counterclockwise loop, the storm made its second landfall in Freeport on September\u00a05. After moving inland, the storm quickly weakened, becoming a depression on September\u00a06 before dissipating early the next day over northern Mexico.[1]"

Later that day, they were extended westward to Palacios, Texas and eventually, warnings for areas east of Morgan City, Louisiana were canceled. Due to the unexpected loop taken by Delia, gale warnings were extended as far south as Baffin Bay, Texas. By September\u00a06, the NHC discontinued all watches and warnings associated with the storm.[1] Around this time, the National Weather Service issued flood warnings, and warned residents about the possibility of tornadoes forming with the weakening tropical cyclone.[3] In Cameron, Louisiana, an estimated 6,000 residents were evacuated with memories of Hurricane Audrey, a storm that killed 575 in the city, still fresh.[4] Due to the erratic track of the storm along the Texas coastline, widespread heavy rains fell in areas near the storm and in Louisiana. Tides up to 6\u00a0ft (1.8\u00a0m),[1] in addition to rainfall up to 13.9\u00a0in (350\u00a0mm),[5] caused significant flooding in the Galveston-Freeport area. Up to $3\u00a0million was reported in damages to homes due to the flooding.[1] In southern Louisiana, numerous areas received more than 10\u00a0in (250\u00a0mm) of rain and most of the state recorded at least 3\u00a0in (76\u00a0mm).[5] This rainfall led to widespread flooding, particularly in agricultural areas. Damages to crops amounted to $3\u00a0million. In addition to the flooding rains produced by Delia, eight tornadoes also touched down due to the storm, injuring four people. Five people were killed during Delia, two of which were directly related to the storm.[1] Two of the other deaths resulted from a car crash, triggered by slick roads, with the two occupants of a pickup truck being killed.[6] The fifth death resulted occurred while a man was boarding up his home and suffered a stress-induced heart attack.[1] The outer bands of the storm also produced significant rainfall in Arkansas and Oklahoma, peaking at 9.72\u00a0in (247\u00a0mm) and 8.22\u00a0in (209\u00a0mm) respectively.[7]"

It formed on October\u00a016 in the western Caribbean Sea from a tropical wave, and strengthened to reach peak winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) before striking Cuba. It later moved slowly through the Bahamas before weakening to tropical depression status. On October\u00a024, with the assistance of a cold front off the coast of the eastern United States, Gilda transformed into a subtropical storm, becoming very large and strong. The storm later accelerated northeastward and became extratropical, ultimately dissipating near Greenland. The storm first brought heavy rainfall to Jamaica, causing six deaths and some damage from mudslides. While crossing Cuba and later the Bahamas, the storm caused little impact, limited to some crop damage. As a subtropical storm, Gilda brought gusty winds and high waves to much of the east coast of the United States, causing minor beach erosion and coastal property damage."

        "content": "A tropical wave moved off the west coast of Africa on October\u00a03. It tracked westward, reaching the Caribbean Sea on October\u00a010. By October\u00a013, a large area of convection persisted from Hispaniola southwestward through Panama, and over the next few days the convection organized and concentrated in the northwestern Caribbean Sea. An anticyclone became established near Jamaica on October\u00a015, which created a favorable upper-level environment for the system by reducing wind shear.[1] Around the same time, a low-level trough emerged from the Intertropical Convergence Zone, heading north off the coast of Nicaragua.[2] Early on October\u00a016, the system developed into a broad tropical depression about halfway between Central America and Jamaica.[1][3] The initial motion of the depression was uncertain, as steering currents could have resulted in a motion either to the west or to the north-northeast. With the possibility of the western track, the storm was remarked as being the first serious hurricane threat for southern Florida since Hurricane Gladys in 1968. However, after formation the depression moved slowly north-northeastward.[1] The thunderstorm activity gradually became better organized while rainbands increased around the circulation.[2] By 0000\u00a0UTC on October\u00a018, the depression attained tropical storm status about 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km) northwest of the Cayman Islands, after which it was named Gilda by the National Hurricane Center (NHC). The storm quickly strengthened as it moved toward southern Cuba, reaching peak winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) about 18\u00a0hours after reaching tropical storm status. Shortly thereafter, Gilda made landfall near the border of the present day Cuban provinces of Sancti Sp\u00edritus and Ciego de \u00c1vila.[3] Tropical Storm Gilda weakened slightly over Cuba, crossing the island in less than twelve hours before emerging into the Atlantic Ocean early on October\u00a019.[3] At the time, the anticyclone over Jamaica which previously assisted the cyclone instead remained over the Caribbean, which increased shear over the storm. This caused the convection to gradually separate from the low-level circulation.[1] Early on October\u00a020, Gilda passed just southeast of Andros Island in the Bahamas,[3] around the same time that the Hurricane Hunters recorded an atmospheric pressure of 994\u00a0mbar;[2] this was the lowest recorded pressure in association with Gilda while it was a tropical cyclone.[3] It gradually weakened due to the wind shear, resulting in the low-level steering currents becoming dominant.[1] After moving through the Exuma island chain, the storm passed near or over Eleuthera, and late on October\u00a021 Gilda became nearly stationary about 60\u00a0mi (95\u00a0km/h) east of Harbour Island. Late on October\u00a022, after moving only about 6\u00a0mi (10\u00a0km) in a 24\u2011hour period, Gilda weakened to a tropical depression.[3] Now a tropical depression, Gilda remained nearly stationary for another 24\u00a0hours before accelerating northeastward,[3] under the influence of an upper-level trough exiting the east coast of the United States. Cold air from the trough interacted with Gilda, providing a baroclinic environment for intensifying, and on October\u00a024 the storm transitioned into a subtropical storm about halfway between Hispaniola and North Carolina. This made Gilda the first tropical storm on record to transition into a subtropical cyclone. Operationally, tropical storm advisories were still issued on Gilda while it was subtropical, due to the need to maintain consistency and the possibility it could again become tropical. The circulation of the storm became very large, at one point stretching from New England to the Bahamas, and eastward beyond Bermuda, or a diameter of more than 1300\u00a0mi (2100\u00a0km). On October\u00a025, Gilda passed about halfway between Bermuda and Cape Hatteras, when it reached peak winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h). Subsequently, it turned northeastward, and on October\u00a027 attained a minimum pressure of 984\u00a0mbar, the lowest of its duration while tropical or subtropical. Later that day, Gilda became an extratropical cyclone southeast of the Canadian Maritimes as it moved over colder waters. After passing just southeast of Newfoundland, the storm continued northeastward, becoming nearly stationary off the coast of Greenland before dissipating on October\u00a030.[1]"

The highest amount measured in a 24\u2011hour period within Jamaica was 411 millimetres (16.2\u00a0in), which triggered many landslides across eastern sections of the island.[4]  The rains produced landslides, particularly in Saint Andrew Parish where six houses were destroyed. Elsewhere on the island, the mudslides caused further property damage and left some roads unpassable.[5] Six people were killed throughout the country.[6] The storm did not have significant impact in Cuba. A station in the mountains of what was then known as Oriente Province recorded winds of 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h). The city of Mor\u00f3n, located along the northern coast of Cuba, recorded 6.13\u00a0inches (155\u00a0mm) of rainfall in the 6\u00a0hour period prior to the storm passing the area.[1] Damage was minor,[1] limited to some crop damage in the eastern portion of the island,[7] as well as power outages. The threat of the storm forced several thousand people to leave their homes.[8] In the Bahamas, officials closed schools, and many businesses closed early on the day the storm moved through the country.[7] The storm's stationary motion caused several days of high tides and heavy rains. Tropical storm force wind gusts were reported on Andros Island, and gusts peaked at 75\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h) on Golden Cay. Gilda's passage left crop damage on several islands, although monetary losses in the country were minor.[1] When Gilda was forecast to move near southeastern Florida, gale warnings were issued from North Key Largo to Fort Lauderdale. Rough seas affected the Florida coastline for about 72\u00a0hours, causing moderate coastal property damage and beach erosion.[1] After becoming a large subtropical cyclone, gale warnings were issued at various times from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina to the mouth of the Merrimack River in Massachusetts. High surf and minor beach erosion were reported along the coastline, and gale-force winds were observed from North Carolina to New Jersey.[1] Over the western Atlantic Ocean, the storm produced strong winds and rough seas. One ship reported a wave height of 28\u00a0ft (8.5\u00a0m), though no significant marine losses were reported. Around the time of it becoming extratropical, Sable Island off the coast of Nova Scotia recorded a wind gust of 74\u00a0mph (119\u00a0km/h).[1] Tropical Storm Gilda was notable as being the first observed tropical cyclone to transition into a subtropical cyclone; several subtropical cyclones have undergone tropical cyclogenesis, but never the opposite. Since Gilda, a few other storms accomplished the feat. In 1980, a tropical depression dissipated, reformed as a subtropical depression, and later became Hurricane Georges over the open Atlantic Ocean. The next year, Tropical Storm Jose became subtropical near the end of its duration, and in 1984, Hurricane Klaus became a subtropical storm over the western Atlantic Ocean. In 2001, Tropical Storm Allison, after causing devastating flooding in Texas, became a subtropical storm over the Gulf of Mexico and moved across much of the southeastern United States.[3] In 2011, Tropical Storm Lee transitioned into a subtropical storm while approaching Louisiana."

Kotzebue, on the Bering Sea coast, received a record 102 inches of snowfall\u2014more than double the average of about 40 inches.[1] In other locations, winter snowfall did not set records but still was heavier than average. Fairbanks, Alaska's second-largest city, received 71.5 inches of snow and experienced unusually cold temperatures for the first three months of the year, preventing early melting of the snowpack.[2][3] Snow also fell heavily in Lake Minchumina and the Alaska Range.[4][5] At Eagle, the ice on the Yukon River was 55\u00a0inches thick\u2014over 40 percent greater than normal.[6] By mid-April, concerns were raised that the heavy snowpack would pose a problem if it melted quickly. \"There's plenty of snowpack out there to cause problems this year,\" warned a National Weather Service meteorologist at the time.[6] In Fairbanks and most of Interior Alaska, temperatures remained below freezing for most of April and temperatures did not hit 50 degrees until April 26.[7] After that date, temperatures rose rapidly. By April 28, the snowpack at Fairbanks International Airport had melted, leaving only snow berms and piles.[7] The next day, Fairbanks recorded a record high temperature of 74 degrees. On April 30, Fairbanks set an all-time high temperature for the month of April when the thermometer reached 76 degrees. Record high temperatures also were recorded at Eagle, Delta Junction, and other towns in central Alaska.[8] In less than one week, central Alaska residents went from skiing to swatting mosquitoes.[9] The warmup was so rapid that on May 1, the Alaska Division of Forestry issued its first wildfire alert of the year.[10] By that date, however, rivers across central Alaska were already flooding.[11]"

        "content": "The Tanana River valley was the first area of Alaska to experience spring flooding. On April 28, the ice on the Salcha River broke up, flowed into the Tanana River, and formed an ice jam. The jam partially dammed the river, flooding low-lying areas of the town of Salcha.[11] High temperatures during the following couple of days added to the ice jam, and several families were forced from their homes by the rising water. Fairbanks North Star Borough officials set up a self-serve sand bag station at the Salcha Fairgrounds, and residents near the river erected impromptu levees.[12] The Salcha ice jam broke loose on April 30, causing flood levels to decline dramatically. Record-high temperatures that day caused jams to form on other rivers in the area, however.[13] On the Chatanika River, a jam caused a flood that threatened several homes before the ice broke loose and dropped water levels to near normal.[13] By May 1, almost the entire Fairbanks North Star Borough was directly threatened by some sort of flooding. In Fox, small-stream flooding caused a house to be evacuated. Flooding was reported in North Pole and in rural areas of the borough.[14] On May 2, high water on the Chena River swept through Fairbanks, causing flooding in low-lying areas.[15] The high water caused the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to consider closing the floodgates at the Chena River Lakes Flood Control Project, a structure built to protect Fairbanks from flooding.[16] The high water registered just below the threshold to close the gates, however, and they remained open throughout the flood. By May 5, the water receded in Fairbanks and the surrounding area as the Tanana River drained floodwater into the Yukon.[17] The draining high water ripped a barge away from its moorings in the Tanana River near Nenana, causing it to float down the Yukon River until it was arrested by a helicopter.[18]"

Supplies of food and water were delivered to old Eagle Village on May 5, and the next day, officials from the Alaska Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management arrived to manage the response from a headquarters set up at Eagle's school. By Thursday, May 7, National Park Service helicopters were airborne, checking on people in isolated homesteads near and within the preserve.[27] On May 6, Governor Sarah Palin declared the drainages of the Yukon, Kuskokwim, Kobuk, and Susitna rivers to be disaster areas.[28] The next day, she canceled a trip to attend the White House Correspondents Dinner in order to survey the damaged communities.[29] In Fairbanks, private citizens donated more than 7,000 pounds (3,175\u00a0kg) of supplies to Eagle residents. The amount of donations was so great that the airline that volunteered to fly the supplies to Eagle was overwhelmed.[30] By May 7, the total amount of private donations exceeded 10,500 pounds (4,763\u00a0kg).[27] By May 10, larger amounts of government aid began reaching affected areas. Akiak on the Kuskokwim River received diesel fuel, potable water, food, and other items, while four 400-gallon (1,514-liter) water tanks were sent to Eagle to alleviate problems caused by contaminated wells.[31]"

        "content": " Hurricane Cindy impacted the Carolinas, the Mid-Atlantic states, New England, and the Canadian Maritime Provinces during the 1959 Atlantic hurricane season. The third storm of the season, Cindy originated from a low-pressure area associated with a cold front located east of northern Florida. The low developed into a tropical depression on July 5 while tracking north-northeastward, and became Tropical Storm Cindy by the next day. Cindy turned westward because of a high-pressure area positioned to its north, and further intensified into a weak hurricane off the coast of the Carolinas on July 8. Early on July 9, Cindy made landfall near McClellanville, South Carolina, and re-curved to the northeast along the Fall Line as a tropical depression. It re-entered the Atlantic on July 10, quickly restrengthening into a tropical storm while it began to move faster. On July 11, Cindy passed over Cape Cod, while several other weather systems helped the storm maintain its intensity. Cindy transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on July 12 as it neared the Canadian Maritime Provinces. Overall the structural damage from Cindy was minimal. One driver was killed in Georgetown, South Carolina after colliding with a fallen tree, and five indirect deaths were caused by poor road conditions wrought by the storm in New England. Many areas experienced heavy rains, and several thousand people evacuated. Other than broken tree limbs, shattered windows and power outages, little damage occurred. Cindy brought a total of eleven tornadoes with it, of which two caused minor damage in North Carolina. The heaviest rainfall occurred in north central South Carolina, where rainfall amounted to 9.79 inches (249\u00a0mm). Tides ranged from 1 to 4 feet (0.30 to 1.22\u00a0m) above normal along the coast. As drought-like conditions were present in the Carolinas at the time, the rainfall produced by Hurricane Cindy in the area was beneficial. After becoming extratropical over the Canadian Maritimes, the cyclone produced heavy rains and strong winds that sunk one ship. Damage caused by Cindy was estimated at $75,000 (1959\u00a0USD)."

        "header": "Meteorological history",
        "content": "The origins of Cindy can be attributed to a deepening low-pressure area that tracked from the Great Lakes as a related cold front traveled southeastward and became stationary over the Atlantic, extending from northern Florida to Bermuda. On July 5, the front spawned a separate cut-off cold-core low off the coast of the Carolinas. This complex scenario resulted in the formation of a tropical depression later during the day, which slowly meandered north-northeastward.[1][2] Tropical cyclones of this origin typically remain at a small size and evolve slowly, and Cindy complied to this pattern.[1] Convection began to increase on July 6, supported on the basis that many showers were observed to the north of the depression. An anticyclone\u2014a large mass of air rotating clockwise\u2014intensified within the depression's vicinity, resulting in a tighter pressure gradient and increasing winds to the north of the center of the depression.[1] The depression intensified into Tropical Storm Cindy early on July 7,[2] and a reconnaissance flight into the storm late during the afternoon observed maximum sustained winds of 60\u201365\u00a0mph (97\u2013105\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 997\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.44\u00a0inHg).[1] Cindy began to curve westward late on July 7 as it reached peak intensity, with a minimum central pressure of 996\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.41\u00a0inHg),[3] and drifted due west early on July 8 as a result of a maturing surface high to its north.[4] Steady intensification continued throughout the day, and the storm attained hurricane status during the morning of July 8.[2] At approximately 2:45\u00a0UTC on July 9,[1] the hurricane made landfall near McClellanville, South Carolina.[5] Shortly thereafter, Cindy began re-curving northwestward along the Fall Line,[4] and eventually weakened to a tropical depression. The depression abruptly turned toward the east-northeast over North Carolina during the afternoon hours of July 9. Cindy then began to accelerate as it curved slightly towards the northeast, and eventually regained tropical storm status late on July 10 as it emerged into the Atlantic. Cindy scraped the southern fringe of the Delmarva Peninsula near the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay at approximately 00:00\u00a0UTC on July 11, and rapidly traveled northeastward during the day. Cindy passed over Cape Cod near the mid-morning of July 11,[2] during which a series of shortwave troughs passed near the storm, producing high-level outflow that helped Cindy maintain intensity.[1] Later on July 11, Cindy moved ashore in New Brunswick and made landfall over Prince Edward Island the following day. The storm subsequently moved over Quebec and Labrador,[6] where it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone.[2]"

Even so, it was also a notoriously deadly and destructive season. The season officially began on June\u00a015, 1963, and lasted until November\u00a015, 1963. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. The first system, an unnamed tropical storm, developed over the Bahamas on June\u00a01. In late July, Hurricane Arlene, developed between Cape Verde and the Lesser Antilles. The storm later impacted Bermuda, where strong winds resulted in about $300,000 (1963\u00a0USD) in damage. During the month of September, Tropical Storm Cindy caused wind damage and flooding in Texas, leaving three deaths and approximately $12.5\u00a0million in damage. Hurricane Edith passed through the Lesser Antilles and the eastern Greater Antilles, causing 10\u00a0deaths and about $43\u00a0million in damage, most of which occurred on Martinique. The most significant and deadliest system of the season was Hurricane Flora, which peaked as a Category\u00a04 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale. Drifting slowly and executing a cyclonic loop, Flora dropped very heavy rainfall in the Greater Antilles, including over 100\u00a0in (2,500\u00a0mm) in Cuba. Extreme flooding ensued, leaving behind at least 7,193\u00a0fatalities and about $773.4\u00a0million in damage. In October, Hurricane Ginny moved erratically offshore the Southeastern United States, though eventually, the extratropical remnants struck Nova Scotia. Ginny caused at least three deaths and $400,000\u00a0in damage in the United States alone. The final cyclone, Tropical Storm Helena, caused five deaths and over $500,000\u00a0in damage on Guadeloupe. Overall, the storms in this season caused at least 7,214\u00a0deaths and about $833.8\u00a0million in damage."

Later, tropical cyclone formation occurred more often after a portion of the trough weakened and easterly flow increased across much of the Atlantic.[5]:\u200a128\u200a The tropical cyclones of the 1963 Atlantic hurricane season collectively caused at least 7,214\u00a0deaths and $833.8\u00a0million in damage.[5]:\u200a128\u200a[6]:\u200a6 Tropical cyclogenesis began early, an unnamed tropical storm developing on June\u00a01.

September was much more active, with Cindy, Debra,[2] an unnumbered tropical depression.[7]:\u200a270\u2013271\u200a Edith, and Flora all developing in that month. Flora was the most intense tropical cyclone of the season, peaking as a Category\u00a04 hurricane with winds of 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 933\u00a0mbar (27.55\u00a0inHg). There were two other system in October, Hurricane Ginny and Tropical Storm Helena; the latter dissipated on October\u00a030.[2] The season's activity was reflected with an above average accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of\u00a0113.[3][4] ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h), which is the threshold for tropical storm strength.[8]"

The third named storm of the 1963 Atlantic hurricane season, Cindy developed within a trough as a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico on 16\u00a0September. The disturbance quickly intensified, with a distinct eye becoming visible on satellite imagery as it drifted north-northwestwards toward the Texas coastline. After peaking with 1-minute maximum sustained winds of 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h), it made landfall at High Island on the morning of 17\u00a0September at peak strength with an atmospheric pressure of 997\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.44\u00a0inHg). Cindy remained nearly stationary for almost a day, dropping copious rainfall over the Texas coastal plain, before finally turning west-southwestward and dissipating west of Corpus Christi on 20\u00a0September. Hurricane watches and warnings were issued prior to Cindy's landfall, hastening evacuations in coastal areas of Louisiana and Texas, with many refugees seeking safety in local shelters. Although tide and wind damage was minimal, extreme rainfall totaling upwards of 23.50\u00a0in (597\u00a0mm) resulted in severe flooding in many areas of the Texas coastal plain; 4,000\u00a0homes were inundated in Jefferson, Orange, and Newton counties, many of them after a levee ruptured in Port Acres. Dozens of residents were forced to flee in rising flood waters, and many streets and roadways became impassable as a result of Cindy's flooding. Strong winds shattered glass windows, and schools throughout southeastern Texas were closed due to the hurricane. Widespread crop damage was observed, with rice, cotton, and pecan harvests suffering the worst. Overall, damage amounted to $12.5\u00a0million (1963\u00a0USD), and three deaths were recorded.[nb 1]"

The disturbance soon strengthened into a tropical storm, developing a well-defined circulation near 1800\u00a0UTC.[1] By the afternoon, it had become well-organized enough to prompt the New Orleans Weather Bureau office to initiate advisories on the storm, christening it Cindy.[2] A distinct eye was noted on radar around 2000\u00a0UTC, and around then a maritime report issued by the SS Sabine documented winds of hurricane intensity, which was the forecasters' basis for operationally upgrading the storm to a hurricane. While operationally classified as a Category 1 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h), a reanalysis of the storm in November 2019 as part of the ongoing Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project determined that Cindy never reached hurricane intensity, instead peaking as a tropical storm with maximum sustained winds of 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h).[3] Despite its favorable environment, Cindy remained disorganized, featuring an asymmetric 20\u00a0mi (32\u00a0km)-wide eye; little further strengthening occurred over the course of the night.[2] Upon Cindy's landfall at High Island the following morning, its atmospheric pressure was measured at 996\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.41\u00a0inHg),[1] and winds reached 75\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h).[4] Soon after moving ashore, Cindy became nearly stationary for 18\u00a0hours,[1] maintaining tropical storm status before weakening to a tropical depression at 1200\u00a0UTC on 18\u00a0September.[4] The remnants of Cindy gradually turned westward-to-southwestward and decreased in strength during 18 and 19\u00a0September. As a result of its abnormally slow movement and deterioration, extremely heavy rains were recorded over Texas and Louisiana, especially in the storm's northeastern quadrant.[1] Cindy finally dissipated on 20\u00a0September while situated west of Corpus Christi.[4]"

After making landfall on the morning of 17\u00a0September, the hurricane warning for Cindy was discontinued, though flood warnings and small craft warnings remained in effect for coastal areas of southeastern Texas.[2] Mandatory evacuations were ordered for low-lying areas along a 300\u00a0mi (480\u00a0km) arc, and five buses were sent to help in evacuation efforts in Sabine County, Texas. Meanwhile, the Texas civil defense and disaster relief agency and other related organizations prepared for the storm as governor of Texas John Connally declared a state of emergency.[5] In Cameron Parish, Louisiana, approximately 5,000\u00a0individuals left the area prior to the storm,[6] while 6,000\u00a0fled in the state as a whole; in neighboring Texas, 3,600\u00a0individuals living along the state's shoreline heeded the Weather Bureau's warnings, evacuating to higher ground.[2] Emergency shelters opened along the Gulf Coast, with 1,500\u00a0taking refuge in Port Arthur, Texas, 525\u00a0in Beaumont, 1,078\u00a0in Galveston,[7] 300\u00a0in Port Bolivar, and 475\u00a0total in Texas City, Hitchcock, and Lamarque.[8] A state of emergency was declared in the city of Lake Charles, Louisiana, where officials prepared to feed up to 10,000\u00a0refugees as the Salvation Army and other relief agencies' volunteers were deployed to the region.[7] One shrimp boat was initially reported missing and the tug Myra White transmitted a distress signal as its engines failed near an oil rig off of Galveston. High winds shattered glass windows at Port Arthur, Texas City, and Galveston, while schools were shut down in Galveston, Lamarque, Texas City, Alvin, and most of Galveston and Jefferson counties. Despite a brief power outage at Lamarque, electricity was quickly restored after the storm.[8] Powerful gusts downed branches, electrical poles, and tore off shingles in Port Arthur and Galveston, but damage was minimal at High Island, where Cindy made landfall.[6] The U.S. Coast Guard responded to four requests for assistance at Galveston, and nine vessels attempted to seek refuge at Port Arthur; the Coast Guard eventually permitted six to enter, and the other three apparently traveled to Galveston.[9] Meanwhile, to the northwest, the port of Houston was closed for the duration of the storm.[10] Trucks and boats were dispatched by civil defense officials in Jefferson County after declaring a state of emergency following numerous requests for assistance by residents of flooded homes. Two children, initially unaccounted for, were later found safe under a bridge abutment.[11] In Amelia, a suburb of Beaumont, officials helped residents in low-lying neighborhoods to higher ground, and in Beaumont proper, flooding inundated streets, rendering some impassible.[12] The hurricane partially defoliated palm trees, leaving palm fronds on streets and roadways, and several structures were toppled or damaged along the coast. Overall damage, however, was minimal.[13] An 8\u00a0ft (2.4\u00a0m) levee sheltering Port Acres ruptured, forcing residents to stack 11,000\u00a0sandbags and dump sand to protect the suburb. There, storm waters inundated homes up to roof level, and after carp were swept into local farm fields, many locals fished for them with clubs; nearby, industrial complexes in Jefferson and Orange counties endured severe damage as well. Boats were tossed into the streets of Beaumont, and numerous highways were unusable for travel due to high water;[14] the widespread flooding forced police to rescue 30\u00a0residents in the Beaumont area.[15] The storm inundated rice, cotton, and pecan crops, with rice harvests suffering the worst impacts.[6] Two men left stranded on a burning fishing boat 50\u00a0mi (80\u00a0km) off of Morgan City, Louisiana were later rescued by the U.S. Coast Guard without issue.[9] Tides and winds resulted in few problems, with flooding causing the majority of Cindy's damage; storm surge reached 3 to 5\u00a0ft (0.91 to 1.52\u00a0m) above normal levels, enough to destroy only a few piers and damage several boats. The hurricane's abnormally slow trajectory over the Texas coastal plain led to extremely high rainfall totals being measured in parts of Jefferson, Orange, and Newton counties in Texas, where storm waters inundated 4,000\u00a0homes, and Calcasieu and Vermilion parishes in Louisiana. The most extreme rainfall totals were measured in Deweyville, Texas, where 23.50\u00a0in (597\u00a0mm) of precipitation fell over a three-day period, with 20.60\u00a0in (523\u00a0mm) alone falling in 24\u00a0hours.[1] Farther north, Cindy inundated 25\u00a0businesses and 35\u00a0homes in Guthrie, Oklahoma, where up to 2.5\u00a0ft (0.76\u00a0m) of water forced 300\u00a0residents to flee.[16] Upwards of $11.7\u00a0million (1963\u00a0USD) in property damage was noted, and crop damage reached $500,000\u00a0in Texas and $360,000\u00a0in Louisiana; one man drowned after falling overboard on a boat taking oil rig personnel back to land, while two others drowned under high waters at Port Acres. Overall, Cindy inflicted $12.5\u00a0million in damage and three deaths.[1]"

The town of Schuld was particularly hard hit where at least 50 people were reported to have been killed after a bridge gave way during the flooding. Reports from the time also claimed that almost every bridge in the valley was destroyed by the flooding.[1] The rains also resulted in flooding in Switzerland, where at least 26 people were reported to have been killed around Lake Lucerne. Flooding was reported in Lucerne and Z\u00fcrich where the city electric lighting systems were compromised.[2] The worst human loss, however was reported in the Kingdom of Hungary, where over 1,000 people were reported killed, which was reported as \"exceeding all records\".[3] Elsewhere severe flooding also occurred in Austria-Hungary, Belgium, and the Kingdom of Serbia.[4] Serbia, in particular, saw severe flooding on the Great Morava river, which resulted in severe damage to cities such as Jagodina, as well as an additional 35 fatalities.[5]"

        "content": "Tropical Storm Barry was a rapidly forming tropical cyclone that made landfall on Florida, United States, in early June 2007. The second named storm of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season, Barry developed from a trough of low pressure in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico on June 1. It tracked rapidly northeastward, reaching peak winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) before weakening and making landfall near Tampa Bay as a tropical depression. Barry quickly lost tropical characteristics after wind shear removed much of the convection, and early on June 3, it completed the transition into an extratropical cyclone. The extratropical remnants tracked up the East Coast of the United States, and were absorbed by a larger extratropical cyclone on June 5. The precursor trough produced heavy rainfall across the western Caribbean Sea, which on Cuba unofficially reached over 7.8 inches (200\u00a0mm). Outer rainbands in Pinar del R\u00edo Province injured three people and damaged 55\u00a0houses. In Florida, Barry dropped a moderate amount of precipitation across the drought-ridden state; rainfall peaked at 6.99 inches (178\u00a0mm). The rain caused some flooding and wet roads, which led to two indirect traffic fatalities. Rough seas killed one Florida surfer in Pinellas County. In Florida and Georgia, the precipitation assisted firefighters in combating severe wildfires. Overall damage from the storm was minor."

        "content": "By late on May 29, a weak trough over the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula produced a small area of convection over the Yucat\u00e1n Channel.[1] Convection increased in association with the trough, and the next day a broad envelope of cyclonic turning developed within the system. By May 30, the moisture from the trough extended from Nicaragua through the southeastern Gulf of Mexico, with the greatest area of convection near Cuba.[2] A westward moving tropical wave spawned a broad area of low pressure on May 30, and by May 31, a circulation had developed within the system to the southeast of Cozumel, Mexico. The low moved north-northeastward,[3] and gradually became better organized despite high amounts of vertical wind shear.[4] The deep convection became more concentrated near the center, and it is estimated the system developed into a tropical depression at 12:00\u00a0UTC on June 1, just to the northwest of the western tip of Cuba. Operationally, the system was not classified until eleven hours later.[3] The depression developed a large area of squalls, and organized enough to warrant a Hurricane Hunters flight into the area.[5] The plane reported flight level winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) and a central pressure of 1000\u00a0mbar near the increasingly well-defined low-level circulation. Initially it maintained characteristics of both a tropical and subtropical cyclone, although deep convection continued to organize near the center; based on the observations, the National Hurricane Center initiated advisories on Tropical Storm Barry at 21:00\u00a0UTC on June 1, while the storm was centered about 235 miles (378\u00a0km) west of Key West, Florida.[6] Embedded within the southwesterly flow ahead of an approaching mid-level trough, it tracked quickly northward,[6] and early on June 2, Barry attained peak winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h), with a minimum central pressure of 997 millibars (29.4\u00a0inHg).[3] Shortly after reaching peak intensity, strong wind shear removed most of the deep convection; the cloud pattern consisted of an exposed yet well-defined center surrounded by a curved convective band extending from Cuba along the eastern Gulf of Mexico.[7] The center became elongated and weakened as it accelerated northeastward, and at 14:00\u00a0UTC on June 2, Barry made landfall near Tampa, Florida, as a weakening tropical depression.[8] As the system continued inland, it rapidly lost tropical characteristics, and later that day the National Hurricane Center discontinued advisories on Barry, while it was located over northeastern Florida.[9] The extratropical remnants strengthened, as the system continued northeastward, and on June 3, the storm moved ashore along the coast of South Carolina.[10] Spiral bands developed to the north of the system as it moved up the coast, and a large plume of moisture extended well ahead of the low-level circulation.[11] At 00:00\u00a0UTC on June 4, Barry's extratropical remnants reached an extratropical peak intensity of 990 millibars (29\u00a0inHg).[3] Late on June 4, the extratropical remnant entered New England,[12] and late on June 5, the remnants of Barry were absorbed by a larger extratropical cyclone near the border between the U.S. state of Maine and the Canadian province of Quebec.[3]"

The passage of the storm resulted in an increased threat for rip currents, with officials recommending that swimmers stay out of the water until the storm leaves the area.[14] A tornado watch was also posted for the southern portion of the state, though was dropped after the storm weakened.[15] After becoming an extratropical cyclone, local National Weather Service offices issued flood watches for portions of South Carolina, much of eastern North Carolina, southeastern Virginia, and southeastern Maryland.[10] Later, flood and flash flood watches were issued for southeast Pennsylvania, northern Delaware, northern New Jersey, east-central New York, and southern New England.[11] Wind and lake wind advisories were posted in parts of Georgia.[16]"

Several other roads across the area were flooded,[20] and on Interstate 95 near Lake Worth, a sinkhole closed two lanes of traffic.[21] Wet roads caused several traffic accidents across the state; in both Brevard and Volusia counties, a motorist was killed from an accident. On Interstate 4, a tractor trailer led to disruptions near Orlando after it crashed into a guardrail.[22] The storm produced heavy surf along the western coastline, as well as a storm tide of 4.78 feet (1.46\u00a0m) at Clearwater Beach. The wave action caused minor beach erosion, with 50\u201360 feet (15\u201318\u00a0m) of sand washed away at Bradenton Beach.

State totals peaked at 6.12 inches (155\u00a0mm) near Hardeeville, South Carolina,[11] 3.73 inches (95\u00a0mm) in Fuquay-Varina, North Carolina, and 3.75 inches (95\u00a0mm) near Pennington Gap, Virginia.[23] High winds also occurred in South Carolina.[31] The extratropical remnants of Barry produced gusty winds along the Atlantic coastline which peaked at 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) near Charleston, South Carolina.[10] Around 200\u00a0houses in Craven County, North Carolina, were without power after winds downed a power line.[32] In North Carolina, adverse conditions from the storm delayed an elimination baseball game between the East Carolina University and Western Carolina University teams.[33] In southeastern Virginia, the remnants of Barry caused over 60\u00a0traffic accidents, which resulted in 10\u00a0injuries.[34] Rough seas off of Cape Fear left a sailboat containing three people requiring rescue from the Coast Guard.[35] Rainfall extended into the Mid-Atlantic states through New England, with 4.50 inches (114\u00a0mm) reported at Absecon, New Jersey, 3.91 inches (99\u00a0mm) recorded near Central Park, New York, and 3.19 inches (81\u00a0mm) at Taunton, Massachusetts.[23] The remnants of Tropical Storm Barry contributed to heavy rainfall and flooding in the Finger Lakes region of New York State. Roads and several driveways were washed out.[36] Flash flooding was also reported in southeast New York, and high wind gusts caused sporadic tree damage.[37] In New Jersey, northeast onshore flow associated with the remnants of Barry produced high tides and minor coastal flooding.[38]"

        "content": " Tropical Storm Chris caused minor flooding in the Greater Antilles and the Eastern United States in August 1988. The seventh tropical cyclone and third named storm of the annual hurricane season, Chris developed from a tropical wave while roughly midway between Africa and the Lesser Antilles on August\u00a021. Forming as a tropical depression, it remained weak for several days, crossing the Lesser Antilles, Hispaniola, and The Bahamas during this time. While offshore the coast of Florida on August\u00a028, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Chris. Thereafter, the system tracked rapidly north-northwestward and came ashore near Savannah, Georgia later that day. Once inland, Chris quickly weakened, and by early on the following day, it weakened to a tropical depression over South Carolina. Six hours later, Chris was absorbed by a cold front while over North Carolina, though the remnants of the system tracked across the Eastern United States and Atlantic Canada before dissipating on August\u00a030. In the Leeward Islands and U.S. Virgin Islands, Chris produced only light rainfall, that caused no damage or fatalities. Heavy rainfall occurred in Puerto Rico, which damaged 100\u00a0homes and caused three fatalities. Large amounts of precipitation also fell in Hispaniola, though no damage was reported. In the United States, much of the damage occurred due to tornadoes, especially in The Carolinas. A tornado in South Carolina destroyed at least 15\u00a0mobile homes, caused one\u00a0fatality, and resulted in a brief shutdown of U.S. Route 301. Flooding was minimal, as rainfall totals amounted to 5 inches (130\u00a0mm) or less, though standing water was reported on Interstate 26. Another destructive tornado occurred in Virginia. Two additional deaths were reported in New York, two from drowning and one from a tree falling onto a car. Although winds were light, at least 118,000\u00a0people from South Carolina to Maine were left without electricity. The dissipating storm produced light winds and precipitation in Nova Scotia. Overall, Tropical Storm Chris was attributed to four fatalities and $2.25\u00a0million (1988\u00a0USD) in losses."

Six days later, the system developed into Tropical Depression Seven while centered halfway between the Lesser Antilles and Africa. The depression tracked west-northwestward around the periphery of a subtropical surface high pressure ridge. After strengthening minimally, the depression struck Guadeloupe late on August\u00a023 and entered the Caribbean Sea shortly thereafter. Although satellite intensity estimates indicated tropical storm status, 13\u00a0reconnaissance flights conducted by the National Hurricane Center between August\u00a023 and August\u00a027 indicated winds were less than 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h). By August\u00a025, the depression made landfall near Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. Despite the mountainous terrain of Hispaniola, the depression did not weaken and re-emerged into the Atlantic from the northern coast of Haiti early on August\u00a026. The depression curved northwestward and did not strengthen. On August\u00a027, the depression made another landfall near Andros Town on Andros, Bahamas. Later that day, the depression passed less than 25 miles (40\u00a0km) east of West Palm Beach, Florida. Thereafter, the depression curved north-northwestward and remained offshore of Florida.[1] At 0600\u00a0UTC on August\u00a028, a ship located about 93 miles (150\u00a0km) from the center of the depression reported tropical storm force winds. As a result, the depression was finally upgraded to Tropical Storm Chris. Tracking rapidly north-northeastward, Chris attained its peak intensity about six hours later, with maximum sustained winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1,005\u00a0mbar (29.7\u00a0inHg). The storm made its final landfall near Savannah, Georgia with winds of 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h) at 1500\u00a0UTC on August\u00a028. After moving inland, Chris quickly weakened and was downgraded to a tropical depression near Columbia, South Carolina on August\u00a029. Shortly thereafter, Chris merged with a cold front over North Carolina. The remnants of Chris tracked east-northeastward across the Eastern United States. Eventually, the remnants briefly re-emerged into the Atlantic from New England, then moved across Nova Scotia before dissipating near Cape Breton Island on August\u00a030.[1]"

Two hours later, areas from Savannah, Georgia, to Cape Hatteras North Carolina, were placed under a tropical storm warning.

Winds were relatively light in the state, with sustained winds generally less than 30\u00a0mph (48\u00a0km/h) and gusts to 44\u00a0mph (71\u00a0km/h) were reported in Charleston. However, 18,000\u00a0people in Charleston and other nearby communities lost electricity. In addition, one mobile home was destroyed and another was overturned in Olanta.[13] Rainfall in South Carolina was generally between 1 and 5 inches (25 and 127\u00a0mm), though peaking at 7.64 inches (194\u00a0mm) in Bishopville. Near Columbia, 1.72 inches (44\u00a0mm) of rain fell in only an hour, leaving standing water on several roads, including Interstate 26.[14] In North Carolina, a tornado spawned in Iredell County threw a tractor-trailer into a building at an industrial park. The tornado also struck the Iredell Container Corp. building and damaged several nearby mobile homes. As a result, numerous residents of Iredell County were left without gas or electricity. Four houses and a produce stand were destroyed by another tornado along U.S. Route 401 in Cumberland County.[15] A third tornado in Granville County caused one injury and light damage.[12] Collectively, the three tornadoes in the state caused at least $1\u00a0million (1988\u00a0USD) in damage.[15] In Charlotte, a wind gust of 42\u00a0mph (68\u00a0km/h) was reported, which downed power lines and damaged the facade of a hotel.[16] In Mecklenburg County, Virginia, an F2 tornado spawned near Chase City damaged or destroyed ten buildings, including a mobile home, which was wrapped completely around a tree. Additionally, several vehicles were damaged and one injury occurred. Damage from that tornado reached about $700,000 (1988\u00a0USD).[12] Winds in Washington D.C. reached slightly more than 47\u00a0mph (76\u00a0km/h), leaving 3,800\u00a0homes without electricity.[12][17] In Maryland, rainfall was less than 2 inches (51\u00a0mm) at all locations. A wind gust reaching 55\u00a0mph (89\u00a0km/h) was reported in Baltimore, though sustained winds were below tropical storm force. Similar amounts of rainfall occurred in other nearby states such as Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania; minor creek flooding occurred in those three states. In Wilmington, Delaware, a wind gust of 48\u00a0mph (77\u00a0km/h) was reported. Power lines were snapped in Essex County, New Jersey.[17] The storm downed power lines on Staten Island and Long Island in New York, leaving 31,000\u00a0people without power. However, many had their electricity restored within 24\u00a0hours. A woman was killed in Mamaroneck when an oak tree fell on her car. According to New York City Transit officials, trees also fell on tracks, which slowed transportation services during rush hour.[18] Two other fatalities when two people canoed in the Highland Falls Reservoir; high winds tipped their canoe and both people subsequently drowned. Wind gusts up to 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h) in Rhode Island caused scattered power outages and minor property damage, due to falling tree limbs. In Connecticut, gusty winds felled trees, which struck power lines, leaving at least 59,000\u00a0people without electricity.[12] High winds in Maine from the storm damaged power lines, leaving 10,000\u00a0people without electricity. The storm also damaged four houses and several automobiles near Crystal Lake.[12] Throughout the United States, damaged totaled to at least $2.25\u00a0million (1988\u00a0USD).[12][15]"

        "content": " The 1951 Atlantic hurricane season was the first hurricane season in which tropical cyclones were officially named by the United States Weather Bureau.[1] The season officially started on June\u00a015, when the United States Weather Bureau began its daily monitoring for tropical cyclone activity;[2] the season officially ended on November\u00a015.[3] It was the first year since 1937 in which no hurricanes made landfall on the United States;[4] as Hurricane How was the only tropical storm to hit the nation, the season had the least tropical cyclone damage in the United States since the 1939 season.[5] As in the 1950 season, names from the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet were used to name storms this season.[6] The first hurricane of the season, Able, formed prior to the official start of the season; before reanalysis in 2015, it was once listed as the earliest major hurricane on record in the Atlantic basin. It formed on May\u00a016 and executed a counterclockwise loop over the Bahamas; later it brushed the North Carolina coastline. Hurricane Charlie was a powerful Category\u00a04 hurricane that struck Jamaica as a major hurricane, killing hundreds and becoming the worst disaster in over 50\u00a0years. The hurricane later struck Mexico twice as a major hurricane, producing deadly flooding outside of Tampico, Tamaulipas. The strongest hurricane, Easy, spent its duration over the open Atlantic Ocean, briefly threatening Bermuda, and was formerly listed as one of a relatively few Category\u00a05 hurricanes on record over the Atlantic Ocean. It briefly neared Category\u00a05 status and interacted with Hurricane Fox, marking the first known instance of a hurricane affecting another's path."

        "content": "As the calendar entered the new year, cyclogenesis occurred with an extratropical frontal wave over the western North Atlantic Ocean due to a closed low forming in a mid-level trough, which eventually produced a low-pressure center at the surface by January\u00a02. Ships recorded moderate gales up to 60 miles per hour (97\u00a0km/h) in connection with the new surface low, which formed several hundred miles east-southeast of Bermuda.[7] While initially lacking tropical attributes, the cyclone headed southeast for two\u00a0days before curving southwestward.[8] As it did so, the temperature of the system warmed in its lower levels, causing the cyclone to evolve into a more barotropic system. Late on January\u00a04, the system shrank in size and began developing an inner core; reanalysis determined that the system became a tropical storm at this time, though it would have likely been considered subtropical beginning in the early 1970s.[7]"

        "header": "Hurricane Able",
        "content": "The origins of the first hurricane of the season were from a trough that exited the East Coast of the United States on May\u00a012. A low-pressure area developed on May\u00a014, and two\u00a0days later it developed into a tropical cyclone about 300 miles (480\u00a0km) south of Bermuda. It formed beneath an upper-level low, and initially was not fully tropical. The depression followed the low, initially toward the northwest and later the southwest. Moving over the Gulf Stream, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Able on May\u00a016.[9] The storm turned to the south, and Hurricane Hunters reported that Able strengthened to hurricane status on May\u00a017 off the coast of Florida.[5] The outer rainbands of Able produced light rainfall and high seas along the Florida coastline.[10] It later moved through the northern Bahamas early on May\u00a018, where it produced hurricane-force winds of 85\u00a0mph (137\u00a0km/h).[8] The hurricane later turned to the north, gradually strengthening through May\u00a021. Shortly thereafter, Able passed about 70 miles (110\u00a0km) east of Cape Hatteras before turning east and reaching its peak of 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) early on May\u00a022.[5][8] Along the coast, the hurricane produced high tides but little damage.[11] Able maintained hurricane intensity for two more days before weakening to a tropical storm early on May\u00a024.[8] Able rapidly dissipated that same day, though originally it was assessed as having evolved into an extratropical cyclone on May\u00a023.[5] Until 2015, Able was listed as having peak winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h) and was analyzed to have been the earliest major hurricane on record. Such a storm would be a Category\u00a03 or greater on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, a system developed and introduced in the 1970s.[12] Able was also the strongest hurricane outside of the current hurricane season (June\u00a01 through November\u00a030).[13] However, reanalysis by scientists in 2015 determined that Able was in fact far weaker than originally listed in HURDAT, the official database containing information on storm tracks and intensities in the Atlantic and Eastern North Pacific regions. It also lost its distinction as the strongest preseason cyclone on record, the record being held by a Category 2 hurricane in March 1908.[8] The hurricane was one of four\u00a0North Atlantic hurricanes on record to exist during the month of May, the others occurring in 1889, 1908, and 1970.[8]"

It moved northwestward, quickly strengthening into Tropical Storm Baker. Early on August\u00a03, the storm attained peak winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h), and the next day passed about 275\u00a0mi (443\u00a0km) east of Bermuda.[5] At its peak intensity, the gale-force winds extended 100 miles (160\u00a0km) to the north of the center.[14] After attaining its peak, Baker quickly weakened on August\u00a04 and turned to the northeast.[8] Early the next day, it regained some of its former strength before losing its identity. Baker never affected land.[5]"

        "header": "Hurricane Charlie",
        "content": "The third tropical cyclone of the season developed on August\u00a012 from a tropical wave, 930 miles (1,500\u00a0km) east-southeast of Barbados. After a few days without further development, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Charlie on August\u00a014, and subsequently crossed through the Lesser Antilles a day later with winds of 70\u00a0mph (113\u00a0km/h).[8] Shortly after entering the Caribbean Sea, the storm intensified to hurricane status early on August\u00a016. Passing south of Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, Charlie then underwent rapid deepening beginning late that day, its winds increasing 35\u00a0mph (56\u00a0km/h) in 24\u00a0hours.[8] As it neared the island of Jamaica early on August\u00a018, Charlie became a major hurricane and shortly afterward struck just south of Kingston with winds of 125\u00a0mph (201\u00a0km/h)\u2014equivalent to a strong Category\u00a03 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale, making Charlie, along with Hurricane Gilbert in 1988, the strongest ever to hit the island.[5][8] On the island, the hurricane dropped heavy rainfall up to 17\u00a0in (430\u00a0mm). The combination of strong winds and the rains left around $50\u00a0million (1951\u00a0USD, $380\u00a0million 2005\u00a0USD) in crop and property damage. Across the country there were 152\u00a0deaths, 2,000\u00a0injuries, and 25,000\u00a0people left homeless; as a result, it was considered the worst disaster in the country in the 20th century until Hurricane Gilbert produced even costlier damage, though with fewer reported fatalities.[5][15][16] After making landfall, Charlie weakened in its passage over the mountainous center of Jamaica, and by the time it left the island, its winds had diminished to 85\u00a0mph (137\u00a0km/h).[8] Charlie later passed south of the Cayman Islands, with Grand Cayman reporting peak wind gusts of 92\u00a0mph (148\u00a0km/h).[5] As it did so, the storm began to undergo yet another period of rapid intensification beginning on August\u00a019. It regained major hurricane status late that day, and early on August\u00a020 Charlie peaked at 130\u00a0mph (210\u00a0km/h), equivalent to low-end Category\u00a04 status.[8] Maintaining its strength, the hurricane then made landfall on the southern tip of Cozumel and hit the Mexican mainland near Akumal on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. The strong winds destroyed 70% of the crops along its path, although no deaths were reported in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.[5] Several homes were wrecked in the region.[17] As it moved inland, Charlie weakened rapidly over land, reaching the Bay of Campeche as a minimal hurricane early on August\u00a021.[8] Once over water, it failed to re-intensify for a full day, but began doing so early on August\u00a022. As it did so, it rapidly re-intensified for a third and final time, reaching peak winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h) before striking near the city of Miramar, just north of Tampico.[8] It dissipated on August\u00a023. The hurricane dropped heavy rainfall in the region, flooding rivers and causing dams to burst. Hundreds of people were killed in the Mexican mainland, and across Charlie's entire path, damage was estimated at over $75\u00a0million (1951\u00a0USD$, 880\u00a0million 2024\u00a0USD).[5] The outer fringes of the storm increased surf along the Texas coast.[18]"

On September\u00a04, Dog weakened to tropical storm status to the south of Hispaniola, and the next day dissipated in the western Caribbean.[8] In northern Saint Lucia, the combination of flooding and high winds destroyed 70% of the banana crop. Two sailing vessels were destroyed, and another one damaged. Across the island, Hurricane Dog killed two people from drownings.[5] Damage was heavier on Martinique, located on the north side of the storm. The hurricane's winds destroyed 1,000\u00a0homes and the roofs of several others. Downed trees blocked roads and disrupted power lines. The winds also destroyed 90% of the banana crop and 30% of the sugar cane. Throughout Martinique, Dog left $3\u00a0million in damage (1951\u00a0USD, $35.2\u00a0million 2024\u00a0USD) and killed five people from drownings.[5] It was considered the \"most violent storm\" in Martinique in 20\u00a0years.[19] Initially the hurricane was expected to strike Jamaica, prompting hurricane warnings for the country, as well as along the southern coast of Hispaniola.[19] Jamaica was struck by Hurricane Charlie a few weeks prior, and the threat from Dog prompted coastal evacuations and the closure of an airport.[20] Ultimately, Dog dissipated and produced only light rainfall on the island.[21]"

        "content": "Hurricane Easy, the strongest tropical cyclone of the season, was a powerful and long-lived Cape Verde-type hurricane that originated as a tropical depression on September\u00a01 between the Lesser Antilles and Cape Verde.[8] Moving generally west-northwestward, the depression deepened into a tropical storm late that day, and further to hurricane status by September\u00a03. On September\u00a05, the cyclone reached its first peak of 110\u00a0mph (177\u00a0km/h), but failed to continue strengthening. Its winds fluctuated through the early morning on September\u00a06, but then resumed strengthening, reaching major hurricane status by that evening.[8] During this period, Hurricane Hunters flew into the hurricane to monitor its progress, recording a minimum pressure of 957 millibars (28.26\u00a0inHg) on September\u00a06 to the north of the Lesser Antilles.[5] The next day, an aircraft was unable to penetrate the center, estimating winds of 160\u00a0mph (257\u00a0km/h) south of the eye. On this basis, Easy was once classified as a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale;[22] A reanalysis in 2015 lowered the peak winds to 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h) on September\u00a08. This was based on the Hurricane Hunters reporting a pressure of 937\u00a0mb (27.67\u00a0inHg) on the previous day, and a ship reporting winds of 140\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h).[22] By the time Easy attained peak intensity, it had turned to the north and northeast while beginning a steady weakening trend.[5][8] It interacted with the small Hurricane Fox to the east; this was the first observed instance of a hurricane affecting another's path.[5][23] Easy then turned to the northeast, passing a short distance southeast of Bermuda on September\u00a09 with winds of 110\u00a0mph (177\u00a0km/h).[8] Easy evolved into an extratropical cyclone late on September\u00a011, while still maintaining hurricane-force winds. The remnants lost their hurricane-force winds on September\u00a012, only to briefly regain them two days later. On September\u00a014, Easy lost its identity over the northern Atlantic Ocean after it was absorbed by another extratropical storm to the north.[22] The Weather Bureau advised Bermuda to take precautionary measures in advance of the storm;[24] tourists and residents \"worked feverishly\" to complete preparations, and the United States Air Force issued \"a formal warning at noon.\"[25] Numerous hotels and homes were shuttered. Heavy traffic snarled evacuations, and 100\u00a0tourists were stranded on the island without \"roundtrip reservations.\" Air Force aircraft returned to the United States, and personnel secured various facilities at the island's base.[25] On Bermuda, the hurricane produced winds of only 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h), which downed a few banana trees.[23] In addition to affecting Bermuda, the strong winds of the hurricane damaged a few ships along its path.[5]"

Moving generally westward, it passed south of the Cape Verde islands, quickly strengthening into Tropical Storm Fox early on September\u00a03; by that time, its motion turned to the west-northwest.[8] On September\u00a05, Fox attained hurricane status, around the same time as it was first observed by ships. Two days later, Hurricane Hunters reported peak winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h), making it a major hurricane, albeit one of very small extent.[5] Around that time, Fox interacted with Hurricane Easy to its northwest. After maintaining peak winds for 12\u00a0hours, Fox began a steady weakening trend, accelerating to the north and northeast ahead of Easy and passing to the east of Bermuda. On September\u00a010, Fox, while still of hurricane force, became extratropical between the Azores and Greenland in the far north Atlantic. It turned towards the north and dissipated on September\u00a011 off the southwest coast of Iceland.

It moved north-northwestward for a few days before turning eastward in the central Gulf of Mexico.[8] Based on Hurricane Hunter reports, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm How late on September\u00a030, and it continued to strengthen as it approached Southwest Florida. On October\u00a02, How attained its first peak of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) just before making landfall near Boca Grande, and within the day it crossed southern Florida.[8] At the time, the storm was not well organized, and its strongest winds were confined to squalls in the Florida Keys and the southeast coast.[5] Wind damage was minor, although heavy rainfall was reported,[5] peaking at 15.7 inches (40\u00a0cm) near where it moved ashore.[27] The precipitation caused significant street flooding, while about 7,000 acres (28\u00a0km2) of tomato and bean fields were deluged.[28][29] The storm emerged into the Atlantic Ocean between Fort Pierce and Vero Beach, quickly intensifying to hurricane strength by October\u00a03. Turning northeastward, How reached its second and strongest peak of 100\u00a0mph (161\u00a0km/h) on October\u00a04 as it passed near the Outer Banks of North Carolina.[5][8] Along the coast, the hurricane produced high tides and minor damage.[30] Subsequently, the hurricane briefly weakened, only to recover its peak of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) on October\u00a05.[8] It passed southeast of Cape Cod before turning more to the east-northeast,[5] causing road closures due to high tides.[30] Offshore, the hurricane sank a ship, killing 17\u00a0people.[31] While still of hurricane force, How became an extratropical storm on October\u00a06, and a few days later it curved to the northeast. The extratropical cyclone later struck Iceland with hurricane-force winds on October\u00a09.[8] A couple of days later, the remnants of How dissipated in the far northern Atlantic.[5] Overall, Hurricane How caused about $2\u00a0million (1951\u00a0USD, $23.5\u00a0million 2024\u00a0USD) in damage.[5]"

A disturbance along the front began rotating on December\u00a02, developing into a small but powerful extratropical storm on the next day. By late on December\u00a03, the storm attained hurricane-force winds, and it increasingly became the dominant system within the broad frontal region. A ridge to the east turned this storm to the southwest. The winds diminished below hurricane-intensity on December\u00a05, and concurrently the inner structure became more tropical as the frontal features dissipated. During this time, ships in the region reported strong winds, mostly to the north. Increasing water temperatures fueled atmospheric instability, likely causing an increase in convection, and the system was potentially a subtropical cyclone on December\u00a06, while located about 1,015\u00a0mi (1,633\u00a0km) east-northeast of Bermuda. A nearby ship recorded a minimum pressure of 987\u00a0mbar (29.1\u00a0inHg) around that time. After the storm turned to the southeast, a ship in the region reported winds of 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h) near the center and a pressure of 995\u00a0mbar (29.4\u00a0inHg), while a weather station indicated that the system had a warm core. The data suggested that the system became a fully tropical hurricane by 12:00\u00a0UTC on December\u00a07, and that it likely had evolved into a tropical storm six hours earlier. By 18:00\u00a0UTC that night, the hurricane attained peak winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h).[22] On December\u00a08, the hurricane turned to the east and weakened into a tropical storm, steered by an approaching trough. Over the next day, the storm accelerated to the east-northeast toward the Azores. Late on December\u00a010, the storm moved through the Azores as a tropical storm, although it was reverting to an extratropical storm at the time. By 06:00\u00a0UTC on December\u00a011, the system was extratropical again after it rejoined with a nearby cold front. It likely merged with another nontropical storm to its east on December\u00a012, although it is possible the former hurricane remained a distinct system. A building ridge near Spain forced the extratropical system to the southeast, eventually dissipating after coming ashore in Morocco on December\u00a015.[22]"

        "content": " The October 1996 India cyclone (also known as Cyclone 05A) had an unusual and protracted path that spanned much of the northern Indian Ocean. It originated in a weather disturbance that formed on October\u00a014 in the southern Bay of Bengal, off India's east coast. Moving westward, it struck Andhra Pradesh on October\u00a017 as a well-defined low-pressure area. It crossed southern India and reorganized in the Arabian Sea off the western coast of India. The system developed into a depression on October\u00a022 and quickly intensified while moving northward. By October\u00a024, the cyclone approached hurricane intensity as it developed an eye, reaching peak winds of at least 110\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph). On October\u00a025, the storm abruptly stalled and weakened off Gujarat, and progressed southwestward as a minimal storm. It was no longer classifiable as a tropical cyclone by October\u00a028, although its remnants persisted until November\u00a02 when they dissipated east of Somalia. In southern India, the storm dropped heavy rainfall that caused severe flooding in Andhra Pradesh. At least 112\u00a0reservoirs and dams were breached, killing 200\u00a0people in Prakasam district. The floodwaters ruined about 1,600,000\u00a0ha (4,000,000 acres) of crops and damaged around 53,000\u00a0houses, leaving thousands homeless. The floods killed 388\u00a0people in southern India and caused US$388\u00a0million in damage. The storm later brushed the west coast of India, stranding 50\u00a0boats. The Indian military helped with relief and rescue efforts. Another cyclone struck Andhra Pradesh in November, causing additional damage and deaths."

        "content": "The long-tracked storm originated from the monsoon trough,[1] which spawned an area of convection, or thunderstorms, in the southern Bay of Bengal on October\u00a014. It moved to the west-northwest and later to the west without much development.[2] The India Meteorological Department (IMD) classified the system as a well-marked low-pressure area before the system moved over the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh on October\u00a017. The system slowly crossed southern India, emerging into the Arabian Sea on October\u00a021. That day, the convection organized into a circular cluster as the circulation became more defined.[2][3] The system slowed and turned to the north around the periphery of a ridge to the east.[1] The system organized into a depression on October\u00a022, the same day that the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified it as Tropical Cyclone 05A.[2][3] As the storm moved slowly northward, it quickly intensified, and the IMD upgraded the system's status from a depression on October\u00a022 to severe cyclonic storm status late on October\u00a023. Around that time, the storm developed an eye,[3] and the JTWC estimated 1\u00a0minute peak winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph) at 18:00\u00a0UTC that day, equivalent to a minimal hurricane.[2] On October\u00a024, the IMD estimated peak 3\u00a0minute winds of 110\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph), although estimates derived from the Dvorak technique suggested winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph).[3] On October\u00a025, the storm stalled about 95\u00a0km (59\u00a0mi) south of the Gujarat coast, as steering currents from the retreating ridge of high pressure diminished.[3][2][1] Strengthening wind shear, cooler waters, and dry air rapidly weakened the storm. By late on October\u00a025, the JTWC had discontinued warnings, and the IMD downgraded the storm to depression status. The system began moving to the southwest away from the wind shear. The IMD downgraded the system further to a remnant low on October\u00a028, although the JTWC began issuing advisories again after a nearby ship reported winds of 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph). Accelerating to the west, the storm again weakened on October\u00a031, prompting the JTWC to discontinue advisories while the system was about 110\u00a0km (68\u00a0mi) northeast of Socotra. The remnants turned to the southwest, dissipating near the east coast of Somalia on November\u00a02.[2][3] The JTWC remarked that the storm \"had one of the most unusual tracks in North Indian Ocean cyclone history\" and was also one of the longest tracked cyclones in the basin.[2] According to the IMD, most storms approaching Gujarat strike the coast or weaken and move westward. The agency stated that \"there is no parallel of this system in [tropical cyclone history].\"[3]"

D. Deve Gowda provided 500\u00a0million rupees (US$15\u00a0million) to help Andhra Pradesh with flood recovery.[7] Conditions returned to normal within 12\u00a0days of the onslaught of the rains, with the exception of minor delays to trains.[4] However, another cyclone struck Andhra Pradesh about three weeks after the flood event,[12] killing over 1,000\u00a0people.[13] Upon forming and moving parallel to India's west coastline, the storm dropped rainfall in the Konkan region of Maharashtra and neighboring Goa.[2] The threat of the storm prompted schools to be closed around Mumbai.[14] Later, it brushed Gujarat with heavy rainfall and gusty winds. About 50\u00a0boats were stranded amid high seas, and 11 other boats were left missing from the Veraval port.[3] During the height of the storm, 320\u00a0fishermen were unaccounted for, spurring the Indian navy to launch search and rescue missions.[15]"

        "content": " Hurricane Ingrid was one of two tropical cyclones, along with Hurricane Manuel, to strike Mexico within a 24-hour period, the first such occurrence since 1958. Ingrid was the ninth named storm and second hurricane of the 2013 Atlantic hurricane season. It formed on September\u00a012 in the Gulf of Mexico from a broad disturbance that also spawned Manuel in the eastern Pacific. After initially moving westward toward Veracruz, Ingrid turned northeastward away from the coast. Favorable conditions allowed it to attain hurricane status on September\u00a014, and the next day Ingrid attained peak winds of 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph). Subsequently, increased wind shear weakened the convection as the storm turned more to the northwest and west. On September\u00a016, Ingrid made landfall just south of La Pesca, Tamaulipas in northeastern Mexico as a strong tropical storm, and dissipated the next day. The hurricane was also the last one to form in the Gulf of Mexico until Hurricane Hermine in 2016. The combined impacts of hurricanes Ingrid and Manuel affected two-thirds of Mexico, killing 192\u00a0people and causing MXN$75\u00a0billion, or roughly US$5.7\u00a0billion in damage. Most of the effects were due to Manuel, though Ingrid was directly responsible for at least 32\u00a0deaths and $20\u00a0billion (MXN, US$1.5\u00a0billion) in damage. The two storms precipitated 162\u00a0billion\u00a0m3 (162\u00a0km3; 5.7\u00a0trillion\u00a0cu\u00a0ft; 39\u00a0cu\u00a0mi) of water, the equivalent of filling every dam in Mexico. Rainfall from the storm peaked at 511\u00a0mm (20.1\u00a0in) in Tuxpan, Veracruz. The rains caused widespread flooding, damaging at least 14,000 houses and hundreds of roads and bridges. In Tamaulipas, where the storm made landfall, the rainfall damaged crops and flooded rivers. The effects of the storm spread into South Texas, causing high tides and some flooding. After the storm, the Mexican government declared several municipalities to be in states of emergency. Relief agencies distributed food and aid to the hardest hit areas, although in Tamaulipas, residents had to rely on assistance from the local Gulf Cartel. The names Ingrid and Manuel were both later retired due to their impacts."

        "content": "On August\u00a028, a tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa, which moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean without development. On September\u00a02, an area of convection, or thunderstorms, developed along the northern portion of the wave, but was eventually absorbed into Tropical Storm Gabrielle north of Puerto Rico. The wave continued westward through the Caribbean Sea into a large area of cyclonic flow at the surface, which extended across Central America into the eastern Pacific. Around September\u00a09, the broad system developed two areas of disturbed weather \u2013 one in the eastern Pacific would become Hurricane Manuel, and the other developing over the northwestern Caribbean. The latter system slowly organized, developing a low pressure area on September\u00a011. Subsequently, the system moved over the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.[1] Although land interaction prevented immediate development, conditions favored further development in the Bay of Campeche.[2] Early on September\u00a012, the low emerged into the bay, and at 1800\u00a0UTC the National Hurricane Center (NHC) assessed that Tropical Depression Ten developed about 280\u00a0km (170\u00a0mi) east-northeast of Veracruz.[1] This was confirmed by a Hurricane Hunters flight indicating the presence of a closed low-level circulation.[3] On September\u00a013, convection and organization increased and the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Ingrid, while weak steering currents resulted in little movement of the cyclone.[4] Partially due to the presence of nearby Hurricane Manuel in the eastern Pacific basin on the other side of Mexico, significant wind shear existed in the vicinity of Ingrid.[5] Nonetheless, strong convection and intermittent development of an eye allowed for strengthening of the storm on September 14.[6] Ingrid strengthened into a hurricane \u2013 the second of the season \u2013 that afternoon.[7] Around that time, the hurricane turned sharply northeastward due to a trough over eastern Mexico and a ridge over the southeastern United States.[1] Additional strengthening took place thereafter, and Ingrid reached a peak intensity of 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph) early on September 15 while starting to move northward and begin a northwest turn towards the Mexican coastline.[8] Afterward Ingrid reached peak winds, shear increased and began to weaken the hurricane as it approached the Mexican coast.[9] The center became displaced to the edge of the convection, and NHC forecaster Daniel Brown noted that Ingrid \"[did] not resemble a classic hurricane in satellite pictures.\"[10] At around 1115\u00a0UTC on September\u00a016, Ingrid made landfall just south of La Pesca, Tamaulipas in northeastern Mexico, after having weakened into a strong tropical storm with 100\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph) winds.[1] Near landfall, the Hurricane Hunters reported flight-level winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph) which, after adjusting to surface winds, confirmed the weakening.[11] The storm moved ashore less than 24\u00a0hours after Tropical Storm Manuel struck the Pacific coast of Mexico on Michoac\u00e1n,[12] making it the first time since 1958 that tropical cyclones struck both coasts of the country within one day.[13] Ingrid rapidly weakened into a tropical depression over land,[14] and although convection temporarily reorganized,[15] the circulation dissipated on September\u00a017.[16]"

        "content": "Several tropical cyclone warnings and watches were posted in anticipation of the storm. Upon the development of Ingrid into a tropical cyclone at 2100\u00a0UTC on September\u00a012, the Government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning from Coatzacoalcos to Nautla, Veracruz. At 1500\u00a0UTC on September\u00a013, the tropical storm warning was extended northward to Cabo Rojo, Veracruz, with a tropical storm watch northward to La Pesca, Tamaulipas. Later, a hurricane warning was issued between Cabo Rojo to La Pesca, with a tropical storm watch to Bahia Algodones, Tamaulipas.[1] Pemex, the oil company operated by the Mexican government, evacuated workers from three platforms in the Gulf of Mexico due to the storm.[17] In Tamaulipas, classes were canceled in 27\u00a0municipalities,[18] and all classes were temporarily canceled throughout Veracruz.[19] The threat of the storm caused events for Mexican Independence Day to be canceled.[20] After a restriction on the news in 2010 due to the local drug war, members of a citizen alert system in Tamaulipas used Twitter to notify about flooding, missing people, and the need for assistance.[21] Early in its duration, Ingrid produced tropical storm force winds along the coast of Veracruz. While making landfall, it also brought tropical storm force winds along the northeastern Mexican coast. Sustained winds at La Pesca peaked at 80\u00a0km/h (50\u00a0mph), with gusts to 105\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph). The NHC remarked that Ingrid \"likely caused above normal tides\" in northeastern Mexico, but there was no data to back up the statement. Interacting with Hurricane Manuel on the Pacific coast and the broad cyclonic flow, Ingrid dropped heavy rainfall across eastern Mexico, primarily in Tabasco, Veracruz, and Tamaulipas states. In Tuxpan, Veracruz, rainfall totaled 511\u00a0mm (20.1\u00a0in) over 10\u00a0days, while at the Presa Vicente Guerrero dam in Tamaulipas, precipitation reached 502\u00a0mm (19.8\u00a0in).[1] Surface runoff from the storm spread to the Pacific coast of Mexico, producing flooding in Guerrero in combination with Manuel. The impacts from both storms produced 162\u00a0billion\u00a0m3 (5.7\u00a0trillion cu ft) of water, the equivalent of filling every dam in the country.[22] The combined effects of hurricanes Ingrid and Manuel affected about two-thirds of Mexico.[23] The rains from Ingrid caused flooding and landslides across Mexico,[1] causing many rivers to rise,[23] and isolating towns.[24] In Veracruz alone, the rains flooded 68\u00a0rivers, which damaged 121\u00a0roads and 31\u00a0bridges, including two destroyed bridges. About 14,000\u00a0houses were damaged to some degree.[25] Heavy rainfall forced 23,000\u00a0people to evacuate their homes, 9,000\u00a0of whom went to emergency shelters,[26] some forced to leave by the Mexican army in high risk areas.[25] Evacuees who did not reside in shelters generally went to the houses of friends and family.[19] Also in Veracruz, flooding killed about 20,000\u00a0livestock.[27] Along the coast of Tamaulipas, damage occurred from Soto la Marina to La Pesca.[19] The P\u00e1nuco River in Tamaulipas rose above its banks, flooding two poor towns along its path and damaging adjacent roads. Also in the state, the storm damaged local sorghum fields.[27] Two people in the state required rescue after their truck was swept away by a river.[17] Throughout Mexico, Ingrid killed 32\u00a0people, mostly due to flooding and mudslides.[1] The two storms collectively killed at least 192\u00a0people and caused MXN$75 (US$\u00a05.7 billion). Manuel was responsible for majority of the overall effects, although Ingrid still left an estimated MXN$20\u00a0billion (US$1.5\u00a0billion) in estimated economic losses, according to AON Benfield; insured damages totaled MXN$3\u00a0billion (US$230\u00a0million).[23] A total of six fatalities occurred in the states of Hidalgo and Puebla. Three of which were caused after a vehicle was swept off a road, while three other people died after their home was buried by a mudslide;[24] another death occurred in Hidalgo after a house collapsed on a woman in the town of Tepehuac\u00e1n de Guerrero.[28] Twelve people died after a landslide smashed a bus in Altotonga, Veracruz,[26] and three people died in Tamaulipas.[29] The fringes of the storm extended into southern Texas, where winds gusted to tropical storm force, and rainfall was around 25\u201375\u00a0mm (0.98\u20132.95\u00a0in).[1] Thunderstorms and high tides affected the coastline, with tides reaching 0.76\u00a0m (2.5\u00a0ft) above normal, causing beaches to close due to flooding.[30]"

Volunteers delivered about 600\u00a0blankets and various cleaning supplies to the town of P\u00e1nuco.[35] Following the storms, the National Civil Protection Coordination received the authority to prevent housing construction in areas at risk for mudslides and flooding; the law had passed in 2012, but initially lacked the authority to enforce it.[36] Some residents in Tamaulipas complained at the slow pace of receiving aid. In response, the Gulf Cartel brought relief items to Aldama, with one columnist for El Universal suggesting that this was to gain favor with local residents.[37]"

The ninth depression, and the third and strongest named storm of the 2017 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, Ockhi originated from an area of low pressure that formed over the southwest Bay of Bengal on November 28.[2] The storm organized into a Depression off southeast coast of Sri Lanka on November 29, causing damage to property and life in Sri Lanka while passing by.[2] Due to high atmospheric moisture and warmer oceanic surface temperature between Sri Lanka and Kanyakumari (Cape Comorin) in mainland India, Ockhi intensified into a cyclonic storm on November 30.[2] While near Kanyakumari in mainland India, Ockhi changed course and intensified while heading towards Lakshadweep in the Arabian Sea.[3] Ockhi impacted Lakshadweep on December 2, uprooting coconut trees and causing extensive damage to houses, power lines and other infrastructure on the islands.[4] Ockhi weakened into a well-marked low near the south coast of Gujarat, India, on December 6, before crossing the coastline and dissipating shortly afterward.[5] In its entirety, Ockhi left a trail of massive destruction in Sri Lanka, Lakshadweep, South India, and The Maldives, as it strengthened from a depression to a mature cyclone. Though it rapidly weakened during its final stages over the Arabian Sea, it caused heavy rainfall along the western coast of India, particularly in Maharashtra and Gujarat. Ockhi caused at least 245 fatalities, including 218 in India[6] and 27 in Sri Lanka,[7] and the storm left at least 550 people missing, mainly fishermen.[8]"

Many parts suffered power cuts, even as educational institutions remained closed in the districts of Tirunelveli, Tuticorin, Virudhunagar and Thanjavur.[51] The Indian Navy and Coast Guard searched for stranded fishermen in the coastal areas of Lakshadweep. More than 400 people were rescued and evacuated, and few cadavers were found.[52] The coastal areas of Ernakulam District, in Kerala, were affected by the cyclone. Around 2,648 people were evacuated to seven shelters over by Kochi.[53] The cyclone claimed five lives in the Kanyakumari District of Tamil Nadu on November 30, caused by falling trees.[54] The cyclone went on to hit the Lakshadweep islands on December 2. The three major islands of Lakshadweep\u2014Minicoy, Kalpeni, and Kavaratti\u2014suffered major damages. A desalination plant at Kavaratti was also damaged.[55] The cyclone then moved away from Lakshadweep towards the western coast of India on December 4, bringing rare December rainfall to Mumbai and nearby.[56] In Goa, beach shacks were hit by high tides caused by Cyclone Ockhi. Several major beaches in the state were affected due to the sudden ingress of water, which resulted in inundation of the shacks and soil erosion. Almost 50 shacks in the Morjim, Mandrem, Arambol and Querim Beaches in Pernem taluka were damaged. In Bardez taluka, only soil erosion at Anjuna and Baga Beaches and damage to a retaining wall at Coco Beach in Nerul were reported.[57] Unseasonal rain and inclement weather in the wake of Cyclone Ockhi had severely impacted grape farms in Maharashtra. The Nashik District received 125.5\u00a0mm of rain, due to the impact of Ockhi.[58] Cyclone Ockhi dumped more than 80,000\u00a0kg or 80 tonnes of waste from the ocean on the Mumbai beaches, according to estimates released by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation's (BMC) solid waste management (SWM) department.[59] In Gujarat, parts of southern region received significant rains, with the highest rainfall in Umargam of 90\u00a0mm, causing damage to vegetables and banana crops.

After it had made landfall, frictional forces made Thane rapidly weaken into a depression. As a result, the JTWC issued their final advisory during December 30, while the IMD continued to monitor the remnants of Thane until the depression weakened into a well-marked low-pressure area early on December 31.[18]"

The North Indian Ocean cyclone season has no official bounds, but cyclones tend to form between April and November, with peaks in late April to May and October to November. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northern Indian Ocean. The season began on May 16 with the designation of Depression BOB 01 in the Bay of Bengal, which later became Amphan. Cyclone Amphan was the strongest storm in the Bay of Bengal in 21 years and would break Nargis of 2008's record as the costliest storm in the North Indian Ocean. The season concluded with the dissipation of Cyclone Burevi on December 5. Overall, the season was slightly above average, seeing the development of five cyclonic storms. The scope of the season is limited to the Indian Ocean in the Northern Hemisphere, east of the Horn of Africa and west of the Malay Peninsula. There are two main seas in the North Indian Ocean\u00a0\u2013 the Arabian Sea to the west of the Indian subcontinent, abbreviated ARB by the India Meteorological Department (IMD); and the Bay of Bengal to the east, abbreviated BOB by the IMD. The official Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre in the basin is the India Meteorological Department (IMD), while the United States's Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) releases unofficial advisories.

The system's small size enabled it to take advantage of low wind shear and high sea surface temperatures.[43] The IMD assessed Gati to have reached its peak intensity as a Very Severe Cyclonic Storm around 12:00\u00a0UTC, with three-minute sustained winds of 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph) and a minimum pressure of 976\u00a0mbar (28.82\u00a0inHg).[44] Six hours later, Gati had made landfall near Hafun in northeastern Somalia with estimated one-minute sustained winds of 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph).[43] This made Gati the first hurricane-force cyclone to strike the country since reliable records began and by default the nation's strongest.[43] Once onshore, land friction-based shear caused convection to quickly become displaced from the storm's center.[45] The low-level circulation became completely exposed early on November 23 as it traversed northeastern Somalia; the system's upper-level circulation and associated convection detached and accelerated west ahead of the surface low.[46] The increasingly elongated circulation of Gati emerged over the Gulf of Aden by 12:00\u00a0UTC,[47] and the JTWC issued their final advisory on the system shortly thereafter.[48]"

It gradually intensified into a Very Severe Cyclonic Storm, reaching its peak intensity. Due to the wind shear, it weakened to a Severe cyclonic storm, shortly before making landfall between Karaikal and Mamallapuram around Puducherry(also known as Pondicherry), Wednesday evening. It reemerged on the Bay of Bengal as a strong deep depression before making its last landfall at Andhra Pradesh before weakening to a well marked low pressure on the morning of November 27. The name Nivar was contributed by Iran which means light.

The sixth tropical storm and first hurricane of the season, Ernesto developed from a tropical wave on August 24 in the eastern Caribbean Sea. Ernesto first affected the northern Caribbean, reaching minimal hurricane status near Haiti before weakening and moving across eastern Cuba as a tropical storm. Despite initial predictions for it to track through the eastern Gulf of Mexico as a major hurricane, Ernesto moved across eastern Florida as a weak tropical storm. After turning to the northeast, it re-intensified and made landfall on August 31 on the North Carolina coast just below hurricane status. Late the next day, Ernesto became extratropical after entering southern Virginia. The remnants spread moisture across the northeastern United States before dissipating over eastern Canada on September 4. The deaths of at least eleven people were attributed to Ernesto, which dumped heavy rains throughout its path, especially in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States. While moving across the Caribbean, it affected several countries, and initially Ernesto posed a threat to the Gulf Coast of the United States around the one-year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. Damage in Virginia was estimated at over $118\u00a0million (2006\u00a0USD), prompting the declaration of a federal disaster area. Total damage in the United States was estimated at $500\u00a0million (2006\u00a0USD)."

        "content": "On August\u00a018, a tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa.[1] It tracked westward, and its convection began organizing and concentrating on August 22.[2] The next day, convection increased along the wave axis, and Dvorak classifications from the Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch of the National Hurricane Center began at 1200\u00a0UTC on August 23. As it approached the Lesser Antilles, a surface low developed,[1] and with the confirmation of a closed low-level circulation from the Hurricane Hunters, it is estimated the system developed into Tropical Depression Five on August 24 about 50\u00a0mi (80\u00a0km) north-northwest of Grenada.[3] Located to the south of a ridge across the southwestern Atlantic Ocean, the depression tracked west-northwestward through an area of dry air and westerly wind shear.[3] Despite the shear, convection intensified near the center as banding features improved,[4] and on August 24, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Ernesto.[1] Convection deepened and expanded, though wind shear displaced the low-level center to the west of the convection.[5] By August 26, the structure had become much better-defined, and within five days Ernesto was forecast to be located about 275\u00a0mi (443\u00a0km) south of the Gulf Coast of the United States as a powerful hurricane.[6] The center reformed under the deepest convection after wind shear decreased, and at the same time outflow increased in all quadrants. Turning northwestward, a small eye formed,[7] and early on August 27 Ernesto attained hurricane status about 95\u00a0mi (200\u00a0km) south-southwest of the border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic.[1] Upon becoming a hurricane, Ernesto was believed to be undergoing rapid intensification.[7] However, the small inner core deteriorated as the circulation interacted with the mountainous terrain of southwest Haiti, and it quickly weakened back to tropical storm status.[1] The center became broad and ill-defined, though it was forecast to re-intensify to hurricane status before striking Cuba.[8] It continued to weaken due to land interaction, and early on August 28 Ernesto passed just offshore of the southwestern tip of Haiti with winds of 45\u00a0mph (70\u00a0km/h). Hindered by increased wind shear from an upper-level low over the Bahamas, the storm weakened further before striking just west of Guant\u00e1namo Bay in Cuba as a minimal tropical storm.[1] With very warm water temperatures and a favorable upper-level environment, one forecast remarked the possibility of Ernesto strengthening greatly over the Straits of Florida and eastern Gulf of Mexico to hit western Florida as a major hurricane.[9] Ernesto remained over land as a minimal tropical storm for about 18\u00a0hours before reaching the Straits of Florida. Convection gradually increased over the warm waters, though Ernesto failed to strengthen significantly due to its disrupted inner core. An eastward-moving high pressure system over the southeastern United States allowed a continued northwest movement, and at 0300\u00a0UTC on August 30 the storm struck Plantation Key in the upper Florida Keys with winds of 45\u00a0mph (70\u00a0km/h). Two hours later, Ernesto made landfall on the Florida mainland in southwestern Miami-Dade County.[1] Moving through a weakness in the subtropical ridge, the storm turned to the north through the state.[1] Operationally, the National Hurricane Center downgraded Ernesto to tropical depression status while over the state,[10] though post-analysis indicated the system maintained tropical storm status.[1] Ernesto retained a well-organized cloud pattern over land,[10] and after emerging over the Atlantic Ocean near Cape Canaveral,[1] convection again increased and began wrapping into the circulation.[11] Upon reaching the Atlantic Ocean, Ernesto accelerated north-northeastward ahead of an approaching deep layer trough. The convection increased as the storm strengthened over warm waters, and late on August 31 Ernesto attained an intensity of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) while located about 170\u00a0mi (270\u00a0km) south-southwest of Wilmington, North Carolina. Shortly prior to moving ashore, an eye began to develop, and early on September 1 the storm made landfall on Oak Island, North Carolina very near the threshold between tropical storm and hurricane status. The National Hurricane Center remarked the possibility that Ernesto could have been a hurricane at landfall, due to the possibility that the strongest maximum wind was not sampled.[1] After landfall the storm rapidly weakened, and about eight hours after moving ashore, Ernesto deteriorated to tropical depression status. Interacting with a pre-existing frontal zone that extended eastward through Virginia, Ernesto quickly lost its tropical characteristics, and late on September 1 it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. It re-intensified to a gale over the Mid-Atlantic states, only to weaken to an extratropical depression near Pennsylvania. With a large high pressure area to its east, the remnants turned to the north-northwest, reaching southern Ontario on September 3. After turning northeastward, the extratropical remnants of Ernesto were absorbed into a larger storm over Quebec on September 4.[1]"

As the storm strengthened, the watch was replaced with a tropical storm warning, and about 15\u00a0hours prior to its closest approach the warning was replaced with a hurricane warning.[1] Several low-lying citizens in Gona\u00efves were evacuated after local meteorologists anticipated up to 20 inches (510\u00a0mm) of rain in some mountainous areas. Additionally, authorities advised residents in shanty towns near the ocean to evacuate to emergency shelters.[12] Jamaican officials issued radio and television advisories for residents in low-lying areas, urging them to be ready and evacuate if necessary. The Jamaican government opened all shelters on the island and placed its armed forces on standby.[13] Long lines for storm supplies were reported at local businesses ahead of the storm as residents rushed to obtain supplies in preparation for Ernesto's onslaught.[13] When a tropical storm warning was put in effect for Jamaica and the central Bahamas, cruise ship companies indicated they were diverting several liners to avoid the storm.[12] Hurricane warnings were put in effect for six provinces in southeastern Cuba,[12] where significant precipitation ranging up to 20 inches (510\u00a0mm) across the mountainous south was expected as the center of Ernesto tracked slowly across Cuba.[14] Cuban officials evacuated 300,000\u00a0people[15] and brought its fishing fleet into harbors.[16] The Cuban state television broadcast extensive warnings about the storm, urging precautions. Cattle were moved to higher ground, tourists were evacuated from hotels in the southeastern province of Granma, and baseball games scheduled for the evening of August 27 in Havana were played earlier in the day.[12] The threat of the storm caused domestic flights to be canceled.[17]"

Several schools were closed across southern Florida.[19] The threat of the storm caused NASA to postpone the launch of Space Shuttle Atlantis at Kennedy Space Center to avoid risking damage from the storm.[22] The storm was initially expected to move into the Gulf of Mexico and affect people recovering from hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma in the previous year, which caused hundreds of billion in damage and left thousands of houses damaged or destroyed.[23] There were initial fears that Ernesto would make landfall days after Hurricane Katrina's one-year anniversary, and that the levees in New Orleans might not be able to withstand a strong storm surge. Officials in New Orleans prepared buses and trains in the event that people needed to evacuate but could not.[24] A possible path over the Gulf of Mexico oil fields, as well as tension with Iran, caused the price of oil to increase, although the prices receded when the threat of the storm receded.[25] On August 29, a hurricane watch was issued from the mouth of the Altamaha River in Georgia to Cape Fear, North Carolina. The next day, the watch was replaced with a tropical storm warning, which was later extended to Currituck Beach Light in Corolla, North Carolina before the storm moved ashore.[1] In South Carolina, voluntary evacuations occurred in Charleston and Colleton counties.[26] On August\u00a031 before the storm's arrival,[27] Virginia Governor Tim Kaine declared a state of emergency, putting the Virginia National Guard and state agencies on alert and opening the state's new Emergency Operations Center in suburban Richmond. North Carolina Governor Mike Easley activated 200 National Guard troops and had other emergency teams on standby.

A two-day storm total of 4.69 inches (119\u00a0mm) occurred in Sabana Grande.[32] In the Dominican Republic, heavy rainfall caused river flooding and mudslides, resulting in damage to several houses. The highest rainfall report noted was 7.01 inches (178\u00a0mm) at Barahona.[1] The rainfall also downed trees, and caused flooding to enter over 400\u00a0houses near Santo Domingo,[33] which forced the evacuation of over 1,600\u00a0people.[34] In Haiti, the storm caused heavy rainfall of over 11 inches (280\u00a0mm) and strong winds,[35] causing flooding and destroying 13\u00a0homes on the island of La Gonave.[36] In Port-au-Prince, rainfall severely damaged a bridge, isolating the southern portion of the region.[33] Across the country, 59\u00a0homes were damaged, of which six destroyed, and a total of five deaths were reported.[37] Ernesto produced heavy rainfall in eastern Cuba, with Guant\u00e1namo reporting 3 inches (76\u00a0mm) in four hours.[38] Gusty winds left some towns in the Camag\u00fcey Province without power, though overall damage was minor.[33] There were no reports from Cuba of deaths, injuries, or major damage attributed to the storm.[39]"

Upon making landfall in southern Florida, the storm produced a storm tide of about 1 foot (0.30\u00a0m) above astronomical tide levels, though no beach erosion was reported. Winds were fairly minor across the state, reaching 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h) at a station on Lake Okeechobee. Ernesto dropped heavy rainfall across southwest Florida, with a state maximum of 8.72 inches (221\u00a0mm) recorded at South Golden Gate. The rainfall caused the Fisheating Creek to overflow, and some flooding also occurred in portions of Collier County.[40] Floodwaters entered at least 13\u00a0homes in Palmdale.[1] The storm resulted in more than 150\u00a0canceled flights at Orlando International Airport, stranding several travelers.[41] While moving through the state, Ernesto spawned two F0 tornadoes in Osceola County.[1] One person died in each in Broward and Miami-Dade counties from traffic accidents; the deaths are considered indirectly related to Ernesto. Overall damage in the state was minor.[40] Passing to the east of Georgia, the storm produced light winds and rainfall near the coast. In South Carolina, the storm brought over 7 inches (180\u00a0mm) of precipitation to North Myrtle Beach, which caused ponding on roadways. Winds were generally light, peaking at around 35\u00a0mph (56\u00a0km/h), which caused isolated power outages;[40] about 2,700\u00a0people across the state lost power.[42] Near Charleston, the passage of the storm caused moderate flooding that left some roads closed. No significant damage was reported in the state.[26] Tropical Storm Ernesto made landfall in Brunswick County in the southern portion of North Carolina, producing a moderate storm surge along the Pamlico River which forced several evacuations. The storm surge reached 4\u20136 feet (1.2\u20131.8\u00a0m) in Beaufort County, flooding many homes and businesses.[40] Just east of where it moved ashore, the storm dropped 14.6 inches (370\u00a0mm) of rainfall in Wrightsville Beach; this was the highest rainfall total associated with Ernesto in the United States. Much of the eastern portion of the state received over 3 inches (76\u00a0mm) of precipitation,[32] and in the northeastern portion of the state, the precipitation caused flash flooding.[43] The rainfall caused freshwater flooding in low-lying areas, as well as along major and minor roadways; the floodwaters left a 12\u00a0mi (19\u00a0km) portion of Interstate 40 closed in Duplin County. Subsequent to the storm's passage, the rainfall caused severe river flooding, with many streams and rivers overflowing their banks for several days. The Northeast Cape Fear River at Chinquapin remained in major flood stage for a week,[40] flooding about 300\u00a0homes.[44] The storm moved ashore just below hurricane strength, though wind gusts near the coast were generally around 40\u201360\u00a0mph (64\u201397\u00a0km/h).[40] Gusts peaked at 62\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h) in Wilmington, and the strong winds downed trees and power lines across the coastal region;[1] about 69,000\u00a0people were left without power.[42] Minor property damage was caused by three tornadoes spawned by the storm in eastern North Carolina.[1] The passage of the storm caused a traffic fatality in the state.[45] Overall damage was estimated at $80\u00a0million (2006\u00a0USD),[44] all but $4\u00a0million of which from crop damage.[46]"

Seven people were killed in the state, of which two directly to the storm;[49] three of the deaths were from traffic accidents, and one person died from carbon monoxide poisoning, due to operating a power generator inside after a power outage.[50] In Washington, D.C., the storm produced wind gusts of up to 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h) which, in combination with heavy rainfall, resulted in a few downed tree branches and power lines.[48] High tides left moderate damage in St. Mary's County, Maryland of about $4.4\u00a0million (2006\u00a0USD),[51] with the damage to trees and power lines considered worse than the impact in Hurricane Isabel in 2003. In neighboring Charles County, storm surge flooding forced the evacuations of houses along the waterfront.[48] The interaction between Ernesto and a high pressure area over eastern Canada produced high winds, heavy rainfall, tidal flooding, and high waves across the Mid-Atlantic and New England. In Delaware, the winds left 151,000\u00a0people without power, and the adverse conditions canceled several Labor Day Weekend events. A buoy in the Delaware Bay recorded a record-high wave height of 22.3\u00a0ft (6.8\u00a0m).[48] In southern New Jersey, 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) winds left over 200,000\u00a0buildings without power, while high waves flooded or closed several roads and bridges.[48] Further north, between 2\u20134 inches (51\u2013102 millimetres) of rain fell across Pennsylvania and New York.[52] In Pennsylvania, there were two deaths. A seven-year-old boy died at a hospital, after a tree limb fell on him. A man was trying to rescue his golden retriever from a drainage steam, while he was sucked into an outflow pipe, and was found dead after being pulled out of a manhole.[53] The rain in New York caused delays in the play at the 2006 US Open, and washed out a whole day's play.[52] The extratropical remnants of Ernesto moved across southern Ontario, dropping moderate rainfall of up to 2.1 inches (53\u00a0mm).[54] Wind gusts reached 37\u00a0mph (60\u00a0km/h) near Toronto, and the winds in combination with the rainfall caused power outages when lines snapped.[55] Hundreds were left without power, though the outages were quickly restored.[56]"

The declaration allocated federal funding to assist in paying for debris removal and the rebuilding of public infrastructure damaged by Ernesto's flooding, including roads, parks, and government buildings.[57][58] The city of Newport News and four additional counties were added later in the areas eligible for federal funding.[59][60][61] In all, FEMA provided about $7.3\u00a0million (2006\u00a0USD) in assistance.[62] Although the state of Virginia applied for individual assistance, the federal government denied the request.[27] Due to debris and waste being carried into waterways by flooding from Ernesto, Virginia officials closed the Chesapeake Bay to shellfishing for four days from the Chesapeake Bay Bridge\u2013Tunnel to the mouth of the Potomac River. In Richmond, officials condemned 70\u00a0homes, prompting city workers to establish temporary homes. By five days after the storm's passage through the state, most of the 600,000\u00a0people who experienced power outages had their electricity restored.[63] Dominion Resources's Tidewater Virginia area was among the most affected, requiring 2\u20133\u00a0days to restore all areas.[64][65] By two days after the storm moved through the area, all major roadways were opened, though secondary roadways took longer to be cleared from debris.[50] Outside of Virginia, the Emergency Operation Centers in Pennsylvania, Delaware, and the District of Columbia were closed. Power crews worked to restore electricity to the affected areas across the region.[66]"

Forming on June 10 in the northwestern Caribbean, the storm moved generally to the north, reaching a maximum intensity of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) before weakening and moving ashore in the Big Bend area of Florida on June 13. Alberto then moved through eastern Georgia, North Carolina, and Virginia as a tropical depression before becoming extratropical on June 14. Across the Western Caribbean, the storm produced heavy rainfall, causing some minor damage. In Florida, a moderate storm tide caused coastal damage and flooding, while Alberto's outer rainbands produced several tornadoes. The storm was indirectly responsible for two drownings off the coast of Tampa Bay. In North Carolina, heavy rainfall caused locally severe flooding, and one child drowned in a flooded storm drain near Raleigh. The remnants of Alberto produced strong winds and left four people missing in Atlantic Canada. Overall, damage was minor along Alberto's path."

        "content": "In early June\u00a02006, an area of convection persisted across Central America and the western Caribbean in association with a broad, nearly stationary trough of low pressure.[1][2] Thunderstorms increased and became more concentrated on June 8 after a tropical wave moved into the western Caribbean,[1] and an upper-level low to its west increased outflow over the system.[3] The disturbance moved slowly north-northwestward, and development was initially inhibited by marginally favorable upper-level winds and land interaction.[4] The system gradually organized,[5] and by June 10 a circulation formed with sufficiently organized convection for the National Hurricane Center to classify it Tropical Depression One. At this point the storm was located about 140 miles (230\u00a0km) south of the western tip of Cuba.[1] The depression tracked to the northwest through the Yucat\u00e1n Channel into an area of increased wind shear, which left the center exposed and elongated.[1][6] Despite its poor structure, the system maintained strong winds in its eastern semicircle. The depression intensified into Tropical Storm Alberto early on June 11 about 260 miles (420\u00a0km) southwest of the Dry Tortugas, based on Hurricane Hunters' reports of flight level winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) in a few convective bands.[1] Upon becoming a tropical storm, the low-level circulation had become better defined, though forecasts predicted the wind shear would increase, preventing significant strengthening of the storm.[7] One forecaster at the National Hurricane Center remarked the system resembled a subtropical cyclone.[8] However, deep convection developed and built westward against the wind shear as the overall organization improved. At the same time Alberto turned northeastward under the influence of an approaching trough.[9] On June 12, the circulation abruptly reformed under the area of deepest convection, which coincided with the storm's passage over the loop current; consequentially, Alberto quickly strengthened to reach peak winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) about 220 miles (350\u00a0km) west-northwest of Tampa, Florida.[1] Though it was projected to track over cooler waters and stay in an area of increased shear, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center predicted Alberto would attain hurricane status and make landfall at that intensity.[10] The storm maintained peak intensity for about 18\u00a0hours,[1] and while accelerating northeastward, Alberto's convection diminished as the cloud pattern became elongated.[11] On June 13, dry air became entrained in the circulation, leaving the center exposed from the convection and the wind field greatly broadened.[12] A partial eyewall developed in the western semicircle of the center; however, winds were well below hurricane force.[13] Alberto continued to weaken, and made landfall at about 1630 UTC on June 13 with 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h) winds in Taylor County, Florida, about 50 miles (80\u00a0km) southeast of Tallahassee.[1] The storm maintained a well-organized structure[14] and banding features over land,[15] while continuing to produce winds of tropical storm force as it moved into Georgia. Early on June 14, the storm weakened to tropical depression status while located near the city of Millen, Georgia. Alberto began to lose tropical characteristics soon thereafter, and about six hours after weakening to a tropical depression it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone.[1] Late on June 14 it accelerated northeastward to emerge into the Atlantic Ocean,[16] and on June 15, it entered the area of responsibility of the Canadian Hurricane Centre.[17] While over open waters, Alberto's remnants began to re-intensify; later that day, the extratropical remnant low attained winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) and a pressure of 969\u00a0mbar while a short distance south of Nova Scotia.[1] At this time, the low presented a well-defined comma structure.[18] After passing near Sable Island,[18] the remnants of Alberto crossed the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland on June 16.[19] The extratropical storm turned to the east-northeast and later to the east as it continued its rapid forward motion, and on June 19 the remnants of Alberto merged with an approaching cold front near the British Isles.[1]"

As Alberto was predicted to continue intensifying, the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane warning from Longboat Key to the mouth of the Ochlockonee River approximately 25\u00a0hours before landfall. A tropical storm warning extended southward to Englewood and westward to Indian Pass. A tropical storm warning was also issued from Flagler Beach, Florida to the mouth of the Santee River in South Carolina.[1] As the storm moved inland, local National Weather Service offices issued flood watches for portions of North Carolina, Virginia, and the Delmarva Peninsula. Additionally, flood and flash flood warnings were issued for some portions of the country from South Carolina through Virginia.[16] While Alberto was becoming extratropical over land, the Canadian Hurricane Centre issued gale warnings for offshore waters of Nova Scotia,[27] and later for Newfoundland. In addition, the Atlantic Storm Prediction Center issued inland wind warnings for coastal regions of Nova Scotia.[28] Due to the prediction for precipitation, the Atlantic Storm Prediction Center posted rainfall warnings for all Atlantic coastal regions of Nova Scotia.[29]"

Upon making landfall on the Florida Panhandle, the storm produced a storm tide which unofficially peaked at 7.3 feet (2.2\u00a0m) at the Crystal River Power Plant.[1] The combination of high surf and the storm tide caused surge flooding along the Florida Panhandle.[33] Six tornadoes were spawned in the state from the outer rainbands of Alberto, none of which caused serious damage.[25][34] Across coastal areas, the storm surge flooding caused minor damage to dozens of homes and closed several roads. Near Homosassa, two people who did not evacuate required water rescue. At Egmont Key State Park, a woman fell off of a boat when a band of showers and surging currents made navigation difficult; her husband and a friend drowned after jumping in to save her without life jackets, though the woman returned safely to the boat.[25] The rainfall caused some temporary road flooding, though precipitation was mostly beneficial in alleviating drought conditions.

Storm tides reached 7.81 feet (2.38\u00a0m) above the mean low-level water mark along Fripp Island, leading to some beach erosion along portions of the coastline. While in the process of becoming extratropical, the rainbands of Alberto spawned seven confirmed tornadoes in the state, most of which rated F0;[1] a National Weather Service report indicated additional tornadoes may have occurred in the state. The tornadoes caused some minor damage, though overall damage in the state was minimal.[37] The remnants of Alberto dropped heavy precipitation across North Carolina, including a nationwide high of 7.16 inches (182\u00a0mm) at the Raleigh National Weather Service Office.[3] Some totals broke previous rainfall records,[38] including the station at Raleigh-Durham International Airport which broke the all-time daily precipitation record for that station. The rainfall led to flooding across the central portion of the state, with 45\u00a0flash flood warnings issued by the Raleigh National Weather Service. Police and firefighters in Wake County performed 47\u00a0water rescues. Additionally, the Raleigh-Wake 9-1-1\u00a0center received more than 1,076\u00a0calls for help. Flash flooding occurred throughout the area, which caused the Crabtree Creek in Raleigh to crest at 23.77 feet (7.25\u00a0m);[39] this was the second highest flood stage on record for the creek. The overflown creek flooded a few cars to their rooftops, and resulted in the closure of the Crabtree Valley Mall. Major flooding was reported elsewhere throughout the region, which closed several roads and damaged some houses.[40] In Franklin County, an eight-year-old boy drowned after getting sucked into a flooded drainage system; the death is considered indirect because the boy was chasing a ball into the drainage system.[1] Near the coast, the storm produced several waterspouts, some of which moved ashore in Dare and Carteret counties. Isolated reports of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) wind gusts resulted in downed trees and minor damage.[41] Rainfall from the storm extended into Virginia, the Eastern Shore of Maryland, and extreme southeastern Delaware.[3] Precipitation totaled 5.8 inches (150\u00a0mm) in Virginia Beach,[42] which caused flash flooding in the Hampton Roads area.

The first tropical cyclone and named storm of the annual hurricane season, Andrea originated from an area of low pressure in the eastern Gulf of Mexico on June\u00a05. Despite strong wind shear and an abundance of dry air, the storm strengthened while initially heading north-northeastward. Later on June\u00a05, it re-curved northeastward and approached the Big Bend region of Florida. Andrea intensified and peaked as a strong tropical storm with winds at 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) on June\u00a06. A few hours later, the storm weakened slightly and made landfall near Steinhatchee, Florida later that day. It began losing tropical characteristics while tracking across Florida and Georgia. Andrea transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over South Carolina on June\u00a07, though the remnants continued to move along the East Coast of the United States, until being absorbed by another extratropical system offshore Maine on June 10. Prior to becoming a tropical cyclone, the precursor to Andrea dropped nearly 12 inches (300\u00a0mm) of rainfall on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. In Cuba, the storm brought flooding, especially in Pinar del R\u00edo Province. Over 1,000\u00a0people fled their homes, mainly along the Cuyaguateje River. A tornado was also spawned in the area, damaging three homes. In Florida, the storm brought heavy rainfall to some areas, causing localized flooding. There were nine tornadoes in Florida, the worst of which touched down in The Acreage and downed power lines and trees, causing significant roof damage to several houses; there was also one injury. After Andrea transition into an extratropical storm, the remnants that also spawned one tornado in North Carolina, though damage was minor. Additionally, minor flooding was reported in some areas of the Northeastern United States. Three fatalities occurred due to weather-related traffic accidents in Virginia and New Jersey. There was a direct death reported after a surfer in South Carolina went missing and was presumed to have drowned.

        "content": "At the end of May 2013, a broad and diffuse cyclonic disturbance developed over eastern Mexico and northern Central America, incorporating the remnants of eastern\u00a0Pacific Hurricane Barbara. As a tropical wave approached from the east, an inverted trough developed on the northern edge of the active region on June\u00a02, setting the stage for the formation of a weak surface low pressure system over the southern Gulf of Mexico the next day.[1] The National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring the system in their Tropical Weather Outlooks,[2] and bulletins were issued every six hours regarding the probability of tropical cyclone formation within 48\u00a0hours.[3] A nearby upper trough created unfavorable conditions for tropical cyclogenesis, subjecting the low to wind shear and abundant dry air that kept it indistinct and disorganized. On June\u00a05, the environment became less hostile, and the system began to improve in structure.[1] On June\u00a05, a Hurricane Hunters flight found a closed center and winds of 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h). In response, the NHC initiated advisories on Tropical Storm Andrea later that day,[4] while centered about 310 miles (500\u00a0km) southwest of St. Petersburg, Florida.[1] Due to somewhat unfavorable conditions, significant strengthening was initially considered unlikely. Early on June\u00a06, deep convection was displaced well to the east and southeast of the center as a result of wind shear up to 29\u00a0mph (47\u00a0km/h).[5] Despite this, Andrea intensified to attain peak winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) at 1200\u00a0UTC that day. Thereafter, unfavorable conditions, including dry air entrainment caused the storm to weaken slightly. At 2200\u00a0UTC on June\u00a06, Andrea made landfall in Dixie County, Florida about 10 miles (16\u00a0km) south of Steinhatchee. Simultaneously, the storm attained its minimum barometric pressure of 992\u00a0mbar (29.3\u00a0inHg).[1] After moving inland on June\u00a06,[1] the NHC noted that extratropical transition was likely within 24\u00a0hours and that it \"could occur sooner if the convective structure does not improve.\"[6] By later on June\u00a07, most of the convection became displaced to the northwest due to dry air. Around that time, the storm began accelerating northeastward at 26\u00a0mph (42\u00a0km/h) due to an approaching mid-latitude trough.[7] Based on ground observations and Doppler weather radar, the system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone at 1800\u00a0UTC on June\u00a07, while located over northeastern South Carolina.[1] The remaining thunderstorms around Andrea became indistinguishable from those associated with a frontal zone over North Carolina.[8] Due to a policy created in response to Hurricane Sandy,[1] the NHC continued to issue advisories on the remnants of Andrea as it remained a threat to the East Coast of the United States.[9] On June\u00a08, it moved rapidly northeastward across the Mid-Atlantic and New England.[1] Because gale-force winds were located well to the southeast of the center, the NHC ceased advisories on the remnants of Andrea.[10] Upon reaching the Gulf of Maine, the extratropical remnants of Andrea were absorbed by another extratropical low pressure area around 0000\u00a0UTC on June\u00a010.[1]"

At 2200\u00a0UTC on June\u00a05, a tropical storm warning was issued from Boca Grande to the mouth of the Ochlockonee River in Florida. Additionally, a tropical storm watch was put into effect for Flagler Beach, Florida to Surf City, North Carolina. At 0900\u00a0UTC on June\u00a06, the tropical storm warning was extended from the mouth of the Ochlockonee River to Indian Pass, Florida. Simultaneously, another tropical storm warning was issued from Flagler Beach, Florida to Cape Charles Light in Virginia. Early on June\u00a07, the tropical storm warning on the Gulf Coast of Florida was expanded to include Boca Grande to the Steinhatchee River in Florida, before being canceled a few hours later. At 0900\u00a0UTC on June\u00a07, the tropical storm warning from Flagler Beach to Surf City was modified to Altamaha River, Georgia to Cape Charles Light. Throughout that day, the tropical storm warning was progressively retracted northward, with the southern terminal being at the Savannah River in Georgia at 1200\u00a0UTC, the Santee River in South Carolina at 1500\u00a0UTC, the Little River Inlet in South Carolina at 1800\u00a0UTC, and finally Surf City at 2100\u00a0UTC. Early on June\u00a08, all tropical cyclone warnings and watches were discontinued.[1] The United States Coast Guard urged marine interests and boaters in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina to take precaution to protect their lives and vessels.[11] In Florida, the Gulf Islands National Seashore closed their campground and a beach front road.[12] Additionally, several states parks were closed and campers were evacuated.[13] At Pensacola Beach, condominium associations asked residents to remove furniture from high balconies due to the anticipation of strong winds.[12] A state of emergency was issued for Taylor County, where two shelters were opened.[14]"

This was over a month earlier than the 1966\u20132009 average date of the first named storm, July\u00a09.[15] The precursor disturbance to Andrea dropped nearly 12 inches (300\u00a0mm) of rain on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in a 24-hour period. In Cuba, the Civil Defense issued a weather alarm for Pinar del R\u00edo Province from June\u00a05 to June\u00a06. There was also a lower-level \"alert\" in the adjacent provinces of Artemisa and Mayabeque. Over 1,000\u00a0people fled their homes due to flooding, especially along the Cuyaguateje River in Pinar del R\u00edo Province. The city of Las Martinas received more than 10 inches (250\u00a0mm) of rainfall in 24\u00a0hours; a few other locations reported over 8 inches (200\u00a0mm) of rain. Of the 24\u00a0dams in Pinar del R\u00edo Province, six had already filled by June\u00a05. The disturbance spawned a tornado in that area, which damaged three homes;[16] four other tornadoes also touched down throughout the country.[1]"

These measurements peaked in Cedar Key, where a station documented a storm surge height of 4.08\u00a0ft (1.24\u00a0m); the same station recorded a storm tide height of 6.26\u00a0ft (1.91\u00a0m).[17] The highest wind measurement was at a mesonet site in Davis Islands, which observed sustained winds of 47\u00a0mph (76\u00a0km/h).[1][17] A total of 10\u00a0tornadoes were spawned in Florida.[1] Near Myakka City, a tornado damaged the roofs of three single family homes, six pole barns, and four outbuildings. One horse and six chickens were killed, and another horse and two dogs were injured. Significant piles of debris and downed power lines covered SR 70 in Myakka City. Damage was estimated at $50,000. Another twister spawned in Sun City Center downed trees and damaged lanais, fascia and shingles. Damage reached approximately $36,000.[17] Andrea dropped locally heavy rainfall in some areas of West Central Florida, with a Community Collaborative Rain, Hail and Snow Network (CoCoRaHS) station observing 6.17 inches (157\u00a0mm) inches of precipitation near Chiefland. Minor street flooding was reported in several counties. Near the city of Coachman, the weight of saturated leaves on the roof of a dog kennel at the Pinellas County Humane Society caused a large section of the roof to collapse. In East Central Florida, the storm produced about 2\u20133 inches (51\u201376\u00a0mm) of rain, with isolated totals of 5\u20136 inches (130\u2013150\u00a0mm) over a three-day period in Orange, Osceola, and Volusia counties.[17] In North Florida, the storm spawned a tornado at the Naval Station Mayport in Jacksonville. A number of \"non-critical\" structures suffered minor impact, while other buildings experienced damaged roofs and broken windows.[17] Strong winds were also observed in the area, with gusts up to 83\u00a0mph (134\u00a0km/h) at the Jacksonville Beach Pier; this was the strongest wind gust associated with the storm.[1] Another tornado was spawned on Amelia Island in Fernandina Beach, though it caused minimal damage.[17] Of the ten tornadoes in Florida, three were spawned in the southern portions of the state. In The Acreage, an EF1 tornado caused minor to moderate roof damage to several homes, mainly in the form of shingles and roof covering torn off. Numerous trees were uprooted or snapped near the trunk, along with several branches falling; this resulted in broken windows in several homes. At one home, the garage door was damaged, causing the door to blow in, which in turn led to the roof being damaged above the garage. An 85-year-old woman was injured after being struck by a falling branch of an oak tree, which broke through her bedroom window. A few vehicles were moved from their original locations, while a 30 feet (9.1\u00a0m) boat was flipped on its side. Another tornado in Belle Glade damaged an awning and downed trees and several power lines. Further south, an EF0 tornado touched down in Broward County and entered Palm Beach County before lifting back up; it resulted in no damage.[17] A convective band associated with Tropical Storm Andrea moved slowly across South Florida, prompting flash flood warnings for Broward and Miami-Dade County Counties. Precipitation peaked at 14.27 inches (362\u00a0mm) in North Miami Beach,[18] 13.96 inches (355\u00a0mm) of which fell in a 24-hour period. Roads became impassable in the Waterways community in Aventura, leaving over 50\u00a0vehicles disabled. In nearby Golden Beach, hundreds of people became stranded in their vehicles, according to city officials. At the Biscayne Bay Campus of Florida International University, 11.71 inches (297\u00a0mm) of rain was observed. A number of stalled vehicles and impassable roads were reported in North Miami, while 24\u00a0families were forced to evacuate due to flooding. Further north in Broward County, the city of Hollywood was particularly hard hit, with 9 inches (230\u00a0mm) of rain observed. Several vehicles became disabled after retention ponds overflowed.[17]"

A surfer in Horry County went missing and was later presumed to have drowned.[1] In several counties along the coast or just inland, trees and power lines were downed.[19] Andrea dropped light rainfall in the state, peaking at 4.9 inches (120\u00a0mm) near Cordova.[1] The storm brought significant amounts of rainfall to North Carolina in short periods of time, with a peak amount of 7.41 inches (188\u00a0mm) near Cameron.[1] In Raleigh, 5.14 inches (131\u00a0mm) of rain fell in 24\u00a0hours, which broke the highest daily precipitation record for the city. Additionally, this total exceeded the average rainfall amount for the month of June.[20] Many streams, creeks, and river overflowed in eastern North Carolina, resulting in numerous street closures in several counties.[17] The Crabtree Valley Mall in Raleigh was closed after the parking lots became inundated. A number of low-lying and creek-side communities in Apex, Cary, Clayton, Durham, and Raleigh were flooded.[20] An EF0 tornado was spawned near Varnamtown, where it downed several trees and damaged a large storage building.[17]"

Poor drainage in some areas resulted in multiple road closures in Caroline and Talbot counties, the latter of which reported about 20\u00a0roads shutdown. Radar estimates of precipitation in Delaware were between 2 and 4 inches (51 and 102\u00a0mm), while 5.19 inches (132\u00a0mm) was observed in Smyrna.

In Delaware County, flooding was reporting along the Chester Creek.[17] Heavy rainfall was reported in New Jersey, amounting to more than 5\u00a0in (130\u00a0mm) in Oceanport. The heavy precipitation resulted in traffic jams and caused flooding along the Millstone and Raritan rivers. Three car accidents were blamed on the storm, two of which were fatal. Numerous roads flooded across the state, leading to several high-water rescues.[21] Overflowing rivers and streams in Bergen and Union counties flooded low-lying and poor drainage areas. The Rockaway River at Boonton reached 5 feet (1.5\u00a0m) above flood stage from the afternoon of June 8 until the following morning.[17] Winds of 35\u00a0mph (56\u00a0km/h) downed some trees and power lines, leaving 500\u20132,000\u00a0residences without power. A plane traveling from Palm Beach, Florida to Boston, Massachusetts had to make an emergency landing at Newark Liberty International Airport after being struck by lightning.[21] In New York, 4.77 inches (121\u00a0mm) fell at Central Park in New York City in only a few hours, causing flash flooding in some areas.

One of the factors that caused the floods was the collapse of the Choqueyapu River, since due to its poor structure in one of its points, and because it is a channel through which wastewater passes, it collapsed during heavy rains. The structure that the city has is characterized by steep slopes and a geological substrate that alternates permeable and impermeable layers, favored the amplification of the accident. Another factor that could cause this incident was the high vulnerability of the city, with intense occupation of risk areas and that it has buildings and infrastructure poorly prepared to face situations like this."

Also, the street was leveled to prevent the effects of a future flood. [2] Lots of shops and street vendors lost their products. Official estimates point out that nearly 60 millions dollars were lost that day. Juan del Granado, mayor of La Paz, stated that relief efforts would go on for 10 days at least with 2000 workers deployed to help the many areas that were affected by the flood. As a result of the flood, 200 families had to abandon their houses. However harsh, the flood didn't affect the whole city. Downtown and the south side of the city were the most affected, along with some north eastern areas of the city.[5] Street markets, such as Uyustus, and Max Paredes were severely affected by the flood."

This led to major flooding and numerous mudslides across portions of Whitley, Perry, Letcher, Leslie, Knox, Harlan, Clay, and Bell Counties. The Governor subsequently declared a State of Emergency for these 8 counties. Major flooding occurred along the Cumberland River at Pineville, Barbourville, and Williamsburg. Additionally, the communities of Loyall and Baxter experienced major flooding. Numerous roads became impassable across large portions of Whitley, Knox, Clay, Leslie, Letcher, Harlan, Perry, and Bell counties. In particular, Harlan County was hit extremely hard with the Kentucky Mesonet site on Black Mountain (4031 foot elevation) receiving over 6.5 inches (170\u00a0mm) of rain over this stretch. Flood gates were closed in Pineville and Harlan, further impacting local travel.[5] A couple of mobile homes were flooded and swept down the Cumberland River in Harlan County, while swift water rescues took place in Bell and Harlan Counties. Elkhorn Dam in Jenkins had water rushing over it for a period of time on February 6.[3] A man went missing in Whitley County and was later found deceased in his car on Kentucky Highway 779 after his attempt to drive into flood waters. A total of seven homes were reported to have been in or under water across Whitley County as the Cumberland River in Williamsburg crested to its third highest stage on record of 34.84 feet (10.62\u00a0m). The city of Pineville saw the river rise to its second highest crest in history at 1019.06 feet, leading to several families being stranded without homes.[citation needed] While impacts were greatest along the Cumberland River, several portions of the Kentucky River also flooded. Several roads were impacted in Hazard and Whitesburg, while Booneville, Heidelberg, and Ravenna also exceeded flood stage.

This season produced only three named storms, of which one only intensified into a very severe cyclonic storm. The North Indian Ocean cyclone season has no official bounds but cyclones tend to form between April and December with the two peaks in May and November. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northern Indian Ocean. The season began with the formation Cyclone Maarutha on April 15 and ended with the dissipation of a deep depression on December 9.

There are two main seas in the North Indian Ocean\u00a0\u2013 the Arabian Sea to the west of the Indian subcontinent, abbreviated ARB by the India Meteorological Department (IMD); and the Bay of Bengal to the east, abbreviated BOB by the IMD. The official Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre in this basin is the IMD, while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) releases unofficial advisories. On average, three to four cyclonic storms form in this basin every season.[1][2]"

        "content": "The season began prematurely, with the formation of Cyclone Maarutha over the Bay of Bengal in mid-April. In May, Cyclone Mora formed over the Bay of Bengal. At its peak, it was equivalent to a marginal Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale. Mora would produce flash flooding throughout Sri Lanka, India, Myanmar and Bangladesh and caused 15 deaths directly and 208 deaths indirectly. The floods persisted in Bangladesh since a Deep Depression over Bay of Bengal made landfall and killed 156 people in Bangladesh. A depression formed in northwestern Bay of Bengal and produced torrential rainfall. It was followed by a depression over Jharkhand which killed 70 people in West Bengal. Under the influence of strong monsoon surge a disturbance developed over Bay of Bengal travelled westwards and intensified to an unnamed depression. It also affected neighboring Karachi in Pakistan. A strong monsoon surge prevented formation of systems until a deep depression formed over West Bengal in October and caused heavy rainfall. A couple of depressions formed between mid-October and November which continued the rain spell causing destruction of life and property. Very Severe Cyclonic Storm Ockhi formed in early December and wreaked havoc in the countries where it impacted. It was equivalent to a strong Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale at peak intensity. The twin storm of Ockhi was a deep depression which originated in Bay of Bengal while its counterpart was in Arabian Sea."

The system moved very fast under the influence of mid-latitude trough in\nwesterlies lying over India in the middle and upper tropospheric levels.[5] However, strong vertical wind shear and unfavourable MJO inhibited rapid intensification or further intensification of the system. Moving northeastwards, it reached its peak intensity in the early hours of 16th. The system maintained its peak intensity till landfall near Sandoway (Thandwe) in Myanmar in the midnight. After landfall, the system weakened into a Deep Depression in early hours of 17th, into a Depression in the morning and well marked low-pressure area over central Myanmar and neighbourhood in the forenoon of 17th.[6] Maarutha had already triggered heavy rainfall as a depression in Sri Lanka, as well as the Andaman and Nicobar Islands (India). Due to a heavy swell in the sea around the Andaman Islands, all ferries to Havelock Island from Port Blair were suspended on leaving nearly 1,500 tourists stranded.[7] In Kyaukpyu, Maarutha destroyed more than 81 households and total damages amounted to Ks31.8\u00a0million (US$23,400) as of April 18.[8] Four people were reported to be killed in the Irrawady division of Myanmar.[9][10]\nMaarutha developed as a depression in the first fortnight of April. Climatologically, the formation of tropical cyclones in the Bay of Bengal at this time of the year is rare. Only twelve Cyclonic Storms have developed over the Bay of Bengal this early in the year between 1891 and 2016."

In the early hours of May 29, the IMD reported the storm to have reached Cyclonic storm intensity, naming it Mora.[11]\nThe storm followed a north-northeasterly track parallel to Myanmar coast. The system moved fast under the influence of mid-latitude trough in westerlies lying over India in the middle and upper tropospheric levels and the anti-cyclonic cyclonic circulation lying to the northeast of the system.[11]\nShortly before landfall, the storm reached its peak intensity as a severe cyclonic storm with winds of 110\u00a0km/h and a minimum central pressure off 978\u00a0hPa (28.9\u00a0inHg). The JTWC analyzed it having reached Category 1 hurricane strength on the same day, with winds of 120\u00a0km/h. At peak intensity, the storm made landfall on the southern coast of Bangladesh near Chittagong at 6:00\u00a0a.m. IST.[11]\nAfter landfall, the storm steadily weakened due to land interaction, before weakening into a well-marked low-pressure area over Nagaland on May 31.[11] A total of 31 people have been killed\u20149 in Bangladesh and 1 in Myanmar and 19 in Manipur[12][13][14]\nDamage throughout all the affected countries totalled almost US$1.37\u00a0billion.[15][16][17] Two people were reported killed in Malda district of West Bengal.[18] Additionally, although not directly related to the storm, the precursor low of Mora strengthened the arrival of the monsoon, which caused heavy flooding in Sri Lanka and the Andaman Islands that killed 208 people."

The 15th and final tropical cyclone of the 2007 Pacific hurricane season, Kiko developed out of a tropical wave that formed off the coast of Africa on September 26 and traversed the Atlantic. The wave crossed over Central America and entered the Pacific Ocean on October\u00a08, where it spawned Tropical Depression 15-E on October\u00a015. The depression drifted to the south over the next day before briefly being declared Tropical Storm Kiko. It subsequently weakened into a tropical depression, but later reattained tropical storm intensity. By October\u00a018, Kiko was forecast to make landfall along the western Mexican coastline as a moderate tropical storm. However, the cyclone turned to the west and reached its peak intensity of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) on October\u00a020. The tropical storm slowly weakened to a remnant low-pressure area by October\u00a024 and completely dissipated on October\u00a027 without making landfall."

        "content": "A tropical wave exited the western coast of Africa on September\u00a026, quickly spawning an area of low pressure. Upon the formation of the low, the wave split into two pieces and a second area of low pressure developed along the southern portion of the wave as it traveled west. The northern low quickly developed, spawning Tropical Depression Fourteen on September\u00a028. The southern low attached to the wave failed to develop and moved away from the intensifying tropical depression. It continued through the Atlantic, entering the Pacific Ocean, after crossing Central America, on October\u00a08. A broad area of low pressure accompanied by showers and thunderstorms developed along the wave around 275 miles (443 kilometres) south of Acapulco, Mexico. However, the low remained disorganized because of strong upper-level winds. On October\u00a013, the low became better organized due to a relaxation in the shear.[1] The low developed enough convection late on October\u00a014 to be declared Tropical Depression Fifteen-E while located about 435\u00a0mi (700\u00a0km) southwest of Colima, Mexico.[2] The depression was embedded within a broad, low-level cyclone with weak steering currents that caused Fifteen-E to drift southward for the next 30\u00a0hours.[1] On October\u00a016, strong easterly wind shear exposed the center of the depression from shower and thunderstorm activity. However, a curving convective band developed around the system, and satellites detected winds of 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h). This prompted the National Hurricane Center to upgrade the depression to Tropical Storm Kiko as it drifted about 430\u00a0mi (690\u00a0km) southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico.[3] The intensification was short-lived, and Kiko was downgraded to a tropical depression six hours later when the center separated from diminishing convection.[4] On October\u00a017, the storm was upgraded to a tropical storm when the low became associated with deep convection.[5] The center remained poorly defined, and winds of tropical storm-force blew only in Kiko's southwest quadrant. Over the next few days, Kiko moved slowly towards the east-northeast as a minimal tropical storm and was forecast to either brush land or to make landfall along the Mexican coast on October\u00a019 or October\u00a020.[6] However, early on October\u00a019, Kiko turned to the northwest when a high-pressure ridge developed over Mexico.[1] Forecasters predicted that the storm would become a strong Category 1 hurricane as it turned away from Mexico and headed to sea.[7] As the ridge pushed the storm away from the coast, weaker wind shear and warm sea-surface temperatures allowed Kiko to gradually intensify. The storm reached its peak intensity of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) 991\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.28\u00a0inHg) late on October 20 while located around 175\u00a0mi (282\u00a0km) west-southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico. As it moved away from the coast, an eye began to form.[1][8] Shortly thereafter, shear increased and began to separate the low from the deep convection.[9] By the afternoon of October\u00a021, the storm was poorly organized and the center was partially exposed. At this time, the weakening system had winds sustained at 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h).[10] Early on October\u00a022, a brief burst in showers and thunderstorms allowed the storm to maintain its intensity.[11] That evening, Kiko was downgraded to a tropical depression as strong wind shear removed convection from the storm's center and exposed the low.[12] As the depression moved over a dryer and more hostile area, two inhibiting factors for development of tropical cyclones, it slowly weakened.[1] It lost almost all convection and degenerated to a remnant low-pressure area on October\u00a023, and the National Hurricane Center issued its final advisory that night.[13] The remnant low moved west before dissipating on October\u00a027 over open waters.[1]"

Above-normal tides and dangerous waves were expected along the coast.[14] Rainfall totals of 4 to 7\u00a0in (100 to 180\u00a0mm) were possible over southwestern Mexico with isolated totals reaching 10\u00a0in (250\u00a0mm). As a precaution, port captains shut down shipping and advised residents to avoid low-lying areas that might flood.[1][15] Civil Defense advised these residents to move to temporary shelters and tourists were told to stay indoors.[16] Emergency procedures were on standby in case conditions became more threatening.[17] As the storm neared land, a ridge over Mexico prevented Kiko from coming ashore, resulting in far less damage than forecast.[1] As Kiko traveled parallel to the coast, heavy rain affected the region for two days.[18] In Kiko's rough seas off the coast of Mexico, a ship capsized with twenty-five\u00a0passengers and crew.[19] Continued effects from Kiko hampered rescue efforts, forcing officials to call off the rescue attempt. Authorities searched the beaches of San Francisco Ixhuat\u00e1n and San Francisco del Mar for any signs of the ship.[20] Only two\u00a0people survived; fifteen\u00a0bodies were recovered, and nine\u00a0passengers were never found.[19]"

        "content": " Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm Nargis (Burmese: \u1014\u102c\u1002\u1005\u103a; Urdu: \u0646\u0631\u06af\u0633, [\u02c8n\u0259r\u0261\u026as]) was an extremely destructive and deadly tropical cyclone that caused the worst natural disaster in the recorded history of Myanmar during early May 2008.[1] The cyclone made landfall in Myanmar on Friday, 2 May 2008, sending a storm surge 40 kilometres up the densely populated Irrawaddy delta, causing catastrophic destruction and at least 138,373 fatalities.[2][3][4] The Labutta Township alone was reported to have 80,000 dead, with about 10,000 more deaths in Bogale. There were around 55,000 people missing and many other deaths were found in other towns and areas, although the Myanmar government's official death toll may have been under-reported, and there have been allegations that government officials stopped updating the death toll after 138,000 to minimise political fallout. The feared 'second wave' of fatalities from disease and lack of relief efforts never materialised.[5] Damage was at $12 billion, making Nargis the costliest tropical cyclone on record in the North Indian Ocean at the time,[6] before that record was broken by Cyclone Amphan in 2020.[7][8][9] The first named storm of the 2008 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, Nargis developed on 27 April in the central area of Bay of Bengal. Initially, the storm tracked slowly northwestward, and encountering favourable conditions, it quickly strengthened. Dry air weakened the cyclone on 29 April, though after beginning a steady eastward motion, Nargis rapidly intensified to attain peak winds of at least 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph) on 2 May, according to IMD observations; the JTWC assessed peak winds of 215\u00a0km/h (135\u00a0mph), making it a weak Category\u00a04 cyclone on the SSHWS. The cyclone moved ashore in the Ayeyarwady Division of Myanmar at peak intensity and, after passing near the major city of Yangon (Rangoon), the storm gradually weakened until dissipating near the border of Myanmar and Thailand.[citation needed] Nargis is the deadliest named cyclone in the North Indian Ocean Basin, as well as the second-deadliest named cyclone of all time, behind Typhoon Nina of 1975.[a] Including unnamed storms like the 1970 Bhola cyclone, Nargis is the fifth-deadliest cyclone of all time, but an uncertainty between the deaths caused by Nargis and those caused by other cyclones (like the 1991 Bangladesh cyclone), could put Nargis as the fourth-deadliest or higher, because the exact death toll is uncertain. Nargis was the first tropical cyclone to strike the country since Cyclone Mala made landfall in 2006, which was slightly stronger, but had a significantly lower impact. According to reports, Indian authorities had warned Myanmar about the danger that Cyclone Nargis posed 48 hours before it hit the country's coast.[citation needed] Relief efforts were slowed for political reasons as Myanmar's military rulers initially resisted large-scale international aid. US President George W. Bush said that an angry world should condemn the way Myanmar's military rulers were handling the aftermath of such a catastrophic cyclone.[10] Myanmar's military junta finally accepted aid a few days after India's request was accepted.[11] Hampering the relief efforts, only ten days after the cyclone, the 2008 Sichuan earthquake occurred nearby and measured 7.9 in magnitude, taking 87,476 lives[12] and causing US$150\u00a0billion in damage in the process, making it the costliest disaster in Chinese history and fourth-costliest disaster ever known. Furthermore, some donated aid items were found to be available in the country's black market, and Myanmar's junta warned on 15 May that legal action would be taken against people who traded or hoarded international aid."

        "content": "Towards the end of April 2008, the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone over the Indian Ocean became very active, with a tropical disturbance developing under its influence during 25 April.[13][14] Over the next couple of days, the disturbance gradually developed further within an area of low vertical wind shear, before it was classified as a depression by the India Meteorological Department early on 27 April.[13] Initially, the depression moved westward and was classified as a deep depression by the IMD, before the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) initiated advisories and classified the storm as Tropical Cyclone 01B later that day.[13][15] The system subsequently started to move north-westwards under the steering influence of an anticyclone and an upper-level ridge of high pressure.[13][16] At 0000\u00a0UTC, 5:30 AM Indian Standard Time, on 28 April, the IMD upgraded the system to Cyclonic Storm Nargis, while it was located about 550\u00a0km (340\u00a0mi) east of Chennai, India.[17] On 28 April, Nargis became nearly stationary, while situated between high-pressure ridges to its northwest and southeast. That same day, the JTWC upgraded the storm to cyclone status, the equivalent of a minimal Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale.[14] Around the same time, the IMD upgraded Nargis to a severe cyclonic storm.[18] The cyclone developed a concentric eye feature, which is an eyewall outside another eyewall,[19] with warm waters aiding in further intensification.[20] Early on 29 April, the JTWC estimated Nargis reached winds of 160\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph),[21] and at the same time, the IMD classified the system as a very severe cyclonic storm.[22] Initially, the cyclone was forecast to strike Bangladesh or southeastern India.[23][24] Subsequently, the cyclone became disorganised and weakened due to subsidence and drier air; as a result, deep convection near the center markedly decreased. At the same time, the storm began a motion to the northeast, around the periphery of a ridge to its southeast.[25] The circulation remained strong despite the diminishing convection, though satellite intensity estimates using the Dvorak technique indicated the cyclone could have weakened to tropical storm status.[26] By late on 29 April, convection had begun to rebuild,[27] though immediate restrengthening was prevented by increased wind shear.[28] On 1 May 2008, after turning nearly due eastward, Cyclone Nargis began rapidly intensifying, due to greatly improved outflow aided by an approaching upper-level trough.[29] Strengthening continued as Nargis developed a well-defined eye with a diameter of 19\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi), and early on 2 May, the JTWC estimated that the cyclone reached peak 1-minute winds of 215\u00a0km/h (135\u00a0mph), as it approached the coast of Myanmar, making it a Category\u00a04 storm.[30] At the same time, the IMD assessed Nargis as attaining peak 3-minute sustained winds of 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph).[31] Around 1200\u00a0UTC on 2 May, Cyclone Nargis made landfall in the Ayeyarwady Division of Myanmar at peak strength.[32] The storm gradually weakened as it proceeded east over Myanmar, with its proximity to the Andaman Sea preventing rapid weakening. Its track turned to the northeast due to the approach of a mid-latitude trough to its northwest, passing just north of Yangon with winds of 130\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph).[33] Early on 3 May, the IMD issued its final advisory on the storm.[34] Nargis quickly weakened after turning to the northeast, toward the rugged terrain near the Myanmar\u2013Thailand border, and after deteriorating to minimal tropical storm status, the JTWC issued its last advisory on Nargis.[35]"

The rainfall left 4,500\u00a0people homeless, and more than 35,000\u00a0people were affected on the island.[41][42] Three people were reported injured on the island, while two were reported dead.[41] The India Meteorological Department recommended that fishermen should not sail on the ocean during the passage of Nargis. Strong waves and gusty winds were expected along the Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh coastline in India.[17] Additionally, the influence of the cyclone lowered temperatures along the Indian coastline, which had been affected by a severe heat wave.[43] When the cyclone was originally expected to strike near Bangladesh, officials requested farmers to hurriedly finish harvesting the rice crop. At the time, the country was experiencing severe food shortages from Cyclone Sidr in the previous year and flooding earlier in the year, and a direct strike from Nargis would have resulted in destroyed crops due to strong winds.[44]"

        "content": "The United Nations estimated that 1.5\u00a0million people were \"severely affected\" by Nargis.[45] It was the deadliest tropical cyclone in the North Indian Ocean since the 1991 Bangladesh cyclone, with estimates of people missing at 53,836 and 84,537 confirmed dead.[3] At least 10,000 people were reported to have perished in the delta town of Bogale alone.[46] The total death total is unknown, as critics of the junta argue that the numbers where unreported to avoid political fallout. It is now thought that hundreds of thousands of people will never be found after Nargis because their bodies have decayed, been buried, or were washed out to sea.[47] Some NGOs estimated that the final death toll would be over 100,000, while one Save The Children's aid worker claimed that the death toll from the cyclone and its aftermath might reach 300,000; if correct, Nargis was the second-deadliest cyclone ever and the fifth-deadliest natural disaster since 1900, after the 1931 China floods.[48][49] Other more deadly natural disasters include the 1887 Yellow River flood, the 1556 Shaanxi earthquake, and the 1970 Bhola cyclone in Bangladesh. Andrew Kirkwood, country director of the British charity Save The Children, stated: \"We're looking at 50,000 dead and millions of homeless, I'd characterise it as unprecedented in the history of Myanmar and on an order of magnitude with the effect of the [2004] tsunami on individual countries. There might well be more dead than the tsunami caused in Sri Lanka.\"[50] Foreign aid workers estimated that 2 million to 3\u00a0million were homeless, often going to one of 260,000 refugee camps in Myanmar. It was likely the worst disaster in Myanmar's history, and the total damages were comparable to that of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.[51] Thousands of buildings were destroyed; in the town of Labutta, in the Ayeyarwady Division, state television reported that 75 percent of buildings had collapsed and 20 percent had their roofs ripped off.[52] One report indicated that 95 percent of buildings in the Irrawaddy Delta area were destroyed.[53] The Ministry of Religious Affairs stated that 1,163 temples were destroyed in Ayeyarwady Division and 284 in Yangon Division.[54] The Burmese government formally declared five regions\u2014Yangon, Ayeyarwady, Bago Divisions and Mon and Kayin States\u2014 as disaster areas.[citation needed] A United Nations official commented as follows: \"It's a bad situation. Almost all the houses are smashed. People are in a terrible situation.\" Another UN official said that \"The Irrawaddy delta was hit extremely hard not only because of the wind and rain but because of the storm surge.\" Burst sewage mains caused the landscape to flood with waste, ruining the rice crop.[55] The Daily Telegraph (UK) reported that food prices in Myanmar could be affected.[56] Woradet Wirawekhin (th: \u0e27\u0e23\u0e40\u0e14\u0e0a \u0e27\u0e35\u0e23\u0e30\u0e40\u0e27\u0e04\u0e34\u0e19), deputy director general of Thailand's Department of Information, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stated on 7 May 2008 that, in reference to a report submitted by Bansan Bunnak (th: \u0e1a\u0e23\u0e23\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e19 \u0e1a\u0e38\u0e19\u0e19\u0e32\u0e04), the Thai ambassador in Yangon, conditions in the city had deteriorated and that most businesses and markets were closed. Mr. Wirawekhin also reported that the locals faced even more adversity in basic subsistence, because local food prices had increased two- or threefold.[57]"

However, many nations and organisations hoped to deliver assistance and relief to Myanmar without delay; most of their officials, supplies and stores were waiting in Thailand and at the Yangon airport, as the Burmese junta declined to issue visas for many of those individuals. These political tensions raised the concern that some food and medical supplies might become unusable, even before the Burmese junta officially accepted the international relief effort.[citation needed]"

Based in Bangkok, the HIC was providing support to the Humanitarian Partnership Team and other humanitarian partners in Yangon, as well as those based in Bangkok.[citation needed] By 8 May 2008, the Foundation for the People of Burma had a team on the ground in Rangoon and beyond providing direct assistance to thousands of refugees.  Since this organisation was administered by Buddhist volunteers and already had tacit permission from the Burmese government, all donations went directly for supplies.[citation needed] The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies had pledged $189,000 for relief.[83] The federation had also launched an appeal of a further CHF73.9\u00a0million.[84] Red Cross spokesman Matt Cochrane said that cyclone survivors needed everything. They needed emergency shelter to keep them dry, including food supplies. He said stagnant waters were a perfect breeding ground for the malaria mosquito, so insecticide-treated nets were needed.[85] The Red Cross suffered a setback when a boat carrying supplies sank when it hit a submerged tree. Everyone aboard survived, but most of the cargo was lost.[86] Ten Red Cross/Red Crescent relief flights carrying medical and shelter supplies were due to land in Yangon on 12 May.[87] Trocaire has been active in Myanmar since 1995 and were the first Irish aid agency to gain access after Cyclone Nargis. Relief work has been conducted mainly through local partners and membership of the international federation Caritas Internationalis. Trocaire had appealed for the focus of humanitarian work in Myanmar not to be lost in the wake of China's more recent earthquake.[88] Save the Children, one of the few agencies allowed to work in Myanmar, said the toll would likely sharply grow in the next few days as help reached isolated areas.[89] On 18 May, it announced that it believed that thirty thousand children younger than five were already facing malnutrition and could starve in under a month if food did not reach them.[90] M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res landed a plane of 40 tons of relief and medical supplies in Rangoon. After clearing customs the supplies were transferred to local MSF warehouses. They have approximately 200 workers in the region, many of whom have been involved in long-term projects there and were already in the region.[91] World Vision launched a US$3\u00a0million appeal and sought to get international aid into the country. Staff on the ground were working to distribute food, water and other non-food items while WV Myanmar managers sought approval from the government to work in the worst affected areas and to bring in aid from outside.[92] Local NGOs also responded to the emergency, many adapting from human-rights or women's focuses to humanitarian emergency relief.[93]"

The reporter was eventually forced to leave the country out of fear of being imprisoned.[124] On 9 May 2008, the junta officially declared that their acceptance of international aid relief would be limited to food, medicines and other supplies as well as financial aid, but would not allow additional foreign aid workers or military units to operate in the country. Samak Sundaravej, Prime Minister of Thailand, stated that, following the request of Eric G. John, US Ambassador to Thailand, he would visit Myanmar on 11 May to urge the junta to open the country. Quinton Quayle, UK Ambassador to Thailand, later remarked that he would also join Sundaravej.[125] However, the junta immediately replied that it was not willing to welcome anyone at this time. Sundaravej said that he would still submit the mediating letter to the junta without delay.[126] The delays had attracted international condemnation. Also, on 9 May in Bangkok, Richard Horsey, spokesperson of the United Nations, urged Myanmar to accept a full scale international relief effort.[127] United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon urged the junta to allow aid in \"without hindrance\". Ban's comments came after the World Food Programme resumed food aid after two shipments of high energy biscuits were stolen by the military.[128] The House of Commons of Canada condemned the Burmese government's response in a resolution passed unanimously on 9 May 2008.[100] Oxfam International's regional chief Sarah Ireland warned that 1.5\u00a0million face death if they did not get clean water and sanitation soon: \"It's really crucial that people get access to clean water sources and sanitation to avoid unnecessary deaths and suffering.\"[129] Myanmar's government seemed unaware of the scope of the death and destruction Cyclone Nargis wrought on the country more than a week ago, it was reported 13 May 2008.[130] Some critics were even suggesting genocide since the Burmese government had deliberately denied storm victims aid, allowing for hundreds of thousands to potentially die from starvation, exposure, and disease.[131] On 16 May 2008, the Burmese UN ambassador accused France of deploying a warship to the Burmese coast. The French UN ambassador denied the LHD Mistral[citation needed] was a warship, and claimed Myanmar's refusal to allow increased aid into the country \"could lead to a true crime against humanity.\"  France stated the ship in question was carrying 1,500 tons of relief supplies.[132]  UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown accused the ruling junta of allowing the disaster to grow into a \"man-made catastrophe\" through its failure to act. He also rebuked the junta as being guilty of inhuman actions.[133] On 19 May, Myanmar agreed to allow aid from members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) to enter. The decision came after an emergency ASEAN summit. The aid would start arriving 21 May. Ban Ki-moon would probably visit the country the same day to \"accelerate relief efforts\".[95] That day, Ban announced that Myanmar was going to \"allow all aid workers regardless of nationality\" to enter, although ships and helicopters were still not expected to be allowed. The announcement came after Ban had met with junta leader General Than Shwe for over two\u00a0hours. Organizations welcoming the announcement included World Vision, the World Food Programme, and the International Rescue Committee.[134] On 23 May, negotiations between UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and Than Shwe resulted in the opening of Myanmar to aid workers, regardless of nationality. Myanmar's government was still staunchly opposed to the presence of military units in the country, only allowing dedicated relief workers.[135]  On 5 June, a USS\u00a0Essex-led American carrier group full of aid left the Burmese coast after being denied entry for several weeks, taking its aid back undelivered.[136] On 27 May, to complicate world opinion and in contrast to numerous and varied accounts from international relief organisations, the Burmese junta praised U.N. aid.[137] On 5 June 2008, Amnesty International released a report saying that at least thirty people had been evicted from refugee camps. The report also indicated that the military was horse-trading aid for physical labour.[136]"

The Philippine protesters delivered the statement that \"this time is not the time for politics, but it is the time to save people.\" The United States Government also demanded that the United Nations not endorse the referendum. Aung San Suu Kyi, leader of the Burmese opposition, also stated that holding a vote for the referendum during this disaster would be a consummately unacceptable act.[58]  About 500 Burmese activists demonstrated on 10 May outside their country's embassy in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, demanding that Burma's military regime call off its constitutional referendum even as voting began despite a devastating cyclone.[139] In a public poll conducted throughout Myanmar on 9 May 2008 by Mizzima, a Myanmar news agency, 64% of those surveyed still intended to vote in the referendum. However, 71% did not know what the constitution was, and 52% had not yet decided whether they would vote to support or oppose it.[140]"

Since Nargis hit right around harvest, a rice shortage and famine could result. The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization estimated that Nargis impacted 65% of the country's paddies. They feel that the situation would be \"devastating... if the recent disaster results in severe rice shortages.\" This might exacerbate the crisis already occurring, but it could be partially alleviated if fall and late summer harvests were good.[162] Myanmar had since appealed for aid to assist with getting the rice planted, as its farmers had a 40- to 50-day window of opportunity before the season's crop would be lost.[163]  The Myanmar government estimated losses of US$10\u00a0billion because of the cyclone.[164]"

        "content": "Hurricane Nicole was the first major hurricane to directly impact Bermuda since Hurricane Fabian in 2003 and equally one of the strongest hurricanes to do so. The fourteenth named storm, sixth hurricane, and third major hurricane of the 2016 Atlantic hurricane season, Nicole formed in the central Atlantic on October\u00a04. The small, slow-moving storm defied forecasts by steadily organizing despite strong wind shear, and it rapidly intensified to a Category\u00a02 hurricane on October\u00a07. The wind shear finally took its toll by October\u00a08, reducing Nicole to a minimal tropical storm, as a building high pressure system forced the storm southward. Intensification began once again as the storm retreated toward Bermuda, and Nicole reached its peak intensity early on October\u00a013 as a Category 4 hurricane with 140\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h) winds. Shortly thereafter, increased vertical wind shear weakened the storm to Category 3, and the eye passed over Bermuda later that day. Afterward, Nicole accelerated northeastwards while gradually weakening, but significantly expanding in size as it traversed the Northern Atlantic. By October 18, decreasing sea surface temperatures caused the large hurricane to become extratropical as it accelerated northwards toward Greenland. The storm's approach and eventual impact on Bermuda forced schools, businesses, and government offices to close, while flight, bus, and ferry services were interrupted. One person drowned due to large swells that Nicole generated along its track that washed ashore along the East Coast of the United States. On the island of Bermuda, several people were injured, but no life-threatening injuries were reported. Overall, damage from Nicole amounted up to $15 million, which was less than what was anticipated."

        "content": "On October\u00a01, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring a weak tropical wave-induced low-pressure area producing scattered showers and thunderstorms, along with winds just shy of tropical storm intensity, over the central Atlantic. Strong wind shear prevented the disturbance from organizing significantly as it tracked northwestward for the next several days.[1] On October\u00a04, satellite data confirmed the presence of a well-defined circulation center with gale-force winds.[2][3] Around the same time, thunderstorm activity became better organized and banding features began to evolve over the eastern side of the disturbance. As a result, the NHC classified the system as Tropical Storm Nicole at 15:00\u00a0UTC, while it was located about 525\u00a0mi (845\u00a0km) northeast of San Juan, Puerto Rico. The storm, still plagued by inhibiting wind shear, was forecast to remain weak.[3][4] Nicole's cloud pattern gradually improved on October\u00a05, partially shielded from the effects of wind shear by an upper-level low situated atop the tropical storm. Although convection remained lopsided, a distinct mid-level eye feature developed within the unusually small cyclone.[5] The storm continued moving generally northwestward around a subtropical ridge to its north.[6] Nicole gradually intensified as it became more symmetrical in appearance, and at 18:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a06, it was upgraded to a Category\u00a01 hurricane about 345\u00a0mi (555\u00a0km) south of Bermuda.[7] A period of rapid intensification brought Nicole to its initial peak intensity as a Category\u00a02 hurricane early on October 7, with sustained winds of 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 968\u00a0mbar (28.6\u00a0inHg). At the same time, a pinhole eye became evident on satellite imagery.[8] Considering the strong shear produced by outflow from powerful Hurricane Matthew to Nicole's southwest, the NHC described this strengthening trend as \"unexpected\".[9] An approaching trough eroded the ridge to the north, leaving the hurricane in an area of very weak steering currents;[10] consequently, its forward movement slowed to nearly stationary.[11] By early on October\u00a07, Nicole had finally felt the effects of strong wind shear and quickly weakened back into a tropical storm.[12] A new blocking high pressure area began forming to the north, driving Nicole slowly toward the south as the storm's convective pattern continued to deteriorate.[13] On the morning of October\u00a08, the storm's center was displaced far to the north of the waning deep convection, and Nicole further declined to a minimal tropical storm.[14] However, later that day, unusually warm sea surface temperatures enabled a \"tremendous burst of deep convection\" close to the center, and Nicole began to reintensify. That the storm was able to survive in spite of as much as 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) of northerly shear proved \"puzzling\" to forecasters.[15][16] Convection oscillated in coverage and intensity throughout the day on October\u00a09; bursts of deep convection, which at one point coalesced into a burgeoning central dense overcast, repeatedly subsided to leave the center exposed. As steering currents slackened, Nicole slowed to a drift before the retreating ridge of high pressure allowed the storm to resume a northward course.[17][18] By the morning of October\u00a010, thunderstorms associated with the tropical storm had \"faded away into a shallow and shapeless cloud mass,\" according to one NHC forecaster.[19] The storm remained disorganized for the next day or so, until several bands of convection began to wrap around a ragged eye feature in response to abating wind shear.[20] Nicole reattained Category\u00a01 hurricane intensity at 18:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a011, and its satellite appearance continued to improve.[21] After meandering westward for a time, the hurricane turned north and soon accelerated toward the northeast as it recurved into the mid-latitude westerlies. While nearing Bermuda, Nicole exhibited a highly symmetrical cloud pattern centered around a large and well-defined eye.[22] The storm underwent another period of rapid intensification, and early on October\u00a013, reached its peak intensity as a Category\u00a04 hurricane with winds of 140\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 950\u00a0mbar (28\u00a0inHg).[23] Shortly thereafter, however, increased vertical wind shear caused Nicole to weaken to a Category 3 hurricane. Between 14:00 and 15:00\u00a0UTC, the western part of the eye of Nicole passed over Bermuda, marking a direct hit, although the exact center of the eye remained just to the east.[24] While passing the islands, the storm's inner core lost some of its structure, and the eye as viewed from radar was tilted to the southwest of the central clearing displayed on satellite.[25] At 09:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a014, southwesterly wind shear reduced the system to Category\u00a01 status, although swells from Nicole affected Bermuda and portions of the U.S. east coast and Atlantic Canada.[26] This strengthening was due to Nicole undergoing a warm seclusion, where a cyclone's warm core is isolated from surrounding cold air, allowing it to intensify.[27] Shortly after, Nicole slowed tremendously, as it became stationed south of a high pressure system.[28] Its wind field started to expand drastically, and Nicole finally transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on October\u00a018, ending its nearly 2-week journey across the Atlantic basin.[29]"

Small boats were removed from marinas for safe storage, while larger vessels that remained in the water were tightly secured.[32] Schools and government offices closed for the duration of the storm, while ferry and bus services were suspended on October\u00a012. Additionally, commercial flights to and from L.F. Wade International Airport were cancelled.[33][34] The threat of the storm prompted three cruise liners to cancel their scheduled stops at Bermuda.[35] As a precaution, officials closed the Causeway late on October\u00a012.[36] Some 140 Royal Bermuda Regiment soldiers were deployed at strategic points, ready to assist in the aftermath of the storm.[37] At the Cedarbridge Academy, a government shelter was opened with cots and emergency supplies for storm victims.[38] Bermuda's only daily newspaper, The Royal Gazette, did not go to print on October 13.[39] With adverse weather conditions expected to impact a crucial NASA rocket tracking site in Bermuda, the launch of an International Space Station resupply spacecraft from Virginia's Wallops Flight Facility was postponed.[40] The mission had already been delayed, in part due to the threat of Hurricane Matthew.[41] Strong swells from the slow-moving storm started affecting Bermuda on October\u00a06.[42] Later, on October 11, gusty winds along the periphery of Nicole's circulation caused a brief power outage.[43] As the core of the hurricane passed over Bermuda, a weather station on Pearl Island recorded sustained winds of 87\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) with gusts to 119\u00a0mph (192\u00a0km/h).[24] An elevated station at Commissioner's Point recorded slightly higher winds.[44] Nicole also dropped extremely heavy rainfall, amounting to 6.77\u00a0in (172\u00a0mm).[42] The strong winds brought down trees and powerlines, leaving 27,341 households\u2014approximately 90% of all electric customers in the territory\u2014without service.[45] Service was predominately restored within a few days, though isolated outages reappeared well after the storm's passage, when salt deposits began disrupting the electric power distribution system.[46] The terminal building at L.F. Wade International Airport was partially unroofed, and rainwater leaks were reported throughout the facility.[47] Agriculture took a significant hit, as the storm destroyed fields of fruit and vegetable crops in various stages of growth. At least one farmer reported a nearly total loss of young vegetable plants.[48] Dozens of boats, some up to 80\u00a0ft (24\u00a0m) in length, were ripped from their moorings and left damaged, sunken, or crushed upon rocky sections of coastline.[49] Low-lying roadways and buildings were flooded, and some homes sustained roof damage, but the hurricane proved less destructive than initially feared. No fatalities or serious injuries were reported, although seven individuals were hospitalized with minor weather-related injuries.[50][51] An unusually high number of blackpoll warblers were spotted in Bermuda after Hurricane Nicole disrupted their transoceanic migration, forcing them to seek shelter.[52] Insured loss were counted at $15 million.[53]"

Coastal roads in Ft. Lauderdale became submerged with waves rolling into streets.[58] In Rodanthe, North Carolina, a large breaking wave pulled two teenagers out to sea; one managed to swim to shore safely while the other drowned. The United States Coast Guard assisted in search and rescue for nearly two days before the boy's body washed ashore.

        "content": " Typhoon Gaemi, known in the Philippines as Super Typhoon Carina, was a powerful and destructive tropical cyclone which impacted East China, Taiwan, and the Philippines in late July 2024. Gaemi, which means ant in Korean, the third named storm and second typhoon of the annual typhoon season, formed as a tropical depression east of Palau on July 19. Owing to favorable environmental conditions, the typhoon intensified and reached its peak with ten-minute maximum sustained winds of 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph), and a central atmospheric pressure of 940\u00a0hPa (27.76\u00a0inHg). With one-minute sustained winds at 230\u00a0km/h (145\u00a0mph), Gaemi was classified as a Category 4-equivalent typhoon. The storm then turned north-northwestward, along the western periphery of a subtropical ridge. After stalling and executing a tight counter-clockwise loop near the coast, Gaemi slightly weakened due to land interaction before making landfall on the northeastern coast of Taiwan on July 24. It emerged over the Taiwan Strait just six hours after landfall. Gaemi made landfall in China as a minimal tropical storm in the Xiuyu District of Putian in Fujian Province. Once inland, the system weakened to a tropical depression by July 27 and continued tracking the system until it dissipated on July 29. Together with the southwest monsoon and Tropical Storm Prapiroon, heavy rains were reported over southern and northern Luzon, triggering widespread flash floods in various areas of the region. The monsoon enhanced by Gaemi's impact on Luzon led to comparisons to 2009's Typhoon Ketsana.

        "content": "The origins of Typhoon Gaemi can be traced back to July 17, when the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) reported that a low-pressure area had formed east of Palau.[1] Environment was generally favourable for tropical cyclogenesis, with warm sea surface temperatures of 27\u201328\u00a0\u00b0C (81\u201382\u00a0\u00b0F), low vertical wind shear and excellent poleward and equatorward outflow. Satellite imagery indicated that formative convective banding had begun to wrap into the centre of circulation.[2] After slowly consolidating for two days, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert for the system on July 19, due to its rapidly consolidating broad low-level circulation center.[3] Shortly after, both the JMA and the JTWC followed suit and upgraded the tropical depression, with the latter designating the system as 05W.[4][5] The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration followed suit a few hours later, upgrading the system from a low-pressure area to a depression and assigning it the name Carina.[6] Early the following day, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm and was named Gaemi by the JMA.[7] Gaemi's deep convection later began to consolidate into a small central dense overcast, with cloud tops reaching temperatures of \u221290\u00a0\u00b0C (\u2212130\u00a0\u00b0F).[8] It then intensified into a severe tropical storm due to being in a conducive environment for development on July 21.[9] The storm displayed convective banding features around its western periphery, wrapping into a low-level center of circulation.[10] Around 00:00 UTC on July 22, the JMA then reported that Gaemi had intensified into a typhoon due to good upper-level outflow, warm sea surface temperatures, and high ocean heat content.[11] Gaemi then turned north-northwestward, along the western periphery of a subtropical ridge.[12] As it remained quasi-stationary six hours later, due to a weak steering environment between the subtropical ridge to the northwest and east, the JTWC upgraded Gaemi to minimal typhoon-equivalent status around 21:00 UTC that day.[13] After undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle and developing a pinhole eye, Gaemi rapidly intensified and peaked at Category 4-equivalent intensity on the Saffir-Simpson scale at 21:00 UTC on July 23, with 1-minute sustained winds of 230\u00a0km/h (145\u00a0mph).[14] The JMA reported that Gaemi reached its peak intensity at 06:00 UTC that day with 10-minute sustained winds of 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph) and a central pressure of 940\u00a0hPa (27.76\u00a0inHg).[15] A study by World Weather Attribution in August 2024 suggests that Gaemi's extreme winds and heavy precipitation were exacerbated by climate change.[16] After stalling and executing a tight counter-clockwise loop near the coast,[17] Gaemi slightly weakened into a below-equivalent typhoon status due to land interaction before it made landfall on the northeastern coast of Taiwan on July 24.[18] Gaemi accelerated as it moved across the island and emerged into the Taiwan Strait just six hours after making landfall.[19] The system quickly weakened to a minimal tropical storm as it made its closest approach offshore of eastern China.[20] Soon after,[21] the JTWC ceased issuing advisories on the system as it made its final landfall at Xiuyu, Putian in Fujian Province.[22] Once inland, the JMA downgraded Gaemi into a tropical depression on July 27 and continued tracking the system until it dissipated at 18:00\u00a0UTC on July 29.[23][24]"

The PAGASA expected winds of up to 61 km/h (69 mph) in these provinces.[27] On the morning of July 23, PAGASA raised to Signal No. 2 warning in Batanes as Gaemi's outer rainbands began to affect the province.[28] Classes in all levels and several local government units were suspended in some areas of Luzon including Metro Manila on July 23 due to the storm.[29][30] Several commercial flights were cancelled at Ninoy Aquino International Airport, as well as flights in Basco, Cagayan, and Tuguegarao. Ship travel was suspended in Itbayat.[31] The Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office (PDRRMO) in La Union raised a red alert on July 21, requiring all personnel to be readied for deployment. Emergency staff were deployed to operations centers where stockpiles of supplies and vehicles were prepared. Government offices in the province closed on the afternoon of July 23, with only emergency staff remaining. Immuki Island was isolated as a result of suspended sailing. Beaches in San Juan were closed to visitors, as well as Tangadan Falls in San Gabriel.[32] On July 21, the government of Iloilo City began a preemptive  evacuation. Documentation began to prepare funding of \u20b110,000 (US$171) to occupants of destroyed dwellings and \u20b17,000 (US$120) to those of partially destroyed dwellings.[33] In the Cordillera Administrative Region, \u20b173.6 million (US$1.2 million) worth of family food packages, totaling 25,357, were propositioned at multiple warehouses. In addition, approximately \u20b152.7 million (US$899,000) worth of non-food supplies were gathered at these warehouses.[34] The PDRRMO office in Pangasinan issued a red emergency alert, allocating 64,564 packages of supplies, as well as a standby fund of \u20b186.75 million (US$1.48 million).[35] The Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) prepared their stock fund of \u20b12.5 billion (US$42.8 million) for assistance during the typhoon. A total of 129,735 family food packages were positioned at warehouses and resource centers in Pasay, 93,516 packages were positioned in Mandaue, and 442,125 packages were made available at DSWD Offices No. 3, 5, and 6. The Philippine Air Force readied three Tactical Operations Group for response to the typhoon, including water rescue crews and helicopters for search and rescue and to serve as air ambulances. Rapid response teams trained for recovery efforts and damage assessments were also readied in Clark, Davao City, Laoag, Mactan, and the Zamboanga Peninsula.[36]"

Initially moderate upper-level wind shear inhibited organization, while strong diffluence aloft aided in developing convection.[8] Vertical shear decreased greatly as the circulation became better defined, and a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert was issued on November 11 while located a short distance south of the Andaman Islands.[9] Around the same time, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) designated the system as Depression BOB 09.[10] The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) upgraded it to Tropical Cyclone 06B after Dvorak estimates indicated winds of 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph).[11] Later that day, it intensified into a deep depression as it moved slowly north-westward.[12] The IMD upgraded the system to Cyclonic Storm Sidr early on November 12.[13] The system then began to intensify quickly as it moved slowly northwestward, and the IMD upgraded it to a severe cyclonic storm later that day[14] and a very severe cyclonic storm early the next day.[15] On the morning of November 15, the cyclone intensified to reach peak winds of 215\u00a0km/h (135\u00a0mph) according to the IMD,[16] and a peak of 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph) according to the JTWC best track.[17] Sidr officially made landfall around 17:00 UTC later that day,[18] with sustained winds of 215\u00a0km/h (135\u00a0mph).[19] It weakened rapidly after landfall and the final advisories were issued early on November 16.[20]"

Dhaka and other parts of Bangladesh experienced drizzle and gusty winds.[24] Total losses reached 196.25\u00a0billion taka (US$2.31\u00a0billion).[26] Storm surges reaching up to a height of 3 metres (9.8\u00a0ft) were reported in the coastal areas of north Chennai in southern state of Tamil Nadu in India, triggering panic among the fishing community.[27][28] The damage in Bangladesh was extensive, including tin shacks flattened, houses and schools blown away and enormous tree damage. Some local officials have described the damage as being even worse than that from the 1991 cyclone.[29] The entire cities of Patuakhali, Barguna and Jhalokati District were hit hard by the storm surge of over 5\u00a0meters (16\u00a0ft).[30] About a quarter of the world heritage site Sunderbans were damaged. Researchers said mangrove forest Sunderban will take at least 40 years to recover itself from this catastrophe.[31]\nMuch of the capital city of Dhaka was also severely affected, as electricity and water service were cut and significant damage was reported there due to winds and flooding.[32] The local agricultural industry was also devastated, as many rice crops\u00a0\u2014 which have a December harvest\u00a0\u2014 were lost.[33] At least 3,447 deaths have been reported.[4] The hardest-hit area was Barguna, where 423 people were reported to have been killed, according to local officials. Patuakhali was also hard-hit, with 385 deaths reported.[32] Most of the deaths confirmed thus far were due to the winds, although 13 of them have been as a result of capsized boats in the Faridpur district of Bangladesh.[34] The head of the Red Crescent in Bangladesh expected the death toll to reach as high as 15,000.[35] Over 3,000 other fishermen were reported missing on over 500 fishing boats.[36] The maximum estimated death toll from Sidr in the densely populated region is over 15,000.[5]"

Sidr may be the strongest cyclone to hit the country since a cyclone killed over 143,000 Bangladeshis in 1991.\nAlthough, the deaths from Sidr number in the thousands but damage to homes, crops and livelihoods could be extensive and were reportedly worst. Effective early warning, cyclone shelters and disaster relief measure implementations helped reduce the death toll.[37] Under a Cyclone Preparedness Program, volunteers evacuated at least 600,000 Bangladeshis in the path of the storm. Many are housed in 1,800 multipurpose disaster shelters built along the coast. Relief organizations distributed seven-day emergency disaster kits of food, blankets and clothing for evacuated families. Since 1991, the donor community, including the US and EC, has supported disaster-preparedness to mitigate the impact of tropical storms and improve post-disaster relief and reconstruction. Cyclone walls planted within trees are in place to protect vulnerable areas from storm surges. Disaster shelters on stilts housing refugees plus early warning systems and timely evacuations appear to have greatly reduced the fatalities from Sidr. It killed around 15,000 people, the highest number since a cyclone killed nearly 140,000 in the region in 1991.[38][39] With wind velocities of up to 260\u00a0km/h, Cyclone Sidr has been named one of the 10 strongest and deadliest cyclones to strike the region of Bangladesh between 1876 and 2010.[40]"

At the time, it was the strongest hurricane in the Atlantic since Igor in 2010.[1] Gonzalo struck Bermuda less than a week after the surprisingly fierce Hurricane Fay; 2014 was the first season in recorded history to feature two hurricane landfalls in Bermuda. A powerful Atlantic tropical cyclone that wrought destruction in the Leeward Islands and Bermuda, Gonzalo was the seventh named storm, sixth and final hurricane and only the second major hurricane of the below-average 2014 Atlantic hurricane season. The storm formed from a tropical wave on October 12, while located east of the Lesser Antilles. It made landfall on Antigua, Saint Martin, and Anguilla as a Category\u00a01 hurricane, causing damage on those and nearby islands. Antigua and Barbuda sustained US$40\u00a0million in losses, and boats were abundantly damaged or destroyed throughout the northern Leeward Islands. The storm killed three people on Saint Martin and Saint Barth\u00e9lemy. Gonzalo tracked northwestward as it intensified into a major hurricane. Eyewall replacement cycles led to fluctuations in the hurricane's structure and intensity, but on October 16, Gonzalo peaked with maximum sustained winds of 145\u00a0mph (235\u00a0km/h). After Hurricane Fay caused extensive power outages on the island just days before, residents of Bermuda were forced to complete preparations for Gonzalo in haste. Banks, businesses, schools, and government offices closed in advance of the storm, while the Royal Navy ship HMS\u00a0Argyll left its post in the Caribbean to provide Bermuda with emergency assistance. The cyclone gradually weakened before crossing directly over central Bermuda at Category\u00a02 strength around 00:30 UTC on October 18. Gonzalo battered the island with wind gusts as high as 144\u00a0mph (232\u00a0km/h), downing hundreds of trees and creating widespread roof damage. At the height of the storm, about 31,000 out of 36,000 total electricity customers were without power; service was not fully restored until early November. Many roads were impassable immediately following the hurricane, and in many cases, the damage done by Gonzalo was indistinguishable from that of Fay. Bermuda Regiment soldiers and sailors from the Argyll took part in initial cleanup and repairs on the territory, and preliminary assessments revealed that the storm did not compare to the devastation of Hurricane Fabian in 2003. Catastrophe modelling firms estimated that Bermuda suffered at least $200\u00a0million in insured losses, and despite the heavy disruptions, no deaths or serious injuries were reported there. Departing Bermuda, Gonzalo accelerated toward the waters of the North Atlantic, passing close to southeastern Newfoundland before becoming extratropical on October 19. Gusty winds and bands of heavy rain in the southeastern Avalon Peninsula engendered minor flooding and power outages. A large storm system involving the remnants of Gonzalo battered the British Isles and central Europe on October 21, killing three people in the United Kingdom and severely hindering transportation. The system later played a role in triggering torrential rains over the Balkans, which resulted in severe flooding in Greece and Bulgaria."

        "content": "Hurricane Gonzalo originated from a tropical wave that emerged from the western coast of Africa on October\u00a04 and trekked across the Atlantic. Despite an attendant expanse of clouds and thunderstorms, hostile winds from an upper-level trough hindered cyclogenesis. On October 10, after encountering an eastward-propagating Kelvin wave, the system developed more concentrated convection. With conditions increasingly favorable for further development, the disturbance gradually became better organized, forming a small low-pressure area by October 11. In turn, a tropical depression formed at 00:00\u00a0UTC on October 12, located approximately 390\u00a0mi (630\u00a0km) east of the Leeward Islands. Continued maturation amid warm waters and low wind shear yielded Tropical Storm Gonzalo 12 hours later.[2] Operationally, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) did not begin issuing advisories on the cyclone until midday on October 12, after a Hurricane Hunter flight into the system reported surface winds of 40\u00a0mph (65\u00a0km/h).[3] A powerful ridge over the central Atlantic steered the nascent storm westward toward the Lesser Antilles.[2] Thunderstorm activity was strong near the center was initially somewhat disorganized and asymmetric.[4] However, a tight inner core soon took shape, and Gonzalo began to quickly intensify throughout the day on October 12. Following the appearance of an eye feature early the next day, the storm was upgraded to a Category\u00a01 hurricane while located near Antigua in the eastern Caribbean. Shortly thereafter, the storm passed directly over the island.[2] The hurricane later struck Saint Martin and Anguilla, and skirted just north of the British Virgin Islands while continuing to intensify.[2] By that time, it was headed toward the northwest around the periphery of the aforementioned ridge.[5] On October 14, the eye contracted to a diameter of 17\u00a0mi (27\u00a0km) and improved its satellite presentation.[6] At 18:00\u00a0UTC, Gonzalo strengthened to a Category\u00a03 major hurricane while located about 170\u00a0mi (275\u00a0km) north of San Juan, Puerto Rico.[2] Six hours later it became the first Category\u00a04 hurricane in the Atlantic basin since Hurricane Ophelia in 2011. Subsequently, a concentric eyewall structure indicated an imminent eyewall replacement cycle, with the inner feature \"about as small as it can get\" according to the NHC.[7] The eyewall replacement cycle briefly disrupted the storm's core, causing Gonzalo to weaken slightly,[8] but upon completion on the evening of October 15, the system stabilized and resumed intensification.[9][10] While moving northward early the next day, Gonzalo reached its peak intensity with winds of 145\u00a0mph (235\u00a0km/h) and a barometric pressure of 940 mbar (hPa; 27.76\u00a0inHg). By evening it had turned north-northeastward, ahead of an advancing trough over the eastern United States and in the wake of the receding ridge.[2] From the evening of October 16 through the next morning, the hurricane experienced further internal fluctuations as it approached Bermuda from the south-southwest. Concurrently, the storm began to weaken.[2][11] In particular, cloud tops around the hurricane warmed, and convection became less uniform, likely attributable to cooler waters and heightened wind shear.[12] The hurricane was downgraded to Category\u00a02 as the northern eyewall crossed Bermuda,[13] and about 00:30\u00a0UTC on October 18, the center of circulation passed directly over the island, signaling an official landfall. Along with Hurricane Fay, which struck Bermuda on October 12, this represented the first recorded instance of two hurricanes making landfall on the island within the same season.[2] Moving away from Bermuda, the hurricane continued to degrade,[14] but showed signs of increased organization later on October 18.[15] As Gonzalo accelerated northeastward at over 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h),[16] it passed about 50 miles (80\u00a0km) southeast of Newfoundland's Avalon Peninsula early on October 19.[2] In spite of sea surface temperatures below 50\u00a0\u00b0F (10\u00a0\u00b0C), the storm was able to maintain a central dense overcast and deep warm core.[17] By 18:00\u00a0UTC, Gonzalo had finally succumbed to the cold environment and intense wind shear, completing its transition into a strong extratropical cyclone about 460\u00a0mi (740\u00a0km) northeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland. Gonzalo's remnants sped east-northeastward until a frontal boundary absorbed it on October 20, to the south-southwest of Iceland. The resultant system brought stormy weather to the British Isles and parts of mainland Europe on October 21,[2] and later contributed to the formation of a large cut-off low.[18]"

        "content": "When Gonzalo first formed, various governments across the eastern Caribbean issued tropical cyclone warnings and watches, extending from Guadeloupe to the coast of Puerto Rico. As the storm was strengthening and moving through the region, a hurricane warning was issued for the British Virgin Islands, Anguilla, and Saint Martin.[2] Several major cruise lines altered their itineraries to avoid the storm.[19] Late on October 14, while Gonzalo was still about 700 miles (1,125\u00a0km) to the south, the Bermuda Weather Service issued a hurricane watch for the island. The watch was upgraded to a warning the next day.[2] Having been affected by the unexpectedly destructive Hurricane Fay just days earlier, residents quickly began preparing for Gonzalo by obtaining emergency supplies and expediting cleanup efforts from the previous storm.[20] Premier of Bermuda Michael Dunkley advised citizens to complete most preparations by the afternoon of October 16.[21] Banks and businesses began closing that day,[22] while schools and government offices were closed by October 17.[23] One school functioned as a storm shelter,[24] and 66 people ultimately sought refuge there.[25] Bus and ferry services were suspended on the evening of October 16.[24] Bermuda's only daily newspaper, the Royal Gazette, did not go to print on October 17, but distributed the next day's edition for free.[26] Bermuda Regiment soldiers were stationed at various points to support emergency response crews and ensure the safety of the public.[27] The Caribbean Electric Utility Services Corporation (CARILEC) sent linemen to assist the Bermuda Electric Light Company (BELCO) crews in the event of power outages from Gonzalo. Still completing restoration work after massive outages from Fay, BELCO stationed vehicles and supplies at strategic points on the island to prepare for the next hurricane.[28] On the morning of October 16, BELCO switched its focus from Fay to Gonzalo, leaving around 1,500 households without power; the remaining affected customers were asked to refrain from calling to report outages.[29] Ahead of the storm, the Royal Navy frigate HMS\u00a0Argyll sailed from the Caribbean to provide Bermuda with emergency assistance.[30] Public beaches were closed as hurricane swells began to build, and the decision was made to shut down the Causeway early on October 17, based on forecasts of long-duration severe winds.[24] Additionally, L.F.\u00a0Wade International Airport closed prior to the storm's onslaught,[31] accounting for 62 canceled commercial flights. Three cruise ships were diverted from the island.[32]"

C. Bird International Airport to delay its return to operation after closing as a precaution.[34] Numerous homes sustained damage, largely to their roofs, with the Saint George Parish suffering the greatest losses.[35] Farming communities and a variety of crops were severely impacted,[33] which sparked concerns of imminent produce shortages.[36] Some growers lost their entire banana crops.[33] Barbuda experienced gusts as high as 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h),[2] as well as radar-estimated rainfall of up to 6\u00a0in (150\u00a0mm).[33] Although Barbuda was subject to less widespread devastation than its twin island, there were still snapped tree limbs, reports of flooding, and disruptions to utility services.[37] Damages to residences, government buildings, and agriculture on Antigua contributed to Antigua and Barbuda's national storm cost of around US$40\u00a0million,[33][35] which also includes compensation to American Airlines for not meeting departing passenger quotas during the hurricane.[38] Numerous individuals were treated for minor storm-related injuries, none of them life-threatening.[39] Further west, Gonzalo caused minor power outages on Saint Kitts and Nevis,[40] while a general 1\u20132\u00a0in (25\u201351\u00a0mm) of rain accompanied wind gusts to 58\u00a0mph (93\u00a0km/h) on Guadeloupe.[41] The storm wrecked dozens of boats around Saint Martin, including 22 in Simpson Bay Lagoon, and an elderly man aboard one of the stricken vessels was killed. Two people on Saint Martin and Saint Barth\u00e9lemy went missing in the storm,[42] and were presumed dead after remaining unaccounted for several months later.[2] Fourteen other missing individuals were returned alive.[43] Winds on Saint Barth\u00e9lemy blew 86\u00a0mph (138\u00a0km/h) sustained, with gusts to 126\u00a0mph (203\u00a0km/h).[2] Fallen trees obstructed streets, and an aircraft flipped over on a runway at Gustaf III Airport.[44] As many as 40 boats were reportedly beached on Saint Barth\u00e9lemy.[45] On Saint Martin, sustained winds exceeded 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h), and L'Esp\u00e9rance Airport recorded gusts to 93\u00a0mph (150\u00a0km/h) before the observing equipment failed. As much as 5.70\u00a0in (145\u00a0mm) of rain fell over the island.[2] Reports of urban flooding and entrance of water into homes were common.[46] Gonzalo impaired water and electricity services throughout Dutch Sint Marteen and inflicted significant damage to homes. The St. Maarten Zoo sustained heavy structural damage, though all resident animals survived unharmed.[42] The French side of the island incurred relatively little destruction, with scattered roof and window damage,[46] though Orient Beach \"was a scene of complete devastation\"; several businesses there suffered extensively.[47] Emergency responders and military aircraft from Martinique were dispatched to aid in post-storm recovery on Saint Barth\u00e9lemy and Saint Martin.[48][49] Heavy rain on Anguilla flooded the Clayton J. Lloyd International Airport and portions of several districts, qualifying the government for a US$500,000 \"excess rainfall\" insurance payout.[50] The eastern and western ends of the island bore the brunt of the storm, facing damage to utility poles, vegetation, and roofs,[40] and public schools did not reopen until October 20 or later.[51] The sole hospital experienced minor flood damage.[40] Gonzalo produced squally weather in parts of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, causing power outages and prompting 20 people to stay in an emergency shelter.[52][53] Cyril E. King Airport on Saint Thomas was temporarily closed due to the storm;[53] the airport endured blustery conditions, with gusts reaching 35\u00a0mph (56\u00a0km/h).[54] Elsewhere, rough seas affected parts of the Greater Antilles and the Bahamas.[55]"

        "content": "Gonzalo generated hurricane-force winds across Bermuda over a period of about six hours, at their strongest from the northwest on the backside of the storm.[2] Tropical storm conditions persisted for up to 24 hours.[56] Elevated weather stations observed the highest winds; Commissioner's Point recorded 10-minute sustained winds of 109\u00a0mph (175\u00a0km/h), and St. David's measured gusts as high as 144\u00a0mph (232\u00a0km/h). Gusts reached 113\u00a0mph (182\u00a0km/h) at the Causeway, closer to sea level.[2] The airport recorded 2.85\u00a0in (72\u00a0mm) of rain, but due to the strong winds, this was most likely an underestimation of what actually fell. The passage of the hurricane's eye was marked by diminished winds and a lack of rain, but a drizzle of ocean mist reportedly fell over the island.[56] As Gonzalo struck at low tide, the effects of storm surge were minimal. At Esso Pier on the north side of the island, storm tides peaked at 3.25\u00a0ft (0.99\u00a0m) above normal.[2][56] The intense winds brought down utility poles and hundreds of trees (likely exacerbated by saturated ground from record rainfall in the months prior), leaving \"barely a road\" passable.[56][57][58] The storm razed several invasive species, with endemic trees proving more resilient.[58][59] A composting facility received 1,200 truckloads of plant debris per day after Fay and Gonzalo, up from an average of 100.[60] Damage from the storms totaled around US$260,000 on Bermuda National Trust properties, which include nature preserves and cemeteries.[61] Similarly, the Bermuda Botanical Gardens and Arboretum were closed due to safety hazards resulting from extensive vegetation damage.[62] The first storm-related power outages took place in the early afternoon on October 17 as weather conditions worsened.[63] At the height of the storm, about 31,000 out of 36,000 electricity customers were without power,[64][65] including the 1,500 outages left unresolved after Fay.[66] Backup CARILEC crews helped with specialty assignments, such as commercial outages and homes without power since before Gonzalo's onslaught.[67] Service was not fully restored until November 3,[56] and BELCO ultimately spent US$2.9\u00a0million on system repairs after hurricanes Fay and Gonzalo. The company replaced 228 utility poles, 80 transformers, and over four miles (6.4\u00a0km) of wire.[68] Other utilities, such as television and Internet services, also suffered, and technicians handled individual outages deep into the month of November.[56] About six hundred streetlights on main roads and several hundred more on side-streets were inoperative following the hurricane; some remained unmended through January 2015.[69] Structural damage ranged from the superficial to complete wall or roof failure, the latter being relatively uncommon.[56] A multitude of buildings, including churches, a visitor's center, the House of Assembly building in Hamilton, and the Bermuda Police Service headquarters at Prospect Camp, suffered some degree of roof damage.[70][71][72] Older structures were particularly prone to substantial damage,[2] as were commercial storage buildings subject to less strict building codes.[73] In December, five new slate quarries were approved to accommodate the demand for roofing materials.[74] Both the new and the old portions of King Edward\u00a0VII Memorial Hospital received significant damage that exposed the facilities to the elements.[75] An exhibit at the Bermuda Aquarium, Museum and Zoo was unroofed, and coastal erosion threatened to encroach on the site, though no animals were harmed.[76] Part of the structure's roof was blown a one-quarter mile (400\u00a0m).[77] L.F. Wade International Airport sustained some roof and runway lighting damage,[78][79] and the Bermuda Weather Service building lost a storm shutter and saw water forced inside a communications room.[56] A restaurant at the site of the Gibbs Hill Lighthouse was severely damaged, requiring a complete roof replacement.[80] The Causeway was largely spared, with some damage to the safety walls alongside the road, and it was partially reopened on October 18 after initial repairs.[72] However, one of two lanes remained shut down for several days.[56] Many boats were washed ashore and damaged or wrecked by the storm,[57] and other vessels tipped over in boatyards.[77] According to preliminary estimates, properties in the Dockyard alone incurred US$1\u00a0million (2014 BMD) in damage.[71] The strongest hurricane to directly affect Bermuda since 2003's Hurricane Fabian,[2] Gonzalo was generally less destructive.[81] Damage modelling firms estimated insured losses from the hurricane to settle between US$200\u00a0million and US$400\u00a0million, not including damage to watercraft,[2][82] though the CEO of the largest property insurer on Bermuda believed losses to be much lower.[73] It was estimated that a Fabian equivalence in 2014 would cause about US$650\u00a0million in damage.[83] Some insurance companies decided to treat Fay and Gonzalo as a single event, allowing one deductible to count toward claims from both storms.[84] After initial assessments, Premier Dunkley reported that the territory fared \"much better than we expected\",[85] and the storm was not blamed for any deaths or major injuries on Bermuda.[86] In the aftermath of the hurricane, a Royal Navy helicopter aboard Argyll flew out ahead of the ship to start aerial damage assessments. Members of the Bermuda Regiment immediately began cleanup and recovery efforts,[87] while the government provided tarps to affected homeowners.[78] Sailors from the Argyll teamed up with Regiment soldiers upon the ship's arrival to continue relief work.[88] Some 35 of the vessel's crew worked to clear debris from the runway at the airport, which reopened on October 19 after thorough evaluations.[89][90] Including damage from Fay, about $2\u00a0million was spent on airport repairs, and the storms were later cited as evidence of the need for a newer terminal in a more protected location.[91] All schools on the territory resumed classes by October 21.[92]"

The coast of the Netherlands endured high seas and gusts to 108\u00a0km/h (67\u00a0mph), uprooting trees and flooding the coastline. Rail services and flight operations were disrupted throughout the region.[114] In Germany, gusts over 145\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph) were recorded at high elevations.[115] In Stuttgart alone, fifty vehicles were damaged by falling debris;[116] downed trees, torn roofs, and power outages were common throughout the nation.[117] In the Bavarian capital of Munich, the storm destroyed a large tin roof measuring over 80\u00a0m2 (860\u00a0sq\u00a0ft), parts of which impacted cars and fences on the ground. Damage from the incident was estimated at \u20ac500,000 (US$637,000).[118] Throughout Germany, the storm wrought \u20ac60\u2013100\u00a0million (US$80\u2013130\u00a0million) in insured losses. A woman died in a traffic accident, attributed to wet road conditions, along the Bundesstra\u00dfe 303 in the Bayreuth district.[119] Northwesterly gales yielded a storm surge along the country's North Sea coastline,[120] with tides running over 2\u00a0m (6\u00a0ft 7\u00a0in) above normal along the Elbe River at Hamburg. Neighboring Austria and Switzerland also experienced gales and power outages.[116] A tornado touched down near Neukirchen an der Enknach in Austria, damaging homes and farms.[121] Gusts in southern Switzerland reached 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph), leading to road and rail closures.[122] In southern France, the system initiated a mistral wind event.[116] The upper-level low associated with the hurricane's remnants blanketed parts of the Alps with heavy snowfall, accumulating to several feet,[116] and subsequently fueled torrential rains in the Balkans on October 24 and 25. Floodwaters caused by estimated rainfall totals nearing 150\u00a0mm (6\u00a0in) inundated entire villages in southeastern Bulgaria, forcing hundreds to evacuate, and there were widespread disruptions of power and water services. A woman in Burgas died from drowning. In the Greek capital city of Athens, the deluge filled streets with rushing water that swept away hundreds of vehicles.[123][124] More than three hundred buildings were inundated in the Attica area.[125]"

        "content": " In April 2022, days of heavy rain across KwaZulu-Natal in southeastern South Africa led to deadly floods. Particularly hard-hit were areas in and around Durban. At least 436 people died across the province, with an unknown number of people missing as of April\u00a022.[2] Several thousand homes were damaged or destroyed. Critical infrastructure, including major roads, transportation, communication, and electrical systems, were also impacted by the flooding, and this damage greatly hampered recovery and relief efforts. It is one of the deadliest disasters in the country in the 21st century, and the deadliest storm since the 1987 floods.[3][4] The floods have caused more than R17 billion (US$1.57 billion) in infrastructure damage.[2] A national state of disaster was declared.[5]"

In January, many regions experienced their heaviest rains since reliable records began in 1921.[6] Southern Africa as a whole experienced multiple devastating tropical cyclones and floods in the summer of 2021\u201322.[7] Heavy rainfall began around 8 April and persisted for days.[8] On 11\u00a0April, a low pressure area evolved near the southeast coast of South Africa from the interaction of an upper-level trough and warmer air near the surface. With warm ocean temperatures and low wind shear, the low developed intense thunderstorms which wrapped around a tight circulation, and the South African Weather Service issuing a level 5 warning for the coast and adjacent interior of KwaZulu-Natal \u2013 which was subsequently changed to a level 8 and later a level 9 warning when the impact and scale of the rainfall was better understood.[9] The clockwise flow of the low pressure system brought warm, moist air from the subtropics toward the coast, resulting in heavy rain across KwaZulu-Natal.[9] The most intense precipitation fell in eThekwini, iLembe, and Ugu municipalities.[10] During the period of 8\u201312 April, most of KwaZulu-Natal saw more than 50\u00a0mm (2.0\u00a0in) of rain, with coastal areas recording more than 200\u00a0mm (7.9\u00a0in). In a 24-hour period spanning 11\u201312 April, Virginia Airport recorded 304\u00a0mm (12.0\u00a0in) of precipitation.[9] Areas along the coast of KwaZulu-Natal recorded 450 millimetres (18\u00a0in) of precipitation.[11] On 12 April, the low-pressure system was classified as a subtropical depression and designated Subtropical Depression Issa by M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France, due to its structure and presence of gale-force winds.[12] Following its southwestern trajectory along the South African coast and after reaching the northeastern coast of the Eastern Cape on the morning of 13 April, the system turned northward, continuing back along the South African coast in a northeasterly direction before moving out to sea and further weakening.[13]"

Under weak steering currents, Edouard drifted to the north and executed a clockwise loop to the west. Despite moderate to strong levels of wind shear, the storm reached a peak intensity of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) on September 3, but quickly weakened as it tracked westward. Edouard made landfall on northeastern Florida on September 5, and after crossing the state it dissipated on September 6 while becoming absorbed into the larger circulation of Tropical Storm Fay.[2] Florida received moderate rainfall from Edouard, with floods exceeding 7 inches (180\u00a0mm) in the western portion of the state. Though Edouard was a tropical storm at landfall, wind speeds along the storm's path over land were light. The rain flooded several roads; however, there were no casualties, and damage was minimal."

        "content": "An area of cloudiness and rain showers developed several hundred miles east-southeast of Bermuda on August 25, likely in association with a low-level disturbance that formed along a cold front. For several days, it moved southwestward, and, while located on the southwestern end of an upper-level trough to the north of Puerto Rico, deep atmospheric convection throughout the system increased. The system tracked westward,[2] and initially remained disorganized while surface pressures remained high.[3] The system started to drift northwest and began to slowly organize on August 30 while located a few hundred miles northeast of the Bahamas.[4] A broad low-pressure area developed on August 31, though convection remained disorganized as winds of 20 to 25\u00a0mph (32 to 40\u00a0km/h) were reported in squalls. Conditions remained favorable for continued organization,[5] and convection persisted and increased across the system. The system developed into Tropical Depression Five on September 1 after developing a low-level circulation while located about 140 miles (230\u00a0km) east of Daytona Beach, Florida.[2] Upon first forming, the tropical depression was located in an area of light to moderate westerly wind shear. With a ridge to the north and west of the depression, the system moved to the northwest under weak steering currents.[6] The depression slowly strengthened and intensified into Tropical Storm Edouard on September 2 while located about 120 miles (190\u00a0km) east of Jacksonville, Florida. The storm remained disorganized with wind shear displacing most of the deep convection from the low-level circulation. Upon becoming a tropical storm, forecasters initially predicted Edouard to gradually turn to the northeast, and within three days be located a short distance off the coast of South Carolina with winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h). However, forecasters admitted little confidence in the prediction,[7] with later forecasts predicting the storm to execute a loop and track westward into northern Florida or southern Georgia. Shortly after the tropical cyclogenesis of Edouard, steering currents became weak, resulting in the storm to turn sharply eastward.[2] Late on September 2, deep convection developed over the center,[8] though the center quickly became exposed again.[9] The environment appeared to become more hostile on September 2 and 3 with increasing shear and dry air overspreading the center.[2] Despite the conditions, the storm maintained vigorous convection over the eastern portion of the circulation, and it quickly intensified on September 3 to reach peak winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h). A reconnaissance flight into the system estimated surface winds of up to 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) and reported flight level winds of 82\u00a0mph (132\u00a0km/h).[10] Shortly after peaking in intensity, Tropical Storm Edouard began to weaken as convection diminished from vertical shear and dry air, with its center becoming exposed from the steadily decreasing convection later on September 3. The development of a weak and narrow mid-level ridge turned the storm to the west-southwest towards northeastern Florida. Despite strong levels of wind shear, Edouard remained a tropical storm while producing sporadic amounts of deep convection,[2] with the banding structure improving on September 4.[11] Early on September 5, Edouard made landfall near Ormond Beach, Florida as a minimal tropical storm, and almost immediately weakened to a tropical depression over land. It tracked across the state for about 13\u00a0hours and entered the Gulf of Mexico near Crystal River.[2] Initial forecasts predicted Edouard to re-strengthen to a tropical storm over the northeastern Gulf of Mexico,[11] though uncertainty was noted due to the development of Tropical Storm Fay in the northwestern portion of the gulf.[12] Upon entering the Gulf of Mexico, the depression encountered strong wind shear from the outflow of Tropical Storm Fay.[2] Edouard generated minimal amounts of intermittent convection along the southeastern portion of its circulation, enough for it to remain a tropical cyclone.[13] The remaining convection, however, disappeared by September 6, with Edouard dissipating while becoming absorbed into the larger circulation of Tropical Storm Fay.[2]"

Hours after becoming a tropical storm, a tropical storm warning was issued from Fernandina Beach, Florida, to the mouth of the Savannah River, with a tropical storm watch further northward to the mouth of the South Santee River in South Carolina, though these were cancelled after Edouard turned to the east. About 10\u00a0hours before landfall, the National Hurricane Center issued another tropical storm warning from Titusville, Florida to Brunswick, Georgia, with a tropical storm watch further south to Sebastian Inlet, Florida.[2] Two days before the storm made landfall, several Florida counties were monitoring the progress of the storm. Though no serious impact was anticipated, Brevard County officials identified possible shelters if warranted. Putnam County officials placed several shelters on standby, and utility crews in Duval County were placed on standby in the event of power failure. Several media releases of information were issued regarding the storm. The State Emergency Operation Center was on Level 2, or partial activation, and the state government organized two conferences to discuss county actions in regards to the storm.[14] The National Weather Service issued a flood watch hours before Edouard made landfall for much of eastern Florida due to the expected rainfall from the storm.[15] The South Carolina Emergency Management Division monitored the progress of the storm, and the Division increased its awareness level in response to the storm. Important state agencies in South Carolina government were notified to be ready to respond if the need arose.[16]"

Beachgoers and visitors were advised to exercise extreme caution.[18] The storm produced water levels about 6\u00a0inches above normal near Cape Canaveral, though elsewhere wave action and storm tides were not significant.[19] Despite being a tropical storm at landfall, sustained tropical storm force winds were not observed. A rainband ahead of the storm produced a 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h) wind gust at Patrick Air Force Base, and a station in St. Augustine recorded a wind gust of 38\u00a0mph (61\u00a0km/h).[2] Sustained winds peaked at 31\u00a0mph (50\u00a0km/h) at Patrick Air Force Base. Edouard dropped light to moderate rainfall in eastern Florida, primarily during 2 to 3\u00a0hour periods. The highest official rainfall total peaked at 2.5 inches (64\u00a0mm) at Orlando Executive Airport, though unofficial totals reached as high as 4.8 inches (120\u00a0mm) in Rockledge.[19] Rainfall was higher in western Florida, peaking at 7.64 inches (194\u00a0mm) in DeSoto County[20] with an area near Tampa reporting over 7 inches (180\u00a0mm).[21] Moderate rainfall resulted in river flooding along the St. Johns River, resulting in flooding along roads in Seminole County. Roadway, urban, and lowland flooding was also reported in the counties of Brevard and Orange. Roadway flooding was extensive in some areas, resulting in road closures in Oviedo, Cocoa Beach, and Cape Canaveral.[19] Heavy rainfall in Pinellas Park caused heavy street flooding along an intersection on U.S. Highway 19.[22] No casualties were reported, and no damage was known to have been incurred.[23]"

During most of the storm's existence, Amy featured many subtropical characteristics but was not classified as such due to the proximity to land. By July\u00a04, the system moved southeast of Newfoundland before becoming extratropical. The main effects from Amy were rough seas, reaching up to 15\u00a0ft (4.6\u00a0m) in height, that were felt from North Carolina to New Jersey, inflicting minor coastal flooding and beach erosion.

        "content": "Tropical Storm Amy originated from a weak trough on June\u00a024 accompanied by scattered showers and thunderstorms over Florida. The system tracked westward in response to an upper-tropospheric low over Georgia. By June\u00a026, a surface circulation developed north of the Bahamas and satellite imagery showed a significant increase in convective activity and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) classified the system as a tropical depression early on June\u00a027. On June\u00a028, the system attained tropical storm-status while tracking north-northeast off the coast of North Carolina.[1] By June\u00a029, a trough, moving through the westerlies, rapidly approached the storm, causing the newly designated Amy to turn sharply toward the east. Strong wind shear disorganized the system slightly, leading to Amy featuring subtropical characteristics. By the evening, the strongest winds were not located around the center, but were instead situated between 60 and 90\u00a0mi (95 and 140\u00a0km) from the center. Convection became displaced from the center of circulation but the storm continued to intensify. Over the following several days, Amy tracked generally northeastward but underwent eastward jogs in response to rapidly moving troughs to the north.[1] Amy neared hurricane intensity several times, beginning on June\u00a030 as maximum winds increased to 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h); however, the storm was unable to acquire enough tropical features, and remained predominately subtropical.[1] Gale-force winds at this time extended roughly 125\u00a0mi (210\u00a0km) out from the center to the north and east.[2] Despite being subtropical at this point, the NHC decided against renaming it due to Amy's proximity to land.[3] On July\u00a02, a barometric pressure of 981\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.97\u00a0inHg) was recorded, the lowest in relation to Amy. The following day, another trough caused the storm to accelerate northeastward. On July\u00a04, Amy passed roughly 170\u00a0mi (270\u00a0km) southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland before becoming an extratropical cyclone.[1]"

By July\u00a02, the small craft advisories were discontinued as Amy tracked away from land.[4] Tides up to 4\u00a0ft (1.2\u00a0m) in Virginia resulted in some beach erosion and coastal flooding due to the prolonged duration of the event.[5] Although no warnings were issued, boaters in Newfoundland were advised to closely monitor the storm.[6] In Hampton, Virginia, a funnel cloud spawned by a squall line associated with Amy formed just offshore.[7] As a tropical depression, Amy produced scattered rainfall in Florida, peaking around 3\u00a0in (76\u00a0mm) near the Georgia border. Along the North Carolina coast, heavy rain fell as the center of Amy tracked nearby. Many coastal areas recorded more than 3\u00a0in (76\u00a0mm) with a peak amount of 5.87\u00a0in (149\u00a0mm) falling in Belhaven, North Carolina.[8] Offshore, a schooner carrying four people capsized in rough seas roughly 250\u00a0mi (400\u00a0km) east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina on June\u00a030.

It moved westward, and quickly strengthened under favorable conditions to reach top wind speeds of 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h). The cyclone hit eastern Sri Lanka at peak strength, then weakened slightly while crossing the island before making landfall over southern India on December 28. The storm degenerated into a remnant low later that day, before merging with another trough on the next day. The storm was the first cyclone over Sri Lanka with winds of at least hurricane strength since a cyclone of 1978 hit the island in the 1978 season, as well as the first tropical storm to hit the island since 1992. The storm was also the first December tropical cyclone of hurricane intensity in the Bay of Bengal since 1996. It produced heavy rainfall and strong winds, damaging or destroying tens of thousands of houses and leaving up to 500,000 homeless. At least nine people died as a result of the cyclone.[1]"

        "content": "An area of atmospheric convection developed and persisted on December 21 in the central Bay of Bengal[2] forming within an active near-equatorial trough.[3] Located within an area of weak vertical wind shear, the system steadily organized, and after initially remaining nearly stationary it began to move slowly westward. Deep convection continued to develop, and on December 23 a mid-level circulation began to form. Later that day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. By the night of the December 23, a low-level circulation developed in the system, located to the south of the deep convection. The disturbance continued to organize,[2] with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) classifying it as a deep depression early on December 24.[3] Later that day, the organization of the system degraded slightly, though it quickly reorganized. On December 25, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone 04B while it was located about 155 miles (249\u00a0km) east of Sri Lanka. On the center's first advisory, the tropical storm was drifting west-northwest at 3\u00a0mph (4.8\u00a0km/h) with maximum sustained winds of 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h).[2] Shortly thereafter, the IMD upgraded the deep depression to a cyclonic storm as a central dense overcast developed over the center.[3] A subtropical ridge to the north of the cyclone resulted in it continuing generally westward. Deep convection continued to develop over the center of circulation, and the storm steadily strengthened as outflow improved throughout the circulation. By late on December 25, a rainband wrapped tightly into the center,[2] and it intensified into a severe cyclonic storm as it approached the coast of Sri Lanka.[3] The next day the cyclone developed an eye as it turned west-southwestward. On December 26, the cyclone made landfall on near Trincomalee, Sri Lanka. The JTWC assessed the cyclone as attaining peak winds of 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h).[2] However, the IMD estimated the cyclone reached a maximum intensity of 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h), making it a very severe cyclonic storm.[3] It weakened slightly over land and emerged into the Gulf of Mannar early on December 27 as a tropical storm. Initially, forecasters predicted it to slowly re-intensify; instead it weakened as its convection degraded in organization and intensity. After turning west-northwestward, the storm struck southern India near Kanyakumari on December 28 with winds of 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h), with minimal convection due to land interaction and increased wind shear.[2] It rapidly weakened to tropical depression status over land, degenerating into a remnant low later that day. Early on December 29, the cyclone's remnants emerged into the eastern Arabian Sea and merged with another trough.[3]"

The cyclone hit the eastern and western coastlines with powerful waves, wrecking 25\u00a0fishing boats in eastern coastal towns and washing away 109 boats near Puttalam. Eight people were left missing and feared dead.[1] The cyclone was accompanied with a storm surge as made landfall that flooded areas up to 330 feet (100\u00a0m) inland.[4] While crossing the country, the cyclone dropped between 4 and 8 inches (100 and 200 millimetres) of precipitation, compounding the effects of severe monsoonal flooding from the previous month.[1] Wind gusts from the cyclone reached 110\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h) near where it made landfall.[2] The area most affected by the cyclone was in and around Trincomalee: 57\u00a0people checked into the local hospital as a result of falling trees or debris, with one person killed due to a falling tree.[1] An entire fishing village was completely destroyed,[2] and heavy rainfall flooded rivers, lakes, and canals,[1] covering roads and crops with floodwaters.[5] The flooding destroyed about 77\u00a0square\u00a0miles (200\u00a0km2) of rice fields,[2] and an additional 19 square miles (49\u00a0km2) of other crops. Strong winds damaged or destroyed around 83,000\u00a0houses across the country, including 2,000\u00a0houses destroyed in Kinnia and 6,600 in Trincomalee. The passage of the cyclone left up to 500,000\u00a0temporarily homeless on the island,[1] most of whom fled to churches, schools, temples, and shopping centers.[6] The winds blew off the roofs of several police stations and military camps,[2] and flooded several refugee camps. The winds damaged electrical systems and disrupted about 3,000\u00a0telephone systems, and many roads were left impassable.[1] Large areas remained without power for several days.[6] No damage reports exist for regions under control of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, despite the fact the storm made landfall there. Throughout the country, at least nine people died as a result of the cyclone,[1] and over 48,000\u00a0families were affected.[4] Prior to the arrival of the storm in India, government officials there issued a severe storm warning for Thoothukudi District, and also warned fishermen not to go out to sea.[5] Thousands were evacuated to emergency shelters prior to the storm's arrival.[7] The cyclone produced rough surf along the southern Indian coast,[5] and heavy rainfall in and around Thoothukudi, causing flooding in a few low-lying areas. The rainfall caused some damage to banana crops, uprooted several trees, and left some roads impassable,[7] but was largely beneficial in alleviating drought conditions. Across southern India, the cyclone damaged 749\u00a0houses and destroyed 81\u00a0more, but no deaths were reported in the country.[3]"

A street protest occurred in Trincomalee due to lack of aid.[1] Prime Minister Ratnasiri Wickremanayake organized a meeting of government officials to propose an increase in relief funds. A family of five or more received $5.50 a week (2000\u00a0USD, ($9.73 2024\u00a0USD), 500 in 2000\u00a0LKR) for dry rations, while the families of those who died received $183 (2000\u00a0USD$, 323.78 2024\u00a0USD, 15,000 2000\u00a0LKR) in compensation. The government also gave $122 (2000\u00a0USD, ($215.85 2024\u00a0USD, 10,000 2000\u00a0LKR)) to those whose houses were damaged or destroyed,[1] and delivered rice rations to those stranded, while state-organized radio broadcasts appealed for donations.[6] Within two days of the cyclone striking, the Sri Lankan Red Cross began an operation with 4,000\u00a0volunteers to help those most badly affected. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies issued a preliminary appeal for $323,000 2000\u00a0USD ($668,786 2024\u00a0USD$, 525,000 in 2000\u00a0CHF) to assist about 10,000\u00a0people by making blankets, shelter, food, and kitchen utensils available. To kick-start the operation, the Federation released about $61,000 (2000\u00a0USD ($107,926 2024\u00a0USD$, 100,000 in 2000\u00a0CHF)) within a few hours of the cyclone making landfall.[6] After about a month, the Red Cross distributed 10 roofing sheets each to 1,720 families, and also sent a set of cooking utensils, bed sheets, and sleeping mats to 3,000\u00a0families.[8] Relief ended on November 7, 2001, roughly 40\u00a0weeks after the cyclone struck.[9]"

They began when excessive rains began falling in March, leading to massive flooding and landslides. They caused more than 430 deaths, notably in Kenya and Rwanda. In the fall another round of floods hit the African Sahel.[1][2] Floods are the most frequent type of natural disaster and occur when an overflow of water submerges land that is usually dry. Floods are often caused by heavy rainfall, rapid snowmelt or a storm surge from a tropical cyclone or tsunami in coastal areas. Disastrous floods have caused millions of fatalities in the twentieth century, tens of billions of dollars of direct economic loss each year, and significant disruption to global trade.[3]"

Rainfall peaked at an extreme amount of 38.76\u00a0in (985\u00a0mm) at Kapapala Ranch.[2] In addition, the 24 hour rainfall total reached 37\u00a0in (940\u00a0mm), which is just 1\u00a0in (25\u00a0mm) shy of the record amount of precipitation in the state of Hawaii set on January 25, 1956.[4] That total was the second-highest tropical cyclone-related rainfall total in the state, although well behind Hurricane Hiki of 1950, which dropped 52 in (1321\u00a0mm).[5]"

It formed on 4 November in the eastern Bay of Bengal. Moving westward, it quickly organized and developed a well-defined eye. On 6 November, the cyclone struck about 50\u00a0km (31\u00a0mi) south of Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh at peak intensity. The India Meteorological Department estimated peak winds of 145\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph),[nb 1] while the American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) assessed peak winds of 215\u00a0km/h (135\u00a0mph).[nb 2] Soon after landfall, the cyclone weakened and dissipated by 7 November. Ahead of the storm, about 225,000\u00a0families evacuated, although many towns lacked proper storm shelters. When the cyclone made landfall, it produced strong winds up to 100\u00a0km (62\u00a0mi) inland, dropped 210\u00a0mm (8.3\u00a0in) of rainfall across a 40\u00a0km (25\u00a0mi) region, and flooded over 250\u00a0villages along a 60\u00a0km (37\u00a0mi) portion of the coast. About 70% of the overall damage was in East Godavari district, where two villages were entirely destroyed. The storm destroyed  241,802\u00a0ha (597,510 acres) of crops and killed millions of cattle and chicken. Across Andhra Pradesh, the storm damaged 647,554\u00a0houses, including over 10,000 that were destroyed. Overall damage totaled \u20b921.5 billion (equivalent to \u20b9120\u00a0billion or US$1.4\u00a0billion in 2023), comparable to a cyclone in 1977 that also hit Andhra Pradesh. There were 1,077\u00a0confirmed deaths with many others missing, although many of the dead were washed into the sea and were unlikely to be found. After the storm, the government and local Red Cross chapters helped residents recover from the damage, while the World Bank provided money to better prepare Andhra Pradesh for future storms."

A new area of convection, or thunderstorms, developed over the Andaman Sea on 1 November\n[3] The system was located within the monsoon trough, and a weak flow steered it slowly westward across the Bay of Bengal,[4] bringing it briefly over southwestern Myanmar. After the convection organized more, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert at 07:30\u00a0UTC on 3 November. At 12:00\u00a0UTC that day, the agency initiated advisories on the system, designating it Tropical Cyclone 07B about 645\u00a0km (401\u00a0mi) west of Yangon, Myanmar.[3] The India Meteorological Department (IMD) \u2013 the official Regional Specialized Meteorological Center for the basin \u2013 did not classify the system until 4 November; at 15:00\u00a0UTC, the agency designated it as a depression.[5] Located beneath the axis of an upper-level ridge, the depression was able to intensify and organize more, with prominent outflow developing.[4] On 5 November, the IMD upgraded the system to a deep depression and later to a cyclonic storm.[5] At 06:00\u00a0UTC on the same day, the JTWC upgraded the storm to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane, estimating 1\u00a0minute winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph).[6] It continued westward toward eastern India at a slow pace, later turning more to the west-northwest. Early on 6 November, the storm began rapidly intensifying, and the IMD upgraded the storm to a severe cyclonic storm and later a very severe cyclonic storm. At 04:00\u00a0UTC that day, an irregular eye formed in the middle of the central dense overcast, which quickly became more circular and distinct.[5] At 06:00\u00a0UTC on 6 November, the JTWC estimated peak 1\u00a0minute winds of 215\u00a0km/h (135\u00a0mph), the equivalent of a Category\u00a04 on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale, and a minimum barometric pressure of 927\u00a0mbar (27.4\u00a0inHg).[6][3] The IMD assessed a much lower intensity, estimating 3\u00a0minute winds of 145\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph) based on a Dvorak rating of 4.5.[5] While approaching land, the eye contracted from a peak width of 64 to 17\u00a0km (40 to 11\u00a0mi). At 16:00\u00a0UTC on 6 November, the cyclone made landfall about 50\u00a0km (31\u00a0mi) south of Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh along the east coast of India. The estimated landfall pressure was 978\u00a0mbar (28.9\u00a0inHg). It was a smaller-than-normal cyclone, only 450\u00a0km (280\u00a0mi) in diameter. The storm rapidly weakened after moving ashore, deteriorating into a deep depression early on 7 November.[5] The JTWC issued their last advisory at 06:00\u00a0UTC that day,[3] and the IMD downgraded the system to a remnant low-pressure area over Telangana at 12:00\u00a0UTC.[5]"

India's Oil and Natural Gas Corporation suspended operations during the storm.[8] The storm caused local Diwali festivities to be canceled.[9] It ultimately struck about 50\u00a0km (31\u00a0mi) north of where it was expected, in a region farther away from state shelters.[10] About 225,000\u00a0families evacuated due to the storm.[5] However, about 30% of the towns in the region lacked a storm shelter, and the existing shelters were generally in poor shape.[11] Some residents avoided the shelters due to their state of disrepair,[9] or stayed in their homes for fear they would be robbed.[10] In addition, storm emergency plans enacted after a cyclone in 1977 that struck Andhra Pradesh had not been used since 1986.[9] Roads and shelters built following a cyclone in 1990 fared the storm better than older structures.[12] The powerful cyclone brought intense winds, heavy rainfall, and high waves to Andhra Pradesh in eastern India. Hurricane-force winds \u2013 at least 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mi) \u2013 penetrated 100\u00a0km (62\u00a0mi) inland. Peak gusts were estimated at 200\u00a0km/h (125\u00a0mph), based on anemometers that were blown away in Yanam. The highest recorded sustained wind was 111\u00a0km/h (69\u00a0mph) by a ship at the Kakinada Port, only 50\u00a0km (31\u00a0mi) from the landfall location. The storm dropped heavy rainfall near the coast, peaking at 390\u00a0mm (15\u00a0in) in Amalapuram.[5] Rainfall rates of over 210\u00a0mm (8.3\u00a0in) occurred over 3\u00a0hours in a 40\u00a0km (25\u00a0mi) stretch of land.[9] Along a 60\u00a0km (37\u00a0mi) portion of the coast, 3.7\u00a0m (12\u00a0ft) waves accompanied a 2\u00a0m (6.6\u00a0ft) storm surge, spreading 5\u00a0km (3.1\u00a0mi) inland.[5][3] The storm struck just three weeks after another storm killed 350\u00a0people.[8] Storm damage extended 130\u00a0km (81\u00a0mi) inland.[13] Widespread areas of crop fields were inundated with floodwaters, washing away tons of rice, coconuts, and bananas.[8] The winds knocked down about 5\u00a0million coconut trees.[14] It was estimated that the storm destroyed 174,000\u00a0ha (430,000 acres) of rice paddy, along with 67,802\u00a0ha (167,540 acres) of other crops.[5] About 13,500\u00a0livestock and 1\u00a0million chickens were killed by the storm;[15][16] many of them rotted on arable fields after the waters receded.[8] Heavy rainfall and high tides flooded more than 250\u00a0villages,[3] and the cyclone affected 1,380\u00a0villages throughout Andhra Pradesh. Many canals and drains were breached by the floods. The storm washed four cargo ships ashore and sank or destroyed 6,464\u00a0boats.[5] About 70% of the overall damage was in East Godavari district,[15] where Kakinada was among the hardest hit villages.[16] Two nearby villages \u2013 Bhairvapada and Bulusutippa \u2013 were entirely destroyed.[5][15] The villages did not receive advanced warning, and Bhairvapada did not have a functioning cyclone shelter.[7] There, 90% of the boats were damaged or destroyed.[9] In Amalapuram, also in East Godavari, roughly two of every three houses were destroyed.[14] The cyclone also destroyed 55\u00a0electrical towers,[12] including a 100\u00a0m (330\u00a0ft) tall telecommunications tower,[5] as well as nearly 17,000\u00a0power lines in West Godavari.[12] About 1,300\u00a0km (810\u00a0mi) of roads were damaged or washed out, including 210\u00a0km (130\u00a0mi) of National Highway 5.[12] Flooding also washed out several railroads,[8] while damaged water drainage systems spewed sewage onto the streets. Many hospitals in the region were washed away or flooded.[17] Across Andhra Pradesh, the storm damaged 647,554\u00a0houses,[5] with about 200,000 sustaining roof damage,[16] and over 10,000 that were destroyed.[3] Over 100,000\u00a0people were left homeless.[18] In the hardest hit areas, only houses made of brick and cement withstood the high winds,[8] and huts made of mud and thatch were decimated.[16] Overall damage was officially estimated at RS$21.5\u00a0billion (US$602\u00a0million).[5][nb 3] However, the World Bank indicated damage reached as high as US$1.5\u00a0billion.[12] Officials likened damage to the 1977 cyclone that also struck Andhra Pradesh.[13] After the storm, there were 1,000\u00a0fishermen missing at sea,[3] despite warnings not to leave port.[20] After being presumed lost, 162\u00a0boats returned to port four days after the storm,[21] and additional fishermen returned over the succeeding days.[22] However, there were 569\u00a0fishermen killed or left missing due to lost boats at sea. Many of these fishermen had departed days before the storm, and those that survived had transistors in their boats.[7] Lacking advanced warning, many shrimp farmers in remote villages were swept away by waves.[7] Hundreds of dead bodies were discovered along the shore; after they were identified, the corpses were cremated instead of bringing the bodies into local villages.[20] Most of the fatalities on land were the result of buildings collapsing on people who stayed inside.[8] A ferry crossing the Godavari River sank amid rough waves, killing all 42\u00a0people on board.[23][3] Overall, the cyclone killed at least 978\u00a0people in Andhra Pradesh, with 1,375\u00a0people listed as missing in January 1997.[5] However, the Red Cross did not expect to find all of the missing bodies, as some were likely washed into the Bay of Bengal.[15] A later report to the Food and Agriculture Organization indicated there were 1,077\u00a0confirmed deaths, with an unconfirmed death toll as high as 2,760.[7]"

        "content": "Following the storm's heavy damage, homeless residents resided in temporary camps.[20] Later, the Indian government set up 742\u00a0relief centers housing 177,000\u00a0people,[15] utilizing schools and office buildings.[16] However, residents did not stay for extended periods of time in the shelters, as rebuilding began within three days of the storm's landfall.[12] Many of the displaced people returned to their homes after the storm receded. Workers restored water service and distributed potable water to those in need.[15] Workers used cranes to remove trees from highways.[24] Roads and communication links were quickly restored,[22] as was the power supply.[25] Later, damaged houses were reconstructed with tiled roofs while destroyed houses were rebuilt on concrete slabs, both to withstand stronger winds.[citation needed] The Andhra Pradesh government coordinated with the Indian Red Cross Society to provide relief goods to the affected citizens, such as 75\u00a0kg (165\u00a0lb) of rice per family.[15] The Red Cross sent 10\u00a0trucks carrying blankets, food, and cooking supplies from Delhi to Andhra Pradesh,[15] to be distributed by the Andhra Pradesh Red Cross.[25] India's military enacted search and rescue missions in the days following the storm.[26] Six helicopters worked continuously to airlift food, water, and medicine to storm victims,[27][8] although residents fought over the aid in poor areas.[21] Helicopters also surveyed the storm damage, as many affected small villages were not linked by roads.[9] About 935\u00a0medical teams were established following the storm,[15] and chlorinated drinking tablets were distributed to purify water,[14] in an attempt to prevent a cholera outbreak. Cholera spreads through stagnant contaminated water, and there were eight reports of storm victims contracting the disease.[14][8] In the months after the storm, foreign governments and international organizations donated about US$500,000.[12] The World Bank considered the cyclone as having a significant effect on Andhra Pradesh's economy.[12] Andhra Pradesh's chief minister N. Chandrababu Naidu estimated that the state would take as long as 30\u00a0years to recover from the storm.[17] The government provided Rs. 1,500 (US$420) to every family whose hut collapsed during the storm, and Rs. 100,000 (US$2,857) to the family of every person killed by the storm.[28][29] However, there were also reports of people stealing bodies to receive the payment.[28] The federal government provided about US$12\u00a0million to the state, as well as tax deductions for monetary donations.[18] Former Union Minister Rangaiah Naidu opined that the state government overinflated the damage estimates to qualify for additional aid, in part due to the government spending annual disaster subsidies for salaries.[28] The World Bank credited the government's experience with disasters as saving lives, although the response to the disaster was largely in repairing damage, rather than mitigating against future storms. The storm also demonstrated the region's outdated infrastructure. Following the heavy damage from the cyclone and other recent disasters, the World Bank enacted a plan for Andhra Pradesh in April 1997, consisting of repairing damaged infrastructure, an updated disaster plan, and technical assistance to the state government. Shelters and roads would be improved to higher standards.[12] This plan ultimately cost about US$175\u00a0million and was completed in July 2003, three years longer than expected but at a lower cost due to the Indian rupee losing some of its value. Power lines were improved to withstand winds of 200\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph), while drains were enlarged and a coastal plant system was created to lessen flooding. An additional 82\u00a0public shelters were constructed. However, the plan failed to yield a long term disaster policy for the state.[30]"

It developed from a previously non-tropical cyclone in the western Atlantic Ocean, and initially it moved northeastward off the Carolinas. The storm turned southwestward due to a building ridge, and concurrently it intensified to become Subtropical Storm Alpha. It later moved ashore near Savannah, and it finally dissipated in the northeast Gulf of Mexico on May 29. It produced wave action and moderate rainfall along the coast.

        "content": "Throughout May 1972, a series of weak troughs moved across the eastern United States. In the third week of the month, an upper-level cutoff low developed along one of these troughs, located southeast of the United States and removed from the Westerlies. The origins of Alpha were from a surface low northeast of Florida, associated with the larger-scale, cold core upper low.[1][2] It organized, and late on May 23 it could be classified as a subtropical depression, east of the Georgia/South Carolina border.[3] While southeast of Hatteras, North Carolina, a developing ridge blocked its northeast motion, and so it slowed to turn to the southeast. On May 25, a small, intense low-level center organized rapidly, and by the next day, it attained gale-force winds, by which time the storm turned southwestward.[2] At 1600 UTC on May 26, the National Hurricane Center initiated advisories on Subtropical Cyclone Alpha, when the storm was about 225\u00a0mi (360\u00a0km) to the south of Cape Hatteras.[4] Around that time, it reached its peak winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h).[3] On its first advisory, there was disagreement among forecast models regarding its eventual track, with projected tracks deviating from a Georgia landfall to a track northeastward out to sea.[5] Alpha was also a climatological outlier at the time; the NHC HURRAN model, which was based on previous storms with similar characteristics, found no analogs for the storm.[6][7] Subtropical Storm Alpha was initially well-defined as it moved southwestward. The very small center was located along the eastern edge of the convection, while low-level cloud bands formed east of the center.[2][8] At the time, the temperature structure was more typical of a winter storm, although it was expected to become more like a subtropical storm typical during the summer months.[9] The winds decreased steadily as it turned more westward on May 27, and the heavy rainfall persisted mostly to the north and west of the center.[3][10] The National Hurricane Center initially thought the center might not have been at the surface, and the agency indicated low forecasting confidence, as they could not determine a circulation center.[11][12] The difficulty arose from the large, sprawling nature of the storm, and by later on May 27 a new center formed, as confirmed by radar imagery and the Hurricane Hunters.[13][14] That night, the extremely small center made landfall just south of Savannah, Georgia, affecting a very small area with winds of 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 991\u00a0hPa (29.26\u00a0inHg).[2] Around the time of landfall, Alpha developed a warm core, indicating some tropical characteristics.[15] The storm weakened quickly over land, although it did not dissipate until two days later over the northeast Gulf of Mexico.[3]"

        "content": "At the time of the first advisory on Alpha, there were small craft warnings from Jacksonville, Florida to Cape May, New Jersey. Gale warnings were posted from Cape Fear, North Carolina to Chincoteague, Virginia.[4] The interaction between Alpha and the high pressure system to its northeast caused cooler temperatures and gusty winds from Delaware southward. Wave heights reached up to 20 feet (6.1\u00a0m) along the Virginia capes.[16] The storm dropped rainfall along the coast of North Carolina and Virginia, with a maximum of 6.97 inches (177\u00a0mm) reported in Ocracoke, North Carolina.[17] While moving slowly off the North Carolina coast, Alpha caused heavy beach erosion, destroyed one house, and threatened the foundation of several other homes in the Outer Banks. Damage totaled over $50,000 (1972\u00a0USD).[18] While the storm was traveling over the western Atlantic Ocean, the storm produced a large area of rough seas, which was considered the greatest threat from the storm.[19] In northeastern Florida, police officers were stationed to ensure people did not swim in the dangerous seas. The high waves also halted work to deepen a harbor at the Mayport Naval Station.[20] Two people drowned after the storm dissipated, when surf was still turbulent.[21] Tides along the Georgia coast reached 2 to 3 feet (0.61 to 0.91\u00a0m) above normal, which caused some flooding and beach erosion.[18][22] Wind gusts reached 58\u00a0mph (93\u00a0km/h) on Saint Simons Island.[23] The winds knocked down trees and power lines, leaving some people without power in eastern Georgia. Damage was minor but widespread in the state, estimated at over $50,000 (1972\u00a0USD).[18] Moderate rains spread in coastal areas from South Carolina through southern Florida.[17]"

After crossing the islands and traversing the Caribbean Sea, the storm struck Honduras, Belize, and Mexico, before dissipating on July\u00a014. After more than three weeks without tropical cyclogenesis, another tropical storm developed west of Bermuda. As the storm brushed eastern New England, four ships sank near Nantucket, causing 41\u00a0fatalities. The same cyclone brought damaging winds to Nova Scotia before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on August\u00a010. A hurricane developed over the central Atlantic Ocean on August\u00a030 and ultimately affected Bermuda with heightened tides as it passed to the east. Elsewhere, the hurricane had little impact, becoming extratropical on September\u00a05. After the third system, a series of four tropical depressions formed, but failed to become severe. The fourth hurricane brought devastation to Jamaica, Cuba, and portions of the Gulf Coast of the United States, especially western parts of the Florida Panhandle. Overall, the storm left six deaths and inflicted at least $170,000 (1917\u00a0USD) in damage. The season's activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 61,[2] slightly above the 1911\u20131920 average of 58.7.[3] ACE is a metric used to express the energy used by a tropical cyclone during its lifetime. Therefore, a storm with a longer duration will have high values of ACE. It is only calculated at six-hour increments in which specific tropical and subtropical systems are either at or above sustained wind speeds of 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h), which is the threshold for tropical storm intensity. Thus, tropical depressions are not included here.[2]"

Later that day, the storm crossed the Lesser Antilles between the islands of Saint Lucia and Martinique. Upon entering the Caribbean Sea on September\u00a021, the system intensified quicker, becoming a Category\u00a01 hurricane several hours later. While passing south of the Tiburon Peninsula on the following day, the storm strengthened into a Category\u00a02 hurricane. Later on September\u00a023, the hurricane struck the northern coast of Jamaica, before re-emerging into the Caribbean Sea. Around 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a024, it intensified into a Category\u00a03 hurricane. Approximately 24\u00a0hours later, the hurricane deepened into a Category\u00a04 hurricane.[4] Ram\u00f3n Perez of the Instituto de Meteorolog\u00eda de la Rep\u00fablica de Cuba estimated that this hurricane attained a minimum barometric pressure of 928\u00a0mbar (27.4\u00a0inHg) on September\u00a025. Using the pressure-wind relationship, HURDAT increased the maximum sustained wind speed to 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h).[1] Within the next six hours, the hurricane made landfall in the eastern Pinar del R\u00edo Province of Cuba. The system entered the Gulf of Mexico later on September\u00a025. While moving northwestward, the storm fell to Category\u00a03 hurricane intensity early on September\u00a027. It briefly tracked generally northward and approached southeastern Louisiana before re-curving northeastward late the next day. At 02:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a029, the hurricane made landfall near Camp Walton, Florida with winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h). Shortly thereafter, the system rapidly weakened to a Category\u00a01 hurricane and fell to a tropical storm several hours later. Early on September\u00a030, it became extratropical over Georgia. About six hours later, the remnants of the hurricane dissipated.[4] Some islands in the Lesser Antilles experienced strong winds and heavy rainfall, including Dominica, Guadeloupe, and Saint Lucia.[1] In Jamaica, the hurricane caused significant damages to banana and coconut plantations. Communications from Holland Bay were disrupted when the station was demolished.[6] The greatest damages were reported from the northern half of the island. In Nueva Gerona, strong winds destroyed well-constructed buildings, devastating the town. Orchards and crops were destroyed on the Pinar del R\u00edo Province.[7] In Louisiana and Mississippi, impact was generally limited to damaged crops and timber stands.[1] One death from drowning was reported in Louisiana.[7] Farther east in Mobile, Alabama, portions of roofs, trees, and other debris littered streets.[8] Communications were severed in Pensacola, Florida. Several small watercraft washed ashore, and numerous wharves, docks, and boat storages suffered impact. Total damages were estimated near $170,000 in Pensacola area.

The extratropical remnants probably dissipated near Newfoundland on September\u00a020. Meanwhile, a trough in the Gulf of Mexico had developed into a tropical depression on September\u00a014. The following day, the system made landfall in Louisiana and disintegrated into a disorganized area of thunderstorms over Mississippi and Arkansas on September\u00a016. The last tropical depression and final cyclone of the season developed on October\u00a019 from a trough over the central Atlantic Ocean. Two days later, the depression was absorbed by a cold front.[1]"

The season has no official bounds but cyclones tend to form between April and December. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northern Indian Ocean. There are two main seas in the North Indian Ocean\u2014the Bay of Bengal to the east of the Indian subcontinent and the Arabian Sea to the west of India. The official Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre in this basin is the India Meteorological Department (IMD), while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) releases unofficial advisories. An average of five tropical cyclones form in the North Indian Ocean every season with peaks in May and November.[1] Cyclones occurring between the meridians 45\u00b0E and 100\u00b0E are included in the season by the IMD.[2] The season was quiet, with only 3 systems."

The first tropical depression and second tropical cyclone of the 1992 Atlantic hurricane season, the depression developed on June 25 from a tropical wave. Located in an environment of strong wind shear, much of the convection in the system was located well to the southeast of the poorly defined center of circulation. The depression moved northeastward and made landfall near Tampa, Florida on June 26, shortly before dissipating over land. The depression, in combination with an upper-level trough to its west, produced heavy rainfall to the east of its path, peaking at 33.43 inches (849\u00a0mm) in Cuba and 25 inches (640\u00a0mm) in Florida. In Cuba, the rainfall destroyed hundreds of homes and caused two fatalities. In Florida, particularly in Sarasota and Manatee counties, the rainfall caused severe flooding. 4,000\u00a0houses were affected, forcing thousands to evacuate. The flooding killed two in the state and was indirectly responsible for a traffic casualty. Damage in Florida totaled over $2.6\u00a0million (1992\u00a0USD, $4\u00a0million 2009\u00a0USD)."

        "content": "A weak tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on June 12. It tracked westward across the tropical Atlantic Ocean with minimal convection, and subsequent to moving through the southern Windward Islands it crossed northern Central America. Convection increased on June 20 as the wave entered the southwestern Caribbean. Under the influence of southeasterly flow from developing Hurricane Celia in the eastern Pacific Ocean and the south-southwesterly flow from a mid-to upper-level trough over the Gulf of Mexico, the area of disturbed weather tracked generally north-northwestward through the Caribbean Sea while spreading across Cuba and southern Florida. On June 24, a mid-level circulation developed near the Yucat\u00e1n Channel, and shortly thereafter satellite image loops indicated deep convection with some cyclonic rotation near the western tip of Cuba. A reconnaissance aircraft flight was dispatched late on June 24 into the system to determine if it developed into a tropical cyclone, though the flight did not observe evidence of a closed low-level circulation. After the flight, satellite imagery indicated a low-level circulation was forming, and on June 25 ship and buoy data confirmed the system developed into Tropical Depression One while located about 235 miles (378\u00a0km) west-southwest of Key West, Florida.[1] The National Hurricane Center (NHC) incorrectly classified the system as Tropical Depression Two due to an earlier subtropical storm.[2] Upon becoming a tropical cyclone, the depression was poorly organized, with much of the convection located well to the southeast of the broad center due to strong upper-level wind shear. The shearing environment was caused by a trough in the Gulf of Mexico and from the outflow from Pacific Hurricane Celia.[1] This was reflected in forecasts, with the National Hurricane Center predicting no significant change in intensity or structure.[2] The depression moved northward before turning to the northeast,[1] and on June 26, the poorly organized system made landfall just north of Tampa.[3] The low-level circulation dissipated while crossing the Florida peninsula, with the remnants continuing northeastward before being absorbed by a large extratropical cyclone over the western Atlantic.[1]"

        "content": "The tropical depression, in combination with the upper-level trough to its west, produced torrential precipitation throughout Cuba,[1] peaking at 33.43 inches (849\u00a0mm).[4]  This is the fifth highest known rainfall total from a tropical cyclone in the country.  The rainfall primarily affected the provinces of Pinar del R\u00edo, Matanzas, and Havana.[4] Two Cuban citizens were killed by the rainfall, with an Arab student reported missing who presumably drowned. The deluge damaged or destroyed hundreds of houses in the provinces of Pinar del R\u00edo and Havana.[5] In Florida, the depression produced moderate winds near the coast, peaking at 51 miles per hour (82\u00a0km/h) in Naples.[6] The system dropped torrential rainfall, peaking at 25 inches (640\u00a0mm) at Arcadia Tower. Large portions of the state reported totals in excess of 10 inches (250\u00a0mm) from the depression, with much of Sarasota County receiving over 20 inches (510\u00a0mm) of rain.[7][8] The rainfall was classified as a 100-year flood event in Sarasota and Manatee counties.[9] Officials in Manatee County declared a state of emergency in response to the flooding.[10] About 3,000 people were forced to evacuate their homes due to the flooding, some of whom left by boat. The flooding damaged about 50 houses in and around Oneco. Due to the evacuations, no injuries were reported.[9] The Lake Manatee reservoir in Manatee County rose to over 39 feet (12\u00a0m), 4 feet (1.2\u00a0m) above normal, which resulted in officials opening floodgates to mitigate potential flooding.[11] In Sarasota County, the flooding closed several roads and led to many overflown creeks and rivers,[10] including the Horse Creek which crested at 5.8 feet (1.8\u00a0m) above flood level. The Myakka River crested at 11 feet (3.4\u00a0m) on the following Monday, 4 feet (1.2\u00a0m) above its flood stage.[9] Damage to roads and bridges totaled about $1\u00a0million.[12] Due to the flat landscape of the region, the flooding persisted for several days. The depression spawned a tornado in a mobile home park in Nokomis, destroying the roofs of five homes and causing leaks in twelve others. Throughout the area, the passage of the depression left about 45,000 customers without power, primarily due to gusty winds. The outages were fairly short-lived due to power companies calling in extra workers to restore the power. Moderate winds toppled a construction crane at the northern end of the Sunshine Skyway Bridge, closing the bridge for 35 minutes before the crane was removed.[10] In Pinellas County, a man hydroplaned while driving along a flooded roadway; he crashed into a concrete pole and was killed.[12] Severe crop damage to orange trees was reported in association with the flooding.[13] Damage from the depression totaled over $2.6\u00a0million (1992\u00a0USD, $4\u00a0million 2008\u00a0USD),[10][14] with about\u00a04,000\u00a0houses affected by the flooding[10] and an additional 70\u00a0destroyed. Two\u00a0people were killed in Florida.[15] On August 14, about six weeks after the flooding, President George H. W. Bush declared a major disaster area for Charlotte, DeSoto, Manatee, and Sarasota counties. The declaration allowed for the use of federal funding to assist in the aftermath of the system.[16]"

        "content": " Hurricane Ginger was the second longest-lasting Atlantic hurricane on record. The eighth tropical cyclone and fifth hurricane of the 1971 Atlantic hurricane season, Ginger spent 27.25\u00a0days as a tropical cyclone, lasting from September\u00a06 to October\u00a03. Twenty of those days (September 11 \u2013 September 30), Ginger was classified as a hurricane. The storm formed northeast of the Bahamas, and for the first nine days of its duration tracked generally eastward or northeastward while gradually strengthening to peak winds of 110\u00a0mph (175\u00a0km/h). On September\u00a014, Ginger slowed and turned to a general westward track, passing near Bermuda on September\u00a023. There, the hurricane produced gusty winds and high waves, but no damage. While over the western Atlantic Ocean, Ginger became the last target of Project Stormfury, which sought to weaken hurricanes by depositing silver iodide into tropical cyclone rainbands. Ginger ultimately struck North Carolina on September\u00a030 as a minimal hurricane, lashing the coastline with gusty winds that caused power outages across the region. Heavy rainfall flooded towns and left severe crop damage, with 3\u00a0million bushels of corn and 1\u00a0million bushels of soybean lost. Damage in the state was estimated at $10\u00a0million (1971\u00a0US dollars$, 75.2\u00a0million 2024\u00a0USD). Further north, moderate precipitation and winds spread through the Mid-Atlantic states, although no significant damage was reported outside North Carolina. Ginger has the highest accumulated cyclone energy for a hurricane below major hurricane strength in the Atlantic basin, at 44.2."

        "header": "Meteorological history",
        "content": "Hurricane Ginger originated in a cold-core upper-level low that persisted for several days in early September in the Western Atlantic Ocean.[1] The upper-level low was located within a large, persistent area of convection from the Gulf of Mexico through the central Atlantic, which resembled the Intertropical Convergence Zone but at a higher latitude. The convective feature was influenced by an anticyclone located over northern South America, which was opposite of the typical flow for September. The anticyclone also led to the formation of Hurricane Fern, Tropical Storm Heidi, and two tropical depressions.[2] By September\u00a05, the low had descended to the surface as its thermal structure warmed, and the next day it developed into a tropical depression about 235\u00a0mi (375\u00a0km) northeast of the Bahamas.[1][3] After forming, the depression moved slowly southeastward for about 24 \u00a0hours before turning to the northeast, slowly organizing in the process. On September\u00a010, the depression turned eastward, and later that day intensified into Tropical Storm Ginger, the seventh named storm of the year in the Atlantic, about 325\u00a0mi (525\u00a0km) south of Bermuda. The storm quickly intensified, and within 24\u00a0hours reached winds of 75\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h), making it a hurricane. It turned to the northeast, passing well to the east of Bermuda. Late on September\u00a013, Ginger attained its minimum barometric pressure of 959\u00a0mbar (28.32\u00a0inHg), and early the next day reached peak maximum sustained winds of 110\u00a0mph (175\u00a0km/h). After reaching a position about halfway between Bermuda and the Azores, the hurricane's eastward movement halted due to a building ridge to its north and east. It turned sharply southward before turning and beginning a westerly drift, during which Ginger weakened to minimal hurricane status.[1][3] For about six days, Ginger maintained minimal hurricane status.[3] As it meandered over the central Atlantic Ocean, it maintained an unusually large eye, reaching 80\u00a0mi (130\u00a0km) in diameter.[4] On September\u00a018, Ginger turned to the south and slowly executed a tight counterclockwise loop within three days. By September\u00a021, the hurricane was tracking south of due west, and the next day suddenly intensified to winds of 90\u00a0mph (150\u00a0km/h). Its westward track briefly posed a threat to Bermuda, although Ginger passed 115\u00a0mi (185\u00a0km) south of the island on September\u00a023 while slowly weakening. On September\u00a024, Ginger decelerated before beginning a turn to the southwest. By September\u00a026, Ginger briefly weakened to minimal hurricane strength, although re-intensification resumed as the track turned to the west and northwest.[1][3] Around that time, Ginger absorbed the smaller and weaker Tropical Storm Janice to its southeast.[5] For three days, beginning on September\u00a026, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration deployed planes into the hurricane as part of Project Stormfury, the fourth hurricane to be a part of the weather control experiment.[2] The plane dropped silver iodide into the center of the hurricane, although there was no effect due to Ginger's large eye and diffuse nature; this was the last seeding done by the project.[6] By September\u00a028, Ginger was moving northwestward toward North Carolina and was steadily intensifying. At around 06:00\u00a0UTC the next day, the hurricane reached a secondary peak intensity of 105\u00a0mph (165\u00a0km/h), which it maintained for about 18\u00a0hours. Afterward, Ginger slowly weakened, and late on September\u00a030 it made landfall near Morehead City, North Carolina, with winds of 75\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h). It quickly deteriorated over land, weakening first to a tropical storm and then to a tropical depression by late on October\u00a01. Ginger turned to the north, entered southern Virginia, and later turned to the east. On October\u00a03, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while crossing Hampton Roads into the Atlantic Ocean. The remnants of Ginger continued east-southeastward until being absorbed by a cold front on October\u00a05.[4][3]"

Officials closed all of the island's schools during Ginger's passage.[8] Before Ginger struck North Carolina, the American Red Cross set up 28\u00a0emergency shelters in six counties, where about 5,500\u00a0people stayed during the storm.[9][10] The National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch from Wilmington, North Carolina, to Virginia Beach, Virginia, with gale warnings extending northward to Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.[11] United States military officials evacuated planes and ships from the Norfolk, Virginia, region, in addition to flying planes down the coast to warn boaters of the approaching storm.[12] Ferry services around the Outer Banks were canceled during the storm's passage, while the Coast Guard ordered the evacuation of workers in three lighthouses.[13]"

        "content": "As the hurricane passed south of Bermuda on September\u00a023, it produced heavy waves, as well as gale force winds for 17\u00a0hours. Naval Air Station Bermuda reported peak gusts of 75\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h).[4][7] There was no reported damage, and the hurricane's passage failed to alleviate persistent drought conditions.[14] While Ginger was still in the vicinity of Bermuda, it produced high swells and riptides along the East Coast of the United States, prompting the issuing of small craft warnings from Florida to North Carolina.[15] Wave heights reached 8\u00a0ft (2.4\u00a0m) in Sebastian, Florida,[16] and one person was killed in St. Augustine from drowning. There were also initial reports of two missing people in Neptune Beach, Florida,[17] but they were not listed as casualties in the year-end hurricane summary.[2] As it moved ashore in North Carolina, Ginger produced a storm tide of around 6\u00a0ft (1.8\u00a0m) along the Outer Banks and up to 7\u00a0ft (2.1\u00a0m) in Pamlico Sound.[4] The storm dropped heavy rainfall peaking at 15.58\u00a0in (396\u00a0mm) in Bodie Island along the Outer Banks, making Ginger among the wettest tropical cyclones in the state. Rainfall from the storm extended southwestward into South Carolina, where precipitation reached 4.98\u00a0in (126\u00a0mm) in Cheraw.[18] In Atlantic Beach, North Carolina, wind gusts reached 92\u00a0mph (148\u00a0km/h), the highest associated with Ginger in the United States.[2] The hurricane had a large wind field upon moving ashore, affecting a large portion of North Carolina; one county official considered Ginger the largest storm in the region since 1936.[19] Strong winds from Ginger damaged store fronts and windows,[19] and also downed power lines and trees. Morehead City, where the hurricane moved ashore, lost power and had debris strewn across the streets. The nearby cities of New Bern, Beaufort, and Atlantic Beach also lost power,[11] and one company had 6,000\u00a0customers without power.[9] Heavy rainfall caused the Neuse and Trent rivers to exceed their banks, resulting in flooding.[19] Several oil tanks along the rivers broke open, creating dangerous boating conditions.[9] Up to 4\u00a0ft (1.2\u00a0m) of water from the Pungo River flooded most of the city of Belhaven, and similar flooding occurred in Washington, entering dozens of buildings and houses.[20] Across the region, the combination of high winds, tides, and flooding closed several bridges and roads, including a portion of U.S. Highway 70. The winds also destroyed several mobile homes,[17] although coastal damage was less than expected.[9] During Ginger's passage, the Salvation Army and Red Cross provided more than 3,000\u00a0people with food assistance.[21] Further inland, the combination of strong winds and rains left heavy crop damage,[22] destroying 3\u00a0million bushels of corn and another million bushels of soybeans; losses to the corn crop were mitigated due to about half of the crop having been harvested before the storm's arrival. Heavy damage was also reported to the peanut crop as well as to various fruits and vegetables.[23] In some locations, up to 15% of the cotton crop was lost, particularly in the northeastern portion of the state.[24] In 45 counties in the eastern portion of the state, farmers affected by the hurricane were eligible for loans from the Farmers Home Administration, following federal approval from United States President Richard Nixon.[25] Governor Robert W. Scott requested federal disaster aid for 24\u00a0counties,[26] which was denied.[27] Damage in North Carolina was estimated at $10\u00a0million (1971\u00a0USD$, 75.2\u00a0million 2024\u00a0USD),[4] of which about $1\u00a0million (1971\u00a0USD$, 7.52\u00a0million 2024\u00a0USD) was from coastal flooding. One death occurred in Washington when a vehicle accident was possibly caused by a wind gust;[10] however, it was not conclusively linked to Ginger.[2] As the storm crossed into Virginia, it continued to produce heavy rainfall, including a total of 7.61\u00a0in (193\u00a0mm) in Norfolk. Near the border between Virginia and North Carolina, the storm produced tides of up to 4\u00a0ft (1.2\u00a0m) above normal.[2] Gusty winds of over 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) downed a few trees, causing scattered power outages. Above-normal tides and waves caused moderate to heavy beach erosion in Virginia Beach.[28] Further north, Ginger produced above-normal tides, light winds, and scattered rainfall along the Delmarva Peninsula and northward through New York.[2][29]"

This made Ginger the second longest-lived of any Atlantic hurricane, but it remains the storm that lasted the most consecutive days as a tropical cyclone in the basin.[3] Ginger spent 20\u00a0days as a hurricane from September 11 to September 30, one of the longest durations on record at that intensity. In addition, Ginger co-existed with several other tropical cyclones, including on September 11 when there were four named storms at the same time, a rare occurrence; the others were Hurricane Edith, Hurricane Fern, and Tropical Storm Heidi.[3]"

The fifth tropical storm of the season, Doria developed from a tropical wave on August 20 to the east of the Lesser Antilles, and after five days without development it attained tropical storm status to the east of Florida. Doria turned to the north, and reached peak winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) as it was making landfall near Morehead City, North Carolina. It turned to the northeast, and moved through the Mid-Atlantic and New England as a tropical storm before becoming an extratropical storm over Maine on August 29. In North Carolina, Doria produced moderate rainfall, resulting in localized flooding and damage. The storm spawned a tornado near Norfolk, Virginia, damaging twelve\u00a0houses and downing hundreds of trees. Tropical Storm Doria dropped heavy precipitation in New Jersey, peaking at 10.29 inches (261\u00a0mm) in Little Falls. The rainfall led to record-breaking river levels and flooding in several houses, resulting in damage to dozens of houses across the state. Moderate damage and rainfall continued along its path into New England and southeastern Canada. In all, Tropical Storm Doria caused seven deaths and $147.6\u00a0million (1971\u00a0USD, $1.11\u00a0billion 2024\u00a0USD)."

On August 20, subsequent to the development of a low-level circulation, an area of convection along the wave developed into a tropical depression while located about 1,000 miles (1,600\u00a0km) east-northeast of Grenada. Initially failing to organize further, the depression moved to the west-northwest, and on August 23, it passed through the northern Lesser Antilles. The depression moved to the north of Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and the Bahamas, and began to show further signs of organization on August 25. After briefly weakening on August 26, the depression re-strengthened while turning to the north, and attained tropical storm status on August 27 while located 230 miles (370\u00a0km) east of Daytona Beach, Florida.[2] After reaching tropical storm status, Doria quickly intensified as its wind field expanded while moving northward. The minimum central pressure quickly dropped, as well, and late on August 27, Doria reached its peak intensity of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) while making landfall on North Carolina near Morehead City. The storm maintained its peak winds as it moved north-northeastward through North Carolina, and weakened slightly to a 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) tropical storm after entering Virginia on August 28. Doria turned to the northeast, passing through the Chesapeake Bay and Delmarva Peninsula before entering southern New Jersey. It paralleled the state a short distance inland, and after moving through New York City Doria became extratropical over northwestern Maine on August 29. The extratropical remnant continued northeastward until losing its identity near the border of New Brunswick and Quebec in Canada.[2]"

Tropical Storm Doria passed about 160 miles (260\u00a0km) east of Charleston, South Carolina, though its large wind field produced 22\u00a0mph (35\u00a0km/h) winds in the town. The storm also dropped light rainfall of up to 1.75 inches (44\u00a0mm), and resulted in a storm tide of 5.7 feet (1.7\u00a0m) above the mean low water level.[2] Upon making landfall in North Carolina, Doria produced a storm tide of 2 feet (0.61\u00a0m) above normal at Cape Fear. Sustained winds in the state peaked at 41\u00a0mph (66\u00a0km/h) in Hatteras,[2] while gusts reached 69\u00a0mph (111\u00a0km/h) in Atlantic Beach. In most areas, wind damage was minimal. Tropical Storm Doria dropped moderate rainfall across the state, including a report of 4.17 inches (106\u00a0mm) in Cape Hatteras.[3] Over 5 inches (130\u00a0mm) of rain fell around the Albemarle Sound and near New Bern.[4] The rainfall led to flooding and mudslides, which blocked roads and highways.[3] In localized areas, the flooding caused severe damage to roads and houses.[5] Flooding from Doria also damaged water and sewage systems.[3] Rainfall in the state persisted for two\u00a0weeks after the passage of Doria.[6] In Virginia, the storm produced a storm tide of 3.6 feet (1.1\u00a0m) above normal in Norfolk.[2] Sustained winds peaked at 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) in Langley Air Force Base,[7] while gusts reached 71\u00a0mph (114\u00a0km/h) in Norfolk.[2] The bands of the storm spawned an F1 tornado near Portsmouth and Chesapeake, damaging twelve homes and downing hundreds of trees. Damage from the tornado amounted to $250,000 (1971\u00a0USD$, 1.88\u00a0million 2024\u00a0USD).[7][8] Rainfall from Doria was moderate, peaking at 6.44 inches (164\u00a0mm) at a location 2 miles (3.2\u00a0km) south-southeast of Halifax. One person drowned in Alexandria when she fell into a draining ditch. The storm severely damaged a large warehouse in Norfolk, as well.[7] Damage in Virginia totaled $375,000 (1971\u00a0USD$, 2.82\u00a0million 2024\u00a0USD).[9] Floodwaters from Doria clogged sewage systems near Norfolk, Virginia with sand and silt.

The government declared Monday, June 23, a day of national mourning.[8] In a message to the Bulgarian President Rosen Plevneliev, the President of the European Commission Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso promised to mobilize all available instruments to help the country.[20] According to EU legislation, for emergency funds to be activated a disaster needs to inflict damage of three billion Euros (by 2002 inflation rates) or more than 0.6% of the country's GDP. In the case of Bulgaria this means confirmed damages of at least 232,5 million Euros.[21] On June 24, officials announced that preliminary damage estimates in Veliko Tarnovo Province alone were over 10 million leva (5,1 million Euros).[2] Damage to the country's road infrastructure was estimated at around 15 million leva (7,7 million Euros), including about 1.5 million leva to reopen the Pass of the Republic.[3] On June 27, Varna Province officials announced that damage to local infrastructure there was estimated to be at least 30 million leva (15.25 million Euros).[4] Starting from June 24, officials in Varna began evacuating around 250 Asparuhovo residents from 85 buildings deemed too dangerous to live in, including at least 11 that would be demolished immediately. Due to the extreme amount of precipitation, measures were taken to stabilize parts of the hillside in the area for fears it might collapse in a landslide.[22] Water service was fully restored to Asparuhovo on June 25, although officials announced they will continue to monitor the chemical composition of water within the city of Varna for at least a few weeks.[23] By June 27, the number of evacuation orders in Asparuhovo had risen to 132, covering more than 1,000 residents of the neighborhood.[4] On June 20 the organizers of Sofia Pride announced they would postpone the 7th edition of the event, scheduled for the day after, in solidarity with the victims of the floods. They also appealed to citizens to actively contribute to the ongoing relief effort.[24] Dozens of fans of Levski (Sofia) and CSKA (Sofia) both urged supporters to donate via the text-messaging campaign and promised to organize help on the ground as well.[25] On June 23 a spokesman for the Bulgarian Army announced that a total of 860 people had been rescued or evacuated by various units across the country.[26] Relatives of people killed in the floods were to receive an immediate one-time government package of 10,000 leva (~5,113 Euros).[27] Within hours of the event, a donation campaign was set up through which citizens could contribute funds by sending text messages to a special numbers. By mid-afternoon on June 20 over 190,000 such texts had been sent, raising a few hundred thousand leva for victims of the floods.[5] By June 24, a total of 832,948 Leva (~425,600 Euros) had been gathered as part of the relief efforts, with about 80% of those coming from text messages and the rest being donated via bank accounts. Authorities estimated the total numbers of families that would require long-term help at around 800, spread across Varna, Dobrich and Veliko Tarnovo provinces.[28] Several dozen Syrian refugees traveled from camps in the capital Sofia and Harmanli to Varna, answering a call by the local municipality for volunteers to help with the clean-up effort.[29]"

The first storm, Subtropical Storm Alpha, developed on May\u00a023 off the Southeast United States and struck Florida, causing minor damage and two fatalities. The most significant storm of the season was Hurricane Agnes, which at the time was the costliest United States hurricane, until Frederic in 1979.[3] After brushing the western tip of Cuba, the hurricane made landfall on the Florida Panhandle. It caused at least $2.1\u00a0billion (1972\u00a0USD)[nb 1] in damage and 137\u00a0fatalities, mostly from inland flooding in Pennsylvania and New York. The strongest hurricane of the season was Betty, which reached peak winds of 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h) while west of the Azores. Tropical Storm Carrie passed just offshore of Massachusetts, causing heavy rainfall and resulting in four fatalities, but leaving only $1.78\u00a0million in damage. The remaining tropical systems caused no significant effects on land. Due to a strong El Ni\u00f1o only three systems strengthened into hurricanes, none of which intensified into major hurricanes.[nb 2] This was the first season to name subtropical storms, and did so using the Phonetic Alphabet. Collectively, the storms of the 1972 Atlantic hurricane season resulted in 137\u00a0deaths and over $2.1\u00a0billion in damage."

The lack of activity was attributed to an El Ni\u00f1o \u2013 which causes below normal sea surface temperatures over the eastern Atlantic \u2013 and strong vertical wind shear.[1] One subtropical storm and two hurricanes made landfall during the season and caused at least 137\u00a0fatalities and more than $2.1\u00a0billion in damage.[1][3][7][8][9][10] The last storm of the season, Subtropical Storm Delta, became extratropical on November\u00a07,[5] about 23\u00a0days before the official end of hurricane season on November\u00a030.[2] Tropical cyclogenesis first occurred in the month of May, with the development of Subtropical Storm Alpha. The month of June featured three tropical cyclones, including Hurricane Agnes and two tropical depressions. Three more systems formed in July, though all of them failed to reach tropical storm status. August was the most active month of the season, with five systems, including Hurricane Betty, Tropical Storm Carrie, and three tropical depressions. September featured slightly less cyclogenesis, with Hurricane Dawn, Subtropical Storm Charlie, and two tropical depressions. An additional three tropical depressions formed in October. Subtropical Storm Delta was the sole system in November, lasting from November\u00a01 to November\u00a07.[5] The season's activity was reflected with an Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) rating of 36,  the lowest value since 1962.[11] Broadly speaking, ACE is a measure of the power of a tropical or subtropical storm multiplied by the length of time it existed. Therefore, a storm with a longer duration, such as Betty, will have high values of ACE. It is only calculated for full advisories on specific tropical and subtropical systems reaching or exceeding wind speeds of 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h). Accordingly, tropical depressions are not included here. After the storm has dissipated, typically after the end of the season, the NHC reexamines the data, and produces a final report on each storm. These revisions can lead to a revised ACE total either upward or downward compared to the operational value.[11]"

After initially moving northeastward, it turned sharply southward on May\u00a026 due to a building ridge of high pressure.[1] Later that day, the system strengthened into Subtropical Storm Alpha and proceeded to move toward the coast of Georgia. After peaking with maximum sustained winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h), Alpha began weakening. Late on May\u00a027, the storm made landfall near Brunswick, Georgia, with winds of 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h). Alpha weakened to a subtropical depression and dissipated after entering the northeastern Gulf of Mexico on May\u00a029.[5] Rough seas generated by the storm resulted in two people drowning in Florida and halted work to deepen a harbor at the Mayport Naval Station in Jacksonville.[7][12] Tides along the Georgia coast reached 2 to 3\u00a0ft (0.61 to 0.91\u00a0m) above normal, which caused some flooding and beach erosion.[8][13] Wind gusts reached 58\u00a0mph (93\u00a0km/h) on Saint Simons Island.[14] The winds knocked down trees and power lines, leaving some people without power in eastern Georgia. Damage was minor but widespread in the state, estimated at over $50,000.[8] Moderate rains spread in coastal areas from South Carolina through southern Florida.[15] North Carolina also experienced about $50,000\u00a0in damage, mostly due to erosion.[8] Alpha was the first named subtropical storm.[1]"

        "content": "A polar front and an upper trough over the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula spawned a tropical depression on June\u00a014. The storm emerged into the western Caribbean Sea on June\u00a015, and by the following day, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Agnes. The storm curved northward and brushed western Cuba on June\u00a017. Agnes continued to intensify, and on June\u00a018, it was upgraded to a hurricane. Minimal fluctuations in intensity occurred before the storm made landfall near Panama City, Florida, on June\u00a019. After moving inland, Agnes rapidly weakened and was only a tropical depression when it entered Georgia. Thereafter, weakening slowed as the storm crossed over Georgia and into South Carolina. However, while over eastern North Carolina on June\u00a021, Agnes re-strengthened into a tropical storm, as a result of baroclinic activity. Early the following day, the storm emerged into the Atlantic Ocean before re-curving northwestward and making landfall near New York City as a strong tropical storm. Agnes quickly merged with a non-tropical low pressure system on June\u00a023.[1] Heavy rainfall occurred in western Cuba, causing flooding that destroyed 97\u00a0houses, isolated a few cities, and flatted crops in low-lying areas.[16] The storm left seven fatalities.[9] Agnes caused a significant tornado outbreak, with at least 26\u00a0confirmed twisters, 24\u00a0of them in Florida and the other two in Georgia. The tornadoes alone resulted in over $4.5\u00a0million in damage and six fatalities.[17] At least 2,082\u00a0structures in Florida suffered either major damage or were destroyed. About\u00a01,355 other dwellings experienced minor losses.[18] Though Agnes made landfall as a hurricane, no hurricane-force winds were reported. Abnormally high tides resulted in extensive damage, especially between Apalachicola and Cedar Key.[1] The storm left nine deaths and approximately $40\u00a0million in damage in Florida.[19] Generally minor effects were also recorded in the states of Alabama, Delaware, Georgia, Ohio, South Carolina, and Tennessee, as well as the New England region.[17] However, one fatality was reported in Delaware and three were recorded in Georgia.[1] The most significant effects, by far, occurred in Pennsylvania, mostly due to severe flooding.[1] Precipitation peaked at 18\u00a0in (460\u00a0mm) in Schuylkill County,[20] causing several creeks and rivers crest at record height, including the Delaware, Juniata, Lackawanna, Susquehanna, and West Branch Susquehanna rivers.[21] More than 100,000\u00a0people were forced to leave their homes due to flooding.[22] In the state of Pennsylvania, more than 3,000\u00a0businesses and 68,000\u00a0homes were destroyed, leaving at least 220,000\u00a0people homeless.[23] Agnes remains one of the worst natural disasters in Pennsylvania.[24] New York also suffered severe damage. Similarly, rivers in the state crested high, including the Allegheny, Chemung, Genesee, Susquehanna, and Tioga rivers.[21] Corning, Elmira, and Olean, as well as many other Southern Tier towns, were severely flooded.[17] Throughout New York, 32,832\u00a0homes were damaged and 628\u00a0others were damaged. A total of 1,547\u00a0small businesses were extensively damaged or demolished.[18] In Canada, a mobile home was toppled, killing two people.[10] Overall, Agnes caused 131\u00a0fatalities and over $2.1\u00a0billion in damage.[3][9][10]"

During the next 24\u00a0hours, minimal intensification occurred. However, a deepening high-level trough and a building ridge enhanced outflow and deep convection on August\u00a025. Additionally, reconnaissance aircraft flights began indicating a transition to a warm-core. Unfavorable northwesterly winds briefly halted further development, though by late on August\u00a026, Bravo resumed acquiring tropical characteristics after another deepening trough accelerated the storm eastward.[1] After reconnaissance aircraft reported winds of 98\u00a0mph (158\u00a0km/h) and satellite imagery indicated a storm with a classic cyclonic appearance, Bravo was reclassified as Hurricane Betty while located about 920\u00a0mi (1,480\u00a0km) west of the Azores on August\u00a027.[1] After some further strengthening, Betty attained its peak intensity as a Category\u00a02 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 976\u00a0mbar (28.8\u00a0inHg) early on August\u00a028. The hurricane then moved rapidly east-northeastward before decelerating late on the following day. Around that time, northerly winds aloft caused Betty to weaken to a Category\u00a01 hurricane. After briefly moving southward, the storm curved back to a general westward direction and fell to tropical storm intensity on August\u00a031. Later that day, Betty turned northward ahead of a trough and became extratropical about 565\u00a0mi (909\u00a0km) northwest of Corvo Island in the Azores on September\u00a01.[5]"

It managed to become a tropical storm on August\u00a031 and reached initial peak winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) later that day. However, upper-level winds increased, causing Carrie to weaken to a minimal tropical storm by September\u00a02. Due to baroclinic processes, Carrie began to re-intensify. As a result, Carrie attained its peak winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) just prior to transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on September 3. The extratropical cyclone continued northeastward, and struck eastern Maine on September\u00a04.[1] By the following day, the extratropical cyclone dissipated over the Gulf of Saint Lawrence.[5] Carrie had a minimal impact on the East Coast south of New England, limited to increased swells, gusty winds, and light rainfall. The worst conditions occurred over southeastern New England, where wind gusts reached 84\u00a0mph (135\u00a0km/h) and rainfall exceeded 1\u00a0ft (0.30\u00a0m). Damage was most severe along and slightly inland from the coast. Thousands of people became stranded on offshore islands of Massachusetts after dangerous conditions created by the storm prompted the suspension of steamship service. Overall, damage was generally light, with total monetary losses valued at $1.78\u00a0million. Four deaths were blamed on the storm.[1]"

Later that day, the depression struck Key Largo, Florida, before moving inland over the mainland of Florida.[5] The storm brought very light rainfall to the state, peaking at 1.19\u00a0in (30\u00a0mm) in Tavernier. The system moved northeastward and soon re-emerged into the Atlantic.[25] While located north of Grand Bahama on September\u00a06, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Dawn.[5] On September\u00a07, a cold low pressure developed near Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, which would influence much of Dawn's movement.[1] Around that time, the storm strengthened into a Category\u00a01 hurricane. Dawn then curved west-northwestward on September\u00a08 and peaked with maximum sustained winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 997\u00a0mbar (29.4\u00a0inHg).[5] With Dawn appearing as a threat to the Mid-Atlantic, storm and gale warnings were issued from Chincoteague Inlet, Virginia, to Cape May, New Jersey, on September\u00a08.[1] However, the hurricane veered southeastward on September\u00a09 and weakened to a tropical storm. By late on September\u00a010, after the cold low pressure area relinquished influence over Dawn, the cyclone began moving westward, but continued to deteriorate. Dawn weakened to a tropical depression while well east of Georgia late on September\u00a012. The system approached the Sea Islands on September\u00a013, but curved northeastward and remained offshore. Dawn dissipated less than 15\u00a0mi (24\u00a0km) east of Isle of Palms, South Carolina, on September\u00a014.[5] The storm also produced very light rainfall in Georgia and South Carolina.[25]"

It then moved quickly northeastward and continued to strengthen. Later on September\u00a020, Charlie peaked with maximum sustained winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h).

It moved northeastward and headed toward the island. The depression dissipated later the following day.[5] The next tropical Depression developed offshore North Florida on July\u00a010. Moving generally northward, the system made landfall near Cape Fear in North Carolina on July\u00a012. The depression dissipated over Virginia about two days later. Generally light rainfall was reported in several states, though 8\u00a0in (200\u00a0mm) of precipitation was recorded on Cedar Island, North Carolina.[26] Another tropical depression originated about 430\u00a0mi (690\u00a0km) southwest of Flores Island in the Azores on July\u00a016. It trekked slowly until July\u00a019, at which time the system curved northeastward. Late the following day, the depression dissipated about 225\u00a0mi (362\u00a0km) west of Flores Island.

The depression moved southwestward, toward the Bahamas and Lesser Antilles, but dissipated about 225\u00a0mi (362\u00a0km) northeast of Turks and Caicos Islands on August\u00a03.[5] A tropical depression developed over Senegal on August\u00a05. Tracking westward, the depression passed south of Cape Verde before dissipating southwest of the islands on August\u00a08. Four days later, another tropical depression originated about 175\u00a0mi (282\u00a0km) east-southeast of Charleston, South Carolina. It moved slowly northeastward and intensified slightly, but dissipated about 210\u00a0mi (340\u00a0km) southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, on August\u00a015. The tenth tropical depression formed on August\u00a016 while offshore Senegal. Moving generally westward, the cyclone crossed through Cape Verde and struck the islands of Fogo and Santiago.

The next tropical depression formed on September\u00a020 while located about 570\u00a0mi (920\u00a0km) west-southwest of Cape Verde. The storm tracked generally westward, but then began moving west-northwestward on September\u00a021. Three days later, the depression dissipated about 890\u00a0mi (1,430\u00a0km) east-northeast of Barbados.[5] On October\u00a01, a tropical depression originated about 700\u00a0mi (1,100\u00a0km) east-southeast of Bermuda. The depression tracked generally northward and dissipated about 505\u00a0mi (813\u00a0km) south-southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland, on October\u00a03. Another tropical depression formed about 120\u00a0mi (190\u00a0km) west of Bolama, Guinea-Bissau, on October\u00a05. The depression moved generally westward, before curving to the northwest on October\u00a08. Five days later, it turned northward while well northeast of the Lesser Antilles.

However, this measurement was deemed to be \"small scale[d]\" and not representative of the storm's actual intensity.[2] At 1700\u00a0UTC on September\u00a05, the National Hurricane Center upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Danielle, based on observations from reconnaissance aircraft and an oil rig.[7] The oil rig, which was location near the coast of Louisiana, reported winds of 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 1,004\u00a0mbar (29.6\u00a0inHg); this would later be considered the peak intensity of Danielle. A few hours later, Danielle made landfall near Galveston, Texas at the same intensity. The storm steadily weakened after moving inland and was downgraded to tropical depression by 1200\u00a0UTC on September\u00a06.[2] About four hours later, the National Hurricane Center discontinued advisories on Danielle.[8] However, the storm did not dissipate until 1200\u00a0UTC on September\u00a07, while located near Del Rio, Texas. The remnants of the storm continued westward for the next two days.[2]"

Flood waters also forced the shutdown of Interstate 10.[1] According to a police spokesman, at least 60% of streets in Port Arthur were inundated by water.[11] In Orange County, two people were injured in automobile accidents.[9] Along Highway 124, a bayou overflowed its bank.[12] Because there were numerous inundated streets, police barricaded roads in Beaumont, Bridge City, Orange, Vidor, and Port Arthur.[13] A sewer system in Roscoe was also damaged by flood waters, leaving 1,500\u00a0residents without running water.[14] In Port Arthur, twelve homes were reported flooded;[9] one house in the Lakeview neighborhood had 1 foot (0.30\u00a0m) of water inside.[15] Flood waters entered an oil pit at Port Neches, which sent at least 200\u00a0barrels of oil into the Neches River.[16] Danielle also produced tides 2 to 3 feet (0.61 to 0.91\u00a0m) above normal, causing minor beach erosion along the Texas coast. Several boats and docks on Lake Buchanan were damaged.[1] A third fatality from the storm occurred when a fisherman's boat on Sabine Lake capsized, causing the man to die of a heart attack during rescue.[17] Danielle spawned several tornadoes in the state of Texas, one of which caused an estimated $1,500 (1980\u00a0USD) in damage to a storage barn in Galveston County on the Bolivar Peninsula.[18] Another touched down twice in Beaumont and overturned a mobile home at a mobile home park. After the storm, the American Red Cross opened storm shelters for residents forced out of their homes because of the flooding.[19] Due to adverse conditions, \"hundreds\" were left without electricity in Beaumont, Silsbee, Kountze, Hamshire, and Fannett.[20] In addition, then President of the United States Jimmy Carter declared Jefferson and Nolan counties as disaster area, allowing those areas to receive federal aid.[21] Damage in Jefferson County alone totaled to $2.7\u00a0million (1980\u00a0USD). Overall, Danielle caused two fatalities and between $25\u00a0million and $50\u00a0million (1980\u00a0USD) in damage within the state of Texas.[9][22]"

        "content": " The 1866 Atlantic hurricane season was originally one of only four Atlantic hurricane seasons in which every known tropical cyclone attained hurricane status, along with 1852, 1858, and 1884.[1]  Initially, there were three known storms during the season, but a re-analysis confirmed the increased activity.[2]  There were also two other systems that were included as tropical cyclones at one time, although both were considered to have been other storms already in the database.  All tropical activity occurred between the middle of July and the end of October.  There may have been additional unconfirmed tropical cyclones during the season.  Meteorologist Christopher Landsea estimates that up to six storms were missed from the official database, due to small tropical cyclone size, sparse ship reports, and relatively unpopulated coastlines.[3] Every storm but the fourth hurricane affected land during the season. The first hurricane hit Matagorda, Texas in July, the only one of the season to hit the United States as a hurricane. A month later a hurricane made two landfalls in Mexico. The third hurricane of the season formed near Bermuda and was last observed along the southern coast of Newfoundland. A few weeks later another storm executed a similar track, although it struck Newfoundland as a hurricane and caused damage. The most notable storm of the season was the Great Nassau Hurricane, which killed at least 383\u00a0people in the Turks and Caicos, Bahamas, and the western Atlantic Ocean. It attained winds of 140\u00a0mph (220\u00a0km/h), which is a Category\u00a04 on the modern-day Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The final hurricane developed over the Bahamas and later struck New Jersey, producing strong winds and high tides across New England."

High tides surrounded the lighthouse at Timbalier Bay for about 24\u00a0hours, prompting the lighthouse keeper to resign from loneliness and from fear of the weather.[4] On July\u00a015, the hurricane moved ashore near Matagorda Bay in Texas, with winds estimated around 105\u00a0mph (165\u00a0km/h), or a Category\u00a02 on the Saffir-Simpson scale. At landfall, the minimum barometric pressure was estimated at 969\u00a0mbar (28.61\u00a0inHg).[5] The hurricane's strong winds broke all of the boats from their moorings in the Matagorda harbor.

The winds spread across much of the island, severing the telegraphs in and around St. John's. Late on September\u00a024, the storm was last observed to the north of the island.[1] [2] Around August 14, the emigrant bark Laura left Bremen en route to Baltimore, Maryland.

On September\u00a030 through the following day, the cyclone moved through the Turks and Caicos Islands, becoming what was considered \"one of the most terrific hurricanes ever known\". About 75% of the population was left homeless and moneyless.[2] After affecting the Turks and Caicos Islands, the hurricane passed through Eleuthera in the Bahamas where \u201cthe brig John Drew of Nova Scotia was overtaken halfway between Harbor Island and Spanish Wells.\"[7] All but two of the passengers and crew were lost: John Ridley and his daughter, Bessie, were rescued and resuscitated by the island occupants who discovered them. The eye then crossed over Nassau, where a barometric pressure of 938\u00a0mbar (27.70\u00a0inHg) was reported.[2] Based on this observation, the hurricane is estimated to have had sustained winds of 140\u00a0mph (220\u00a0km/h).[4] The hurricane struck without warning in the Bahamas, either washing ashore or sinking every ship but one in Nassau. In addition, strong winds downed trees and destroyed roofs.[2] Every building in Nassau was damaged or destroyed.[8] After moving through the islands, the hurricane curved northeastward,[1] affecting dozens of other ships and wrecking four. On October\u00a04, it passed north of Bermuda, where it produced Force\u00a011 winds on the Beaufort scale.[2] The hurricane was last observed on October\u00a05 to the southeast of Atlantic Canada.[1] Along its path through the Turks and Caicos, the Bahamas, and the western Atlantic, the hurricane killed at least 383\u00a0people, making it among the 100 deadliest Atlantic hurricanes.[9]"

In Brooklyn, the storm moved the rail cars off their tracks, while in Providence, Rhode Island the winds destroyed three buildings and wrecked the roofs of two others. Further northeast, the storm disrupted shipping and cut telegraph lines, although no fatalities were reported. The post-tropical storm was last observed over Vermont late on October\u00a030.[2]"

Dorian was one of four Category\u00a05 hurricanes to strike the Bahamas, the others being the 1932 Bahamas hurricane, the 1933 Cuba\u2013Brownsville hurricane, and Hurricane Andrew in 1992. The most recent hurricane to strike the archipelago was Hurricane Nicole in 2022."

The cyclone formed from a tropical low near the Queensland coast that itself formed as a result of Cyclone Pam's outer rainbands. Later that day, the BoM designated the system as 17U and intensified into Tropical Cyclone Nathan several hours later. It slowly executed a cyclonic loop over the next few days, moving across Arnhem Land. After intensifying to an initial peak intensity of 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph), Nathan weakened while crossing the Cape York Peninsula and reintensified over the Gulf of Carpentaria. It impacted Arnhem Land as an equivalent of a Category 1 cyclone, before hitting Darwin, Northern Territory, Northern Territory the same day. It dissipated afterwards. The remnants of Nathan brought 106\u00a0mm (4.2\u00a0in) of rainfall to Onslow, Western Australia on 30 March. Cyclone Nathan hit the Arnhem Land one month after Cyclone Lam.[1] Cyclone Nathan caused heavy flooding in Queensland and in the Northern Territory, though no deaths were reported. The cyclone's erratic path was a shock to many local residents. Total damage in northern Queensland were about A$74.8\u00a0million (US$57\u00a0million).[2]"

        "content": "On March 9, 2015, the outer rainbands of Cyclone Pam, which had recently made landfall in Vanuatu, generated a low-pressure area around 100 miles from the closest coastline of Queensland, Australia. The low-pressure area entered an area of warm waters and low wind shear, allowing the gradual increase in convection for the developing storm. As a result, the low-pressure area gradually intensified into a tropical storm, and the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) named it \"Nathan.[1] Nathan rapidly intensified to a category-2 cyclone within the same day, with maximum sustained winds of 110\u00a0mph. However, the period of intensification stopped as the cyclone experienced above-average wind shear and slightly colder waters. Despite this, Nathan still retained its category-2 intensity for nearly three more days as it took a winding path that curved two times. By the time the process finished, the cyclone was headed directly for the Cape York Peninsula.[3] During the curves, the cyclone periodically weakened below category-2 intensity into tropical storm intensity. However, it would always re-intensify back to category-2 strength. Near the end of its winding path, Nathan intensified into a final category-3 status, with maximum sustained winds of 125\u00a0mph. It made landfall in a sparsely populated area north of Cooktown on March 20 as a major cyclone with winds exceeding 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph), and gusts reaching nearly 210\u00a0km/h (130\u00a0mph).[3] As it passed over Cape York Peninsula, Nathan briefly weakened to tropical depression status. However, as a result of the brown ocean effect, it regained tropical storm status while being inland, and continued moving westwards. By March 22, as a result of the warm waters of the Gulf of Carpentaria, Nathan re-intensified into a hurricane and made landfall north of the small, remote Australian town of Nhulunbuy within the Northern Territory as a minimal hurricane. As it traveled over land, it quickly lost convection, and turned into a remnant low. The remnant low of Nathan traveled several more hundreds of miles, before eventually dissipating over the Timor Sea, west of Darwin, Northern Territory.[3]"

The Queensland Fire and Emergency Services (QFES) deployed at least 51 Urban Search and Rescue technicians from several stations within Queensland to Cape York Peninsula due to the possibility of stranded people needing rescues in the aftermath of the cyclone.[5] Acting Chief Superintendent Brett Schafferius said, \"Clearly all the key government agencies will be looking at what staff they have on the ground here and available and if need be, additional resources will be brought in. I can assure people up here that as every year we get an impact of cyclone in some measure, we're well and truly prepared for whatever Nathan will bring us\".[6] Heavy rain, flash floods, and high tide warnings were in place for nearly the entire region of Cape York Peninsula and for East Arnhem.[7]"

In Nhulunbuy, flooding reached knee-deep and disrupted transportation and communication.[8] Cyclone Nathan caused powerful wind-gusts throughout much of Lizard Island, causing heavy damage to the poor infrastructure of the rural island.[9] Roof shingles were blown away, trees were uprooted, and power poles snapped near the landfall site in Yirrkala.[8] Road closures and flight and ferry cancellations were widespread, causing severe transportation disruption. As runways and roads were washed out, emergency aid was blocked from entering the affected region in any proper manner. Flooding in Darwin, Northern Territory forced aid-carrying flights to instead land way west in Port Hedland, delaying aid by nearly an entire day, as washed roads caused helicopters to take the role as trucks would have.[10] Total damage in northern Queensland were about A$74.8\u00a0million (US$57\u00a0million).[2]"

The fourth named storm of the 2023 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, Hamoon formed from a low-pressure area over the west-central Bay of Bengal on 21\u00a0October. Initially slowly developing, after it entered an area favorable for development, it rapidly intensified, peaking as a very severe cyclonic storm on 24 October. However, soon after, Hamoon weakened due to wind shear, later making landfall in Bangladesh as a severe cyclonic storm. Once inland, Hamoon degenerated into a low-pressure area, last being noted on 26 October. Prior to Hamoon's landfall, officials in Bangladesh ordered the evacuation of over 1.5 million people as it was expected to have a severe impact on the nation. As Hamoon made its devastating landfall in Bangladesh on 26 October, five people died from Hamoon's winds. Additionally, 63 others sustained injuries. Over 6 million lost power, primarily in the port of Cox's Bazar, where several days after Hamoon made landfall, over 5 million were still without power. Elsewhere, a weakening Hamoon mainly brought light rainfall to India and Myanmar. In total, according to Aon, the cyclone caused around $250 million in damage."

After almost four months of inactivity, the IMD began to monitor a disturbance which was located in the Bay of Bengal on 6 May. The system steadily improved and was upgraded into a Depression by the IMD with it being classified as BOB 02. Soon afterwards on 10 May, it intensified to a Deep Depression. On the next day, it strengthened into a Cyclonic Storm with the IMD naming the system Mocha. Mocha afterwards, began to rapidly intensify and reached its peak intensity as a Category 5-equivalent cyclone on 14 May. Mocha then made landfall just north of Sittwe, Myanmar as a Category 4-equivalent cyclone. The cyclone then rapidly weakened and was last noted over the Chinese province of Yunnan on 15 May. Mocha caused heavy damage across Myanmar and Bangladesh and killed at least 400 people.

The season officially began on June\u00a01, 1967, and lasted until November 30, 1967. These dates, adopted by convention, historically describe the period in each year when most tropical cyclogenesis occurs in the Atlantic Ocean. The season's first system, Tropical Depression One, formed on June\u00a010, and the last, Tropical Storm Heidi, lost tropical characteristics on November 2. Hurricane Beulah, the strongest storm of the season, and only major hurricane (Category\u00a03 or above on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale), was also the most damaging. It caused 59\u00a0deaths and $235\u00a0million in damage (1967\u00a0USD) along its two-week-long path. Beulah formed on September\u00a05 and soon after crossed southern Martinique into the Caribbean Sea. On the island, it dropped 18.7\u00a0in (475\u00a0mm) of rainfall in Les Anses-d'Arlet, causing severe flooding. Widespread evacuations occurred along the southern coast of the Dominican Republic due to fears of a repeat of Hurricane Inez from the previous year. After brushing the south coast of Hispaniola, the hurricane weakened and re-intensified, striking the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula and later near the United States/Mexico border. There, it caused severe river flooding, killing 34\u00a0people in the two countries. Hurricanes Arlene and Chloe, as well as several tropical depressions, originated from tropical waves that left the coast of Africa. Chloe lasted for nearly 17\u00a0days, eventually dissipating over France after wrecking a ship offshore northern Spain, killing 14\u00a0people. Hurricane Doria co-existed with Beulah and Chloe, taking an unusual trajectory over the eastern United States; it killed three people in a boating accident offshore New Jersey. In late September, Tropical Storm Edith was a minimal storm that moved through the Lesser Antilles without serious impact. Hurricane Fern killed three\u00a0people when it struck Mexico north of Tampico."

        "content": "The 1967 Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June\u00a01, and ran through November\u00a030. These dates historically describe the period in each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic Ocean.[1] Tropical cyclogenesis, the process in which a tropical cyclone develops, resulted mainly from tropical waves, the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), and decaying frontal systems. There were 30\u00a0tropical waves that exited the west coast of Africa at Dakar, Senegal; another 20\u00a0tropical disturbances originated offshore the Mid-Atlantic states, and 7\u00a0disturbances derived from cold-core lows.[2] A total of 18 tropical depressions (tropical cyclones with maximum sustained winds of 38 mph (62 km/h) or less) formed during the season, 13 of which developed into named storms. Of those, six strengthened into hurricanes, while 1 system reached major hurricane intensity. This was the first season that non-developing tropical depressions were included into HURDAT, the National Hurricane Center(nbh)managed tropical cyclone database.[3] The season got off to a slow start, with the first operationally named storm, Arlene, not forming until August\u00a028. The latency was caused by a stronger than normal ridge across the Atlantic Ocean, which suppressed convective activity across the basin and prevented the formation of strong low pressure areas.[4] The season came to life in September, as seven tropical storms formed, including hurricanes Beulah, Chloe, and Doria.[3] The season's overall activity was reflected with a near normal Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) index of 121.7 units. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, such as Beulah, have high ACEs. It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 39 mph (63 km/h), which is the threshold for tropical storm status."

A tropical wave exited the coast of Africa on August\u00a024, and by the next day, a Pan American flight observed a circulation with falling pressures. Based on the system's organization on satellite imagery, the NHC assessed that Tropical Depression Five developed late on August\u00a028 about 740\u00a0mi (1,190\u00a0km) west of Cabo Verde. Steered by a strong ridge to its northeast, the nascent system tracked northwestward, strengthening into a tropical storm by 18:00\u00a0UTC on the following day. After two\u00a0ships reported gale-force winds, the NHC began issuing advisories on Tropical Storm Arlene at 08:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a030.[2][4][3] That day, Arlene quickly attained winds of 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h). Concomitantly, the Hurricane Hunters observed winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h),[4] although the storm was well below hurricane intensity at that time;[6] this was due to Arlene's interaction with the strong ridge.[4] Arlene failed to intensify much for nearly three\u00a0days while passing through the Mid-Atlantic upper-level trough, although its wind speeds eventually increased. On September\u00a02, Arlene turned to the north due to an approaching trough moving eastward from the Northeastern United States. Around that time, it began intensifying as it passed about 500\u00a0mi (800\u00a0km) east of Bermuda. The storm's convection wrapped around the center and organized further as Arlene progressed northward. Turning to the northeast, the storm attained hurricane status by 18:00\u00a0UTC. Late on the next day, the Hurricane Hunters recorded a minimum barometric pressure of 982\u00a0mbar (29.0\u00a0inHg), which, along with the storm's forward speed, suggested maximum sustained winds of 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h); together these data would signify Arlene's peak intensity.

On September\u00a06, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Chloe, but its intensity stabilized for the next three\u00a0days. On September\u00a09, intensification resumed, and the Hurricane Hunters visually observed winds of 86\u00a0mph (138\u00a0km/h); though these were judged to be too high, Chloe's winds neared hurricane status.[3] Maintaining intensity over the following day, Chloe turned sharply westward. By 12:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a011 Chloe attained hurricane status; around that time interaction with Hurricane Doria to the west turned Chloe more toward the northwest. Little more than a day later, Chloe peaked with winds of 110\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h), and subsequently reached its minimum pressure of 958\u00a0mbar (28.3\u00a0inHg), as documented by reconnaissance aircraft.[4][6] Due to the sparse observations in the area, it is possible that Chloe briefly reached major hurricane intensity, but data were insufficient for such an upgrade.[3] After maintaining peak winds for about 48\u00a0hours, Chloe weakened somewhat early on September\u00a015, while still over the open waters of the east-central Atlantic Ocean. By 12:00\u00a0UTC the cyclone briefly dipped below Category\u00a02 on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale, but re-intensified to recover its former status 12\u00a0hours later.[3] Over the next three\u00a0days the westerlies turned Chloe east-northeastward, but the storm maintained winds of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) during this timeframe. On September\u00a018 the storm was last intercepted by the Hurricane Hunters southeast of Newfoundland.[4] By 12:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a019 Chloe finally began to lose its strength, and a day later degenerated into a tropical storm. Chloe transitioned into an extratropical cyclone containing gales on September\u00a021. On the same date, the extratropical remnants of Chloe reached the coastline of France near Bordeaux and quickly dissipated inland over central France.[4] Off the northern coast of A Coru\u00f1a, Spain, high waves from Chloe sank the Fiete Schulze \u2013 a German cargo ship attempting to circumnavigate the storm. Of the 42\u00a0person crew, 14\u00a0people drowned, and the others were rescued and brought to a West German hospital, sparking fear of kidnapping from the East German government.[4][7]"

Moving westward, it organized into Tropical Depression Seven at 12:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a05, while located about 170\u00a0mi (270\u00a0km) northeast of Barbados. On September\u00a07, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Beulah, which crossed into the Caribbean Sea that day. After continued strengthening, Beulah became a hurricane on September\u00a08, and two days later reached an initial peak of 145\u00a0mph (233\u00a0km/h) to the southwest of Puerto Rico. An anticyclone over the Bahamas turned the hurricane westward, as changing upper-level conditions from a passing trough to the north, as well as land interaction with Hispaniola, greatly weakened Beulah. The track shifted to the southwest and weakened further to a tropical storm.[4] On September\u00a013, Beulah began a steady track to the northwest while passing south of Jamaica. On the next day, it re-intensified into a hurricane due to favorable conditions, strengthening to a major hurricane by September\u00a017. Continuing to intensify, Beulah impacted Cozumel and later the east coast of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula with winds of 125\u00a0mph (201\u00a0km/h). After weakening over land, Beulah restrengthened over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, attaining peak winds of 160\u00a0mph (260\u00a0km/h) early on September\u00a020, making it a Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson scale. On two aircraft passes about seven hours apart, Hurricane Hunters reported a minimum pressure of 923\u00a0mbar (27.3\u00a0inHg), the second-lowest aircraft reading at the time after Hurricane Hattie in 1961. The pressure may have been lower between those passes around 00:00 UTC\u00a0on that day as a result.[3] Beulah weakened slightly before making its final landfall around 12:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a020, just south of the United States\u2013Mexico border, with winds of 125\u00a0mph (201\u00a0km/h) and an estimated central pressure of 940\u00a0mb (28\u00a0inHg). It weakened quickly over land and stalled near Alice, Texas, before turning to the southwest over Nuevo Le\u00f3n on September\u00a022.[4] On Martinique, Beulah dropped 18.7\u00a0in (475\u00a0mm) of rainfall in Les Anses-d'Arlet.[8] Flooding rains damaged roads, bridges, and houses on Martinique and neighboring Saint Lucia. In the Lesser Antilles, Beulah caused $7.65\u00a0million in damage and 17\u00a0deaths. The storm caused minor damage and one death in southern Puerto Rico. After the severe impacts of Hurricane Inez a year prior, about 200,000\u00a0people evacuated the southern coast of the Dominican Republic. There, Beulah left heavy damage to roads, bridges, and the banana and coffee crops, but the evacuations led to a low death toll of two in the nation. Minor water damage occurred along Haiti's southern Tiburon Peninsula. On Cozumel, Beulah's strong winds destroyed 40% of the houses and heavily damaged many hotels, severely impacting the tourism industry. Along the northern Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, the winds wrecked a clock tower in Tizim\u00edn, killing five.[4] Beulah dropped heavy rainfall in southern Texas and northeastern Mexico, peaking at 27.38\u00a0in (695\u00a0mm) in Pettus, Texas.[9] The rains caused record river flooding, with a peak crest of 53.4\u00a0ft (16.3\u00a0m) along the San Antonio River at Goliad. In northeastern Mexico, Beulah killed 19\u00a0people, left 100,000\u00a0people homeless, and caused $26.9 million in damage. In Texas, damage reached $200\u00a0million, and there were 15\u00a0deaths, 5 of whom related to a then-record-breaking tornado outbreak that generated 115\u00a0tornadoes.[4]"

Twelve hours later, the storm reached peak winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h),[6] a trend that spurred hurricane watches from Dominica northward through the Leeward Islands.[13] The storm failed to intensify due to its proximity to a cold upper-level trough and releasing too much latent heat.

On October\u00a02, the British ship Plainsman observed gale-force winds, prompting the NHC to upgrade the depression to Tropical Storm Fern.[4] A small system, the storm intensified further to hurricane status on October\u00a03, reaching peak winds of 85\u00a0mph (137\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 987\u00a0mbar (29.1\u00a0inHg).[6] Upwelling and cold air left in the wake of Hurricane Beulah caused Fern to weaken slightly as it approached the Gulf Coast of Mexico. Around 06:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a04, Fern made landfall about 30\u00a0mi (48\u00a0km) north of Tampico, Tamaulipas, possibly having weakened to a tropical storm. It rapidly weakened over land, dissipating by 18:00\u00a0UTC.[4][6] Fern's landfall was accompanied by an area of heavy rainfall that extended into the mountainous areas of Veracruz.[15] The rains caused additional flooding along the P\u00e1nuco River, which became swollen during Hurricane Beulah two weeks prior. Three people drowned in the floodwaters. Damage was minor related to Fern.[4] Along the lower Texas coast, the threat from Fern spurred high tide and small craft warnings from the National Weather Service.

Sunrana moved through the storm on October\u00a020, reporting winds of 58\u00a0mph (93\u00a0km/h). At the time, the system was not named due to the lack of a warm thermal core,[4] although it was later assessed as a tropical storm as of 18:00\u00a0UTC that day.[6] On October\u00a021, the Hurricane Hunters observed a weak circulation with winds of only 35\u00a0mph (56\u00a0km/h). At the same time, the storm was located along the edge of a baroclinic zone, which limited strengthening. Curving northeastward due to an approaching trough, the storm intensified more on October\u00a022, as a ship reported winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h). That day, data from the Hurricane Hunters observed a warm core,[4] and the NHC classified the system as Tropical Storm Heidi. The storm was more of a hybrid storm initially,[19] with the strongest winds near the center, spurring gale warnings for Bermuda.[20] However, winds there only reached about 15\u00a0mph (24\u00a0km/h) during the storm's passage.[21] The NHC initially anticipated that Heidi would become extratropical within two days.[22] Early on October\u00a023, the agency upgraded the storm to hurricane status about 105\u00a0mi (175\u00a0mi) southeast of Bermuda. Heidi moved quickly eastward with the approaching trough until October\u00a025, when a building ridge caused the hurricane to move slowly northeastward in an area of light wind shear. Early on October\u00a026, Heidi attained peak winds of 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) about halfway between Bermuda and the Azores.[4][6] By the next day, the hurricane had become much larger, with characteristics of an extratropical storm despite maintaining the warm thermal core.[23] After stalling on October\u00a029, Heidi turned westward and weakened to tropical storm status.[6] Another approaching trough turned the storm back to the northeast on October\u00a031.[24] Later that day, Heidi started losing tropical characteristics,[25] transitioning into an extratropical cyclone by November\u00a01.

The third tropical cyclone of the 1972 Atlantic hurricane season, Carrie formed on August 29 from a complex sequence of meteorological events starting with the emergence of a tropical wave into the Atlantic in the middle of August. Tracking generally northward throughout its life, Carrie reached an initial peak intensity as a moderate tropical storm before nearly weakening back into tropical depression status. The storm began to intensify in a baroclinic environment after turning toward the northwest, its winds of 70,000 miles per hour (110,000\u00a0km/h) as it was transitioning into an extratropical system eclipsed the cyclone's previous maximum strength. The extratropical remnants of Carrie skirted eastern New England before making the landfall in Maine on September 4 and dissipating over the Gulf of Saint Lawrence during the next two days. Carrie had a minimal impact on the East Coast south of New England, limited to increased swells, gusty winds, and light rainfall. The worst conditions occurred over southeastern New England, where wind gusts reached 84\u00a0mph (135\u00a0km/h) and rainfall exceeded 1\u00a0ft (300\u00a0mm). Damage was most severe along and slightly inland from the coast. Thousands of people became stranded on offshore islands of Massachusetts, after dangerous conditions created by the storm prompted the suspension of ferry service. Overall damage was generally light, with total monetary losses valued at $1,780,000 (equivalent to $12,970,000 in 2023), and four deaths are blamed on the storm."

        "content": "The origins of Tropical Storm Carrie are traced back to a tropical wave\u2014an elongated area of low atmospheric air pressure that emerged from the western coast of Africa on August 15, 1972. A relatively strong weather system, the wave progressed westward, but by the time it had reached the Leeward Islands ten days later, it had degenerated substantially. The influence of a nearby upper-level low pressure system caused the disturbance to further deteriorate, and the resultant remnant circulation drifted toward the northwest; by August 28, it was situated at a position just offshore southeastern Florida. The low pressure system maintained a cold core and had not yet established itself at the surface. On August 29, the low began moving northward in response to an approaching trough. For the first time, a low-level circulation center had been identified in association with the system,[1] and the storm became a tropical depression at 1200 UTC while located east of the central Florida peninsula.[2] The depression tracked steadily northeastward as it gradually intensified.[1] On August 31, reconnaissance aircraft flying into the cyclone reported maximum sustained winds of up to around 55\u00a0mph (89\u00a0km/h).[1] Post-storm reanalysis estimated the depression had strengthened into a tropical storm at around 0000 UTC on August 31.[2] Operationally, however, it was not recognized as such until 2200 UTC that day, when it was assigned the name Carrie. At the time, the system was located approximately 350 miles (560\u00a0km) east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. A small storm, Carrie slowed drastically in forward movement as it curved northward.[3] By the time it was identified as a tropical storm in real-time, Carrie had already reached its initial peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 1,002 millibars (29.6\u00a0inHg), and strong wind shear inhibited immediate strengthening as it continue to slow to a drift. On September 1, Carrie began to weaken, and by early on September 2, it had dwindled to a minimal tropical storm with winds of only 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h).[1][2] Satellite imagery indicated that the storm's center of circulation had become distorted with little or no associated convection.[4] At its weakest, the storm's highest winds were found far from the center, likely generated more by the increasing pressure gradient in relation to an anticyclone to the north than by the low pressure center itself.[1] A low pressure system moving through the Mid-Atlantic states pulled Carrie northwest, back toward the United States East Coast, at an accelerated forward speed.[5] Later on September 2, the storm had begun to show signs of reorganization, including an improved appearance on satellite imagery and the development of some thunderstorm activity, although significant reintensification was considered unlikely.[6] However, with the advance of a trough embedded in the westerlies, Carrie quickly deepened under the influence of baroclinic processes. While the storm's maximum sustained winds increased, it also began to shed its tropical characteristics and resemble an extratropical cyclone.[1] Moving once again toward the north-northeast, Carrie was declared extratropical by the National Hurricane Center during the late afternoon on September 2.[7] In the official Atlantic Hurricane Database, however, Carrie is listed as a tropical cyclone until 1800 UTC on September 3, at which point it possessed winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) and a central barometric pressure of 993\u00a0mb (29.3\u00a0inHg). As a result, these data are considered representative of the storm's peak intensity.[2] Regardless of its status, the storm was a large and intense system as it progressed north and neared New England, generating strong winds and rough surf along the coast.[8] Having fully transitioned into an extratropical system, the storm made landfall near Eastport, Maine on September 4 and slowly weakened as it continued north up the Gulf of Saint Lawrence.[1] The cyclone fully dissipated on September 6 in the Gulf.[1]"

Sustained winds throughout the region were generally below 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h). In Boston, Massachusetts, winds gusted to 46\u00a0mph (74\u00a0km/h). The storm brought down trees and powerlines, blocking roads and damaging property. Structural damage was also evident, especially to buildings under construction, and an entire cottage in Rockland, Maine, was blown off its foundation.[15] Rainfall in southeastern New England was heavy, locally exceeding 10\u00a0in (250\u00a0mm). On the island of Martha's Vineyard, a storm total of 12.5\u00a0in (320\u00a0mm) was reported, the highest known precipitation sum resulting from Carrie. The most torrential rains were usually confined to within 70\u00a0mi (110\u00a0km) of the coast. The deluge swelled streams, inundated cellars, and washed out a railroad near Eagle Lake, Maine, derailing a train. Along the coast, rough surf caused beach erosion and swamped hundreds of small craft.[15] On September 3, choppy conditions forced the suspension of steamship services to and from the mainland and the islands of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket. Thousands of tourists and seasonal residents became stranded on the islands, creating what officials described as a \"logistical problem\".[16] During the height of the storm, around 20,000 Narragansett Electric Company customers lost power, with scattered power outages reported elsewhere throughout New England.[17] Damage from Tropical Storm Carrie and its extratropical remnants was light.[17] Total monetary damage was estimated at $1,780,000 (equivalent to $12,970,000 in 2023[18]), of which $1,200,000 in losses was inflicted on Massachusetts. Losses totaled $350,000 in Rhode Island, $200,000 in Maine, and $30,000 in New Hampshire.[19] Four fatalities were attributed to the storm: two in the aftermath of boating accidents in Massachusetts, and two due to rough surf along the coast of Maine. In the aftermath, a local disaster area was declared for the town of Plymouth.[15] The weakening remnants of Carrie produced strong winds throughout New Brunswick on September 4. In Saint John, where wind gusts reached 97\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph), there were reports of downed telephone wires and trees. Widespread power outages occurred throughout communities in the province. Despite well over an inch of rain at Saint John, no flooding was evident. Fredericton also received fairly heavy rain and gusty wind on the 4th, which was its wettest day of the month but not its windiest. The storm damaged or destroyed numerous boats in Charlo, New Brunswick.[20][21][22] Oceanic currents produced by the storm washed cells of the harmful alga Alexandrium fundyense south and west into the coastal waters of New England. The alga releases toxins that cause shellfish poisoning and is native to the Bay of Fundy. Several weeks after the storm, a massive bloom of the alga occurred offshore the northeastern United States for the first time, and the species bloomed every year post-Carrie.[23]"

Ianos developed from an area of low pressure over the Gulf of Sidra that quickly began tropical cyclogenesis while moving over warm waters. After receiving various names from different meteorological centers, the storm, dubbed Ianos by the METEO unit of the National Observatory of Athens,[2] rapidly intensified while moving northeastward. After scraping Italy, the storm went on to strike Malta and Crete with tropical storm-force winds. Despite land interaction, the small cyclone reached its peak intensity of 159\u00a0km/h (99\u00a0mph) with wind gusts up to 195\u00a0km/h (121\u00a0mph) on 18 September,[3] equivalent to a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale, immediately before making landfall in southwestern Greece. After landfall, Ianos turned back out to sea and moved south-southeastward, before dissipating on 21 September. Damage was severe in Greece, with cities in the central part of the country getting the brunt of the storm's impacts. Cities such as Karditsa and Mouzaki were flooded for several days. Heavy agricultural damage was reported in rural areas north of Athens. A state of emergency was declared for the islands of Ithaca, Kefalonia, and Zakynthos. Four people were killed, and one person remains missing.[4][5] Ianos caused at least $100 million (2020 USD) in damages.[1]"

        "content": "An upper-level low moved eastward in the southern Mediterranean Sea through 14 September. On that day, a low-pressure area began to develop over the Gulf of Sidra, beginning tropical cyclogenesis by forming a warm core at the surface.[6] The cyclone quickly developed in the subsequent hours while slowly moving northwest, with a wind speed of around 50\u00a0km/h (31\u00a0mph).[7] By 15 September, it had intensified to 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph), with a minimum pressure of 1,010\u00a0hPa (30\u00a0inHg), with further development predicted over the coming days. The cyclone had strong potential to become tropical over the next several days due to warm sea temperatures of 27 to 28\u00a0\u00b0C (81 to 82\u00a0\u00b0F) in the region. Weather models predicted that it would likely hit the west coast of Greece on 17 or 18 September. Ianos gradually intensified over the Ionian Sea, acquiring an eye-like feature. Ianos made landfall on Greece at peak intensity on 03:00 UTC on 18 September, with winds peaking near 159\u00a0km/h (99\u00a0mph) and a minimum central pressure estimated at 984.3\u00a0hPa (29.07\u00a0inHg), equivalent to a Category 2 hurricane.[3][7][8] After making landfall, Ianos turned south-southeastward on 19 September, moving back out to sea,[9] where the storm managed to reorganize somewhat. Soon afterward, Ianos underwent a weakening trend. Ianos continued moving south-southeastward for another couple of days before dissipating on 21 September, off the coast of Cyrenaica.[10][11] Warmer sea surface temperatures caused by climate change in the Mediterranean Sea can allow the storms to take on more tropical appearances and characteristics, increasing the wind speeds and making the storms more intense.[12] A 2017 study in Global and Planetary Change led by Raquel Romera examined a large suite of regional climate model projections, which supported the theory that medicanes will gradually become stronger due to climate change.[13]"

As much as 35\u00a0mm (1.4\u00a0in) of rain was reported in Reggio Calabria, more than the city's normal monthly rainfall.[14] The Hellenic National Meteorological Service issued Red Alerts, the highest level of warnings, to alert people of the storm while it was approaching Greece.[15] Downed trees and power outages were reported on Kefalonia, and residents were urged to stay indoors. Wind gusts reached 195\u00a0km/h (121\u00a0mph) on Kefalonia and Zakynthos.[3] When Ianos stalled over the western part of Greece, it caused flash flooding and landslides. The peak official rainfall amount recorded was 644.7\u00a0mm (25.38\u00a0in), in Kefalonia.[3] Ianos left four people dead and one missing. On 19 September, a man was found dead on his farm north of Athens, while the body of a woman was recovered from her flooded home in a nearby town. On 20 September, the body of a 62-year-old farmer was found under the collapsed roof of his house in a village north of Athens.[4] In addition, a 43-year-old woman was found dead on 24 September after being declared missing on 20 September. The woman was swept several kilometres from her car by flash flooding.[5] More than 5,000 homes were damaged.[4] In addition, there were strong tides in Ionian islands such as Kefalonia, Zakynthos, Ithaca and Lefkada, and 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph) winds at Karditsa that brought down trees and power lines, and caused landslides. A bridge also collapsed in Karditsa, one of the hardest-hit areas.[16] Throughout the country, over 600 people were rescued by the national firefighting service.[17] Greece's cotton crop was ready for harvest, which was set to begin just as the storm hit. However, Ianos likely caused significant flooding and crop losses where rain was heaviest, especially in Thessalia.[8] Assos, in Kefalonia, was isolated from the rest of the island and the mainland. Nearly two metres (6.6\u00a0ft) of rubble covered roads, prohibiting access by car and trapping residents and tourists. Damage in one village (Assos) in Kefalonia totaled more than \u20ac50,000 ($58,555 USD).[18]"

        "content": "The North American blizzard of 1947 (also known as the Great Blizzard of 1947) was a record-breaking snowfall that began without prediction on Christmas and brought the northeastern United States to a standstill. The snowstorm was described as the worst blizzard in the region after that of 1888.[1] The storm was not accompanied by high winds, but the snow fell silently and steadily. By the time it stopped on December 26, accumulation had reached 26.4 inches (67.1 cm) in Central Park in Manhattan.[2] Similar or greater accumulations were noted in all of metropolitan New York and New Jersey, as well as in upstate New York, Connecticut, and most of the mid-Atlantic region. Meteorological records indicate that warm moisture arising from the Gulf Stream fed the storm's energy when it encountered the cold air of the storm and greatly increased the precipitation. Automobiles and buses were stranded in the streets,[3][4] subway service was halted, and parked vehicles initially buried by the snowfall were blocked further by packed mounds created by snow plows when they were able to begin operation, some not accessible so long as the mounds persisted. Once trains resumed operations, they ran twelve hours late. Seventy-seven deaths are attributed to the blizzard. Interference with delivery of coal, the typical fuel for furnaces of the day, created emergencies in which facilities and homes with heating through underground gas-distribution systems or having a good supply of wood for their fireplaces became havens until supplies could be provided. Schools were closed. Typical items delivered regularly to homes during that period, such as milk, were subject to delays and sometimes deliveries were not possible due to roadways waiting plowing."

        "content": "Drifts exceeded ten feet and finding places to place snow from plowing became problematic, creating snow piles that exceeded twelve feet. In Manhattan, some of the snow was dumped into sewers, where it melted in the warm waste water flowing to the rivers. When possible the snow was dumped directly into the Hudson River and the East River. New Jersey, Connecticut, and upstate New York were affected heavily as well, but suburban areas did not have such nearby alternatives for disposal of the snow as a city built on islands and most resorted to stacking the snow into piles rivaling the highest drifts. In Connecticut, the Stamford Historical Society site has a photograph of the 1947 snowfall at the end of its discussion of the blizzard of 1888 for comparison.[5] In the book entitled, Disaster!, by Ben Kartman and Leonard Brown, the introduction to an article by Stephen Turkel describes the 1947 storm and its disastrous effects in detail. They noted that the effect of this storm rivaled the tales boasters related about the blizzard of 1888 and in the article, many statistics regarding the 1947 snowfall are given of a type that exceed those recorded in 1888.[6] In February 2022, the storm was recognized as the most snow New Jersey ever received in a 24 hour period, with this storm dropping up to 29.7\u00a0in (75\u00a0cm) in that timeframe.[7] The storm progressed westward toward the Great Plains, but with less moisture from the Gulf Stream feeding it along its path, the volume of snow lessened as the distance from warm seawater increased. Low temperatures that winter led to the snowfall remaining on the ground until March of the next year."

In and around the Lake Ontario snow belt, the storm period is considered to have lasted from January 27 - February 1, 1966, and the blizzard was a combination nor' easter and lake effect event in this region.[1] Prior to the event, temperatures plunged to record low levels in central and northern New York as Arctic air dominated in the wake of an earlier cyclone. Syracuse, NY, tied its official record low of -26\u00b0F on January 26.[1] [2] Within days, at least 142 people had been killed \u2014 31 had frozen to death, 46 died in fires that started while people were trying to heat their home.

Lake effect bands continued to impact northern Cayuga, Onondaga, Madison, Oswego, and Oneida counties even during the cyclonic portion of the event on January 30-31.[1] Winds were more than 60 miles per hour (97\u00a0km/h) during the storm. The snow was badly drifted and roads and schools closed as long as a week. Drifts covered entire 2 story houses.[7] A total of 102 inches (260\u00a0cm) of snow was recorded at Southwest Oswego by meteorologist and associate earth science professor Robert Sykes Jr. His total includes 50 inches (130\u00a0cm) of this falling on the calendar day of January 31 alone. Sykes' measurement methodology was designed to arrive at a \"true\" snowfall total and account for the settling effects of the wind on snow accumulation. His methodology included estimation and frequent measurements. While Sykes methodology was certainly rigorous and scientific, it is not directly comparable to official snowfall measuring practices utilized by the National Weather Service.[1] The official Oswego snowfall total for the storm, measured by the cooperative observer at the State University College at Oswego was 68\". Retired former federal meteorologist and cooperative observer at Oswego, Elmer Loveridge, maintained a private weather station at his home on Ellen Street in Oswego after the Weather Bureau Office in Oswego was closed in the early 1950s. Loveridge measured 71.5\" of snow during the event using standard methodology.[1] The heaviest snowfall centered from northern Cayuga and western Oswego County inland through central Oswego County into the southern Tug Hill of northern Oneida County. Storm totals of roughly seven feet were observed in central Oswego and northwest Oneida counties. Official storm totals include 89.5\" at Mallory, Oswego County, 84\" at Bennetts Bridge, Oswego County, and 80.7\" at Camden, Oneida County.[1] 50 inches (130\u00a0cm) of snow were recorded at Camden, New York on January 31. This is the official largest single day snowfall in New York history.[7] The last day of the blizzard the winds subsided and snowburst conditions prevailed, with the snow falling straight down. Fair Haven did not have official snowfall records at the time, but state troopers reported measuring 100 inches (250\u00a0cm) of snow on the level, where none had been prior to the storm. Syracuse, New York received a record snowfall of 42.3 inches (107\u00a0cm) which remained their heaviest storm on record, until the Blizzard of 1993.[8] At Oswego, the storm lasted from January 27 to January 31, 1966, a total of 4\u00bd\u00a0days. The daily snowfall totals for Southwest Oswego, as measured by Professor Robert Sykes Jr, are as follows."

The seventh named storm of the 1996\u201397 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season, Gretelle developed within the Intertropical Convergence Zone on 19 January, and gradually intensified while moving southwestward. On 22 January, the storm intensified to tropical cyclone status while passing northwest of R\u00e9union; there, Gretelle produced strong wind gusts and heavy rainfall in mountainous regions. Subsequently, the cyclone strengthened to reach peak 10-minute sustained winds of 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph). On 24 January, Gretelle made landfall near Farafangana, the first in the region in 41\u00a0years. The cyclone weakened while crossing Madagascar, but restrengthened slightly in the Mozambique Channel. Gretelle meandered off the coast of Mozambique, bringing gusty winds that downed trees, but caused little damage in the country. An approaching trough turned the cyclone to the southeast, and Gretelle dissipated on 31 January to the south-southwest of Madagascar. Damage from Cyclone Gretelle was heaviest near where it made landfall in Madagascar. In several villages, over 90% of the buildings were destroyed, leaving about 80,000\u00a0people homeless. Wind gusts at Farafangana reached 220\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph), which knocked trees onto roads and wrecked about 138,000\u00a0tons of crops. Heavy rainfall and high waves flooded coastal regions, in some areas up to 16\u00a0m (52\u00a0ft) deep. Overall damage was estimated at around $50\u00a0million[nb 1], and there were 152\u00a0deaths. After the storm, there was a coordinated international relief effort to provide food and money to Madagascar."

        "content": "The Intertropical Convergence Zone spawned a tropical disturbance on 19 January, developing a circulation just west of St. Brandon.[1] That day, the M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France on R\u00e9union (MFR) classified the system as a tropical disturbance,[nb 2] and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)[nb 3] began monitoring the system as a low-pressure area a day prior. The system intensified into Tropical Storm Gretelle late on 20 January,[4] by which time the JTWC gave it the designation Tropical Cyclone 20S.[3] Due to a large ridge centered near \u00cele Amsterdam, the storm tracked generally southwestward toward the Mascarene Islands.[1] Early on 22 January, the JTWC upgraded the storm to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane, and later that day, the MFR upgraded Gretelle to tropical cyclone status, or with 10-minute sustained winds of at least 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph).[4] Shortly after attaining tropical cyclone status, Gretelle made its closest point of approach to R\u00e9union late on 22 January, passing about 300\u00a0km (190\u00a0mi) northwest of the island. Subsequently, the cyclone developed a small eye,[1] and the MFR estimated peak 10-minute winds of 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph) at 0000\u00a0UTC on 23 January. Meanwhile, the JTWC estimated Gretelle continued to intensify to a 1-minute sustained wind peak of 215\u00a0km/h (135\u00a0mph) at 0600\u00a0UTC on 24 January, equivalent to a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale.[4] Later that day, the cyclone made landfall on southeastern Madagascar near Farafangana near peak intensity.[1] Reports from the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs considered Gretelle the first cyclone to strike the region in 41\u00a0years.[5] Gretelle rapidly weakened over land, emerging into the Mozambique Channel as a tropical depression on 25\u00a0January. Continuing to the southwest, the depression re-intensified into a tropical storm on 27\u00a0January.[1] After becoming a tropical storm again, Gretelle slowed in the Mozambique Channel. A cold front bypassed the storm to the south, and a building ridge behind it turned Gretelle to a west-northwest drift. Although it approached southeastern Africa on 28 January, an advancing trough turned the storm to the southeast.[1] The next day, the JTWC briefly re-upgraded Gretelle to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane, and on 30 January, the MFO estimated a secondary 10-minute wind peak of 85\u00a0km/h (55\u00a0mph). Accelerating to the south-southeast, Gretelle dissipated on 31 January well to the south-southwest of Madagascar.[4]"

Over 48\u00a0hours, rainfall totaled nearly 1\u00a0m (3.3\u00a0ft) at Commerson Crater, while Mafate recorded over 600\u00a0mm (24\u00a0in). Gretelle produced gusts of about 100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph) in portions of R\u00e9union.[1] Late in its duration, the cyclone produced heavy rainfall but left minimal damage in Mozambique,[6][7] estimated at $50,000.[8] Winds of over 55\u00a0km/h (34\u00a0km/h) knocked over trees and caused power outages in Gaza and Maputo provinces. Officials in South Africa issued rain and wind warnings for the northeast coast.[9] In Madagascar, Gretelle produced wind gusts of over 200\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph) at Vangaindrano near where it moved ashore,[10] and over 220\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph) at Farafangana. The storm also dropped heavy rainfall, although peak totals were unknown due to the meteorological station in Farafangana being destroyed.[11] Heavy rainfall and high waves left heavy damage near the coast,[10] washing away several boats and causing rivers to overflow.[7] Floods in some areas reached 16\u00a0m (52\u00a0ft) deep.[11] Where Gretelle made landfall, most buildings were damaged or destroyed excluding those made of concrete,[1] leaving about 80,000\u00a0people homeless.[12] Among the wrecked buildings included a hospital and a prison.[7] About 95% of homes in Vondrozo were wrecked, and in Farafangana, 90% of government buildings were destroyed. In both southern Midongy and Vangaindrano, nearly every building was destroyed. Gretelle damaged or destroyed 1,538\u00a0homes in Manakara.[13] Reports from the Red Cross indicated that Gretelle was the severest in the region \"in living memory\", with many people surviving the high tides and winds by \"clinging to trees\".[7] The storm also damaged water stations, power lines, and thousands of hectares of crops,[13] including food reserves.[11] The World Food Programme estimated that Gretelle destroyed 7,000\u00a0tons of rice, 123,500\u00a0tons of cassava, and 8,000\u00a0tons of cash crops, mostly to coffee.[14] About 40,000\u00a0people were isolated for weeks after the storm in Befotaka and Midongy Sud, with many roads blocked by fallen trees.[5] Overall, about 200\u00a0people were killed or left missing in Madagascar,[11] with 152\u00a0confirmed fatalities by two weeks after the storm,[15] 82 of whom in Vangaindrano.[12] The International Disaster Database later listed 140 as the total fatalities related to Gretelle. Damage from the storm was estimated at $50\u00a0million.[8]"

        "content": "After heavy damage from Cyclone Bonita in 1996, the government of Madagascar initiated a disaster response system that was used during Gretelle; there was quick response but efforts were hampered by damaged infrastructure and disrupted transportation.[11] The storm had cut communications in some areas,[7] but by 29 January, or five days after landfall, telephone service was restored to Manakara.[13] Following the storm, the Madagascar government coordinated the distribution of emergency rice rations and other relief items.[10] On 27 January, the government launched a fundraiser on television that raised over \u20a3130\u00a0million (FMG, US$30,000).[13] The southern portion of the country was declared a disaster area.[13] A plane of relief supplies flew from the capital Antananarivo to Manakara along the southeast coast, where trucks distributed the items to the affected areas. A radio station based out of the country criticized the slow pace of relief, citing the lack of available boats after many were destroyed.[16] In addition, there were reports that government aid was being stolen by looters.[12] In the weeks after the storm, the hardest hit residents faced food shortages and lacked access to clean water, in an area already facing ongoing food shortages. In response, the World Food Programme and other agencies of the United Nations created a program to feed about 350,000\u00a0people in the region over three months,[5] providing about 5,900\u00a0tons of food.[14] In the months after the storm, roads were repaired, including the link from Vangaindrano to Midongy. Farmers grew additional beans and potatoes to compensate for the damaged crops, while the quick distribution of food prevented significant malnutrition.[17] In the subsequent years, about 40% of the forest at Manombo that regrew following Gretelle was of foreign nature, which threatened the original plants in the region.[18] Due to the scale of the cyclone damage, the government issued an international appeal for assistance. As a result, the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs provided a grant of $30,000.[10] UNICEF provided about $48,000 to secure drug kits for children impacted by the cyclone.[5] The Red Cross of Seychelles donated about one tonne of clothing and 20\u00a0tonnes of tuna,[11] and the Red Cross of R\u00e9union sent drugs to Madagascar.[7] The government of France also sent a crew from R\u00e9union to Madagascar to assist in the aftermath,[13] as well as a plane to airdrop the aid.[5][11] The governments of Germany, Japan, France, the United Kingdom each donated about $100,000 to Madagascar, while the United States provided about $25,000 and 500\u00a0tons of food.[13] The government of Japan also sent 2,040\u00a0blankets and 10\u00a0tents. By 18 February, the total contributions by the international community reached about $3\u00a0million.[5]"

The seventh depression, third cyclonic storm, and second very severe cyclonic storm of the 2020 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, Gati formed from an area of low pressure in the Arabian Sea, on 21 November. The storm then explosively intensified, becoming a very severe tropical cyclone and reaching its peak intensity, the following day. Gati weakened slightly before making landfall in northeastern Somalia on 22 November. Gati was the first hurricane-force cyclone to make landfall in Somalia on record. Gati then weakened and became disorganized as it moved inland. The JTWC issued its final advisory on Gati shortly after it moved into the Gulf of Aden on 23 November. The name Gati was suggested by India, which means 'motion' in Hindi. Gati caused heavy rainfall over Somalia, peaking at 128\u00a0mm (5.0\u00a0in) in Bosaso. An estimated 10,000 animals were killed by Gati in Ufeyn. The storm killed at least 9 people and displaced approximately 42,000 others in the country and caused millions of dollars in damages.[1] Minor impacts were also observed on the Yemeni island of Socotra and in the Ethiopian Highlands."

        "content": "On 17\u00a0November 2020, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) noted the potential for tropical cyclogenesis over the central Arabian Sea in association with an area of convection near the Maldives.[2] Convective activity was enhanced by the Madden\u2013Julian oscillation while sea surface temperatures of 29 to 30\u00a0\u00b0C (84 to 86\u00a0\u00b0F) and low wind shear favored additional development.[3][4] By 18\u00a0November, a weak low-level circulation developed about 1,185\u00a0km (736\u00a0mi) east-southeast of Socotra.[4] Organization thereafter was stymied as it became embedded within a monsoon trough. Two additional circulations developed to the east and west of the original low; however, the original low steadily became the dominant system by absorbing the previous two circulations.[5] On 21 November, two scatterometer passes revealed a single, well-defined low with gale-force winds underneath an area of flaring convection.[6] At 18:00\u00a0UTC, the IMD classified the system as Depression ARB 04 about 410\u00a0km (250\u00a0mi) east-southeast of Socotra.[7] Similarly, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) initiated advisories on the system as Tropical Cyclone 03A. Steered west by a subtropical ridge to the north, little intensification was expected before the cyclone's forecast landfall in Somalia.[6] During the overnight of 21 to 22 November the small cyclone quickly organized,[8] with a well-defined eye developing.[9] The IMD upgraded the system to a deep depression early on 22 November and a cyclonic storm soon after. Upon becoming a cyclonic storm, it was assigned the name Gati.[10][11] Classified as a \"midget system\" by the JTWC with a core diameter of only 120\u00a0km (75\u00a0mi) and a 27\u00a0km (17\u00a0mi) wide eye, Gati explosively intensified that morning,[12] with 1-minute maximum sustained winds increasing from 110 to 185\u00a0km/h (70 to 115\u00a0mph) in only six hours. The IMD assessed Gati to have reached its peak intensity as a Very Severe Cyclonic Storm around 12:00\u00a0UTC, with three-minute sustained winds of 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph) and a minimum pressure of 976\u00a0hPa (28.82\u00a0inHg).[13] Six hours later, Gati had made landfall near Hafun in northeastern Somalia with estimated one-minute sustained winds of 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph).[14][15] This made Gati the first hurricane-force cyclone to strike the country since reliable records began and by default the nation's strongest.[14] Once onshore, land friction-based shear caused convection to quickly become displaced from the storm's center.[16] The low-level circulation became completely exposed early on 23\u00a0November as it traversed northeastern Somalia; the system's upper-level circulation and associated convection detached and accelerated west ahead of the surface low.[17] The increasingly elongated circulation of Gati emerged over the Gulf of Aden by 12:00\u00a0UTC,[18] and the JTWC issued their final advisory on the system shortly thereafter.[19]"

In Somaliland, the National Disaster Preparedness and Food Reserve Authority alerted residents of the storm and placed the coast guard on standby for possible evacuations.[23] Torrential rains, damaging winds, and storm surge impacted areas of northern Somalia, primarily in Puntland.[22][23] Twenty-four-hour rainfall totals reached 128\u00a0mm (5.0\u00a0in) in Bosaso and 103\u00a0mm (4.1\u00a0in) in the Balidhidhin District. Extensive damage occurred in Bari, with at least 642 homes destroyed and communication lost with several communities.[23][24][25] An estimated 180,000 people were directly affected by the cyclone, including 42,000 who were displaced from their homes.[26] Freshwater wells in Hafun, Taageer, and Qandala were inundated by flooding.[23][27] At least six people were injured in Hafun, including district commissioner Mohamud Yusuf Garow, due to collapsing buildings.[28] At least 8 fishermen were killed off the coast of Hafun while 30 others remain missing.[23][29][30] Farther inland, the desert communities of Ashira and Hordio were directly impacted by the cyclone's core.[15] An estimated 10,000 animals were killed in Ufeyn.[31] In Sanaag, roughly 950 heads of livestock were killed by Gati.[32] Flooding in Bosaso disrupted transportation.[33] A bridge was damaged between the towns of Maydh and Heis.[32] In Somaliland to the west, rainfall was lighter and no damage was reported.[23] Accumulations peaked at 60\u00a0mm (2.4\u00a0in) in Badhan and 35\u00a0mm (1.4\u00a0in) in Erigavo.[34]"

Requests were made to transport WASH supplies from Mogadishu, a process that normally takes ten days, with the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) working with Puntland to expedite the process.[34] By 26\u00a0November, 3,000 hygiene kits were distributed to about 9,000 people in Bossaso. United Nations Health and Nutrition Cluster partners mobilized clinics to aid 10,000 households across Bossaso, Hafun, Hurdiya, and Iskushuban.

Striking in November\u00a01988, the tropical system exacerbated the catastrophic damage from what was then considered the worst floods in Bangladesh's history. The tropical cyclone originated from a disturbance that developed within the Strait of Malacca on November\u00a021. Tracking slowly westward, the initial tropical depression reached tropical storm status in the Andaman Sea. On November\u00a026, the storm reached an intensity equivalent to that of a modern-day severe cyclonic storm and subsequently turned northward. Gradually intensifying as it had previously, the tropical cyclone reached peak intensity with winds of 125\u00a0mph (201\u00a0km/h) as it was making landfall near the Bangladesh\u2013India border on November\u00a029. Although the storm retained strong winds well inland, it was last monitored over central Bangladesh as a moderate cyclonic storm-equivalent on November\u00a030. The brunt of the tropical cyclone's damage was inflicted upon coastal areas of Bangladesh and West Bengal. A total of 6,240\u00a0people were killed as a result of the storm, with 5,708\u00a0in Bangladesh and 538\u00a0in West Bengal. Many of the deaths were a result of the destruction of homes or electrocution after strong winds toppled power poles across the region. Along the coast of Bangladesh, strong storm surge caused heavy infrastructure damage and contributed in wiping out an estimated 70% of all harvestable Bangladeshi crops, with an estimated 200,000\u00a0tonnes (220,000\u00a0tons) of crops being lost. Widespread power outages cut telecommunications across Bangladesh; in Dhaka, Bangladesh's capital city, debris-laden streets paralyzed traffic while electrical outages caused water shortages."

        "content": "During November\u00a01988, weather patterns over the Bay of Bengal were dominated by the winter monsoon, leading to lower atmospheric pressures over the region and the conglomeration of moisture across the area. The genesis of the 1988\u00a0Bangladesh cyclone was preceded by floods that occurred over the Malay Peninsula as a result of a monsoon trough redeveloping over the region.[1][2] By 18:00\u00a0UTC on November\u00a021, a low-pressure area within the Strait of Malacca was sufficiently organized such that the Joint Typhoon Warning Center\u00a0(JTWC) issued a Significant Tropical Weather Advisory; thus, the JTWC began closely monitoring the newly developing storm. Over the next few days, the tropical depression tracked west-northwestward into the Andaman Sea.[nb 1] The inchoate storm quickly organized during this period, and convection about the storm's center intensified. These developments caused satellite intensity estimates to increasingly indicate a stronger storm, which in turn prompted the JTWC to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert at 18:30\u00a0UTC on November\u00a023. At 06:00\u00a0UTC the following day, the JTWC upgraded the system to tropical storm status (or modern-day Cyclonic Storm-equivalent) and thus designate the storm as Tropical Cyclone 04B;[1] however, the storm's \"best track\" listing, which details refined cyclone positions and is subject to revision, indicates that the storm reached tropical storm intensity six hours earlier.[3] After reaching tropical storm status, the system took on a slower and more westerly path across the Bay of Bengal. Gradually strengthening, the system attained typhoon intensity (or modern-day Severe Cyclonic Storm-equivalent) at 00:00\u00a0UTC on November\u00a026. Shortly after reaching this strength, the cyclone began to curve northward, rounding the western periphery of a subtropical ridge centered over Indochina. Due to the ridge's broad size, the tropical cyclone was steered generally due north rather than northeast. Gradual intensification continued as the storm progressed closer to the coasts of Bangladesh and East India.[1] At around 12:00\u00a0UTC on November\u00a029, the tropical cyclone made landfall near the border between Bangladesh and West Bengal at the mouth of the Hooghly River. At the time, the JTWC analyzed the storm to have had maximum sustained winds of 200\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph); this was the cyclone's peak intensity. After landfall, the storm slowly weakened over Bangladesh and was last noted as a cyclonic storm-equivalent with sustained winds of 110\u00a0km/h (68\u00a0mph) on November\u00a030.[3]"

A 2\u00a0m (6.6\u00a0ft) storm surge inflicted significant damage along the Bangladeshi coast and forced the temporary closure of the Port of Mongla,[6] where nine were killed.[7] Off the coast, waves generated by the tropical cyclone reached 4.5\u00a0m (15\u00a0ft).[8] Twenty vessels and barges and hundreds of small fishing boats sank as a result of the rough seas and storm surge generated by the storm.[6]  Another 37\u00a0vessels carrying \u00a32\u00a0million (US$3.7\u00a0million) of goods ran aground.[9][nb 2] Approximately 200\u00a0km (120\u00a0mi) offshore, the Singaporean freighter Pumori capsized due to the cyclone, killing 19.[10] Initially reported as a much lower figure,[6] 5,708\u00a0fatalities occurred as a result of the tropical cyclone.[11] Despite the high death toll, the Bangladeshi government stated that human casualties were minimized by efficient early warning systems.[4] However, other deaths were blamed on poor communication systems, which did not effectively relay information to residents in more rural areas.[5] Many of the deaths were caused by the collapse of dwellings or by electrocution due to the collapse of high tension power poles, and most of the deaths occurred in Khulna District.[6] Nine people were killed in Khulna after a single power pole collapsed onto a house.[7] A hundred corpses were discovered on the island of Dublar Char alone.[6] In Satkhira, 100\u00a0people were killed due to flying debris kicked up by the storm's fierce winds.[10] In addition to the fatalities, nearly three million people were left homeless.[1] The storm's effects also resulted in the deaths of over 33,000\u00a0cattleheads and inflicted a heavy blow to the country's November\u2013December rice harvest. Crop damage occurred across 174,000 hectares (430,000 acres) of land in Bagerhat, Bhola, Khulna, and Satkhira districts as well as Cox's Bazar. The total gross weight of crop losses was estimated at 200,000\u00a0tonnes (220,000\u00a0tons),[6] accounting for 70%\u00a0of Bangladeshi crops that were ready for harvest.[1] Extensive damage to infrastructure was reported across the nation. Most mud and straw houses and tin shed offices and schools were destroyed due to the storm.[7] Telecommunications and electrical supplies were disrupted by the storm in at least sixteen towns and four coastal districts. In the capital city of Dhaka, debris and fallen trees caused by winds of up to 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph) resulted in both power outages and paralyzed traffic.[6][7] The power outages also disrupted the city's distribution of water.[7] In Shyamnagar Upazila, all mud and straw-constructed homes were destroyed.[12] Overall, an official estimates suggested 50,000\u00a0homes were destroyed across the country.[13] However, independent investigations were more aggressive in their estimates, suggesting that over a million homes accounting for 60\u201380% of homes in coastal Bangladesh were destroyed, displacing as many as seven million people.[14] In nearby West Bengal in India, the death toll was largely disputed between government agencies and news agencies, with the former generally indicating lower figures.[15] While the Kolkata Police Force initially reported 210\u00a0deaths, various news agencies suggested that the death toll was around 500.[12] Ultimately, the official death toll in West Bengal reached 538.[16] In addition to human casualties, the cyclone also killed 57,604 heads of cattle.[17] The damage in West Bengal totaled US$13\u00a0million.[18] Following the cyclone's passage, the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society began dispatching relief teams, food, and other supplies to impacted areas. The Bangladesh Army and non-governmental organizations participated in both air- and water-borne relief operations, though inclement weather initially forced the suspension of several planned helicopter flights.[6] Both the Bangladesh Navy and Indian Navy convened in the northern littoral of the Bay of Bengal to search for the thousands of fishermen and islanders that went missing during the tropical cyclone's landfall.[9] Due to the wide scope of the disaster, the Bangladeshi government appealed for international aid, particularly from Japan and Canada as those countries had played large roles in the relief efforts of past Bangladeshi disasters.[19] The Government of the Netherlands donated US$370,000\u00a0for use in the relief efforts following the storm.[6] Lord Glenarthur, then British Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, toured affected areas in Bangladesh for three days before announcing a \u00a3200,000\u00a0grant (US$370,000) to voluntary relief agencies assisting in cyclone relief operations.[20] Then-Bangladeshi President Hussain Muhammad Ershad also visited the worst impacted districts, including Khulna and Bagerhat. Following these visits, Ershad's administration established a national disaster committee composed of relief specialists to coordinate relief and rehabilitation efforts.[6]"

        "content": "Completed in 1935, this two-storeyed concrete structure was the third building to be used as a Masonic Temple in Cairns.[1] The first recorded gathering of Freemasons in Cairns was held in December 1885, at Hides Hotel. The first Masonic Lodge in Cairns, Gregory Lodge No. 50 was constituted in April 1886. By the mid 1920s, there were six Lodges that met in Cairns, in a building in Lake Street. Prior to the destruction of this building by a cyclone in 1927, the Lodges moved to a building adjoining the site of the present Temple.[1] In 1921, at a meeting held in the Cairns Masonic Hall, it was resolved that the representatives of the Gregory Lodge would communicate with the Grand Lodge regarding the establishment of a District Grand Lodge (DGL) of Carpentaria, with headquarters at Cairns. The creation of the DGL of Carpentaria was approved by the Grand Lodge in December 1923, and was subsequently formed in 1924; the Carpentaria district spread from Cardwell to Cape York, and west to Normanton.[1] In 1928, it was recommended that the DGL erect a suitable memorial to the craftsman who sacrificed so much in World War I, and to the peace which followed. The following year, the DGL organised an appeal for individual donations towards the erection of the Memorial Temple. In 1934 it was decided to proceed with the erection of a Memorial Temple adjoining the present Hall at a cost not exceeding \u00a312 000.[1] Tenders for the new Masonic Temple were called in August 1934. The architects for the buildings were the north Queensland firm of Hill and Taylor, who had offices in Townsville and Cairns. Richard Hill and Arthur Taylor established the firm of Hill and Taylor in Cairns in 1927, and in 1931, the firm took over the practice of CV Rees in Townsville. Both Hill and Taylor appear to have been masons.[1] The contractor for the building was CE Steadman, also a mason. The foundation stone of the building was laid on Armistice Day in 1934. Reports from the laying of the stone refer to the building as the Masonic Peace Memorial Temple, and the following description was given of the building:[1] it would [upon its completion] be a worthy and fitting monument of the union of Freemasonry and a fitting memorial and tribute to those who sacrificed so much in the Great War. When it was decided to have the foundation stone laid on Armistice Day, he believed that no more fitting day could have been chosen as it was a day symbolising peace and harmony which was an attribute of the Craft The Temple was constructed during the large-scale interwar redevelopment of Cairns, in which the city centre was virtually rebuilt. The redevelopment was partly a consequence of severe cyclone damage suffered by the city in 1920 and 1927, and also of the developing role of Cairns as an important regional centre in Far North Queensland.[1] The dedication ceremony for the completed Temple was held in October 1935, and was performed by Sir Leslie Wilson, Governor of Queensland and Masonic Grand Master. The ceremony was a large occasion; attended by about 700 representatives of Lodges in Queensland.[1] A description of the building shortly before the dedication, referred to the imposing facade facing Minnie Street, and the North Queensland walnut and maple joinery. The attention given to the ventilation of the building was also important, and ducts from the external wall were brought through under a raised platform around the lodge room and the air exhausted by two big fans ensuring a continuous flow of fresh, cool air on even the most humid evenings.[1] A tablet to the memory of WHJ Mayers, the Foundation District Grand Master, was set into the base of the pillar at the left entrance to the temple and unveiled in March 1954.[1] The two large pillars at the entrance to the temple were destroyed/damaged by a cyclone in March 1956. There was considerable damage also to the windows and outbuildings of the temple. New columns are recorded as being completed in 1957, and in accordance with Masonic tradition, were formed hollow and a copy of all records subsequent to the laying of the foundation stone was placed inside one of the pillars.[1]"

The building is T-shaped in plan, with the main body of the building consisting of a minimally adorned box with high set steel framed windows. The gable entrance sits proud of the main section, and features a symmetrical facade composed of classical elements.[1] The entry consists of a flight of stairs to a recessed door with a cantilevered awning. The doorway is surmounted by a tall rendered arch flanked by a Corinthian column, supporting a large globe, to either side. Each column sits on a pedestal with a marble plaque. The rendered arch mouldings contain a large keystone and surround a circular window above a row of four small square windows. The parapet has a deep cornice above the words AD GLORIAM DEI, and is crowned with the masonic emblem of the carpenter's square and divider.[1] The building has high-level steel framed, multi-paned windows to each side and rear. Entrance doors area also located on either side and at the rear.[1] Internally, the building appears to consist of a large hall with a gallery, with staircases to the first floor at the front and rear.[1] The Minnie Street facade has an iron fence with concrete posts.[1]"

The Temple survives as an illustration of the development of Cairns as an important regional centre during the early twentieth century.[1] The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The Masonic Temple has an imposing idiosyncratic facade which makes a strong contribution to the Cairns townscape. The building's facade, scale and form ensures its status as a Cairns landmark.[1]"

        "content": " The March 2017 North American blizzard also known as  Winter Storm Stella was a major late-season blizzard that affected the Northeastern United States, New England and Canada, dumping up to 3 feet (36\u00a0in; 91\u00a0cm) of snow in the hardest hit areas, mainly New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and southern Quebec. Forming out of an extratropical cyclone near the Northwest, the storm system dived into the northern portions of the United States, dropping light to moderate snow across the Great Lakes, Upper Midwest on March 11\u201312 before reaching the Ohio Valley the next day. It later coalesced into a powerful nor'easter off the East Coast, producing a swath of heavy snowfall across a large portion of the Northeast. The storm was given various unofficial names, such as Winter Storm Stella, Blizzard Eugene, and Blizzard of 2017.[3][4][5] Ahead of the storm, residents prepared in advance for the major nor'easter, with blizzard warnings issued for several states, including New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts. Several officials had crews with salt trucks ready to deploy to clear roads. The system also disrupted travel across the country, with numerous flight cancellations at most of the major airports in the Northeast. It dropped a swath of moderate snow accumulation as it moved across the northern tier of the country, with as much as 13 inches (33\u00a0cm) reported. The storm was also responsible for ending a record streak without snowfall in Chicago, Illinois, where no snow had occurred since December 25, 2016.[6]"

        "content": "On March 9, an extratropical cyclone formed in the North Pacific Ocean. On March 11, it began to affect parts of the Northwestern United States as well as British Columbia in Canada.[7] It eventually moved ashore later that day and transferred its energy to a new surface low, which began to move southeastwards into the United States as an Alberta clipper. The system moved swiftly across the Upper Midwest throughout the day of March 12, dropping a swath of accumulating snow of 3\u20136 inches (7.6\u201315.2\u00a0cm) as frontogenesis took place.[8] On March 13 at 15:00\u00a0UTC, the Weather Prediction Center began issuing storm summaries while the system was located west-northwest of St. Louis, Missouri.[9] Throughout the day, a weak secondary area of low pressure formed in the Gulf of Mexico and drifted northeastwards, while not expected to fuse with the other low to its north, it helped inject moisture from the ocean over the state of Florida, which gradually began to merge with the outermost fringes of the northerly system that had now moved into the Ohio Valley.[10][11] By 21:00\u00a0UTC that night, a new surface low developed off the Georgia coastline with a central pressure of 1,010 millibars (30\u00a0inHg),[12] eventually becoming the dominant low of the nor'easter. The storm began to rapidly deepen as it moved parallel to the East Coast of the United States, with the central pressure dropping to 986 millibars (29.1\u00a0inHg) by 15:00\u00a0UTC on March 14 while it was just off the Maryland coastline.[13] The storm continued to intensify as it drifted northeastwards towards Long Island, continuing to produce an expansive area of snow with heavier rates embedded in snowbands across Connecticut, northern New York and most of interior New England, as well as parts of Canada.[14] The low subsequently reached its peak intensity of 974 millibars (28.8\u00a0inHg) while just inland over Long Island. By 20:00\u00a0UTC, most of the snow had come to an end in New Jersey, Delaware, and Washington D.C., as the low began to move inland over New England; subsequently it also began to weaken as it traveled further inland, and by early on March 15, snow began to end in more parts of the region.[15] The system continued to weaken as it moved slowly through upper New England, the system continued to weaken, consequently, the Weather Prediction Center terminated storm summaries on the winter storm as nearly most of the moderate to heavy snow had stopped in the region and switched to rain. On March 18, the low that was formerly the blizzard had moved out to sea and dissipated."

Initially, the National Weather Service predicted that the blizzard would leave New York City with up to 12\u201324 inches (30\u201361\u00a0cm) (rivaling it almost with the Great Blizzard of 1888), however these totals were later reduced due to the change in the system's track.[17][18] Similarly, the metro area faced a similar situation a little over two years prior where New York City was predicted to receive up to 2\u20133 feet (24\u201336\u00a0in) of snow, but only received less than half of the predicted amount due to a shift in the storm's track by 50\u2013100 miles (80\u2013161\u00a0km). Meteorologists at the National Weather Service were aware of the changing conditions that led to lesser snow accumulations along the coast the night prior to the expected event. In a multi-office conference, however, forecasters decided to maintain the higher-than-likely snowfall predictions \"out of extreme caution.\" They sought to avoid sending mixed and/or incorrect messages about a dangerous storm by maintaining a steady forecast.[19]"

At the end of the blizzard, 18\u00a0cm (7\u00a0in) were recorded in Ottawa, 40\u00a0cm (16\u00a0in) in Montreal, 35\u00a0cm (14\u00a0in) in Quebec City, 55\u00a0cm (22\u00a0in) in Sherbrooke, 70\u00a0cm (28\u00a0in) in Drummondville, and more than 75\u00a0cm (30\u00a0in) in several locations such as Saint-Hubert, Vaudreuil-Dorion and Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu.[124] Winds from the Northeast increased in the Saint Lawrence River between Montreal and Quebec City in the evening, producing the blizzard. Wind gusts reached 107\u00a0km/h (66\u00a0mph) at Montreal Pierre-Elliott Trudeau International Airport, 113\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph) at Saint-Hubert Airport on the South Shore and 140\u00a0km/h (87\u00a0mph) at Quebec International Airport.[124] Numerous road pileups occurred, most notably on Ontario Highway 401 near Mallorytown, on Quebec highway 20 near Saint-Zotique (which caused a major fire, destroying several semis and killing one of their drivers), on highway 10 near Magog, on highway 40 near Lavaltrie and on Highway 20 near Sainte-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne de Bagot.[124] Road closures included highway 15 near the USA border, highway 10 near Magog, highway 20 in Saint-Zotique and Saint-Eug\u00e8ne, and most notably on highway 13 on Montreal Island, where several hundreds of cars and trucks were left trapped for more than 14 hours due to communication and logistic issues complicating the evacuation.[124] In Quebec, many areas were left without power for more than 24 hours.  In Quebec City, the Saint-Lawrence river stepped out of its riverbed, flooding both areas of Quebec City and L\u00e9vis.[125] Five people were killed during the storm itself.[126] At least two more (both elderly males) were found dead in Montreal in parked cars over the following days, presumably killed by heart attacks while attempting to clear them out.[127]"

The North Indian Ocean cyclone season has no official bounds, but cyclones tend to form between months of April and December, with the peak from May to November. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northern Indian Ocean. The scope of this article is limited to the Indian Ocean in the Northern Hemisphere, east of the Horn of Africa and west of the Malay Peninsula. There are two main seas in the North Indian Ocean\u00a0\u2014 the Arabian Sea to the west of the Indian subcontinent, abbreviated ARB by the India Meteorological Department (IMD); and the Bay of Bengal to the east, abbreviated BOB by the IMD. The official Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre in this basin is the India Meteorological Department (IMD), while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center releases unofficial advisories. On average, three to four cyclonic storms form in this basin every season.[1]"

Ashobaa was followed by 2 depressions, before Komen formed in July. Komen produced torrential rainfall in Bangladesh. September featured no storms, before Chapala formed at the end of October. Chapala rapidly intensified over the Arabian Sea into an Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm, becoming the strongest in the Arabian Sea since Gonu in 2007. Chapala also became the only hurricane force system to make landfall in Yemen, and the first since 1922 in Socotra. Chapala was followed by Megh, which reached a weaker intensity in the same general area."

It slowly consolidated, prompting the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on June 6.[2] The following day, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) issued its first advisory for the system, designating it ARB 01. Later the same day, the JTWC reported the storm had reached tropical cyclone intensity, and on June 8, the IMD upgraded the storm to a cyclonic storm, assigning it the name Ashobaa. The storm continued to track northwestwards for a while, before turning westwards and weakening due to moderate to high wind shear and land interaction. Due to most of the moisture being drawn into the storm, the onset of the southwest monsoon over the Indian subcontinent was stalled.[3] Torrential rains fell across much of eastern Oman, with Masirah Island receiving 225\u00a0mm (8.9\u00a0in) of rain in one day and more than 250\u00a0mm (9.8\u00a0in) overall.[4][5] Significant flooding prompted dozens of evacuations while strong winds caused power outages.[6] Waterlogging was reported in Kalba and Fujairah, in the United Arab Emirates, due to disturbed weather attributed to Ashobaa.[7]"

Chapala caused widespread damage in mainland Yemen, Socotra and the Puntland region of Somalia. High winds, strong waves, and heavy rainfall affected the southern Yemen coast, with areas in the region receiving 610\u00a0mm (24\u00a0in) of rainfall over 48 hours, or 700% of the average yearly precipitation. The storm caused severe flooding along the coast, including in Mukalla, the nation's fifth largest city, where the seafront was destroyed by waves exceeding 9\u00a0m (30\u00a0ft). While passing north of Socotra, Chapala brought heavy rainfall and high winds while inundating the northeastern part of the island.

The IMD later upgraded the system to a deep depression before it crossed the coast of Tamil Nadu near Puducherry the following day with peak wind speeds of 55\u00a0km/h (35\u00a0mph) and a minimum central pressure of 991\u00a0hPa (29.26\u00a0inHg). Due to land interaction and high vertical wind shear, the system weakened into a well-marked low-pressure area over north Tamil Nadu on November 10. The storm brought heavy rainfall over the coastal districts of Tamil Nadu. Neyveli, a mining township southwest of Puducherry, recorded 139\u00a0mm (5.5\u00a0in) of rainfall on November 9 and 483\u00a0mm (19.0\u00a0in) of rainfall on November 10[63] of which 450\u00a0mm (18\u00a0in) fell within a span of 9 hours.[64] At least 71\u00a0people were killed in various incidents, predominately related to flooding, across Tamil Nadu.[65][66]"

The storm paralyzed the East Coast from the Chesapeake Bay to Maine,[1][2] as well as the Atlantic provinces of Canada.[3] Snow fell from 10 to 58 inches (25 to 147\u00a0cm) in parts of New Jersey, New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut, and sustained winds of more than 45 miles per hour (72\u00a0km/h) produced snowdrifts in excess of 50 feet (15\u00a0m). Railroads were shut down and people were confined to their homes for up to a week.[3] Railway and telegraph lines were disabled, and this provided the impetus to move these pieces of infrastructure underground. Emergency services were also affected during this blizzard."

In a 2007 article, the National Weather Service estimated that this nor'easter dumped as much as 50 inches (130\u00a0cm) of snow in parts of Connecticut and Massachusetts, while parts of New Jersey and New York had up to 40 inches (100\u00a0cm).[2] Most of northern Vermont received from 20 inches (51\u00a0cm) to 30 inches (76\u00a0cm).[6] Drifts averaged 30\u201340 feet (9.1\u201312.2\u00a0m), over the tops of houses from New York to New England, with reports of drifts covering three-story houses. The highest drift was recorded in Gravesend, Brooklyn at 52 feet or 16 metres. 58 inches (150\u00a0cm) of snow fell in Saratoga Springs, New York; 48 inches (120\u00a0cm) in Albany, New York; 45 inches (110\u00a0cm) in New Haven, Connecticut; and 22 inches (56\u00a0cm) in New York City.[7] The storm also produced severe winds; 80 miles per hour (129\u00a0km/h) wind gusts were reported, although the highest official report in New York City was 40 miles per hour (64\u00a0km/h), with a 54 miles per hour (87\u00a0km/h) gust reported at Block Island.[7] On March 13, New York City recorded a low of 6\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221214\u00a0\u00b0C), the coldest so late in the season, with the high rising to only 12\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221211\u00a0\u00b0C).[5]"

Transportation gridlock as a result of the storm was partially responsible for the creation of the first underground subway system in the United States, which opened nine years later in Boston.[8][9]  The New York Stock Exchange was closed for two days.[10] A full two day weather related closure would not occur again until Hurricane Sandy in 2012.[11] Similarly, telegraph infrastructure was disabled, isolating Montreal and most of the large northeastern U.S. cities from Washington, D.C. to Boston for days.  Following the storm, New York began placing its telegraph and telephone infrastructure underground to prevent their destruction.[12] Fire stations were immobilized, and property loss from fire alone was estimated at $25\u00a0million (equivalent to $850 million in 2024).[1] From the Chesapeake Bay through the New England area, more than 200 ships were either grounded or wrecked, resulting in the deaths of at least 100 seamen.[7] [13] Efforts were made to push the snow into the Atlantic Ocean. Severe flooding occurred after the storm due to melting snow, especially in the Brooklyn area, which was susceptible to flooding because of its topography.[7] Not all areas were notably affected by the Blizzard of 1888; an article in the Cambridge Press published five days after the storm noted that the \"fall of snow in this vicinity was comparatively small, and had it not been accompanied by a strong wind it would have been regarded as rather trifling in amount, the total depth, on a level, not exceeding ten inches\".[14] Roscoe Conkling, an influential Republican politician, died as a result of the storm after attempting to walk home during the blizzard.[15] On 1 October 1888, an article appeared in the first issue of the National Geographic Society magazine about the great blizzard. It was written by Edward Everett Hayden and described the blizzard and the courageous and successful struggle, told by boat-keeper Robert Robinson, of the crew from the pilot-boat Charles H. Marshall, No. 3.[16]"

Also in the city the Cumberland Basin flooded with new temporary flood barriers erected for the first time to protect housing.[29] The Severn bore combined with high water leading to flooding in Gloucestershire, as the river burst its banks at Minsterworth, Maisemore, Elmore and Newnham.[29] Widespread coastal flooding and damage occurred in Ireland.[30] Flooding was reported in Cork and County Cork.[31] Flooding began in Cork on 2 January evening tide at 17:45. Clare County Council described the promenade at Lahinch as \"seriously compromised\" following the storm.[32] Images of waves lashing the promenade and spray blowing over the normally popular surfing location, were captured.[33][34] Several families were evacuated from homes in the village after homes flooded.[35] There were further reports of damage across County Clare in Doolin, Spanish Point and Quilty.[32] Inishbofin in County Galway saw heavy seas, which caused extensive damage on the island, including a lighthouse beacon swept off its foundations.[36][37] In Northern Ireland parts of Coleraine in County Londonderry were flooded after the River Bann overflowed, several coastal roads around the region were closed because of flooding.[38] The Isle of Man Government said low-lying port areas were affected, with parts of Ramsey losing electricity, though damage appeared minimal.[39] In Wales 30 homes were flooded in Cardigan.[40] On the Welsh coast 100 residents were evacuated from vulnerable homes in Borth and Aberystwyth.[41] Aberystwyth was hit by destructive high waves for the second time this winter, after it was hit by a storm which followed the St. Jude storm on 2\u20133 November 2013.[42][43] Aberystwyth sea front has previously been severely damaged by storms in October 1927 and January 1938.[44] Damage occurred to sea defences and gardens at St Bees, Cumbria.

[1][2][3] The calamity affected the province of Sondrio, but also other Alpine valleys in the  provinces of Brescia, Bergamo, Lecco, and Como.[4] During June and July 1987 Valtellina witnessed an exceptionally high rainfall accompanied with rapid glacier melting due to the relatively high altitude of the 0 degree isotherm. As a result, the Val Pola Creek significantly eroded its valley flanks, including the area of debris accumulation of post-glacial landslides.[3] This resulted in a fracture which detached an estimated volume of 35\u201345 million cubic metres of old debris from the Northern slope of the Mount Zandila (Eastern side of Pizzo Coppetto[5]) first detected on 25 July. On 26 July evacuations of local villages started. The fracture eventually produced a rapid rock avalanche with subsequent shallow landslides of the Val Pola sides and a debris flow along the Val Pola thalweg.[6] The flow entrained an estimated 5\u20138 million cubic meters of debris. The created alluvial fan dammed the Adda River and created a lake. The mass ran about 1.5 km downstream and generated an upstream mud wave 35 m high which traveled about 2.7 km. [3] Twenty-two people were killed by the main landslide, which created a huge wave in the temporary lake caused by a previous, smaller landslide.[6] The landslide resulted in a 35 m deepening of the Val Pola canyon.[6] The debris from the Val Pola rock avalanche and landslide impounded on the Adda River creating a lake with 6 million cubic meters of water. The landslide itself obliterated 5 villages and six hamlets with 43 people dying of various disaster-related causes.[7][2][8] The total cost of the disaster  and several months of its mitigation was about 400 million euros.[9] The resulting lake created the floodability threat, because the accumulated huge amount of water threatened to breach the debris dam and flood the Adda valley. Efforts to mitigate the threat included evacuation of about 25,000 people downstream, works to stabilize the debris tongue to prevent spill-over with subsequent dam breach, and works to drain the lake in a controllable manner.[7][2][10] The disaster coincided with the change of the government of Italy, including the replacement of the Minister of Civil Protection, which resulted in a certain amount of policy vacuum and non-optimal decisions.[7] By appointment of the Ministry of Civil Protection, a large monitoring system was installed on many different sites throughout the Valtellina (Campofranscia, Spriana, Torreggio, Valpola), to check the progress of the landslide phenomena.[11][12] In July 2007, a civil protection national exercise, Valtellina 2007, was carried out which simulated hydraulic and hydrogeological risk similar to that of the 1987 disaster.[4]"

The storm was also nicknamed the \"Storm of the Century\" in Quebec.[1] The event included the worst 24-hour snowfall on record in the city of Montreal with 43 centimetres (16.9 inches) of snow falling on March 4, for a total of 47 centimetres (18.5 inches), until the one-day record was broken again on December 27, 2012.[3] Higher terrain in eastern Quebec received as much as 80 centimetres (31.5 inches). Heavy snowfall was also recorded in eastern Ontario and northern New Brunswick as well as parts of the Northeastern United States. The storm itself was responsible for the deaths of 17 people in Montreal (30 province-wide) along with numerous other injuries directly and indirectly attributed to the blizzard."

        "content": "A coastal low-pressure system, called a Nor'easter, developed across the coastal United States late on March 3, 1971. The system rapidly intensified as it moved towards the Northeast United States as well as Quebec and eastern Ontario. The storm centre had a rapid pressure drop to 966 millibars (966\u00a0hPa; 28.5\u00a0inHg) while it was centred over New York before moving across New Brunswick exiting the province of Quebec during the morning of March 5.[1] Snow started across most of the affected areas on March 3 with the peak of the storm during most of the day on March 4 where for a period of up to 17 hours there was at least moderate snow and blowing snow in Montreal. Visibility was also significantly reduced for nearly 24 hours. The 47 centimetres (18.5 inches) received makes it one of the heaviest snowfalls on records for Montreal with the 43 centimetres (16.9 inches) received on March 4 being the snowiest day on record.[1][4] Elsewhere across Quebec, 80 centimetres (31.5 inches) of snow fell in the Laurentides Wildlife Reserve north of Quebec City while 65 to 75 centimetres (25.6 to 29.5 inches) of snow fell locally in the Gasp\u00e9sie, Bas-Saint-Laurent and Eastern Townships regions south of the Saint Lawrence River. Up to 40 centimetres (15.7 inches) fell in the Ottawa and Quebec City regions.[1]\nThe heavy snow was accompanied by damaging wind gusts of near hurricane-force, which created snowdrifts of up to two stories high in some places. Widespread power outages were reported and some were left without power for up to ten days. The city of Montreal was left paralyzed following the storm for a few days. Bus service was stopped: snowmobiles and the Montreal Metro were the easiest transportation options possible throughout the city, while bridges and roads were completely shut down.[5] For the first time in over 50 years a Montreal Canadiens National Hockey League game at the Montreal Forum was postponed.[6] Seventeen people were killed in Montreal while there were several other injuries related to the storm. Fatalities were resulted by heart attacks or people stuck inside stranded vehicles. At least two people were killed in the Quebec City region and at least 30 fatalities were reported province-wide. It took at least 36 hours to clean up the worst of the storm and to resume regular traffic although snow clearing operations lasted for several days.[2][7] Initial damage estimates were at about $1\u00a0million (1971\u00a0dollars) for central Quebec including 50 homes that received roof damage. Businesses also sustained window damage some due to flying debris particularly in the Limoilou area of Quebec City.[8]"

Ottawa had received up to 444 centimetres (174.8 inches) of snow that year and Montreal just over 380 centimetres (149.6 inches), records that were nearly broken during the 2007\u20132008 season when Ottawa received 436 centimetres (171.7 inches) and Montreal 375 centimetres (147.6 inches). Quebec City also had their worst season in 1970\u20131971 with 460 centimetres (181.1 inches) before it was broken in 2007\u20132008 when just over 500 centimetres (196.9 inches) fell.[9][10][11] Storms in December 1969 left 58 centimetres (22.8 inches) in three days across the city making that event the most significant snowfall event from one system. Other systems in 1954, 1955, and 2001 had higher total snowfalls for a single event making the 1971 even the fifth-heaviest single-event snowfall. The record snowfall may have been a contributing factor for a deadly mudslide in the town of Saint-Jean-Vianney in May 1971 when heavy rains combined with already saturated grounds because of heavy melting snow formed a large sinkhole of about 600 metres (660 yards) wide and 30 metres (98.4 feet) deep. Thirty-one people were killed by the mudslide.[7]"

At least 35 people were killed at a resort on Ilha Grande:[4] about forty people were staying in the hotel which was buried under a mudslide, and the death toll is expected to rise further.[5] Brazil's only functioning nuclear power plant, Central Nuclear Almirante \u00c1lvaro Alberto, is also located within the municipality: plans were made for a temporary shutdown, as blocked roads would make any evacuation difficult or impossible in the event of an incident at the plant.[2] In Rio Grande do Sul, at least seven people died and 20 went missing after a bridge collapsed due to heavy rains.[6] Around 60 tons of dead fish washed up in a lagoon in Rio de Janeiro beginning in January,[7][8][9] possibly as a result of local ocean anoxia caused by algal blooms triggered by increased eutrophication from the excess run-off produced by the flooding."

It initially paralleled the Indian coastline, becoming a tropical storm on June\u00a09 with a minimum barometric pressure of 986\u00a0mbar (29.1\u00a0inHg).[1] That day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began tracking the system. The storm moved northward, followed by a northwest turn on June\u00a010.[2] It curved toward the west, and the JTWC reported the cyclone as reaching peak 1\u2013minute sustained winds of 110\u00a0km/h (68\u00a0mph) on June\u00a011.[2] In addition, the India Meteorological Department estimated the system became a severe cyclonic storm, which has sustained winds of at least 118\u00a0km/h (73\u00a0mph).[3] On June\u00a012, the storm attained a minimum pressure of 975\u00a0mbar (28.8\u00a0inHg) while continuing westward.[1] On June\u00a013, the eye of the cyclone passed over Masirah Island for a 40-minute period, producing peak sustained winds of 167\u00a0km/h (104\u00a0mph) and a minimum pressure of 956\u00a0mbar (28.2\u00a0inHg).[1] The JTWC issued the final advisory at 0800\u00a0UTC that day.[2] The Oman Department of Meteorology reported the storm as being much stronger than the JTWC, with sustained winds of 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h) and gusts to 230\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph).[4] The cyclone was the strongest on record to make landfall on the Arabian Peninsula, until Cyclone Gonu surpassed it in 2007.[5][6] Shortly after striking Masirah, the storm moved ashore mainland Oman, causing rapid weakening to tropical depression status.

The waves affected several drilling rigs operated by the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, forcing work to shut down. The tanker Texaco Plymouth experienced significant structural damage from the storm, losing two lifeboats. The freighter Buxom Island in the central Arabian Sea experienced 139\u00a0km/h (86\u00a0mph) winds before sinking, which took the lives of 23 of its crew.[1] The military base in Masirah was first warned about the cyclone on June\u00a011. The next day, officials there raised a Category\u00a03 warning, which was soon upgraded to Category\u00a02. Aircraft were stored in hangars, and workers inspected the roofs of buildings before riding out the storm in a shelter. Hurricane-force winds struck during the morning hours of June\u00a013, with sustained winds peaking at 167\u00a0km/h (104\u00a0mph) and gusts to 200\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph). After a lull during the eye's passage, winds then increased out of the southwest towards 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph). The strong winds caused buildings to collapse and roof beams to be blown through the air. Every building at the base sustained damage, and virtually all homes in the nearby village were leveled.[1] The radio relay station on the island was also damaged.[7] Overall, the storm wrecked about 95% of the buildings in Masirah,[8] leaving 2,000\u00a0people homeless there. Rain totals were significant, with a total of 482.3\u00a0mm (18.99\u00a0in) falling 40 kilometres (25\u00a0mi) northeast of Salalah.[1] A station on Masirah Island reported 430.6\u00a0mm (16.95\u00a0in) in 24\u00a0hours, more than six times the average annual precipitation there. The total was the highest daily rainfall in the period from 1977 to 2003 nationwide.[9] Floods washed away thousands of animals as well as lime and palm-tree plantations,[1] downing thousands of trees across the region.[10] The rains flooded the main highway from Muscat to Salalah, and also accumulated in the typically dry Dhofar region. There, most drains were unable to withstand the unusual flooding.[1] The cyclone was considered the worst disaster in Oman during the 20th century,[10] and remains the deadliest cyclone as of 2010.[11] Overall, the cyclone caused 105\u00a0deaths,[12] and over 5,000\u00a0injuries,[13] and left about 20,000\u00a0people homeless.[10] The death toll is disputed, as another report indicated 110\u00a0deaths in Oman.[1] After the storm, neighboring Saudi Arabia sent assistance to Oman,[14] as did other nations in the Persian Gulf.[15] The cyclone struck before the nation created a coordinated disaster network in 1988; as a result, the relief work was spread among various agencies.[16]"

Bird populations were decimated across the nation. Henderson County, Tennessee saw nearly the complete extinction of its bluebird population[14] and Culpeper County, as well as most northern and central Virginia counties lost nearly all of its quail, having to import new birds in the late teens and 1920s to repopulate the areas.[15] Some of the bird species affected:[16] Bluebird, Blue-headed vireo, Catbirds, Chipping sparrow, Dark-eyed junco (also known as snowbird), Fox sparrow, Grass finch, Hermit thrush, Killdeer, Meadowlark, Mourning dove, Pine warbler, Quail, Savannah sparrow, Song sparrow, Swamp sparrow, and Woodcock. It has been estimated that over 100 people died.[2] In Brooklyn, 31 year-old Mary Goodwin was frozen to death and a thinly clad, unidentified woman in The Dalles, Oregon, was found frozen to death in a hallway in an attempt to find warmth. Mail carriers Palmer and Hawkins of New York were thought to have drowned attempting to deliver the mail. It is believed that their boat, overturned by the high winds, was crushed by the floating ice.[17] Crops were ruined, and orchards utterly destroyed in Georgia.[18] Walla Walla, Washington's majority of wheat was destroyed by the frost with Eureka Flat seeing the most damage.[19] Traffic was brought to a complete standstill in all parts of the country. Barges on the Mississippi River \u2014 which was in some parts entirely frozen through \u2014 and the Great Lakes, were brought to a complete standstill. Traffic across all railroads were delayed or paralyzed indefinitely while steamers and liners were likewise delayed.[20]"

Officials said hundreds of people have been forced from their homes, dozens of houses have collapsed and hundreds of homes were damaged.[9] According to an IGSU press release, the storms and flooding affected the counties of Alba, Arad, Bac\u0103u, Boto\u0219ani, Bra\u0219ov,  Cluj, Hunedoara, Ia\u0219i, Mehedin\u021bi, Neam\u021b, Olt, Prahova, S\u0103laj, Sibiu, Suceava, Timi\u0219, Tulcea, V\u00e2lcea and Vrancea.

The north-eastern town of Dorohoi witnessed 6 deaths in the night of June 28\u201329 as floods rose to just over 1 metre, 3,3 feet in some places. Several roads into Dorohoi remained either washed away or under water.[8] The heavy rain that had been falling for much of the past week in the Balkan country and forecasters have warned that it will continue in northeast Romania until Wednesday morning.[8] The emergency situations spokeswoman Dorina Lupu from Boto\u0219ani County said unusually heavy rain had killed 6 people, most in the town of Dorohoi on the 29th.[10] On July 5, 2010, the Danube in Gala\u021bi recorded a flow rate of 676\u00a0cm (76\u00a0cm above the rate of flooding) and a flow of 16,055\u00a0m/s. At \u0218endreni, Siret had a rate of 728\u00a0cm (78\u00a0cm over the danger level).[11] The local emergency services reinforced the dykes in the afternoon and narrowly averted any more flooding. It was flooded during the July 2010 flood as was its names sake in Gala\u021bi County. In Gala\u021bi, the city was building a dam 1.5 m high, 4.5\u00a0km long, with the support of 1,400 military personnel from the Ministry of Administration and Interior and the Ministry of Defence. If the dam breaches, the resulting flood would drown one-quarter of the city, including its shipyard, port and customs office. Nearly 12,000 jobs exist in the area, and about \u20ac45 million is lost daily and around \u20ac250 million in property losses have been caused by the flooding in Gala\u021bi.[11]"

Numerous other motorists while been stuck on highways were also forced to abandon their vehicles, particularly on Highways 15 and 30 north of Laval and between Brossard and Varennes[51][52] About 900\u00a0accidents were reported in Ontario provincial highways by Ontario Provincial Police including 450\u00a0across Eastern Ontario,[53][54] while the Toronto Police Service reported over 1700 collisions during the weekend.[55] In the Niagara region, a tour bus carrying 17\u00a0people tipped over into a ditch although there was no known word on any injuries in this incident.[43] In Ohio, according to the State Highway Patrol, nearly 2 000\u00a0crashes occurred throughout the state, including one fatal one and 190\u00a0others which resulted in injuries.[46]"

On 17 January 1881,[5] a low pressure system rapidly developed in the English Channel. The snowfalls began on the 17th in the southwest and as the system deepened as it moved through the Channel, a gale force easterly developed over southern parts with heavy blizzards and drifting snow. The blizzard paralysed all transport, communication, trade and industries. Hundreds of miles of rail track were blocked by drifting snow, dozens of feet high in places. Even in central London, there were 3-foot drifts in places. Around 100 people are believed to have died as a result of the blizzard. The storm was accompanied by extreme cold.[citation needed]"

While this was by far the hardest hit region, it was also a significant snowstorm for the Philadelphia and New York City areas, which both suffered occasional blizzard conditions and 12\u201315\u00a0in (30\u201338\u00a0cm) snow accumulations.[1] The storm began dropping snow on the upper Midwest on Thursday, January 20, 2005. It slowly moved eastward affecting the Great Lakes region and the Mid-Atlantic states on Friday and Saturday, January 21 and January 22, 2005. On Saturday evening the storm entered the Southern New England area. The strength of the storm, coupled with the extreme Arctic temperatures, created a light, fluffy snow which increased the snowfall totals. The storm shut down Logan International Airport in Boston, Massachusetts and T. F. Green Airport in Rhode Island, while also impairing travel throughout much of Massachusetts due to the high amount of snow covering the roads.  Practically all schools in the Metrowest and South East regions of Massachusetts were closed for at least two days.  Cape Cod Community College, as well as all public schools on Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket were closed for up to a week. After traveling across the Atlantic Ocean, the storm system hit parts of Great Britain and Ireland and the Scandinavian peninsula, causing even more widespread blackouts and a small number of deaths in the region."

State Police in both Dartmouth and Middleborough suggested that residents travel as little as possible.  Major highways, such as Route 24, Route 6 and Route 140, could not be properly cleared because of the heavy snowfall and high winds.  Secondary highways, such as Route 79 were nearly impassable in some areas. Many Boston-area newscasters credit the New England Patriots football game on January 23 for keeping most travellers indoors, avoiding the pile-ups and endless lines of stuck cars that were the hallmark of the Blizzard of 1978.  The fact that the storm fell on a weekend when many people did not have to go to work or school also helped to this effect."

Most schools in eastern Massachusetts and Rhode Island remained closed for an extended period of time to allow for clean-up of the road debris."

There are no current plans for another study.[11] Although many advances have been made towards flood protection in Louisiana, flooding is inevitable; the changing course of the river(s) will continue no matter how high the levees are built.[12] The Mississippi River flood history shows that the river has a pattern of major flooding once every decade or so."

The following day, the cyclone reached its peak intensity with winds of 250\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph) (10-minute sustained) and a barometric pressure of 904\u00a0hPa (mbar).[1] Orson maintained this intensity for nearly two days before making landfall near Dampier. The cyclone rapidly weakened after landfall as it accelerated to the southeast. After moving into the Great Australian Bight on 24 April, the storm dissipated. Despite Orson's extreme intensity, damage was relatively minimal as it struck a sparsely populated region of Western Australia. Five people were killed offshore and damages amounted to A$20\u00a0million (US$16.8\u00a0million). The storm damaged a new gas platform, delaying the project for nearly two weeks. The most severe impacts took place in Pannawonica, where 70 homes were damaged. Following the storm, cleanup costs reached A$5\u00a0million (US$4.1\u00a0million).

        "content": "Cyclone Orson originated out of a tropical low, monitored by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, that formed northwest of Darwin, Northern Territory on 17 April 1989. The system tracked southwest throughout the day before turning due west and strengthening into a tropical cyclone, at which time it received the name Orson.[3] At this time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also began monitoring the storm as Tropical Storm 28S.[4] The forward motion of the storm gradually slowed as it intensified and on 19 April, Orson attained Category 3 status on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale, classifying Orson as a severe tropical cyclone.[2] Later that day, as the storm attained Category 4 status, an eye developed. By this time, Orson began to turn towards the southwest and on 20 April,[3] the storm intensified into a Category 5 cyclone with winds of 210\u00a0km/h (130\u00a0mph) (10-minute sustained).[2] The JTWC also reported significant strengthening during the same period. They assessed Orson to have attained an intensity equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale on 22 April with winds of 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph) 1-minute sustained).[4] Around this time, the storm tracked directly over the North Rankin gas platform. The platform was in the 40\u00a0km (25\u00a0mi) wide eye of Orson for roughly 40 minutes.[5] A weather station there recorded a barometric pressure of 904\u00a0hPa (mbar; 26.69\u00a0inHg)[1] and wind gusts of 250\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph) before the station was damaged. This was, at the time, the lowest pressure ever recorded in the Australian region since records began.[5] It was later surpassed by Severe Tropical Cyclone Gwenda in 1999 when that storm attained a pressure of 900\u00a0hPa (mbar).[6] By this time, Cyclone Orson was roughly 555\u00a0km (345\u00a0mi) in diameter.[7] Continuing on a southerly track, accelerating ahead of an approaching cold front, Cyclone Orson made landfall, near Dampier, around 4:45\u00a0am AWST on 23 April (2045\u00a0UTC 22 April).[5] with winds of 220\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph) (10-minute sustained).[2] The JTWC also reported that Orson had weakened, with winds at landfall estimated at 230\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph) 1-minute sustained).[8] Tracking at 28\u00a0km/h (17\u00a0mph), the weakening storm passed over Pannawonica.[5] Less than 12\u00a0hours after landfall, the storm weakened below Category 3 status.[2] By this time, the JTWC was no longer monitoring the system.[8] Around 5:00\u00a0am AWST on 24 April (2100\u00a0UTC 23 April), Orson weakened to a tropical low while situated over southern Western Australia.[2] Continuing to accelerate to nearly 50\u00a0km/h (31\u00a0mph), the remnants of the storm moved over the Great Australian Bight late on 24 April.[3] Several hours after moving back over water, the storm dissipated.[5] The Australian Bureau of Meteorology uses 10-minute sustained winds, while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center uses one-minute sustained winds.[9] The conversion factor between the two is 1.14.[10] The Bureau of Meteorology's peak intensity for Orson was 250\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph) 10-minute sustained, or 290\u00a0km/h (180\u00a0mph) one-minute sustained.[2][10] The JTWC's peak intensity for Orson was 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph) one-minute sustained, or 220\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph) 10-minute sustained.[8][10]"

All 200 personnel from a A$1.5\u00a0billion gas platform off the coast were evacuated ahead of the storm.[12] Since Cyclone Orson made landfall in a sparsely populated region, its effects were relatively light compared to its intensity.[3] More than 20 fishermen were reported missing during the storm.[13] On 23 April, a rescue mission with three aircraft recovered roughly 20 fisherman, while one was still missing.[13] Offshore, the storm killed four Indonesian fishermen after their ships sank in swells up to 20\u00a0m (66\u00a0ft) produced by the storm.[3] The North Rankin gas platform sustained minor damage despite wind gusts reaching 270\u00a0km/h (170\u00a0mph)[14] and waves estimated at 21\u00a0m (69\u00a0ft).[15] The large swells also delayed the find of a major oil field that contained more than 200 million barrels (32,000,000\u00a0m3) of oil. The waves knocked a drill rig used to find oil out of position; it would take several days for the drill rig to be repositioned.[16] After an assessment of damage, it was found that the drill rig snapped off and broke the chains of two anchors before drifting nearly 2\u00a0km (1.2\u00a0mi) from the platform. The repositioning and cleanup of the drill rig delayed the project by nearly two weeks.[17] The damages from Cyclone Orson increased the total cost of the platform to roughly A$20\u00a0million (US$16.8\u00a0million).[18] Upon making landfall, Orson produced a storm surge of 3.1\u00a0m (10\u00a0ft).[5] This came during low tide, having a height of 1.6\u00a0m (5.2\u00a0ft).[3] Severe erosion was recorded along coastal areas, some losing nearly 20\u00a0m (66\u00a0ft) of rocks.[3][19] Wind gusts in Dampier reached 183\u00a0km/h (114\u00a0mph) and a station near where Orson made landfall recorded a wind gust of 211\u00a0km/h (131\u00a0mph).[5] Harbour officials stated that several ships were knocked off their moorings and washed up onshore.[19] In Karratha, the local weather radar sustained roughly A$900,000 (US$760,000) in damages.[12] A nearby airport was also damaged.[19] The jetty at Point Samson was severely damaged and eventually removed.[20] The most severe damage took place in the mining town of Pannawonica, where 70 homes were damaged by the storm. Numerous trees and power lines were downed along the storm's path. Before dissipating, the storm left one additional person missing after contact was lost with his yacht.[19] Later reports confirmed that the missing person drowned during the storm.[21] Twenty people were also injured during the storm, 60 were left homeless and about 1,000 were affected.[22] Total damages from the storm were estimated at A$20\u00a0million (US$16.8\u00a0million) and repair costs reached A$5\u00a0million (US$4.1\u00a0million).[3][23] Due to the severity of the storm, the name Orson was retired after the season.[24]"

        "content": "On 29\u00a0March 1989, a tropical disturbance developed near the Solomon Islands. Tracking slowly west-northwest,[1] it eventually moved over the Louisiade Archipelago off the southeast tip of Papua New Guinea by 31\u00a0March. By this time, it was classified as a tropical low by the Tropical Cyclone Warning Center in Port Moresby. The low subsequently turned south-southeast and intensified into a tropical cyclone on 1\u00a0April. Upon reaching cyclone strength, the storm was assigned the name Aivu.[2] Concurrently, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified Aivu as Tropical Cyclone 23P, also estimating winds to have reached gale-force.[1] Tropical cyclone formation within Port Moresby's area of responsibility (AOR) is relatively uncommon, though usually linked with cool La Ni\u00f1a events. However, Aivu's late-season formation within the region proved to be an unusual case with no fully understood reason.[3] Moving across the Coral Sea at 15 to 20\u00a0km/h (9.3 to 12.4\u00a0mph) the storm soon crossed 12\u00b0S and entered the Bureau of Meteorology's (BOM) AOR.[2] Rapid intensification ensued on 2\u20133\u00a0April, with Aivu becoming a severe tropical cyclone\u00a0\u2014 the Australian-equivalent of a hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale.[2] Though obscured by high-level clouds, an eye likely developed during the overnight of 2\u00a0April before becoming well-defined the following day.[4] Early on 3\u00a0April, the cyclone attained its peak strength with winds of 205\u00a0km/h (125\u00a0mph) and a barometric pressure of 935\u00a0mbar (hPa; 27.61\u00a0inHg).[2] This ranked it as a Category\u00a05 severe tropical cyclone\u2014the highest classification on the Australian intensity scale.[5] The estimate stemmed from the Dvorak technique\u00a0\u2014 a method of analysing a tropical cyclone's intensity using satellite imagery\u00a0\u2014 as values reached T#6.5.[4] Around this time, the JTWC estimated Aivu to have become a Category 4-equivalent cyclone, with one-minute sustained winds of 220\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph).[1] A temporary slowing of forward motion occurred during the intensification phase but was followed by even faster motion than before, with the storm approaching Queensland, Australia at 30\u00a0km/h (19\u00a0mph).[2] Some weakening took place as it neared the coast. The cyclone's small eye expanded from 22\u00a0km (14\u00a0mi) to 34\u00a0km (21\u00a0mi) as it neared the coast.[6] Aivu ultimately made landfall between Home Hill and Inkerman at 0300\u00a0UTC (1:00\u00a0p.m. AEST) with a pressure of 957\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.26\u00a0inHg).[2] Shortly thereafter, the storm passed over Ayr where a sea level-corrected pressure of 962\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.41\u00a0inHg) was measured.[6] The JTWC estimated one-minute sustained winds to have been 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph) at this time.[1] In Fredricksfield, a pressure of 959\u00a0mb (hPa; 28.32\u00a0inHg) was measured in the cyclone's eye about 10\u00a0km (6.2\u00a0mi) from the center of circulation.[6] Rapid weakening ensued as Aivu moved inland; the JTWC estimated winds to have dropped to 100\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph) within six hours of landfall.[1] The storm passed directly over Charters Towers as it turned to the southwest. Degrading to a rain depression,[2] Aivu continued inland and was last noted by the BOM on 5\u00a0April well to the northwest of Longreach.[6]"

Regular advisories in the subsequent 48\u00a0hours highlighted the likely impacts of the storm and in the hours leading up to Aivu's landfall, residents were advised to seek shelter.[8] Less than three hours after the watch, a cyclone warning was raised for areas between Cooktown and the Whitsunday Islands. At 1800\u00a0UTC on 3\u00a0April (4:00\u00a0a.m. AEST 4\u00a0April), the BOM warned that Aivu, \"[posed] a major threat.\" Forecasters expected a destructive storm surge to affect areas between Ayr and Shute Harbour and notified residents that these areas would likely be inundated during the storm. This was followed by a statement advising residents between Townsville and Mackay to, \"complete preparations quickly and be prepared to seek shelter in a safe place.\"[7] The Bureau was later praised for the quality of warnings issued to the public.[8] On 3\u00a0April, a leading supermarket in Ayr reported a major increase in daily sales from A$16,000 to A$60,000, indicating that residents were taking appropriate actions to prepare for Aivu.[8] The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) relocated a squadron of fighter jets inland away from the storm.[9]"

No reliable measurements were available for the area and the highest recorded wind, 118\u00a0km/h (73\u00a0mph), was well-offshore at Holmes Reef the day before landfall.[6] In addition to destructive winds, the storm produced a large storm surge along Upstart Bay, estimated between 2.5 and 3\u00a0m (8.2 and 9.8\u00a0ft), that caused severe coastal damage. The highest observed surge was 1.2\u00a0m (3.9\u00a0ft) in Bowen roughly 100\u00a0km (62\u00a0mi) southeast of the landfall location.[11] The cyclone dropped torrential rains across portions of Queensland, namely south of the storm's center. These areas experienced moist, convergent flow with gale-force winds in advance of the cyclone's landfall prolonging the rain-event. While many areas received more than 200\u00a0mm (7.9\u00a0in), orographic lift along the Clarke Range about 30\u00a0km (19\u00a0mi) inland greatly enhanced rainfall totals. Exceptionally heavy rains fell west of Mackay with a maximum of 1,082\u00a0mm (42.6\u00a0in) recorded in Dalrymple Heights (located 200\u00a0km (120\u00a0mi) south of Aivu's track). The rains in Dalrymple Heights had an average return interval (ARI) of roughly 100\u00a0years, though 24-hour accumulations were well in excess of this. Ayr, where Aivu's eye made landfall, experienced a peak hourly rainfall of 71\u00a0mm (2.8\u00a0in), though this was considered normal for fast moving, intense cyclones. A 24-hour rainfall, with an ARI of 100\u00a0years, of 215\u00a0mm (8.5\u00a0in) was measured in Longreach.[12] Across west-central Queensland, the remnants of Aivu dropped torrential rains along a narrow strip spanning only a few kilometres across. More than 500\u00a0mm (20\u00a0in) in Whitehill while areas nearby only received 50\u00a0mm (2.0\u00a0in). In 24\u00a0hours, the station recorded more than two years' worth of rain and multiple gauges had to be used due to overflow.[13] Many areas experienced record-high rainfall totals for the month of April due to Aivu.[12] The heavy rains caused moderate to severe flooding along several rivers in the state. The most significant flooding took place along the Pioneer River, which crested at 12.2\u00a0m (40\u00a0ft) at Mirani. This was the third-highest value in 30\u00a0years. In Mackay, the swollen river rose to 7.8\u00a0m (26\u00a0ft). The Proserpine River also reached major flood levels while moderate flooding occurred on the Don and Burdekin rivers. Water levels reached 10\u00a0m (33\u00a0ft) at Inkerman Bridge along the Burdekin River. Heavy rains across the Fitzroy River basin flowed into the Connors and Issac Rivers and the Funnel Creek catchments. Funnel Creek crested at 6\u00a0m (20\u00a0ft) in Rockhampton on 15\u00a0April. The remnants of Aivu triggered additional flooding along the Barcoo, Bulloo, Paroo, and Thomson rivers.[14] Severe damage to power lines left many areas without electricity, most notably Burdekin where repairs were expected to take up to two weeks.[15] Six sugar mills in the path of the storm were severely damaged or destroyed by Aivu. Roughly 20\u00a0percent of the national sugar crop was lost in the storm. Alongside flooding in the days preceding the cyclone, nearly 80\u00a0percent of cotton and virtually all vegetable crops in Queensland and New South Wales were damaged or destroyed.[16] Roughly 30\u00a0percent of the 300,000\u00a0mango trees affected by the storm were damaged, with many stripped bare of their fruit-bearing branches. The worst effects were felt in Burdekin where trees were uprooted and/or defoliated.[17] For the second time in just over a year, the Endeavour Foundation in Home Hill lost nearly its entire crop to a cyclone. Only 130,000 of the 750,000 planted capsicum and eggplant seeds were recovered, with losses reaching A$300,000.[18] Throughout Queensland, damage from Aivu amounted to A$200\u00a0million (1997\u00a0AUD; US$156\u00a0million).[19] Of this total, at least A$25\u201326\u00a0million of the damage was insured (normalised value of A$138\u00a0million[20]) while A$12\u201315\u00a0million was uninsured or underinsured.[21] One person was killed and thirteen others were injured.[19]"

Though southern areas of the state began to dry out as Aivu moved inland, the cyclone exacerbated conditions in northern areas, with rainfall reaching 400\u00a0mm (16\u00a0in) in some areas. Caravan parks along the Queanbeyan and Murrumbidgee rivers had to be evacuated. The Murrumbidgee River in particular was expected to crest at near-record heights, prompting additional evacuations at farms.[22] More than 700\u00a0mm (28\u00a0in) of rain fell in Eungella along the Queensland border, triggering massive landslides that cut off all roads to the town. The main road to Eungella was severely impacted and expected to be blocked for several weeks. Several vehicles, including a train and bus, were also stranded in the area. Multiple bridge wash outs further isolated areas.[15] Floodwaters also cut off the small town of Coraki from surrounding areas.[23] Throughout the state, flooding was responsible for two fatalities.[20]"

        "content": "Immediately following Aivu's landfall, a state of emergency was declared for parts of Queensland.[9] The severity of damage in the Shire of Burdekin prompted a local and federal emergency declaration for the area. In response, 140\u00a0personnel from Delta Company of the Australian Army were dispatched as Defense Aid to the Civil Community by the afternoon of 4\u00a0April.[15][24] They set up an emergency headquarters at the Ayr racecouse and assisted with cleanup operations in Ayr itself and Home Hill. Delta Company's operation was complete by 7\u00a0April,[24] with 98\u00a0percent of damaged homes having tarpaulins placed on their roof. A handful of engineers and liaison officers from the company stayed behind for additional inspections.[15] On 7\u00a0April, a Cessna aircraft carrying five people crashed in the remote Cravens Peak cattle station near the Queensland\u2013Northern Territory border. Though not caused by the cyclone, a woman on the plane was flying due to a lack of hospital access resulting from floods caused by Aivu.[25] Meanwhile, in Eungella, New South Wales, food, water, and medical supplies had to be airlifted by a RAAF Bell UH-1 Iroquois helicopter because it was inaccessible by ground.[15] On 11\u00a0April, an appeal for aid was made for farmers in the Burdekin and Gympie regions; only authorities and associated organisations were allowed to contribute. The Department of Primary Industries monitored all crops affected by the storm for signs of a Sclerotinia outbreak and preemptively sprayed them to prevent the disease. Across the state, 3,500\u00a0insurance claims were made by 12\u00a0April, with this total expected to reach 9,000.[26] Clean up and restoration efforts cost approximately A$10\u00a0million (US$8.4\u00a0million) throughout Queensland.[21] Following an assessment of the BOM's warning performance during Cyclone Aivu, in which they received praise from most, a new scale for tropical cyclone intensities was to be implemented starting with the 1989\u201390 cyclone season. This five-level scale was designed to better inform the public of the degree of danger storms posed.[27]"

The second tropical cyclone of the 2004 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, it formed as a depression on May\u00a016 in the central Bay of Bengal. With low wind shear and a surge in the monsoon trough, the storm intensified while meandering over open waters. The storm eventually began a steady northeastward motion due to a ridge to the north over India. While approaching land, an eye developed in the center of the storm, indicative of a strong cyclone. On May\u00a019, the cyclone made landfall along northwestern Myanmar near Sittwe, with maximum sustained winds estimated at 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph) by the India Meteorological Department. The storm rapidly weakened over land, although its remnants spread rainfall into northern Thailand and Yunnan province in China. Winds from the cyclone reached 157\u00a0km/h (98\u00a0mph) in Myanmar, occurring in conjunction with heavy rainfall and a high storm surge. Despite the storm's ferocity, the government did not report about the cyclone for ten days, as they usually under-report on landfalling storms. The cyclone caused heavy damage throughout Rakhine State, destroying or heavily damaging 4,035\u00a0homes and leaving 25,000\u00a0people homeless. There was widespread crop damage, resulting in food shortages, and damaged roads disrupted subsequent relief efforts. Damage in Myanmar totaled over K621\u00a0million kyat ($99.2\u00a0million USD), making it the worst storm in the country since 1968, and there were 236\u00a0deaths, with an unofficial death toll as high as 1,000. Although damage was heaviest in Myanmar, the cyclone's effects also spread into neighboring Bangladesh, where strong winds knocked over trees and capsized two ships."

As the shear decreased, the thunderstorms increased and organized, with the eastward-moving circulation partially exposed.[1] At 09:00\u00a0UTC on May\u00a016, the India Meteorological Department [nb 1] classified the system as a depression, and nine hours later the agency upgraded it to a deep depression as the system turned northwestward.[3] The nascent system quickly organized, aided by the decreasing wind shear,[1] as well as a surge in the monsoon.[2] The IMD upgraded the depression to a cyclonic storm at 03:00\u00a0UTC on May\u00a017.[3] At 12:00\u00a0UTC that day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)[nb 2] began issuing warnings on the system with its own designation Tropical Cyclone 02B. With weak steering currents, the storm meandered over the central Bay of Bengal, executing a small cyclonic loop over 30\u00a0hours.[6] The cloud pattern organized into a central dense overcast that was initially irregular in nature. However, the storm quickly intensified on May\u00a018, strengthening into a severe cyclonic storm and later very severe cyclonic storm. During this time, the cyclone turned eastward under the influence of a ridge over India to the north.[3] A buoy near the storm's center recorded a pressure of 994\u00a0mbar (29.4\u00a0inHg) on May\u00a018, the lowest recorded pressure in association with the storm. Convection increased around the center and organized into a distinct eye.[3] The JTWC upgraded the cyclone to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane at 00:00\u00a0UTC on May\u00a019, estimating peak 1\u00a0minute sustained winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph).[6] The IMD assessed a much higher intensity, estimating peak 3\u00a0minute winds of 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph) at 03:00\u00a0UTC that day.[3] About an hour later, the cyclone made landfall at peak intensity with an estimated pressure of 952\u00a0mbar (28.1\u00a0inHg) in northwestern Myanmar near Sittwe, near the country's border with Bangladesh.[1][3][6] It weakened gradually over land,[3] dissipating over Myanmar late on May\u00a019.[6]"

The winds also knocked down trees and power lines. Two boats sank off Cox's Bazar, leaving five fishermen missing. Later, the remnants of the cyclone dropped heavy rainfall in northern Thailand, reaching 112.4\u00a0mm (4.43\u00a0in) in 24\u00a0hours at the Bhumibol Dam.

Four hospitals in the region were heavily damaged, including the one in Sittwe that was unable to continue normal operations.[10] About 300\u00a0schools were damaged or destroyed,[7] including 44 in Sittwe.[10] The storm also damaged or destroyed 133\u00a0religious buildings and 176\u00a0government buildings.[16] Across the region, high winds knocked down telephone lines and disrupted power supply.[10] About 2,000\u00a0cattle were killed, and many rice mills were knocked down, causing a 70% increase of food prices.[13] Transportation was disrupted after roads were washed away,[7] which contributed to food shortages, while damaged wells caused water shortages.[17] During the storm, 84\u00a0ships were lost at sea, in addition to a lost ocean liner, while the main harbor at Sittwe was damaged,[13] along with several fishing piers.[14] The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs considered the cyclone as the worst to hit Myanmar since 1968.[10] Damage totaled over K621\u00a0million kyat ($99.2\u00a0million USD).[16][nb 3] Officially, there were 236\u00a0deaths in the country,[16] although there were unconfirmed reports of a death toll as high as 1,000.[19] In the city of Myebon alone, there were 139\u00a0deaths.[10] Most of the deaths were fishermen from Rakhine State caught at sea.[13]"

In early June, the government issued an updated appeal to request $337,000 (USD) to help 25,000\u00a0people, after the scope of the disaster became better known.[16] The Red Cross operation responding to the cyclone ended in December 2004, which marked the first time the agency had a major response to a disaster. It worked in conjunction with the World Food Programme, Bridge Asia Japan, and the Myanmar Maternal and Child Welfare Association, utilizing some private donations. Red Cross volunteers helped clear roads and clean ponds to return areas to normalcy.[12] Typically, the government handles relief measures.[16] In the days following the storm, Myanmar's Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement assessed damage in the affected areas to determine needs, and also coordinated relief efforts.[10] The local Red Cross chapter went to the worst affected villages with water, water purification tablets,[13] blankets, and mosquito nets.[7] Many of the affected families were unable to afford rebuilding their homes.[13] Myanmar's National Disaster Relief Committee distributed 500\u00a0tons of concrete and 50,000\u00a0roofing sheets to help rebuild homes. By June\u00a08, all displaced residents were either staying with relatives or returned to their homes, with the reconstruction or resettlement process expected to take up to nine months.[16] Myanmar's then-Prime Minister Khin Nyunt surveyed the damaged areas and held a ceremony on June\u00a07 in Sittwe, where domestic donations were transferred to the government in \"the spirit of national consolidation\".[20] The Prime Minister stated that the country rarely experiences devastating cyclones due to their strong religious beliefs.[21] A group of 35\u00a0Rohingya people from Yangon took a tour of Rakhine State after the storm, despite they are usually banned from the region. The group donated about $267,000 (USD), although due to their minority status in the country, the aid did not help other Rohingyas in the state, who also did not receive assistance from the government.[9] In response to the aid request, various United Nations agencies sent $175,000 (USD) worth of financial or material assistance to the country. The World Food Programme provided 50\u00a0kg (110\u00a0lb) of rice to 3,700\u00a0families for three months, and UNICEF provided medicines, corrugated sheeting, and latrine slabs.[10] The government of Japan donated about \u00a510\u00a0million worth of supplies, including blankets and water.[17] The Chinese Red Cross donated about $20,000 (USD) worth of relief.[9] Eight other governments and Red Cross chapters donated CHF331,432 francs worth of aid or supplies.[22]"

The fourth named storm of the 2023 Pacific typhoon season, Talim originated from a weak monsoon depression east of Manila while moving towards Luzon. The system continued to track westward close to the northern edge of mainland Luzon before emerging off the coast of Ilocos Norte. A favorable environment allowed the fledgling tropical storm to rapidly intensify to a high-end Category 1-equivalent typhoon on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale. The storm maintained this intensity until shortly before landfall near Zhanjiang, Guangdong on July 17. Talim quickly weakened and dissipated early on July 18. Talim brought heavy monsoonal rains over the Philippines and brought heavy rainfall and gusty conditions over the country as it neared Luzon. Rainfall from the storm helped raise the water level significantly in Angat Dam, the main water source for areas in Metro Manila but only slightly in more northern Magat Dam in Isabela. In China, authorities in Guangdong Province ordered the evacuation of at least 1,000 residents in Yunfu. In Vietnam, authorities announced on July 17, that the countries were preparing to evacuate approximately 30,000 individuals from high-risk locations in Quang Ninh, Th\u00e1i B\u00ecnh, and Haiphong. Overall, the storm was responsible for three deaths, nine injuries and US$364 million in damage across several countries."

Now back in warm seas and moving further westward away from land, the system found itself in a favorable environment and began consolidating further.[8] The system intensified into a tropical storm just prior to exiting the PAR and was subsequently named Talim by the JMA.[9][10][11] Talim left the Philippine Area of Responsibility while it maintained its strength which was announced by the PAGASA in its final bulletin on July 15.[12] The storm had a broad LLCC with deep convection persisting along the western and southern periphery.[13] Talim continued to intensify in the South China Sea, later being upgraded into a severe tropical storm.[14] Talim moved west-northwestward within a favorable environment was being offset by equatorward outflow.[15] Talim continued to improved its convective banding with satellite imagery revealed a 30 nautical miles (56\u00a0km; 35\u00a0mi) ragged eye.[16] The JTWC's assessed the storm to have strengthened into 155\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph), equivalent to Category 2-equivalent typhoon status [17] Talim's started to rapidly deteriorate as it approached land.[18]  Talim made its second landfall in Zhanjiang, Guangdong, with winds of 136\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph) on July 17.[19] As it moved further inland, Talim rapidly weakened. Shortly after the landfall, the JTWC discontinued warnings on the system.[20] The JMA issued its last advisory on Talim and later declared it dissipated early on the next day.[21]"

More than 3,000 vehicles were still stranded on the motorway by the morning of 26 January.[5] The Snake and Woodhead passes had been closed by dusk on 25 January in conditions described by South Yorkshire and Derbyshire police as 'atrocious'. Ice also became a dangerous hazard as temperatures plummeted below freezing. At Pendle, Lancashire, 22 children and three adults who had been at a ski school were brought to safety by a fell rescue team.[5] Public transport was also widely disrupted over the period and roads were chaotic, with five-hour journeys commonplace for commuters accustomed to a 30-minute drive. In the city centres of Barnsley, Bradford, Halifax, Huddersfield, Leeds and Sheffield endured protracted gridlocks as the blizzard arrived during rush hour. In Leeds, grit had been focused on the roads of the higher ground rather than in the city centre, leaving many motorists angry. In Sheffield, traffic was still trailing out of the city centre at 11pm.[5][4]"

Perhaps it is fairer to say: it was misery, misery that our society did not neutralize, that caused the majority of deaths. Even in death it is sad to be miserable. Especially when you die for being miserable.\" \u2013 Com\u00e9rcio do Funchal, n\u00ba 1963, 1967.[6] Newspapers closer to the regime would frame the catastrophe as unpredictable and would focus on the wave of grief and solidarity that followed.[6] Others, namely the Portuguese Communist Party (then an illegal party) and student publications, would focus on social factors as the main cause.[6] For example, the Solidariedade Estudantil bulletin would point out that the peak of the rain had occurred in Estoril, while most deaths would occur in the Lisbon slums.[6] Gon\u00e7alo Ribeiro Telles, soon after the floods, appeared on national TV (RTP) establishing a direct link between the lack of spatial planning and the dimension of the tragedy.[10] Since 1967, there were only two other years with comparable events of intense precipitation: 1983 and 2008, but none led to as many deaths or evacuated people as the 1967 floods.[2] While some of the most affected areas were not repopulated after 1969, such as the Santa Cruz da Urmeira neighborhood in Odivelas (20 killed, 30 injured, 100 homeless), other areas were repopulated and have since expanded closer to the river banks.[3] New neighborhoods, such as the Bairro do Vale do Forno, have since been constructed near the river banks.[3] In effect, many areas, at least in the Odivelas area, still had high risk for flash floods as of 2005, but the local population does not consider their personal risk to be high (58%) and do not have insurance that would protect them in case of a flood (82%).[3]"

The floods were mainly caused by the seasonal monsoon, though enhanced by numerous tropical cyclones. On 7 October, during a seasonal monsoon and tropical depressions over the Kh\u00e1nh H\u00f2a province, several multitude of tropical cyclones during the 2020 Pacific typhoon season, such as Linfa, Nangka, Ofel, Saudel, and Molave, struck the northern and central regions of Vietnam, especially in areas of Laos and Cambodia, bringing high winds and excessive rainfall in these affected provinces, with accumulations peaked at 3,245\u00a0mm (127.8\u00a0in) in H\u01b0\u1edbng Linh, H\u01b0\u1edbng H\u00f3a District, Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb around 20 October. This subsequent flooding was the first time Vietnam issued IV category disaster alert for heavy rainfall, as III category is the highest alert level.[10] On 5 November, the weakening Typhoon Goni entered the South China Sea and made landfall in Central Vietnam two days later as a tropical depression. Etau made landfall in Central Vietnam as a tropical storm three days later. On 12 November, Typhoon Vamco approached Vietnam as it gradually strengthened into Category 4-equivalent status after exiting the Philippine Area of Responsibility. As of 1 December, over 243 people were reported by Vietnam Disaster Management Authority (VNDMA) as dead or missing due to the floods.[11] The floods resulted in almost \u011135.2 trillion (US$1.52 billion) of damages."

The federal government mobilized about 250,000 troops and 2,300 vehicles to be used for search and rescue missions.[33] Members of the Vietnamese military helped load elderly people onto evacuation buses and helped direct boats onshore. Some also helped residents put sandbags on their roof.[34] On 27 October, Da Nang People's Committee had requested people to not leave their houses starting from 8:00\u00a0pm (local time) that night and urged all officials and workers to not come into work on the next day, among other measures in preparation for the typhoon.[35] On 27 October, the typhoon caused two Vietnamese fishing boats to sink.[36] Authorities deployed search boats to search for 26 missing fishermen that were on the boats.[37] Molave started affecting Vietnam late on 27 October. On the morning of the 28th, the entire island of L\u00fd S\u01a1n and its 20,000 inhabitants lost power. The island was lashed with 165\u00a0km/h (103\u00a0mph) winds for hours.[38][39] Waves as high as 6 feet (1.8\u00a0m) lashed coastal areas of Vietnam.[37] Molave caused widespread destruction in Central Vietnam. Wind gusts peaking at 176\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph) were reported in the city of Qu\u1ea3ng Ng\u00e3i.[39] Molave brought heavy rains; S\u01a1n K\u1ef3 (Qu\u1ea3ng Ng\u00e3i) received 18.50 inches (470\u00a0mm) of rainfall over 24 hours.[39] The typhoon damaged or destroyed 56,163 houses and left 6.5\u00a0million people without power.[40] It killed 13 people, injured 16, and left 48 others remaining missing.[39][41][42][43][44][45] As of 1 November, Vietnam reported that approximately 10 trillion VND ($430 million) worth of damages were caused by Molave.[46]"

Goni's convection decoupled from its low-level circulation as a result of anticyclonic wind shear generated by the nearby Tropical Storm Atsani (Siony) from Northern Luzon combined with cooler water. Goni's trough then brought showers, thunderstorms, and more flooding to an already rain-stricken Vietnam from the previous Linfa, Nangka, Ofel, Saudel and Molave which had all struck a few days earlier. Goni brought unusual floods to coastal cities of Nha Trang and Quy Nh\u01a1n. According to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting, the storm would hit Da Nang and Phu Yen provinces on 5 November. On 3 November, just two days before the expected landfall, the only preparations done were to institute a no-sail policy within the storm's path which affected about 50,000 fishing boats.[48] The following day, Quang Ngai People's Committee Chairman Dang Van Minh asked those living in landslide-prone areas to evacuate, while the National Committee for Disaster Prevention and Search and Rescue mobilized more than 64,500 people and 1,718 vehicles for rescue operations.[49] On 5\u00a0November, Tropical Depression Goni made landfall in southern B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh Province, becoming the fifth tropical cyclone to strike the country in the previous 30 days.[50] A man in Qu\u1ea3ng Ng\u00e3i Province was swept away by floodwaters on 6\u00a0November. Another man went missing on 6\u00a0November after the ship he was captaining sunk. Twenty houses in Qu\u1ea3ng Nam Province collapsed into a river and a school was damaged. In B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh Province, two houses were destroyed by landslides and 228 hectares (560 acres) of croplands were damaged. Roads in several provinces were damaged by erosion and landslides, including parts of the Ho Chi Minh Highway.[51] Damage in B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh Province from both Goni and Etau were calculated to be \u20ab543\u00a0billion (US$23.5\u00a0million).[52]"

        "content": " The Great Lakes Blizzard of January 1971 affected almost the entire Great Lakes region of North America, as well as the western St. Lawrence Valley and northern New England between January 25 and 28, 1971 before a second severe snowstorm hit many of the same areas between January 28 and 31, 1971.  The areas that felt the fiercest effects of the dual storms, that being moderate or heavy snow, sustained high winds, and zero visibility due to blowing snow, included southern Wisconsin, most of Michigan, Southern Ontario, northeastern Ohio, northwestern Pennsylvania, most of upstate New York and Southern Quebec, while northern Wisconsin, northern Indiana, northeastern Ontario, and northern Vermont experienced blizzard conditions from the first of the storms. The only part of the Great Lakes not impacted was the northern area of Lake Superior. Weather related to the first storm system also inflicted gale-force winds on areas just south of the Great Lakes, on the Central Appalachian Mountains and on much of the Eastern Seaboard of the United States, particularly, from North Carolina to Maryland, and on Maine. Several major metropolitan areas were hit by the dual blizzards, although most did not have major snowfalls; London, Ontario with 68.6 centimetres (27.0\u00a0in), Quebec City with 54.1 centimetres (21.3\u00a0in), and Rochester, New York with 16.9 inches (43\u00a0cm) were the cities with the most snowfall, with areas around London (the Lake Huron Region of Southwestern Ontario) and Rochester (west-central New York) being subjected to all or part of six consecutive days of blizzard conditions and/or snowfall. The single highest snowfall was in Paisley, Ontario, which over seven days was lashed with 127.6 centimetres (50.2\u00a0in) of snow. The storms left at least 34 people dead in the United States and 14 people dead in Canada with numerous persons injured from traffic accidents or other mishaps, such as train derailments or falling glass.  Schools, businesses, major highways and secondary roads were closed or blocked for at least a day throughout most of the affected states/provinces and in the most heavily affected portions of those jurisdictions (often areas impacted by both storms), these items were closed or blocked for up to a week, intra- and inter-city bus service was halted, flights were cancelled, train travel was delayed, large power outages occurred, thousands of vehicles had to be abandoned, and tens of thousands of people, including thousands of students, were stranded for between one and three nights."

While damage occurred due to high winds and private and public road transportation was severely affected in major urban centres such as Detroit, Cleveland, Chicago, Pittsburgh, Toronto and Buffalo, it was London with 68.6 centimetres (27.0\u00a0in), Quebec City with 54.1 centimetres (21.3\u00a0in), Rochester with 16.9 inches (43\u00a0cm), Syracuse, New York with 13.1 inches (33\u00a0cm), Ottawa with 29 centimetres (11\u00a0in), and Montreal with 26.5 centimetres (10.4\u00a0in) which had the most snow from five or six days of storm conditions. Smaller centres with the greatest snowfalls included: Paisley, Ontario with 127.6 centimetres (50.2\u00a0in) over a week, Oswego, New York with 22.1 inches (56\u00a0cm), Watertown, New York, with 18.8 inches (48\u00a0cm), and Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan with 17.5 inches (44\u00a0cm). Some of the most severe impacts of the dual blizzards were on the London/Lake Huron Region of Southern Ontario, and most of Western and Central New York; in these areas blizzard conditions of less than a quarter-mile (400 m) visibility lasted for 32 and 29 non-stop hours, respectively, on January 26 and 27 resulting in the blockage and later closure of Highway 401 between London and various sections to its east at various times over two days and the complete closure of the entire New York State Thruway west of Utica for almost two days. Both freeways were formally closed again during the second blizzard on January 29. During both closures hundreds of people needed to find sudden overnight accommodation, such as at highway service centres, government buildings and hotels. Thirteen counties in New York banned all vehicular travel on roads and highways during the first blizzard, while numerous highways in Ontario's Lake Huron Region were formally closed or totally blocked by snow for two to three days. Over 20,000 students in Ontario were not able to be transported home from school on January 26 and had to spend between one and three nights at their schools or billeted at homes in the communities; some schools boards kept some or all of their schools closed for four to six days because many rural roads were not fully cleared due to ongoing drifting of snow. Significant numbers of students and workers in the Rochester-area were also stranded overnight. Many parts of Michigan also experienced completely blocked or closed roads and closed schools, as did much of Southern Quebec. In Montreal, blizzard conditions lasted 16 consecutive hours and the port was closed for January 27. Northeastern Ohio had thousands of people stranded due to the second blizzard and Interstate 90 in the adjacent area of Pennsylvania was closed for a time period. The second blizzard hit Wisconsin very hard resulting in five counties closing all their roads during that storm. All of the above areas pulled snow plows from their roads for extended periods due to absolute zero visibility conditions making collisions with marooned vehicles probable."

By January 28, there were reports of more than 50 injuries from the Midwest to New England from the first storm, which would include numerous injuries due to high winds in cities like Chicago, Cleveland and Cincinnati, some south of the blizzard zone.[10][23] The second storm caused at least 19 fatalities in the US, six each in New York and Michigan, five in Wisconsin, and two in Pennsylvania.  Eleven of the deaths were by traffic accidents, four were heart attacks from shovelling snow, two pedestrians were hit by vehicles, one person died from exposure, and one person drowned. In Ontario, six persons died from the first blizzard: two people were hit by cars, one died in a traffic accident, a fourth died from a heart attack when trying to dig his truck out of a snowdrift, and two died from exposure.

Marie and the 13 counties of the northwest Lower Peninsula the hardest, dropping between 6 and 12 inches (15 and 30\u00a0cm) of blinding snow, leading authorities to close all highways and roads to all vehicles, including snow plows.[36][9][37] All airports in the area, except one, closed for the day.[37] Sault Ste. Marie received 8 more inches (20\u00a0cm) of snow on January 28\u201329 for a total of 17.5 inches (44\u00a0cm) for a five-day period.[38] Cheboygan, at the northern tip of the Lower Peninsula, had such high winds coming off Lake Huron that there were 15-foot (4.6\u00a0m) snow drifts; everything\u2014factories, schools, stores, offices\u2014were closed for January 26 and all 6,000 residents stayed home for the day.[36][33][37] On the eastern shore of Lake Michigan, 20,000 residents of Benton Harbor were without electricity, as the winds wreaked havoc on the power lines, while inland, the roofing on a building under construction  at the Grand Rapids airport was torn off.[31][25] In some southwestern counties of Michigan, schools were closed from January 26 through the end of January 28 as snowfall and drifting snow continued into January 28, with total accumulations of snow over the three days approaching 15 inches (38\u00a0cm).[32] A four-wheel drive military ambulance was used in Cass County to deliver medicine, food and fuel, to pick up marooned motorists, and to push cars from the roadway to permit plowing, while in adjacent counties snowmobiles were used for food deliveries.[35]"

most were billeted with residents, with some being transferred from high schools to billets during the day January 27.[83][85][98] In the Town of Clinton, population of about 3,000, 600 secondary school students were billeted in volunteer's homes.[85] For pupils staying overnight at elementary schools in small settlements or on isolated rural roads, food was a substantial concern; in a separate school north of Lucan, the food supply was dangerously low for the 270 students by January 27, as the stores in the village ran out of milk and bread and almost all food\u2014but snowmobile caravans delivered food from various sources to that school and many others, in addition to some farmers delivering eggs by tractor.[98][62][84] The next day, the CAF, with heavy-duty trucks and a tracked armoured-personnel carrier, were able to forge through the drifts to replenish Lucan with supplies.[80] At a school in the village of Brucefield, where 600 students and 24 teachers were marooned for 55 hours, soup, crackers and 20 cases of pop brought by snowmobile from two local stores, plus 160 loaves of bread from two bread trucks that were stranded in the village, became first few meals for the throng.[93][85][51] Schools used drapes from windows or stages as blankets and gym mats, hall runners and carpeted floors as mattresses.[102][50][99][93] Large numbers of blankets, loaned from hotels or hospitals or villagers, medical supplies or even doctors were delivered by snowmobile caravans or by CAF tracked-vehicles or helicopters.[83][62][93] By early January 28, the greatest obstacle to getting pupils home became snow-blocked roads,[62] and achieving that goal often required detailed coordination, including students being delivered by buses as far as the roads were clear, such as to a specific store, and then being transported by snowmobiles to their actual homes on severely drifted concession roads.[50][51] One school bus travelling to pick up students on January 28 crashed into an obscured car abandoned in the middle of the road.[51][50] In some cases, CAF tracked-vehicles transported children to their homes.[62][96] The morning of Friday, January 29, about 5,000 students in the Lake Huron Region were still stuck at their schools, but aside from a few isolated cases, all were transported to their homes before that night for the weekend despite the fact the second blizzard struck that day.[75][17] In rural parts of Perth, Huron, Bruce and Grey countries, schools remained closed until Tuesday, February 2 or Wednesday, February 3 due to impassable secondary roads blocking access to the schools and precluding school buses operating, while in the rural portions of Middlesex (outside of London) most reopened on Monday, February 1.[62][98][73][72] In the towns and cities of those counties, schools were open by January 28 or 29 to in-town students who could walk to them.[79] In the Kitchener and Brantford areas on the eastern edge of Southwestern Ontario, Waterloo County schools were closed until Monday, January 31 due to higher winds in Kitchener causing drifting snow on January 26, 28 and 29, whereas Brant County schools reopened January 28, despite the fact the area had substantially more snow on January 26\u201327.[67][71][106][107]"

The second named storm, the first typhoon and the first super typhoon of the 2023 Pacific typhoon season, Mawar originated from an area of low pressure south-southwest of Chuuk Lagoon that developed into a tropical depression on May\u00a019. It fluctuated in intensity and became a tropical storm, after which it intensified into a Category\u00a04-equivalent super typhoon on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale. It then underwent an eyewall replacement cycle, then reintensified to attain 1-minute sustained winds of 305\u00a0km/h (190\u00a0mph)  according to the JTWC, becoming a Category\u00a05-equivalent super typhoon. Mawar weakened slightly as it moved around the southwestern edge of the subtropical high that made it steer north of the Philippines and then east of Taiwan. Mawar traversed the Okinawa Islands as a tropical storm, then transitioned into an extratropical cyclone as it moved northeastward out to sea, where it later dissipated east of Kamchatka Peninsula. Typhoon Mawar passed north of Guam as a Category\u00a04-equivalent typhoon on May\u00a024, bringing hurricane-force winds and heavy rain marking as the strongest storm to affect the island since Typhoon Pongsona in 2002.[2][3] U.S. President Joe Biden declared Guam a major disaster area on May 27, enabling the distribution of federal funds. Two men are presumed dead after going missing in the waters off Guam; additionally, one death related to the storm has been reported in Taiwan. Mawar caused one death, one minor injury, and damage worth \u20b1201,696 (US$3,584) as it passed close to the eastern Philippines.[4] Heavy rain in parts of Japan killed two people and left four people missing.[5] At least 8,900 homes experienced power outages in Japan.

Global forecast models such as the Global Forecast System and Navy Global Environmental Model indicated that the disturbance would gradually intensify into a tropical cyclone in the upcoming days.[7] The atmospheric convection broadened over the LLC the following day.[8] Later the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the disturbance after thunderstorms became very wide and organization had improved.[9] The Japan Meteorological Agency also began tracking the system, marking it as a low-pressure area[10] shortly before upgrading it to a tropical depression on May\u00a019.[11] The system steered northward due to the weak trade winds.[12] The JTWC followed suit on May\u00a020 after the depression had strengthened from warm sea surface temperatures and poleward and westward outflow, designating it 02W.[13] The same day, the depression upgraded to a tropical storm after a scatterometer pass revealed winds of 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph) in the southwest quadrant, as it formed a central dense overcast.[14] The JMA in response, assigned the name Mawar to the storm.[15] The JMA further upgraded the storm to severe tropical storm status at 00:00 UTC of May\u00a021,[16] as the deep convection in the CDO completely obscured the LLCC.[17] Both the JMA and JTWC upgraded Mawar to a typhoon on May\u00a021.[18][19] An eye formed under the CDO on May\u00a022,[20] as rainbands wrapped around the circulation center of the system.[21] On May\u00a023, Mawar rapidly intensified to winds of 215\u00a0km/h (130\u00a0mph), equivalent to Category\u00a04 strength on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS). Furthermore, Mawar underwent an eyewall replacement cycle.[22] But despite usually causing the storm to weaken, the typhoon strengthened even further into a super typhoon, the highest classification of strength from the JTWC, after reaching winds of 250\u00a0km/h (155\u00a0mph).[23] On May\u00a024, the center of Mawar passed just off the northern tip of Guam and Andersen Air Force Base as a Category\u00a04-equivalent typhoon with maximum sustained winds up to 140 mph with gusts up to 165 mph around 9\u00a0p.m. local time, then slightly weakened.[24][25][26] On May 25, the aforementioned eyewall replacement cycle had been completed, and a uniform eye had appeared. Initially cloud-filled, the storm quickly cleared it out and continued strengthening slowly as it moved west-northwestward.[27] By the next day, Mawar reached its peak intensity, attaining 1-minute sustained winds of 295\u00a0km/h (185\u00a0mph) according to the JTWC, which is equivalent to Category 5 strength on the SSHWS.[28] It also had 10-minute sustained winds of 215\u00a0km/h (130\u00a0mph) and a minimum central barometric pressure of 900\u00a0hPa (26.58\u00a0inHg) which was assessed by the JMA.[29] While being large and symmetrical, Mawar again went through another eyewall replacement cycle,[30] resuming its weakening trend from the process. However, its concentric eye still remained large throughout the procedure.[31] By 18:00\u00a0UTC of May\u00a026, Mawar entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR), and PAGASA hence assigned it the name Betty.[32] On May 27, Mawar slightly weakened under the influence of dry air while moving west along the southern edge of a subtropical high.[33] The structural degradation continued as Mawar's convection fragmented at the northern side of the storm. During that time, Mawar was situated in an area where the sea surface temperatures were 28\u00a0\u00b0C (82\u00a0\u00b0F), indicating a cooling trend as the storm's outflow became impacted by it.[34] The CDO shrank from the dry air on May 29,[35] while the convective decay continued on Mawar's northwest quadrant while steering north-northeastward from a subtropical ridge to the northwest and east of the storm.[36] The eye was no longer detected on satellite imagery on May 30 as yet another weak eyewall replacement cycle commenced.[37] As a result, Mawar weakened into a severe tropical storm as the JMA reported on May 31,[38] before exiting the PAR on June 1.[39]  Mawar continued to further weaken into a tropical storm on June 2 whilst moving towards Okinawa Island.[40][41][42]\nThe following day, Mawar became an extratropical cyclone south of Honshu, as it moved towards the open Pacific.[43]"

Won Pat International Airport had also recorded winds up to 104.7 miles per hour (168.5\u00a0km/h) as Mawar impacted the island when the Extreme Wind Warning was still in effect, but the office later lost its wind sensors before the height of the storm around 9 pm.[82][83] The Weather Prediction Center reported that multiple locations in Guam received at least 20 inches (510\u00a0mm) of rain during Typhoon Mawar, with most of it falling in just three hours.[84] A United States Geological Survey rain gauge in Dededo, Guam measured the most rainfall at 28.42 inches (722\u00a0mm).[85] Despite being the strongest storm to strike the island in over 20\u00a0years, overall structural damage was relatively limited.[86] However, the typhoon's powerful winds did defoliate and uproot trees, topple billboards, and tear tin roofing from buildings.[87] Floodwaters in Yona were reported to be waist-deep.[86] Guam Memorial Hospital suffered some damage as typhoon shutters gave out, walls collapsed, and windows broke. Torrential rains pouring through damaged areas of the building caused staircases to flood with water. The hospital's kitchen caught fire during the storm, leaving it useless.[88] Four piers operated by Mobil were damaged at the Port of Guam.[89] Along Piti Channel, three barges, two mobile crane barges, and a derelict vessel were grounded. Two tugboats sank during the storm, forcing crew members to abandon ship. A dry dock at Cabras Island sank. The Sumay Cove Marina at Naval Base Guam suffered damage. Navy Rescue 21 Search and Rescue towers were rendered inoperable.[90] Two men were swept out to sea off Guam in separate incidents on May\u00a025.[91] Efforts to locate them would have no results by May\u00a027 and the two men are presumed dead.[92] On the afternoon of May 26, 41.4% of Guam Power Authority substations had been energized and 3.8% of system load for customers had been restored. Additionally, the Guam Waterworks Authority (GWA) reported that 50% of operable water wells were online, with connections yet to be restored to Navy-supplied sources in S\u00e5nta Rita-Sumai and Nimitz Hill Annex.[93] Eight public water tanks from the GWA were set up across Guam by May\u00a028 as water service was slowly restored. A boil water advisory remained in place for residents with access to tap water.[94] Telecommunication providers Docomo Pacific, GTA Teleguam (GTA), and IT&E worked to restore service. Docomo suspended data caps and distributed generators to keep services running. GTA reported repair work would not begin until power was restored. IT&E's fiber-optic network was damaged in southern Guam.[95] As of May\u00a030, 2023[update], the FCC reported that 163 cell towers remained offline: seven due to damage, but the remainder due to a lack of power. Another 120 towers were operating on backup power.[96] A lack of power and fuel for generators, along with damage to studios and transmission facilities, kept radio and television stations off the air after the storm, too.[97][98] Approximately 3,000 Korean tourists were stranded on the island as the island's international airport remained shut down due to damage caused by Typhoon Mawar.[99] The Guam Visitors Bureau provided them with meal vouchers and refunds.[100] Damages from Mawar to businesses were estimated to be US$111.8 million,[101] The Guam Memorial Hospital's reported damages were at least US$12 million,[102] and The Port Authority of Guam has estimated US$8.2 million in damages, excluding the assessments of fuel piers.[103] A prison in Guam sustained US$2 million.[104] President Joe Biden declared Guam a major disaster area on May\u00a027, enabling the distribution of federal funds. A total of 150 Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) personnel were on the island by this point.[105] Guam Delegate James Moylan penned a request to FEMA for the distribution of supplies from a warehouse containing over 1\u00a0million units of water and 900,000 meals.[106] The Port of Guam reopened on May\u00a028, with three United States Coast Guard Sentinel-class cutters and the Matson, Inc. cargo ship Maunawili docking with emergency supplies and food. The SCGC Sequoia (WLB-215) and Navy Explosive Ordinance Disposal Mobile Unit Five conducted sweeps around the port entrance to ensure no debris would hinder maritime traffic.[107] Carrier Strike Group 11 with the flagship USS Nimitz was directed to Guam to assist in relief efforts. An HC-130 Hercules aircraft was sent from Coast Guard Air Station Barbers Point in Hawaii with supplies.[90] Gas station lines reached 1\u00a0mi (1.6\u00a0km) long at times as residents flocked to refuel their cars.[108] Supplies of fuel were available but distribution was hampered by damaged fuel piers at the Port of Guam. The Guam Police Department coordinated with fuel companies to escort fuel trucks to gas stations.[89] The Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport opened one runway on May\u00a028 to allow cargo planes carrying supplies and personnel to land.[109] On May 30, more than 180 trained Red Cross disaster workers from all over the United States are on the islands, distributing relief supplies, supporting feeding efforts in community-run shelters, and assessing residential damage to help and support people affected by Mawar.[110]"

        "content": " The 2016\u201317 North American winter was quite warm across North America in general, due in part to a weak La Ni\u00f1a that was expected to influence weather conditions across the continent. Several notable events occurred during the season, including a potent winter storm that affected the East Coast of the United States in early January, the second-largest winter tornado outbreak on record later that month, and an unusually warm February.[a] In addition, towards the end of the season, a large cyclonic storm system that caused a large tornado outbreak, flooding, and a potent blizzard occurred in the Heartland of the country. However, the most notable event of the winter was a powerful blizzard that impacted the Northeast and New England in mid-March, towards the end of the season. While there is no well-agreed-upon date used to indicate the start of winter in the Northern Hemisphere, there are two definitions of winter which may be used. Based on the astronomical definition, winter begins at the winter solstice, which in 2016 occurred on December 21, and ends at the March equinox, which in 2017 occurred on March 20.[4] Based on the meteorological definition, the first day of winter is December 1 and the last day February 28.[5] Both definitions involve a period of approximately three months, with some variability. Winter is often defined by meteorologists to be the three calendar months with the lowest average temperatures. Since both definitions span the calendar year, it is possible to have a winter storm in two different years."

A La Ni\u00f1a was expected to influence winter conditions, and the CPC noted that such conditions were likely to either develop in the late fall or early winter. Forecasters also noted that the La Ni\u00f1a, should it develop, would likely be weak and would probably be short-lived. The outlook indicated that above-average precipitation was favored in the northern Rocky Mountains, Hawaii, western Alaska, and in the vicinity of the Great Lakes. The converse was favored across the entire Southern U.S. and southern Alaska. The outlook favored above-average temperatures across the Southern United States extending through the central Rockies, in northern New England, in northern and western Alaska, and especially in Hawaii. Other regions were given \"equal chances\" of either above or below-average temperatures. Drought conditions were considered likely to continue in multiple regions already in drought, including parts of California and the Southwest. Such conditions were expected to not only remain but also expand in the Southeastern U.S., and development was anticipated in the southern Plains. Lessening of drought conditions was expected in northern California, western New England, parts of the Ohio Valley, the northern Plains, and the northern Rockies, while the expansion of drought conditions was considered likely in eastern New England.[6]"

An arctic airmass to the system's north helped crank out snowfall as it slowed down in speed and continued to deepen, reaching a minimum pressure of 983 millibars (29.0\u00a0inHg) late on December 25.[16] The storm caused over 13,700 residents in South Dakota to lose power, while also resulting in 200 miles (320\u00a0km) of I-90 in the state to close.[17] The remaining system moved into Canada and was absorbed by another system on December 27."

The storms caused wind damage to various buildings, including at least one death, and shuttered several airports and other transportation systems as it passed.[25][26] It also caused significant beach erosion in parts of New Jersey and flooded coastal communities in New Jersey and Long Island.[27][28] On the 24th, wind gusts around the New York City metro area approached 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h).[28] Freezing rain and snow caused treacherous traveling conditions across southern Quebec on January 24; at least 100 accidents were blamed on slippery roads.[29]"

It underwent bombogenesis off the East Coast, and stalled out in the Gulf of Maine for over a day. It resulted in a wide swath of over 2 feet (0.61\u00a0m) of snow in New England and Eastern Canada.

Officials were also worried that because of the time of year where most trees were in full bloom, the heavy wet snow might cause branches to break and fall down, possibly causing power outages.[38] In Boulder, where a golf tournament was being held, officials were prepared for possible delays to the tournament.[39] In the end, Denver picked up 5 inches (13\u00a0cm), with higher amounts in the mountains.[38] At the height of the storm, up to 9,200 were reported to be without power in Pueblo.[40] Previously, the winter storm had dumped up to 2 feet (24\u00a0in) of snow in the higher elevations of Wyoming.[38] The state's Department of Transportation also urged residents to stay off the roadways if necessary. In addition, Highway 16 was shut down in the Bighorn Mountains because of the treacherous conditions.[41] Blizzard warnings were issued for Kansas and the adjacent areas, as heavy snow and gusty winds were predicted.[38] After the storm subsided, about 100 evacuations and 36 rescues were reported.[42] In the northwestern part of the state, 130 miles (210\u00a0km) of Interstate 70 was shut down due to the treacherous conditions.[43][38]"

The system quickly advanced eastwards through the heart of the country, and by 18:00\u00a0UTC on February 8, a surface low had developed over the Arkansas\u2013Tennessee state border.[3] This low would become the dominant low of the system as it continued towards the Northeastern United States, while also producing light to moderate snow across the Ohio Valley since there was enough cold air in place from a departing storm system. As the clipper system neared the tri-state area, it began to steadily intensify and produce more moderate and heavy snow while beginning to make the transition into a nor'easter. By 09\u201312:00\u00a0UTC on February 9, the low had begun to move just offshore near the Delaware coastline.[4][5] As very heavy snow bands (with snowfall rates of 2\u20134 inches (5.1\u201310.2\u00a0cm) in some spots) set up offshore, forecasters noted that the low was likely to rapidly deepen \u2013 or in meteorological terms, bomb out \u2013 due to the temperature contrast between the cold air to its north and moisture feeding into the storm from the warm waters of the Gulf Stream.[6] Indeed, the storm had undergone this process, meeting the criteria for bombogenesis, with the central pressure dropping from 1,005 millibars (29.7\u00a0inHg) at 18:00\u00a0UTC on February 8 to 977 millibars (28.9\u00a0inHg) by 18:00\u00a0UTC on February 9 while it was offshore the New Jersey coastline.[7] Snow slowly began to subside in areas such as eastern Pennsylvania and western New Jersey.

Aside from Hokkaido, the entire country is subject to the East Asian rainy season, known as Tsuyu (\u6885\u96e8), during the early part of summer. The mountainous terrain of Japan places it at risk for flooding and landslides. These climate events have killed hundreds of people, and expert analysis has stated global warming is a contributing cause.[4] The Kuma River basin had previously flooded in 1965. One of three major rapids in Japan, the Kuma is a 115-kilometer-long (71\u00a0mi) class A river. Its course begins in the mountain range in Kyushu, and runs through Hitoyoshi, Kumamoto; Kuma, Kumamoto; and Yatsushiro, Kumamoto before it discharges into the Yatsushiro Sea.[5]"

At 5 AM, local time (UTC+9) the Japan Meteorological Agency raised its heavy rain warning to its highest level of 3 in many parts of the prefectures, the first time it has ever done so for these areas.[6] The Japan Meteorological Agency stated the amount of rain was record-breaking for the region and was never seen before.[7] The rate of rainfall exceeded 100 millimeters (3.9\u00a0in) per hour.[8] As of 9 July 2020, 60 people are confirmed dead and approximately a dozen are reported missing.[9] According to Kyodo News, 1.3\u00a0million people were ordered to evacuate their homes and there were 12 different landslide events.[10] Fourteen of the dead were residents in a flooded old age home in Kuma, Kumamoto.[6][7] Kumamoto governor Ikuo Kabashima stated that scores were stranded after mud and floodwater gushed into the old age home.[4] According to a rescue volunteer, when they reached the old age home, the water was still on the first-floor level. The rescue personnel managed to rescue residents who had made it up to the second floor but were unable to reach those left below.[8] According to the staff at the home, they roused residents at 5 a.m. and shuffled them upstairs. On the first floor, when water came into the building, they placed residents with wheelchairs on top of tables in the dining room. The staff was unable to rescue the deceased residents after water broke through the windows and the patients floated off the tables.[11][12] Following overnight rains, authorities instructed more than 75,000 residents to evacuate in the prefectures of Kumamoto and Kagoshima.[13] 203,200 residents were instructed to shelter in place, and 109 shelters were opened in the region.[6] The Kuma River overran its bank in eleven different locations and breached one levee.[14] In Kuma, Kumamoto, stranded residents were rescued by a rescue helicopter.[13] Eight homes were swept away in Ashikita, Kumamoto.[7] In Tsunagi, Kumamoto, 2\u20133 people were pulled out of a landslide without signs of life.[13] Some 8,000 homes were left without power in Kumamoto and Kagoshima according to the Kyushu Electric Power Company.[13] Another 6,100 houses were estimated to be submerged, 11 bridges destroyed[15] and 4,700 buildings destroyed, damaged or flooded.[3] A dike was breached near the town of Hitoyoshi, normally known for its hot springs and boating, which was flooded by the Kuma River. Volunteers from the local rafting association in Hitoyoshi used their rafts to rescue stranded residents in the flooded town. At least 17 people in Hitoyoshi died.[16][6][13] On the morning of 7 July, the Chikugo River overflowed in Hita, \u014cita leading authorities to issue the highest level alert to residents.[17]"

In late January 2019, one of these lobes traveled southward and stalled over central Canada and north-central United States for about a week before the upper-level flow of the atmosphere directed it over to Western Canada.[8] The influx of frigid air from the North Pole created high winds, and brought extreme sub-zero temperatures, further exacerbated by severe wind chill.

Classified as a level 5 or Extreme Nor'easter by the Dolan-Davis scale for classification of Atlantic Nor'easters[1] it was one of the ten worst storms in the United States in the 20th century. It lingered through five high tides over a three-day period, killing 40\u00a0people, injuring over 1,000, and causing hundreds of millions in property damage in six states.

        "content": "On March\u00a04, 1962, a large low-pressure area developed along a cold front off the southeast coast of the United States, with several ill-defined circulation centers. At the same time, a large ridge was over Atlantic Canada, and a powerful upper-level low was over the Ohio Valley. The upper-level low reached the North Carolina coast on March\u00a06, which aided in the intensification of the frontal system, reaching a minimum barometric pressure of 979\u00a0mbar (28.9\u00a0inHg). From March\u00a06\u20138, the storm drifted northeastward, but the ridge blocked quicker movement blocked by the ridge.[3] The storm and ridge interaction produced a steep pressure gradient that produced hurricane-force wind gusts along the Mid-Atlantic coast. The storm also produced a 600\u00a0mi (970\u00a0km) long fetch of flow of winds from the Atlantic Ocean, building the height of the waves as high as 30\u00a0ft (9.1\u00a0m).[4][3] Storm conditions diminished along the coast on March\u00a09.[3] The storm was unusual because of its slow movement, contrary to typical nor'easters.[5] In most areas, the storm peak occurred on March\u00a07, which was the Christian holiday of Ash Wednesday, the first day of Lent that year. Outer Banks writer Aycock Brown named the coastal storm as the \"Ash Wednesday Storm.\"[6][5] In their Mariners Weather Log summary, the U.S. Weather Bureau referred to the weather system as the \"Great Atlantic Coastal Storm.\"[3] The storm is also known as the \"Five High Storm\" because it lingered off the Atlantic Coast of the northeast United States over a period of five high tides.[7]"

The large storm dropped heavy snowfall as far south as Alabama, with the heaviest accumulations in western Virginia and Maryland. Little precipitation occurred to the storm's north over New England.[4][3] During the storm, several ships came into danger amid the high waves. The British vessel Arthur Albright was blown ashore at Port Tampa, Florida. About 200\u00a0mi (320\u00a0km) southeast of Charleston, three people were rescued when the yacht Guinevere sank during the storm. Offshore Cape Hatteras, a 500\u00a0ft (150\u00a0m) tanker broke in two; one member of the crew died while attempting to launch lifeboats, but the remaining crew were rescued by a passing cruise ship and the Navy.

Tides reached 6.5\u00a0ft (2.0\u00a0m) above normal in Vero Beach. The high tides caused minor beach erosion and extensive drifting of sand. Flooding entered oceanfront properties, damaging docks, streets, and cabanas. Monetary damage was estimated around $1\u00a0million. Impacts were minimal in Georgia.

The storm wrecked a few beachside cottages, and one person drowned along the Santee-Cooper Lakes.[3] A gale warning was issued for North Carolina on March\u00a06.[6] Along the Atlantic side of the Outer Banks of North Carolina, high waves eroded sand dunes and created a new 200\u00a0ft (61\u00a0m) inlet on Hatteras Island, about 2\u00a0mi (3.2\u00a0km) north of Buxton. Several sections of North Carolina Highway 12 were washed out or covered with sand, covering cars with sand.[3] At least two storm-related deaths occurred on the Currituck Outer Banks, as result of exposure to the elements.

Damage in the region was estimated at $50\u00a0million, and ten people were killed \u2013 seven fatalities were in Delaware and the other three were in Maryland.[3] Farther north, 7.6\u00a0m (25\u00a0ft) waves struck Ocean City, Maryland and the resort developments beginning on Assateague Island were destroyed.[11] Waves more than 12\u00a0m (39\u00a0ft) high occurred at Rehoboth Beach, Delaware destroying the boardwalk and beach front homes. The flow of water flooded waterfront areas of Philadelphia and Camden, New Jersey. The Weather Bureau forecast for Atlantic City failed to anticipate the severity of the storm, and there was little warning for the flooding along the coasts.[4] High waves battered the Jersey Shore and the Delaware Bay, along with strong wind gusts, reaching 73\u00a0mph (117\u00a0km/h) in Long Branch. Damage was estimated at $80\u00a0million statewide, one of the most damaging storms on record for the coast. The highest tide in the state was 7.7\u00a0ft (2.3\u00a0m) in Harrison. High waves and tides changed the New Jersey coastline. Floodwaters breached Long Beach Island in five locations, and about half of Harvey Cedars was wrecked during the storm. In coastal towns, about 4,000\u00a0houses were destroyed and another 40,000 were severely damaged after being inundated with 4 to 5\u00a0ft (1.2 to 1.5\u00a0m) of water. In Atlantic City, the waves knocked a 100\u00a0ft (30\u00a0m) barge into Steel Pier, which washed out a quarter-mile section, including the tank used for the diving horse. Also lost was the wave sensor, which last reported a tide of 6.9\u00a0ft (2.1\u00a0m) on March\u00a06. The estimated high tide was 10\u00a0ft (3.0\u00a0m) above normal. Stranded residents along the coast attempted to evacuate by boat, but were impeded by icy waters. About 2,000\u00a0people were evacuated by army trucks and helicopters. Boardwalks were damaged in several towns, and rail lines were shut down. The high tides cut power and phone lines, which sparked fires that were unable to be reached by fire trucks until the floods subsided. There 14\u00a0fatalities, as well as 12\u00a0people missing and presumed killed.[3][4] Avalon, New Jersey lost 6 blocks. In New York, high waves and tides affected Long Island and the New York metro. Willets Point reported a high tide of 8.6\u00a0ft (2.6\u00a0m) before the gauge failed. Waves up to 20\u00a0ft (6.1\u00a0m) in height washed away about 100\u00a0houses in the state, including 35 on Fire Island, and flooded coastal roads, forcing families to evacuate. The Battery reported wind gusts of 56\u00a0mph (90\u00a0km/h) during the storm. The winds knocked down power lines, trees, and signs. Damage in New York was estimated at over $10\u00a0million.[3] High winds and waves affected southern New England, with a peak wind gust of 84\u00a0mph (135\u00a0km/h) on Block Island, Rhode Island; the same station recorded sustained winds of 76\u00a0mph (122\u00a0km/h). The highest tide in New England was 13.5\u00a0ft (4.1\u00a0m) in Boston, Massachusetts. High waves flooded coastal and low-lying areas, inundating roads and houses' cellars, and washing over seawalls as far north as Portland, Maine. Near New Haven, Connecticut, a barge and an oyster boat sank. Little precipitation occurred in New England, and the Weather Bureau referred to the storm as a \"dry nor'easter\". Flights in and around the region were canceled during the storm. Damage in New England was estimated at $1.3\u00a0million.[3] Extensive damage to trees and structures and beach erosion was also reported along the southern New England coast.[10]"

Shore towns cleared sand and restored road access ahead of the summer tourist season.[4] The Army Corps of Engineers made emergency beach replenishments to shore towns to protect from further storms.[7] Some 5,000 private lots comprising what is now National Park Service land on Assateague Island had been zoned and sold for resort development. The Ash Wednesday Storm halted the plans for development, as it destroyed the few existing structures on the island and ripped roads apart. Instead, in 1965, Assateague Island National Seashore was designated by the National Park Service.[citation needed]"

Weather systems were undergoing cyclogenesis from North American storms moving across the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and saw many parts of Europe experiencing heavy snowfall and record-low temperatures. This led to a number of deaths, widespread transport disruption, power failures and postponed sporting events."

Scientists have shown that El Ni\u00f1o, the quasi-biennial oscillation[3] and solar variability all conspired to drive this extreme winter."

        "content": "Light snowfall occurred in the UK on 16 December and weather warnings were given on most local TV stations; there were some traffic jams towards the south. The snow later spread towards France and northern Spain. In mainland Europe, early snowfall was seen across much of the western half of the continent. On 17 December, the Swiss canton of Grisons saw a record-low overnight temperature of \u221232\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221225.6\u00a0\u00b0F). This snowfall led to the shutdown of Utrecht Centraal (the largest rail hub in the Netherlands). While snowfall on highways led to the busiest morning rush hour of 2009, with a total of 671\u00a0km (417 m) in traffic jams.[4] The following day, heavy overnight snowfall caused widespread disruption across large parts of the South East, East Anglia, the East Midlands and Yorkshire and the Humber in Britain. This snow was in the north half of a depression with east winds centred south of England. Several deaths attributed to the cold weather were reported.[5] During the night of 18\u201319 December, five Eurostar trains were stuck in the Channel Tunnel, trapping more than 2,000 people for up to 16 hours after the vehicles suffered electrical failures because of freezing overnight temperatures. Passengers were without heating, lighting and air-conditioning for several hours while food and water ran out.[6] Some passengers were evacuated via service tunnels to car trains, while others were kept on their trains until the trains could be towed out.[7] Eurostar added special services on the evening of 19 December to transport \"vulnerable passengers\" between London, Paris and Brussels. However, a service from Paris became the sixth train to break down after becoming stuck near Ebbsfleet, Kent.[8] The cause of the breakdowns was unclear; Eurostar initially blamed the sudden contrast between freezing temperatures above ground and the 25\u00a0\u00b0C (77\u00a0\u00b0F) heat of the tunnel, which affected the high-speed engines.[9] On 19 December, a daily high temperature of -11.5\u00a0\u00b0C was recorded in Mainz, Germany, making it remaining in the two digit negatives all day for the first time since 1956. On the 20th, the December record low of -16.5\u00a0\u00b0C was set with great distance (previously -13.9\u00a0\u00b0C), and also overall the lowest temperature measured since 1979[10] On 20 December in the Netherlands, the Royal Dutch Meteorological Institute (KNMI) issued an official weather alarm for the entire country following heavy snowfall (15\u201320\u00a0cm or 5.9\u20137.9\u00a0in) in the west, which eventually spread to the entire country. In most cities bus services were halted and tram service was halted in all four major cities.\nIn northern Italy several locations recorded the lowest temperatures since 1985, with one low reaching \u221217\u00a0\u00b0C (1.4\u00a0\u00b0F).[11] Police in Poland reported that 15 people froze to death in the country as overnight temperatures fell as low as \u221220\u00a0\u00b0C (\u22124\u00a0\u00b0F) and 47 people died indirectly as a result of the cold during the month of December. Public appeals were made to the Polish community to report any homeless or drunk people lying outdoors, in an attempt to reduce the number of deaths from exposure to the cold.[12] In Kosovo, one person died and ten people were injured in traffic accidents because of poor weather conditions. Kosovo Police spokesperson, Arb\u00ebr Beka, said that one person died in an accident which occurred near \u0110akovica; there were injuries reported in 16 traffic accidents, and a total of 74 accidents causing property damage. The local police called on residents to be careful on the roads because of the heavy snowfall and very difficult driving conditions.[13] On 21 December, the M25 motorway and large parts of the M3, M4, M40, M1 and M11 motorways in the United Kingdom were brought to a standstill until late at night and many towns were gridlocked. About 100 people were able to travel from London Victoria Station to Ashford International railway station on a steam train hauled by the locomotive Tornado.[14] Widespread transport disruption affected parts of England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland (except a few southern parts of Munster).[15] In Bosnia and Herzegovina, three people were found dead from hypothermia in Sarajevo and Tesli\u0107.[16]"

        "content": "Fresh overnight snowfall brought renewed problems to parts of the United Kingdom. Particularly badly hit were north Hampshire and the Thames Valley in England. In Basingstoke, some 3,000 motorists were forced to either abandon their vehicles or sleep in them overnight after becoming stuck in gridlocked traffic; approximately 2,000 cars were abandoned.[17] The vehicle recovery service, AA, accused some local authorities of not acting quickly enough to grit the roads, claiming some \"key roads\" had \"not been gritted at all\". The Local Government Association dismissed the claims as \"unverified, unsubstantiated and unjustified\".[18] A man found unconscious in his back garden on the Isle of Lewis, in the Outer Hebrides, after a night out over the weekend died.[19] A homeless charity in France reported that 12 people died during December as a result of the severe cold.[20] On 23 December, overnight temperatures in the UK once again dropped well below freezing. Dalwhinnie in the central Highlands of Scotland recorded a low of \u221216\u00a0\u00b0C (3\u00a0\u00b0F) and Edinburgh recorded \u221210\u00a0\u00b0C (14\u00a0\u00b0F), causing Scottish Transport Minister Stewart Stevenson to state that conditions on Scottish roads were at their worst in 20 years.[18] Air travel was disrupted in the United Kingdom, with Southampton Airport cancelling (or diverting) all inbound and outbound flights until midday due to a frozen runway. Train services were cancelled for most of the day from Southampton Airport Parkway. A Ryanair flight landing at Prestwick Airport overshot the runway; no injuries were reported and the airport was soon reopened.[21] Two women were killed and more than 40 people injured following a coach crash on an ungritted country road in Cornwall, as a party returned from a trip to see Christmas lights in Mousehole the previous evening.[22][23] Weather forecasters warned of icy conditions and further snowfall into Christmas Eve, particularly affecting northern England and the East Midlands.[18] In western Serbia, rapidly melting snow caused the Jadar River in Loznica to flood and resulted in farmland being submerged. Danijela Despotovi\u0107, of the Hydro-Meteorological Service of Serbia in Loznica, said that the temperature was \u221219\u00a0\u00b0C (\u22122\u00a0\u00b0F) in the town.[24] Heavy snowfall began in Saint Petersburg, Russia. By 26 December the city was under 35\u00a0cm of snow, creating the largest December snowfall recorded in the city since 1881.[citation needed] On Christmas Day, parts of Britain had a White Christmas for the first time since 2004 after snow fell in northern and central Scotland and parts of England (including Nottinghamshire).[citation needed]\nThe Netherlands had its first white Christmas since 1981.[25] On 26 December (Boxing Day), drivers in Northern Ireland were warned of icy conditions.[26] Conditions in many other parts of the UK continued to improve as milder air moved in from the south. However, northern England and Scotland remained cold and nighttime temperatures continued to drop below freezing. Some Boxing Day sporting fixtures were cancelled (or postponed) because of continuing icy conditions in certain areas, including the National Hunt meeting at Towcester and all but two of the Scottish Football League's matches.[23] Some parts of East Anglia suffered electricity cuts, including Dedham, Stratford St Mary and parts of Colchester; in more remote parts of the region, some were without power for 36 hours.[27][28][29]"

The Met Office issued fresh severe weather warnings and motorists were advised to drive with caution. The A75 between Stranraer and Newton Stewart was closed due to icy conditions; while the southbound carriageway of the A9 was blocked between the A824 and B8081 in Perth and Kinross following an accident at Gleneagles.[31] Temperatures dropped to \u221218\u00a0\u00b0C (0\u00a0\u00b0F) in parts of the Highlands overnight on 28\u201329 December, with Braemar recording Britain's lowest temperature of the Winter. Fresh travel warnings were issued on 29 December, as wintry conditions continued to cause problems on Scotland's roads. The runway of Inverness Airport was briefly closed because of snow and ice, and First ScotRail reduced its service to and from Glasgow Central because of the severe conditions.\nHowever, the snow and icy conditions were good for the Scottish ski industry, which said the weather helped it to experience its best start to the season for several years.[32] Warnings of heavy snow were issued for Wales, the Midlands, Yorkshire and Humber, north-west England, eastern and southern England.[33] More snow began falling across parts of Wales/central and northern England on the evening of 29 December, with Wales recording the heaviest of the snow showers; some rural areas recording up to 30 centimetres (12\u00a0in). Snow was also reported in parts of the West Midlands region and Yorkshire. On 30 December, Sportscotland Avalanche Information Service (SAIS) issued warnings about conditions on Scottish mountains.[34] However, three people died in three large avalanches.[35] Two climbers were killed as a result of a snow slide on Ben Nevis, while a man was airlifted from Liathach (a mountain in Torridon) after getting into trouble, but died in hospital.[34] Continued icy weather in Scotland on New Year's Eve led to the cancellation of Hogmanay celebrations in Inverness, amid concerns over public safety;[36] New Year celebrations in other parts of Scotland went ahead as planned.[36] Northeast Scotland experienced fresh snowfall during the afternoon and evening of 31 December. For a second time that week Inverness Airport was closed, forcing several hundred passengers to make alternative arrangements.  In Batley, West Yorkshire, 2,500 gallons of water leaked into the local gas network; 400 homes in Dewsbury and Batley were without gas during subzero temperatures.  The final homes were reconnected on 7 January.[37] There was also heavy snowfall in Dublin, Ireland, leading to the closure of Dublin Airport for several hours disrupting flights.[38]\nIn Dublin, the snow began 10 minutes before the New Year's Eve countdown."

In some places it was as deep as 10 centimetres (3.9\u00a0in), and motorists were warned not to travel unless absolutely necessary.[39] On 2 January, the synoptic position settled with the jet stream in a route causing a blocking high in the eastern Atlantic. This diverted warm west winds to the south over the Mediterranean and subjected western Europe to cold north winds, warm weather around the Caspian Sea and unusually cold weather in China. A weather front brought heavy snow to north west England. In Britain many roads were closed, including part of the M9.[40] On 3 January parts of northeast England and Cumbria had 6 centimetres (2.4\u00a0in) of snow, and Edinburgh had 9 centimetres (3.5\u00a0in).[41] Europe's largest private-sector weather business, MeteoGroup, announced that the previous month was the coldest December (on average) since 1996.[42] Temperatures remained very cold throughout Ireland and Britain;[43] however, Inverness Airport reopened after several days.[44] It was announced that due to the cold snap, it would be illegal to shoot certain game birds.[41] An all-time snow record in the Estonian capital, Tallinn, was measured at 62\u00a0cm (two feet).[45] The next day in Scotland, Fife Council became the first local council to confirm that its supplies of grit were exhausted after it received less than it had ordered from suppliers. Ministers denied there was a shortage of grit and salt, insisting there were \"very substantial\" supplies for Scotland's roads.[46] In its monthly summary Met \u00c9ireann, Ireland's weather service, said December was the coldest month for 28 years for most of the country and the coldest of any month since February 1986 at several stations.[47] Wintry conditions returned to Europe, as much of the northern hemisphere was gripped by intensely cold weather.[48] 13 people died in Poland, bringing the total number of cold-related deaths in Poland to 122. In Switzerland, ten skiers were reported dead or missing in avalanches.[48] The worst incident occurred in the Diemtig Valley; avalanches hit a group of skiers and their rescuers, killing four people (including a doctor). Eight people were rescued, although three remained missing.[48] On 5 January, the Met Office issued weather warnings for every region in the UK except the Northern Isles. An extreme-weather warning was issued in the southern areas for overnight snowfall, which could bring accumulations from 25 to 40 centimetres (9.8 to 15.7\u00a0in).[49] BBC Weather and the Met Office also warned that temperatures in the Highlands of Scotland could drop to \u221220\u00a0\u00b0C (\u22124\u00a0\u00b0F) later in the week. The Met Office also confirmed that the UK is experiencing the longest prolonged cold spell since 1981.[50] 48 centimetres (19\u00a0in) of snow fell in Aviemore, Scotland, and 3 to 4 feet (0.91 to 1.22\u00a0m) of snow was recorded within the Cairngorms National Park. Most of Scotland had further snowfall during the night of 4\u20135 January."

Hawick and most of the southern Scottish Borders was cut off from the rest of the country for two days,[52] and roads in the southeast of England were left with traffic jams and abandoned cars. 8,000 schools were closed.[53] The lowest registered temperature on 7 January in Sweden was \u221240.8\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221241.4\u00a0\u00b0F) in Hemavan.[54] In the Netherlands and Belgium, road salt used to keep the roads clear of snow and ice was running out.[55] National and secondary schools in Ireland were supposed to open after the Christmas break on this day; however, many were forced to close because of weather conditions. On 8 January, the Minister for Education announced that all schools were to remain closed until at least Thursday, 14 January.[56]\nOn the Luas Green line there were difficulties getting up slopes, such as those between Harcourt and Charlemont and between Beechwood and Cowper. This had caused some delays (especially when salt was scarce for sand tanks on the trams) for Dublin pedestrians. Major reservoirs in County Cork, County Dublin and County Limerick were critically low; in areas such as County Laois and the rural areas of County Cork, bottled water was supplied by the Irish army. This had also been done for the people affected by floods in October and November 2009. The National Grid issued its second alert in three days, asking suppliers to provide more gas and some businesses to switch to other power sources, as gas usage hit record levels.[57] BBC News reported heavy snowfall as far south as Granada, Spain on 8 January.[citation needed]\nA new record of \u22129\u00a0\u00b0C (16\u00a0\u00b0F) was also recorded in Dublin, Ireland. Temperatures in County Limerick dropped to \u221211.1\u00a0\u00b0C (12.0\u00a0\u00b0F). In Kuusamo, Finland, the lowest registered temperature was \u221237.1\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221234.8\u00a0\u00b0F).[58]\nIn Norway, the temperature dropped to \u221242.4\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221244.3\u00a0\u00b0F) at Tynset.[59]\nIn Germany more than 30 centimetres (12\u00a0in) of snow fell on the island of R\u00fcgen, and the entire country was blanketed in snow.  German officials also acknowledged a shortage of grit, and feared that high winds and drifting snow would lead to road closures.[60]\nIn France, officials closed Autoroute 35 for trucks because of heavy snow, and over 400 truck drivers bound for Germany had to make an unscheduled overnight stop.  In the early morning hours of 9 January, the autoroute was also closed to cars. The storm also grounded 160 flights at the Frankfurt am Main international airport.[61]\nSnow fell heavily in some parts of Spain. Prades (Tarragona, southern Catalonia) sported a 120\u00a0cm snow cover after a 30-plus- hour storm,[citation needed] which led to an 18-hour closure of the AP7 motorway at La Jonquera (at the Spanish/French border).[62] Overnight temperatures of \u221222.3\u00a0\u00b0C (\u22128.1\u00a0\u00b0F) were recorded in Altnaharra in the Scottish Highlands.[63] Deal and Sandwich in Kent, England, were virtually cut off by snowdrifts on 9 January.[64]\nSnow showers persisted in the east of the UK. In the far south east, snow showers merged into longer and more persistent areas of snow. A low temperature of \u221214.5\u00a0\u00b0C (5.9\u00a0\u00b0F) was recorded at Tulloch Bridge. The football schedule was also heavily affected by the snowfall; all but seven games (two in both the Premier League and League 1 and three in the Championship) were postponed in England, and all but five Scottish Cup games were played in Scotland. Several Guinness Premiership games and horse-racing meets were cancelled as well.[65] Dublin Airport was closed once again.[66] Flights to Krak\u00f3w in southern Poland were diverted to the airport in Katowice, due to fog which prevented planes from landing.[67] Met \u00c9ireann issued a weather warning with up to 10 centimetres (3.9\u00a0in) of snow forecast.[68] Belgium was covered with another thick layer of snow, in some central provinces (such as Flemish Brabant) as deep as 10 centimetres (3.9\u00a0in). Since the snow (and possible traffic chaos) had been forecast for several days, this resulted in few people leaving their homes; traffic accidents were minor and few. At Brussels Airport slight delays were inevitable, but mostly the result of airports in neighbouring countries coping with heavier snow.[69] In Denmark, army personnel carriers were once again deployed in the southern part of the country to assist emergency services as drifting continued to cause traffic problems.[70]"

A heavy snowstorm, named \"Daisy\", struck northern Germany on 9 and 10 January. Especially along the coast and on the islands of Usedom, R\u00fcgen and Fehmarn, snowdrifts made roads, parts of the coastal autobahn and rail tracks impassable. In northern Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and eastern Schleswig-Holstein secondary roads were closed and trains cancelled, while snowplows and excavators struggled to keep the main routes free. Since the storms were accumulating increasingly large snowbanks, hundreds of cars were stranded on Autobahn 20 near Jarmen during the night, and a train derailed after striking a snowbank near Miltzow.[71] In Denmark, drifting continued to disrupt traffic in the southern part of the country; army personnel carriers were used to assist emergency services.[72] In Spain, a snowstorm swept the country; Madrid had more than 10 hours of snow. Parts of southern Spain, such as Seville, saw their first snow since 1954 or M\u00e9rida since 1983 On 11 January, England and Wales continued to feel the effects of the depression in the Western Approaches. In the Republic of Ireland, the Department of Education ordered all schools to close for the day due to heavy snowfall. Due to a mix of bitter cold and the milder system trying to push in from the Atlantic, heavy snowfall in the United Kingdom resumed; there were fresh accumulations (on top of existing snow) of up to 15 centimetres (6\u00a0inches) on 12 January in Wales and South West England. Snow later fell in The Midlands and South-east England. In Holmfirth and Barnsley in north England, freezing rain or sleet fell onto deep-frozen roads; this created so much black ice that some people found that the only safe way to move about on roads was by crawling.[73] Hospital accident and emergency units in the Sheffield, Rotherham and Barnsley areas of South Yorkshire reported being inundated by people with fractures and sprains after slipping on what one Council official in Sheffield described as the worst black ice seen in the area in living memory. Many schools were again closed across England and Wales, and there were many road accidents and closures. The M25 motorway was down to one lane between Leatherhead and Reigate; roads across southern Great Britain were untreated, wreaking havoc on commuters. Gatwick and Birmingham airports were closed, and many flights were delayed at Heathrow. During 13 January the weather system continued north, affecting much of Northern England before reaching Scotland. Parts of northern France were also affected by snowfall.[74] At least 22 people died due to lower temperatures in Romania over a five-day period.[75][76][77][78] By the end of January in southern Sweden, temperatures had failed to get above 0\u00a0\u00b0C (32\u00a0\u00b0F) a single time in the whole month in the major cities in the entire M\u00e4lar valley, including capital Stockholm as well as major other cities such as Uppsala, V\u00e4ster\u00e5s and \u00d6rebro. Remarkably enough that even spread further south to inland cities in the deep south such as V\u00e4xj\u00f6 and Ljungby.[79] Although temperatures were lower than usual, no actual cold records were broken, but even temperatures in marine climate areas such as in Malm\u00f6 plummeted below \u221215\u00a0\u00b0C (5\u00a0\u00b0F) during the coldest nights. All of Sweden's official stations averaged below 0\u00a0\u00b0C (32\u00a0\u00b0F) in terms of daily high, which is highly unusual. The cold in the large cities were relatively moderated, but \u00d6rebro some way inland had a \u221210\u00a0\u00b0C (14\u00a0\u00b0F) mean, which is normal for areas much further north."

High pressure building to the north of the storm indicated it would turn more towards the west, but it moved nearly due northward.[1] The cyclone attained its peak intensity with winds of 50\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h) at 0600 UTC on August 20[3] and subsequently began to weaken; by the time Dottie made landfall in Charleston, South Carolina later that evening, it was barely of tropical storm intensity.[1] It deteriorated into a tropical depression on August 21 and dissipated shortly thereafter.[3] The remnant low pressure system turned southward and once again entered the Atlantic before turning westward and crossing the Florida peninsula.[2]"

A hurricane watch was also posted between Savannah, Georgia and Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. The hurricane watch was later extended to Jacksonville when conditions appeared more favorable for the storm's intensification, but was soon discontinued.[1] Flooding rains were anticipated in the Carolinas,[4] though, in contrast, Dottie was compared to a mere thunderstorm by some local officials.[5] Prior to being upgraded to a tropical storm, the depression spawned heavy precipitation and high winds throughout southern Florida and portions of the Bahamas.[6] In Fort Lauderdale, the storm dropped 10.68\u00a0in (271\u00a0mm) of rainfall,[7] and in the Miami area, 24-hour rainfall totals reached 8\u00a0in (200\u00a0mm). The heavy rainfall caused street flooding across the region, especially in the Broward County cities of Fort Lauderdale, Hollywood, Lauderhill, Miramar, and Tamarac.[8] Further south, street flooding in Miami delayed thousands of motorists during morning rush-hour traffic. Police closed the Venetian Causeway \u2013 which links Miami to the Venetian Islands and Miami Beach \u2013 after the bridge was inundated with 2.5\u00a0ft (0.76\u00a0m) of water.[9] The highest recorded wind gusts were 62\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h) in Islamorada, and in the city the winds damaged a roof. The winds downed trees,[8] and left roughly 20\u00a0neighborhoods in southern Florida without power during the passage of Dottie.[10] Wind gusts of 40 to 50\u00a0mph (64 to 80\u00a0km/h) were recorded across the northern Florida Keys and Grand Bahama.[1] Near the latter location, a fishing boat capsized during the storm; four of its occupants drowned.[2] Along the coast of the Southeastern United States, tides generally ran 1 to 2\u00a0ft (0.30 to 0.61\u00a0m) above normal, peaking at 3.5\u00a0ft (1.1\u00a0m) in North Carolina.[1] Moderate to heavy rainfall was reported in the Carolinas,[7] causing flooding of 5\u00a0ft (1.5\u00a0m) deep in New Hanover County, North Carolina.[8] Overall damage was light and primarily limited to coastal beach erosion.[1][2][7] In some areas, Dottie helped relieve drought conditions.[11]"

Their livelihoods are dependent on subsistence farming and the floods increased livestock and household vulnerability of the farmers.[12] Water logging and retention due to the floods was associated with the loss of land productivity and soil degradation. The declining quality of soil affected the farming of major staple crops, sorghum and mahangu, which escalated food prices in the region furthering household food insecurity.[12] Livelihoods were affected after livestock died from drowning in large numbers, whilst the poor prevailing conditions made those remaining susceptible to diseases and parasites such as Lumpy skin disease and the African swine fever.[20] Other impacts were on public infrastructure like roads, bridges, sewerage system, health facilities, market places and schools which were damaged extensively. Rehabilitation work in flooded areas went beyond repairs to include the elevation of roads and improvements to the drainage system.[21] The cost of this was 5.5 times the value of replacing damaged structures.[21] Unfortunately, the area and the population had not yet recovered and were still vulnerable when flooding occurred in 2009.[22]"

The eighteenth cyclone and fourth subtropical storm of the 1974 Atlantic hurricane season, the storm developed near eastern Cuba on October\u00a04 from an area of disturbed weather. Shortly before striking Andros Island on October\u00a06, the system strengthened into a subtropical storm. The storm made its closest approach to Florida early on October\u00a07. Peaking with sustained winds of 50\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h), the system veered northward and then northeastward, but nonetheless caused heavy rainfall and coastal flooding on land in Florida. While paralleling offshore North Carolina and South Carolina, the storm began to slowly weaken. By late on October\u00a08, the subtropical cyclone merged with a cold front while well east of Cape Hatteras. Gale-force winds were observed by ships and land stations in The Bahamas. The storm and a stationary high pressure system over the Eastern United States resulted in strong winds and rough seas along the coast of Florida for several days, especially on October\u00a06. Many coastal areas observed sustained winds of 25 to 40\u00a0mph (40 to 64\u00a0km/h), with higher gusts.

It then drifted north-northwestward and intensified slowly.[2] Due to a large high pressure area, the cold front, and the subtropical cyclone, gale-force winds began spreading into the eastern Gulf of Mexico, the Straits of Florida, and adjacent land areas. At 16:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a05, the National Hurricane Center stated that a low pressure center developed in the central Bahamas, though it was not classified as a subtropical cyclone. Late on October\u00a05, ships crossing through the central Bahamas reported gale-force winds.[1] The system intensified into a subtropical storm at 00:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a06. Shortly thereafter, the subtropical storm struck Andros Island in The Bahamas with winds of 45\u00a0mph (75\u00a0km/h).

This meteorological pattern resulted in very rough seas and strong winds over Florida for several days, especially when the subtropical storm made its closest approach on October\u00a06.[3] As a result, gale warnings were issued from the Jupiter Inlet northward to Savannah, Georgia, beginning at 21:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a06, as were small craft warnings around the entire Florida peninsula and northward to Virginia Beach, Virginia.[4] Along the east coast of Florida, several weather stations reported sustained winds between 25 and 40\u00a0mph (40 and 64\u00a0km/h), with gusts exceeding 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h) at some locations. Tides generally were about 3\u00a0ft (0.91\u00a0m) above normal, leaving widespread erosion and threatening several oceanfront structures. Many coastal streets were closed due to either sand deposited on the roads or tidal flooding. Isolated areas also observed heavy rainfall. Precipitation peaked at 14\u00a0in (360\u00a0mm) in Boca Raton, while other areas such as Deerfield Beach and Cocoa reported 11.5\u00a0in (290\u00a0mm) and 10\u00a0in (250\u00a0mm) of rainfall, respectively.[1] Waves left 1\u00a0ft (0.30\u00a0m) of water on State Road A1A in Hollywood, resulting in about 1.5\u00a0mi (2.4\u00a0km) of the road being closed.[5] Dozens of homes were flooded in Pompano Beach. Along the beach, nearly 20\u00a0ft (6.1\u00a0m) of sand was lost in one section.[6] State Road A1A was closed from 14th Street northward, while North Federal Highway was shut down between 9th Street and 15th Street.[7] Deerfield Beach generally lost about 3 to 4\u00a0ft (0.91 to 1.22\u00a0m) of its shore due to erosion.[6] Throughout Broward County, about 50% of winter vegetable crops were destroyed due to 6 to 8\u00a0in (150 to 200\u00a0mm) of rainfall in the northern part of the county.[8] Sporadic losses of electricity occurred throughout the county due to falling tree limbs, but most outages were quickly restored.[7] In Boca Raton, 5,000\u00a0homes were left without electricity and 2,500\u00a0homes lost telephone service at the height of the storm.[9] Washouts occurred on two Interstate 95 overpasses.[10] More than 100\u00a0cars were flooded. Floodwaters entered a few businesses along Dixie Highway, while firemen received 21\u00a0calls to pump water out of homes.[9] Damage to city properties ranged from about $10,000\u2013$15,000, while damage throughout the city may have reached approximately $500,000.[10] The storm caused approximately $100,000 in beach erosion damage in Delray Beach.[11] In Lake Worth, 10 to 12\u00a0ft (3.0 to 3.7\u00a0m) waves were observed along the shore, causing erosion south of the municipal pier.[12] Abnormally high tides in West Palm Beach caused a brief closure of Flagler Drive between Monroe Drive and Southern Boulevard. Sporadic power outages were reported in the city due to falling tree limbs.[13] In Palm Beach, minor coastal flooding occurred on South Ocean Boulevard.[12] Throughout Palm Beach County, about 25% of the eggplant crop was destroyed, while about 5%\u201310% of pepper, squash, and tomato plants were lost.[14] At the north end of Jupiter Island, waves severely damaged at least three homes. Many condominiums along Beach Road lost electricity after tree limbs fell on the wires. In Indian River County, some beaches lost several feet of sand. Erosion caused part of a restaurant in Vero Beach to collapse.[11] In Cape Canaveral, the shoreline was mostly protected by more than 7,000 sandbags, which had been filled by 500\u2013600\u00a0volunteers. One house partially collapsed due to erosion.[15] Severe erosion occurred in the vicinity of Ponce de Leon Inlet, with waves reaching the top of the sand dunes and above the seawalls at Daytona Beach Shores. In Port Orange, waves from the Halifax River caused left about 1\u00a0ft (0.30\u00a0m) of standing water on parts of Riverside Drive. The storm produced wind gusts near 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h) in the Daytona Beach area.[16] Throughout Florida, the storm caused at least $600,000 in damage.[10][11] In Georgia, tides 6.4\u00a0ft (2.0\u00a0m) above mean low water and 2.8\u00a0ft (0.85\u00a0m) above normal was reported at Fort Pulaski.[17] Tides in South Carolina ranged from 1 to 2\u00a0ft (0.30 to 0.61\u00a0m) above normal, causing minor erosion.[3] The storm also produced rainfall in eastern North Carolina, with the highest observed total being 5.35 inches (136\u00a0mm) in Cape Hatteras.[18] Additionally, light rainfall was reported on Bermuda, peaking at 1.75 inches (44\u00a0mm).[19]"

        "content": "Tropical Storm Karen was a system that brought record-breaking rainfall and flooding to southeastern Pennsylvania and other Mid-Atlantic states in October 2013. The twelfth tropical cyclone and eleventh named storm of the well below-average 2013 Atlantic hurricane season, Karen originated from a tropical wave that departed from the west coast of Africa on September 16. After passing south of Jamaica and the Cayman Islands, the storm became a tropical cyclone to the northeast of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. The storm peaked shortly afterward, with 1-minute sustained winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h). The storm triggered warnings along the Gulf Coast of the United States, but the storm ultimately degenerated into an open trough in the Gulf of Mexico without making landfall. The remnants of Karen then turned eastward and crossed Florida, before evolving into a nor'easter off the coast of North Carolina, stalling off the Delmarva Peninsula through October 12. The system weakened and drifted back southwestward towards Florida, dissipating off the coast of the state on October 15. The governors of Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi declared state of emergencies ahead of the storm. Mayors of several towns in Louisiana ordered mandatory evacuations. Oil workers on drilling platforms were evacuated ahead of the storm. The storm caused moderate coastal flooding along the Gulf Coast. The remnants of Karen transitioned into a nor\u2019easter, bringing heaving rain from Florida to New Jersey. Karen's remnants dropped a maximum total of 11.27 inches (286\u00a0mm) of rain in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Overall damage was minimal, however, and no deaths were reported."

        "content": "On September 16, a tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa. The wave propagated westward across the Tropical Atlantic Ocean, reaching the western Caribbean Sea on September 27.[1] Around the same time, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) first mentioned the possibility of tropical cyclogenesis in the upcoming days.[2] Around that time, the wave encountered an upper-level trough, generating deep convection over the region. On September 28, a broad area of low pressure formed southeast of Jamaica.[1] The system travelled south of Jamaica and the Cayman Islands through the end of September, producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms.[3] Early on October 1, the convection associated with the wave expanded and concentrated near the center.[4] However, the system remained elongated due to moderate upper-level wind shear.[5] Late on October 2, the disturbance began to quickly organize,[6] though a Hurricane Hunter reconnaissance aircraft did not find a well-defined circulation. The aircraft did, however, indicate the low was producing gale-force winds.[7] Another Hurricane Hunter aircraft investigated the storm early on October 3, finding a closed circulation as well as surface winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) and a pressure of 1004 mbar (29.65 inHg).[8] Based on this information and surface observations, it is estimated that Tropical Storm Karen developed into a tropical cyclone near the northeastern tip of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula at 06:00 UTC on October 3.[1] Despite being affected by more than 25\u00a0mph (40\u00a0km/h) of westerly wind shear, Karen continued to strengthen. The shear caused the bulk of Karen's convection to be displaced northeast of the low-level circulation center (LLCC). However, the NHC anticipated Karen to gradually strengthen into a hurricane, citing a marginally favorable environment with continuous moderate wind shear as an inhibiting factor.[9] The cloud pattern of Karen remained sheared throughout October 3, with the LLCC partially exposed west of the convective mass.[10] Late that day, a Hurricane Hunter aircraft found that Karen had deepened to a pressure of 999\u00a0mbar (29.5\u00a0inHg).[10] At 21:00 UTC on October 3, Karen peaked with winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) and a central minimum pressure of 998\u00a0mbar (29.5\u00a0inHg).[1] Early the next day, Karen began weakening as it succumbed to wind shear above 30\u00a0mph (48\u00a0km/h). The main area of convection was located around 115 miles (185\u00a0km) away from the center, and only sporadic bursts of thunderstorm activity occurred over the LLCC.[11] Karen's center wobbled on October 4 as the coverage of convection over the center fluctuated. The cyclone consistently tracked west of the NHC track cone, due to it being ragged and weak, allowing low-level steering currents to direct it northwestward.[12] Shear and dry air continued to plague the system throughout October 4.[12] A NOAA reconnaissance jet found that wind shear west of the system was stronger than previously analyzed by weather models.[13] The increased shear completely stripped the storm of its convection early on October\u00a05, with NHC forecaster Lixion Avila remarking that the storm had been \"decapitated.\"[14] Karen moved northwestward at inconsistent forward speeds around a low- to mid-level ridge of high pressure.[1] The storm gradually spun down, stalling off the coast of Louisiana late on October\u00a05.[15] At 00:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a06, Karen weakened into a tropical depression,[1][16] as shear from an eastward-moving deep-layer trough finished off the storm. Twelve hours later, the system opened up into a trough off the coast of Louisiana. Karen was one of only a few tropical cyclones to lose tropical characteristics in the Gulf of Mexico without making landfall since the beginning of reconnaissance flights in 1943.[1] Subsequently, the remnants of Karen turned eastward and interacted with a cold front on October 7, transitioning into an extratropical cyclone soon afterward. The cyclone crossed Florida later that day, entering the Western Atlantic Ocean. The extratropical remnant then became elongated off the coast of The Carolinas and turned northeastward, becoming better-defined and consolidating into a nor'easter on October 9. For the next few days, Karen's remnant made a counterclockwise loop over the coast of North Carolina,[17] reaching an extratropical peak of 1,005 millibars (29.7\u00a0inHg) on October 10,[18] before making another counterclockwise loop off the coast of the Delmarva Peninsula.[17][19] The nor'easter then turned southward on October 12, after completing its second loop. Afterward, the system drifted southwestward back towards Florida for the next few days, closing off a long, clockwise loop in its track. Karen's remnants eventually dissipated on October 15, just off the coast of Florida.[17]"

An experimental alert system was devised after the catastrophic impact of Hurricanes Ingrid and Manuel, being put to the test during Karen's passage. PEMEX, an oil drilling company owned by the government, was alerted to Karen's strong winds and high waves. In Quintana Roo, authorities ordered residents to remove trash from streets and to clear debris, in the event that the objects blocked sewers during a flood. Schools were also closed in the province. The Mexican Navy was ordered to patrol the waters near Holbox Island.[20] In addition, citizens were encouraged by Comisi\u00f3n Nacional del Agua (Conagua), the Mexican National Weather Service, to exercise extreme precautions and to continue listening to civil protection calls. Sea vessels were advised by the agency to exercise caution in waters near the north and coast of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, due to the high swells. The tropical storm generated high waves and moderate to heavy rains in Yucat\u00e1n and Quintana Roo, in addition to precipitation in Veracruz, Tabasco, and Campeche.[21] Strong winds from Karen alleviated a red mite infestation in Tabasco and Campeche, carrying the parasite off crops.[22]"

At Grand Isle, tar balls from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010 were washed ashore.[27] In Texas, the storm brought minor coastal flooding to Brazoria County. A road was flooded from wave runup in Surfside Beach. Bryan Beach was closed due to high waves.[28][29] On October 2, a trough extending from Karen caused a strong thunderstorm with gale-force winds in Key West. Key West International Airport reported winds of 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h). The remnants of Karen and a cold front caused a strong thunderstorm in Marion County, Florida on October 7. Winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) damaged trees, power lines, and a barn roof, causing an estimated $5,000 in damage.[30] In relation to the thunderstorm, a weather spotter reported that 1.57\u00a0in (40\u00a0mm) of rain had fallen in half an hour.[31] A local radio station reported flooding in areas of Jacksonville Beach.[32] On October 15, the extratropical remnants of Karen was situated offshore of northeast Florida, causing coastal flooding in parts of Jacksonville. Portions of roads were closed due to the tidal flooding of Hogans Creek.[33]"

Harrisburg saw more than 10\u00a0in (250\u00a0mm) of rainfall,[34] setting the record for the wettest October for the city, with 11.27\u00a0in (286\u00a0mm) of rain recorded.[17][35] Flood warnings were issued for Cumberland, Dauphin, Perry, Franklin, and Lebanon Counties.[36] In Dauphin County, where Harrisburg is located, most areas received 5 to 10 inches (130 to 250\u00a0mm) of rain from the storm. Portions of the Pennsylvania Farm Show Complex & Expo Center parking lot were inundated. Parts of Hershey, including Hersheypark, experienced flooding.[37] The animals at ZooAmerica in Hersheypark were evacuated to higher ground.[36] The zoo took additional precautions due to the flooding and closed the park, after an incident two years prior, when Tropical Storm Lee flooded the area, killing two bison.[38] Three people were displaced by flood waters on October 12 in Middletown.[36] Numerous roads were closed in Adams County, mainly in the northern and eastern portions of the county. Two homes collapsed in Oxford and Tyrone townships.[39] Numerous rural roadways were closed in Lancaster County, including Fruitville Pike near Pennsylvania Route 72. The Chickies Creek near Manheim, Pennsylvania overflowed its banks and flooded nearby roads. Minor river flooding also occurred in Lancaster from the Conestoga River.[40] A precautionary evacuation took place at a mobile home trailer park in Hellam Township, due to river flooding associated with Kreutz Creek. A portion of U.S. Route 30 was flooded in West Manchester Township.[41] In Camp Hill, moderate river flooding occurred on the Yellow Breeches Creek, with a crest of 11.4 feet (3.5\u00a0m).[42] In Howe Township, a part of Perry County, a rockslide closed U.S. Route 322 westbound.[43] One water rescue was performed for a stranded motorist in South Londonderry Township on Pennsylvania Route 241.[44] Flooding was reported due to poor drainage systems in Downingtown, where 3.59\u00a0in (91\u00a0mm) of rain fell.[45] Near Philadelphia, the Newtown Square Pennsylvania Railroad Museum rescheduled Newtown Square Railroad Day, originally set for October 12, to October 19.[46] Philadelphia International Airport reported 2.03\u00a0in (52\u00a0mm) of rainfall from the nor'easter.[47] After the storm, the American Red Cross opened a shelter for people affected by flooding in Mechanicsburg.[48] Workers cleared debris from a drain that caused the ramp from Hersheypark Drive to U.S. Route 322 westbound to flood.[49] Residents of Germantown, a suburb of Philadelphia, were furious with the Philadelphia Water Department, due to sewers flooding from heavy rainfall. The residents claimed that the city had promised to fix the sewer problem since 2011, but no work had been done. A spokeswoman from the Water Department explained that the sewers were more than 100 years old and that \"that sort of high intensity rain storm overwhelm our sewer system.\" The city directed residents to the Basement Protection Program, which would help alleviate some of the flooding problems.[50]"

In Ocean County, minor flooding associated with high tides was reported on Long Beach Boulevard in Beach Haven, along with Long Beach Island. Seaside Park and Lacey Township also experienced minor tidal flooding.[51] At Harvey Cedars, wind gusts of at least 30\u00a0mph (48\u00a0km/h) were recorded for a record 79 consecutive hours, beginning at 3:00\u00a0a.m. EDT on October 9 and ending at 10:00\u00a0a.m. EDT on October 12.[52] In Atlantic County, the Black Horse Pike was down to just one lane on October 8 because of coastal flooding. Some side streets in Atlantic City were flooded with water up to one foot (0.30\u00a0m) in height. In Stone Harbor, where the Army Corps of Engineers finished a major beach restoration project a few months prior to the storm, heavy wave action carved out cliffs along the beach.[53] Some of the severest coastal flooding happened in Cape May County, where the National Weather Service issued a Coastal Flood Warning, citing property damage.[54] Tidal flooding inundated roads in Strathmere. Several streets and parking lots off of New Jersey Route 47 were submerged by 2 to 3 feet (0.61 to 0.91\u00a0m) of floodwaters in Wildwood.[55] In Ocean City, in Cape May County, a foot (0.3\u00a0m) of floodwaters entered garages along 10th Street.[54] Cape May County also recorded the highest rainfall amounts in the state, with 3.74\u00a0in (95\u00a0mm) in Middle Township and 3.54\u00a0in (90\u00a0mm) in Cape May.[52] Sea Isle City's Italian Festival and Columbus Day Parade on October 12 were postponed to October 26. Nearby, the West Cape May Christmas Parade Fundraiser and the Avalon Seafood Festival were postponed. The Lima Bean Festival was delayed until October 13.[46] The Cape May Wine Festival was delayed one day to October\u00a013.[56] Total damage in New Jersey was minimal, estimated at $5,000\u00a0(2013\u00a0USD).[51][55] In neighboring Delaware, similar coastal flooding and strong wind gusts affected coastal parts of all three counties. The Delaware State University cancelled some outdoor activities scheduled for the October 11 and 12. In Sussex County, Long Neck, and the surrounding areas experienced tidal flooding. Roadway tidal flooding occurred in and around Angola and Oak Orchard. Strong waves pushed water over bulkheads.[57] In Milton, minor tidal flooding closed Prime Hook Road for several days. The Delaware Department of Transportation helped residents living along the road reach or exit their homes.[58] The high tides reached the support pilings of homes at Primehook Beach. Delaware Route 16 was also flooded, and the Delaware Department of Transportation recommended evacuation. In Kent County, minor tidal flooding affected Bowers Beach, where a dune breach occurred. A parking lot was also flooded. Scattered street flooding and street closings occurred along Delaware Bay, between Dover and Milford. Delaware State University cancelled some outdoor activities scheduled for October 11 and 12. In New Castle County, the strong winds caused wave action to lap over a sea wall in Bay View Beach, south of Port Penn. While minor tidal flooding occurred during the daytime high tide cycles from October 9 through 13, in Kent and Sussex Counties, the highest tides occurred during the daytime high tide cycle on October 10. The high tide at Lewes reached 6.77 feet (2.06\u00a0m) above mean lower low water levels. Minor tidal flooding started at 6.0 feet (1.8\u00a0m) above mean lower low water levels. This also coincided with the strongest winds affecting the area, as most of the peak wind gusts occurred during the first half of the day on October 10. Peak gusts were all located in Sussex County: 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) at Dewey Beach, 49\u00a0mph (79\u00a0km/h) in Lewes, and 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h) in Indian River. The strong winds blew sand into the left lane of northbound Delaware Route 1, near the Indian River Inlet Bridge.[59] The runoff from the heavy rain that fell caused minor flooding along the Red Clay Creek Basin on October 11. The creek at Stanton was above 15\u00a0ft (4.6\u00a0m) flood stage on that day. Poor drainage led to flooding in Newark and Middletown. A peak rainfall amount of 2.9\u00a0in (74\u00a0mm) was recorded in Blackbird, with 1.98\u00a0in (50\u00a0mm) recorded in Newark and 1.5\u00a0in (38\u00a0mm) recorded at the New Castle Airport.[60]"

Long swells started moving into the Gulf of St. Lawrence from the southeast, as the wind began to pick up out of the same quarter. The wind backed to the northeast that evening, increasing to gale force. Surface pressures across the region begin to fall rapidly, with one barometer on Nova Scotia falling to 31\u00a0hPa or mb/nearly 1\u00a0inch within 23\u00a0hours. The gales continued for nearly two days, according to one of the sea captain's logs from the area.

Ships at anchor either sank at anchor or were capsized by other ships ramming them during the cyclone. Most of the American fishing fleet fell victim to the storm. At least 74 ships and 150 lives were lost.[3] Today, the tombs of the Yankee Gale victims can still be found in the cemetery near the Cape Tryon lighthouse.[4]"

It began to rain heavily, peaking between 3:00 AM and 5:30 AM.[4] During the storm's peak, visibility was only 500 metres (1,600\u00a0ft).[4] In total, the storm dumped between 160 and 190\u00a0mm (6.3 and 7.5\u00a0in) of rain on Buenos Aires, the heaviest April rainfall on record.[4] Buenos Aires city typically averages 96\u00a0mm (3.8\u00a0in) of rain for the entire month of April.[5] In nearby La Plata, the capital city of Buenos Aires Province, approximately 400\u00a0mm (16\u00a0in) of rain fell over a two-hour time span on Tuesday evening.[6] The heavy rainfall led to flash floods and widespread power outages. In Greater La Plata, an estimated 3,000 people were evacuated, many after waiting hours for rescue in trees and on roof tops of flooded homes.[7][8] Half of the city lost power and vast portions were underwater.[5][6] TV footage of the disaster showed people wading through waist-deep water and cars almost completely underwater.[5] The city's oil refinery caught fire due to \"an extraordinary accumulation of rainwater and power outages\" and was shut down.[7] Flood waters encircled the La Plata suburb of Tolosa, rendering 50 vehicles immobile.[6] Santiago Martorelli, cabinet chief of La Plata partido (department), called the storm \"a catastrophe without precedent.\"[8] In Buenos Aires, more than a quarter of a million people were without power by Wednesday.[5] Key transportation routes were submerged, and mass transit services disabled.[4] A local reporter described the situation in Buenos Aires: \"A record torrential rainstorm unleashed all its might\u00a0... turning the city into a macabre version of Venice rather than the dry capital of Argentina.\"[4] Rain continued to fall throughout the region on 3 April, making the situation very bad.[4]"

Local charities sought donations of food, water, diapers and mattresses.[5] Hepatitis shots were available at evacuation centers, and four mobile hospitals were set up to treat victims and distribute food and water.[11] At that time, at least 51 people were known to have died in Greater La Plata, and six deaths had been reported in Buenos Aires.[5][15] Two additional deaths were reported in Greater Buenos Aires.[4] Many victims died by drowning, while others were electrocuted by downed power lines (including a Metro worker who was electrocuted in Los Incas station).[7][12] Many deaths in La Plata were not discovered until after the flood waters started to recede. \"The bodies began to appear as the water subsided,\" said the Governor of Buenos Aires Province, Daniel Scioli.[6] Numerous families lost all their possessions in the floods, while shopkeepers reported losses of their merchandise.[5] Business losses were estimated at 530.6 million pesos (US$104 million).[16] Schools and government offices were closed across La Plata.[6] As of 4 April, there were reportedly still 20 people missing and 1,200 evacuated in La Plata.[17] More than two months later, it was officially reported that 78 was the number of deaths in Greater La Plata.[1] Politicians were quick to blame one another for the disaster. The Minister of Federal Planning and Public Utilities, Julio de Vido, claimed that Buenos Aires city officials knew that the rains were coming and had failed to prepare for them.[5] Macri, a vocal opponent of President Kirchner, accused the national government of preventing the city from getting World Bank loans to finance infrastructure improvements. According to official data, the government of the City of Buenos Aires Mauricio Macri had not implemented any development works in stormwater infrastructure, while related works Brook Maldonado, had only 14 percent of budget execution.[18][5][4] Residents of Barrio Mitre blamed the drainage system of a large shopping mall built nearby in 2009 for the heavy damage in their area.[19] On Wednesday afternoon and on Thursday morning, Kirchner met with Scioli to coordinate the rescue and emergency efforts in Greater La Plata.[15] Fear remained high as reports of looting and clashes with police officers spread.[11] The Argentine army mounted an industrial kitchen and ten field kitchens to prepare hot meals 8,000 and 1,500 cold rations per day.[20] Three days of national mourning were declared on 3 April.[8] On 5 April, Kirchner announced government benefits for the victims, including doubled pensions for some 70,000 elderly people and for an estimated 16,000 families receiving five other social subsidies, free replacement ID cards, new car licenses, and low-cost housing loans.[21]"

        "content": "Tropical Storm Danielle was a strong tropical storm that made landfall on Virginia in the 1992 Atlantic hurricane season. The fourth storm of the season, Danielle was one of two tropical cyclones in the year to make landfall in the United States, the other being Hurricane Andrew. It formed out of a stationary trough of low pressure on September 18 near the coast of North Carolina. The system quickly reached tropical storm status, and Danielle looped to the west due to a change in steering currents. Tropical Storm Danielle reached a peak of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) winds before weakening and hitting the Delmarva Peninsula. The storm quickly dissipated over land. The storm dropped light rainfall throughout its path, and winds were minimal. The combination of Danielle and a high pressure system produced higher than normal tides and strong waves, causing beach erosion and light coastal damage. The waves killed two in New Jersey from a boat sinking, and also destroyed three houses in the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Overall damage from the storm was minimal."

On the same day, a weak tropical wave which moved off the coast of Africa on September 8 approached the area. A cold front merged with the stationary area of disturbed weather on September 20, and on September 22 a circulation developed 200 miles (320\u00a0km) southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina.[1] Organization continued as outflow became better defined, and the system developed into Tropical Depression Six later that day.[2] The depression rapidly organized and attained tropical storm status with winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) just six hours after forming, upon which it was named Danielle. In response to an approaching trough, Danielle initially moved to the northeast. However, the trough outran the system, and a developing high pressure system to its north resulted in Danielle executing a tight, anticyclonic loop on September 23 to the 24th. The storm strengthened as it turned to the northwest, and reached a peak of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) winds on September 25 while just off the northeastern coast of North Carolina. Danielle turned to the north-northwest, and made landfall on the Eastern Shore of Virginia late on the 25th. It rapidly weakened over land, and dissipated over eastern Pennsylvania on September 26.[1]"

After Danielle executed its loop, forecasters consistently predicted a landfall along the northeastern North Carolina coastline.[3] As a result, officials issued Tropical Storm Warnings for the coast of North Carolina on September 24, 36\u00a0hours before the storm passed to the east of the state. The continued northward motion caught forecasters off guard, and consequentially tropical storm warnings were not issued for the Delmarva Peninsula until just 12\u00a0hours before the storm made landfall. In addition, forecasters issued tropical storm warnings from Delaware through Watch Hill, Rhode Island, as a precaution.[4] In North Carolina, ferry operations between Ocracoke and the mainland at Hyde County were closed, while officials canceled schools in Dare County, North Carolina due to the approaching storm.[5] Several families voluntarily evacuated St. George's Island in southern St. Mary's County, Maryland.[6] In addition, officials in Delaware recommended evacuations for low-level areas and beaches. As a precaution, officials set up two shelters in Kent County.[7]"

The pressure gradient also produced higher than normal waves along the coastline, with a maximum of 20 feet (6.1\u00a0m) at Duck.[8] Despite passing close to the coastline, Danielle dropped only light rainfall, totaling to 0.2 inches (5.1\u00a0mm) at Cape Hatteras.[9] However, locations in the central portion of the state experienced over 1 inch (25\u00a0mm) of rainfall.[10] Waves and high tides from the storm caused flooding along the Pamlico Sound side of Ocracoke and southern Hatteras Island. High tides also resulted in overwash in Pea Island, forcing the closure of Highway 12 due to 12 inches (300\u00a0mm) of salt water. High tides from the storm also destroyed two houses in South Nags Head and one in Rodanthe, two of which were previously condemned after the 1991 Perfect Storm. Three other houses in the Outer Banks were threatened by the storm.[9] Elsewhere in the Outer Banks, damage was minimal, and was limited to pedestrian ramps and steps to the beachfront.[5]"

The waves caused significant overwash, leaving parts of Norfolk under 2 feet (0.61\u00a0m) of water. Several homes, businesses, and cars were flooded, as well. The waves also eroded beaches along the coast.[13] Overall, damage was minimal, and there were no reports of deaths or injuries.[11] Upon making landfall Danielle produced an estimated storm tide of 2 to 3 feet (0.61 to 0.91\u00a0m) in Ocean City, Maryland. Wind gusts peaked at 53\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h), also in Ocean City.[6] The storm produced moderate rainfall of over 3 inches (76\u00a0mm) across the Eastern Shore of Maryland,[10] while interior amounts experienced slightly lesser amounts of up to 2.79 inches (71\u00a0mm) in Pasadena. Waves from the storm caused minor to moderate beach erosion along the coastline, and the combination of waves and high tides caused moderate street flooding. Near Salisbury, the storm produced a possible hook echo, though no tornadoes were reported. Danielle caused no deaths or injuries in the state.[6] In Delaware, the storm dropped light precipitation, with a maximum amount of 3.75 inches (95\u00a0mm) in Smyrna. Wind gusts peaked at 66\u00a0mph (106\u00a0km/h) at Cape Henlopen.[12] Danielle caused 2 to 3-foot (.6 to .9-m) higher than normal tides, along with strong waves. The combination of the two flooded some coastal houses[7] and resulted in significant beach and dune erosion. The waves also sank four boats and washed away a dock near Slaughter Beach.[14] Gusty winds caused power outages in New Castle County, while persistent rainfall caused sewer interruptions.

Subsequently, the low moved over northern Germany on 17\u00a0February, last being noted the following day. Being on the leeward side of the Pennines in the prevailing wind direction, Sheffield is usually relatively protected from the effects of high wind events which may have more serious impacts on surrounding areas. However, on this occasion, the winds were funnelled through the valleys of the River Don, River Sheaf and other rivers down into the centre of the city, creating higher wind speeds than seen elsewhere in the country inland and at similar altitudes.[2][3] The cause of this funnelling effect was a temperature inversion, which meant that high winds generated over the higher ground to the west of the city were unable to escape the surface layer, instead effectively \"bouncing\" off the underside of the inversion layer and being funnelled down into the lower levels of the city.[4] This also gave the winds a variation variable, gusty and turbulent nature, increasing damage further.[4]"

The return period for such an intense storm hitting Sheffield is estimated at once every 150 years.[4] Damage across the city was extensive, totalling more than \u00a35 million (equivalent to more than \u00a3115 million in 2021). Four people were killed and more than 400 people were injured by flying debris and collapsing buildings.[3] A floodlight pylon at Bramall Lane football and cricket stadium collapsed onto the field, as did perimeter walls at the Shoreham Street end of the ground.[5][6] Near Heeley railway station, a full train travelling to Sheffield from London narrowly avoided striking debris on the tracks.[6] The most widespread damage occurred to pre-fabricated homes on housing estates on the edges of the city,[5] many of which had been hastily constructed to replace houses destroyed in the Sheffield Blitz during the Second World War and, as a result, were not built to a high standard. In Arbourthorne in the south of the city, whole streets of prefabricated homes were flattened.[5] Older properties that had survived the Blitz suffered considerable damage as well, mainly in the form of fallen chimneys and collapsed roofs; all of the deaths recorded in Sheffield were as a result of falling chimneys, either into the property as people sheltered inside or onto the streets outside.[5] A tower crane on the construction site for the new city centre buildings of the Sheffield College of Technology, now Sheffield Hallam University, collapsed, crashing into the side of the under construction high rises and causing serious damage.[5]"

Seven storms became hurricanes, of which one became a major hurricane. In addition, the season was unusual in the fact that no storms moved across large portions of the Caribbean Sea.[1] Seven storms, including three hurricanes, struck the United States. The season's activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 100\u00a0units,[2] slightly higher than the 1931\u20131943 average of 91.2.[3] ACE is a metric used to express the energy used by a tropical cyclone during its lifetime. Therefore, a storm with a longer duration will have high values of ACE. It is only calculated at six-hour increments in which specific tropical and subtropical systems are either at or above sustained wind speeds of 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h), which is the threshold for tropical storm intensity. Thus, tropical depressions are not included here.[2]"

It slowly weakened as it approached the East Coast of the United States. Late on September 18, the hurricane passed within 45\u00a0mi (70\u00a0km) of the Outer Banks before it accelerated and turned to the northeast. It remained close to the Mid-Atlantic and New England coastline, and passed near Nantucket before turning to the east-northeast. The hurricane remained south of Atlantic Canada by a short distance, and became extratropical on September 19 while located about 50\u00a0mi (80\u00a0km) east of Nantucket. The extratropical storm decelerated as it turned northeastward, and the system dissipated on September 25.[1][9] Early on September 17, Weather Bureau offices began issuing storm warnings from Beaufort, North Carolina, to the Virginia capes.[1] In North Carolina, the hurricane produced winds of up to 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) in Manteo. Described as one of the worst hurricanes in record in Hatteras, the storm resulted in $25,000 in damage (1936\u00a0USD) to roads and bridges and $30,000 in damage (1936\u00a0USD) to buildings and piers. Very high tides were reported along the Outer Banks, with Nags Head losing about 35\u00a0ft (11\u00a0m) of beach. The hurricane destroyed the highway bridge along the Currituck Sound, and resulted in heavy crop damage in northeastern North Carolina.[11] The hurricane was also considered among the worst hurricanes on record in the Norfolk, Virginia, area. Winds of up to 84\u00a0mph (135\u00a0km/h) at Cape Henry destroyed windows, roofs, and some entire buildings, resulting in around $500,000 in damage (1936\u00a0USD). The hurricane produced a storm tide of 9.3\u00a0ft (2.8\u00a0m) in Sewell's Point, Virginia, the second highest on record at that location. Two locations along the James River experienced record crest levels of over 20\u00a0ft (6.1\u00a0m). Rough seas washed several boats ashore, and shipping was cancelled in and out of Norfolk. The hurricane resulted in cancelled train service and increased traffic.[12][13] The hurricane was indirectly responsible for two casualties. The first fatality occurred when debris from the hurricane struck a person in the head and later died. Another person drowned in the Elizabeth River in an effort to recover a rowboat blown adrift.[1] Though hurricane warnings were posted for the northeast United States and hurricane-force winds occurred there, damage, if any, is unknown.[14] Extensive property damage was reported in Nova Scotia. Up to 7\u00a0in (180\u00a0mm) of precipitation washed out a number of bridges, roads, and railroad tracks, causing two train derailments. Dozens of cars stalled, while slick roads resulted in several vehicular accidents. Crops also suffered significant damage, with thousands of dollars in losses to grain alone in Annapolis Valley. One person drowned in Antigonish while swimming in a lake that swelled to about twice its normal size. In Newfoundland, rough seas capsized a few boats, causing two deaths, while two fishing stages were also destroyed. Overall, the extratropical remnants of this hurricane caused five fatalities in Atlantic Canada.[15]"

Breaches along the coast and the rivers Elbe and Weser led to widespread flooding of huge areas. In Hamburg, on the river Elbe, but a full 100\u00a0km away from the coast, the residential areas of Wilhelmsburg were the most affected. On Thursday 15 February, German authorities published the first storm warning for the North Sea with wind speeds up to 9 Beaufort.\nA severe storm warning followed the next day, with a predicted gauge of 3\u00a0metres above normal, which was a level the dykes could withstand."

At this time of the day, most city offices were closed, which slowed the notification of the population. Civil protection plans were not implemented yet. Due to telephone landline breakdowns, warnings could not be forwarded from coastal to inland emergency offices. Breakdowns in alarm siren lines and electricity lines severely affected the warning system. Radio amateurs had to establish emergency operations to support emergency services as a means of communication. Around midnight, the peaks were too high for some dykes to withstand. The backs of the dykes were not fortified, so the first overtopping waters destroyed the dykes from behind and cleared the way for the flood. Helmut Schmidt, then police senator of Hamburg, coordinated the rescue operations, and requested emergency help from countries throughout western Europe. He also called for elements of the new formed Bundeswehr to assist with the emergency, especially engineers. That meant overstepping his legal authority, ignoring the German constitution's prohibition on using the army for \"internal affairs\"\u2014a clause excluding disasters was not added until 1968. He also secured the assistance of helicopters from other NATO states.[5] 120 square kilometres or a sixth of the city of Hamburg were flooded, destroying 6,000 buildings.

        "content": " Between May and June\u00a02019, an extended sequence of heavy rainfall events over the South Central United States caused historic flooding along the Arkansas River and its tributaries. Major and record river flooding occurred primarily in northeastern Oklahoma, and the elevated flows continued downstream into Arkansas where they caused additional inundation. Antecedent soil moisture levels and water levels in lakes and streams were already high from previous rains, priming the region for significant runoff and flooding. The prolonged combination of high atmospheric moisture and a sustained weather pattern extending across the continental United States led to frequent high-yield rainfall over the Arkansas River watershed. The overarching weather pattern allowed moisture levels to quickly rebound after each sequential rainfall episode. With soils already saturated, the excess precipitation became surface runoff and flowed into the already elevated lakes and streams. Most rainfall occurred in connection with a series of repeated thunderstorms between May\u00a019\u201321, which was then followed by additional rains that kept streams within flood stage. Flooding in the Arkansas River basin caused an estimated $3\u00a0billion in damage and killed five people. The initial episode of torrential rainfall prompted the issuance of two flash flood emergencies for several counties in eastern Oklahoma on May\u00a020, with numerous water rescues occurring during the event. Several reservoirs in eastern Oklahoma filled over capacity and reached record levels, requiring large releases of water to alleviate the dangerously high storage of water. Repeated rains continued to keep the reservoirs filled, necessitating further releases of water. The prolonged release of reservoir water combined with surface runoff to cause near-record to record flooding along the Arkansas River. Parts of the Tulsa metropolitan area and entire towns near swollen rivers were inundated. In some locations the Arkansas River backed upstream into its tributaries, causing major flooding. The bulge of elevated water levels that began in Oklahoma flowed downstream into Arkansas by May\u00a023, breaching three levees along the Arkansas River and inundating numerous buildings. In Van Buren, the flood was assessed by the United States Geological Survey as a 1 in 200 year flood event.[note 2] Federal major disaster declarations and statewide states of emergencies were declared for Oklahoma and Arkansas."

During the latter half of May\u00a02019, an active weather pattern became established over the United States, characterized by the juxtaposition of pronounced trough over the western half of the country and ridging over the southern and southeastern United States.[4] This configuration was favorable for frequent rainfalls over the Southern Plains,[4] placing the jet stream in a position to draw the warm and moist air mass atop the Gulf of Mexico northward.[1]:\u200a4\u200a Atmospheric moisture was also atypically high during this period, with precipitable water content persisting between 1.5\u20132\u00a0in (38\u201351\u00a0mm), thereby increasing the precipitation potential of each individual shower and thunderstorm.[5][4] The first rains associated with the flood occurred on May\u00a018, when a squall line moved across eastern Oklahoma and western Arkansas. Additional showers immediately preceding and succeeding the squall enhanced rainfall totals.[5]:\u200a23 Between May\u00a020\u201321, another storm system moved from the Rocky Mountains into Oklahoma. A warm front associated with the complex moved across the state during the daytime on May\u00a020, followed by a cold front that swept eastwards across the state between the evening of May\u00a020 into the following morning. This produced several episodes of severe thunderstorms enhanced by the confluence of the moist, warm, and unstable airmass ahead of the storm system.[6] Initially isolated thunderstorms over eastern Oklahoma coalesced into a line, with new storm cells training repeatedly tracking over the same locations as the line slowly moved east. The complex combined with another cluster of storms over central Oklahoma and tracked northeast, causing further rainfall before dissipating. Another squall line was generated by the storm system as the associated upper-level low moved into Kansas, sweeping through eastern Oklahoma and northwestern Arkansas on the morning of May\u00a021 with its heaviest rains overlapping the same areas affected by the earlier storms.[5]:\u200a23\u200a Most of the rainfall associated with the flood event occurred during a 36-hour period between May\u00a019\u201321 in a region spanning from northeastern Oklahoma to northwestern Arkansas.[1]:\u200a1\u200a  Lesser rainfall events followed the primary rainfall event, keeping rivers in flood stage into June\u00a02019.[1]:\u200a4\u200a On May\u00a022, the approach of an upper-level trough allowed moisture levels to quickly rebound in the wake of the previous day's storms. Several thunderstorms rapidly organized along Interstate 44 in Oklahoma during the late afternoon and moved towards the east-northeast. A surge of warm air and strengthening low-level winds during the nighttime hours instigated additional storm formation over the same areas.[5]:\u200a24 Two rounds of showers and thunderstorms affected eastern Oklahoma and the Ozarks between May\u00a024\u201325, reaping a moist atmosphere characterized by precipitable water levels at least two standard deviations above normal over north-central Oklahoma and south-central Kansas. Widespread 1.5\u20134\u00a0in (38\u2013102\u00a0mm) rainfalls occurred across the upper Arkansas River basin.[5]:\u200a30\u200a The dominant trough over the western United States persisted, maintaining a southwesterly wind across the Southern Plains along which storms would travel. In the pre-dawn hours of May\u00a026, a bow echo tracked across Oklahoma into Kansas, primarily affecting areas north of Interstate 40 and the Tulsa metropolitan area with severe weather and 1\u20133\u00a0in (25\u201376\u00a0mm) of rainfall. Two more periods of rainfall occurred on May\u00a026, producing 0.5\u20133\u00a0in (13\u201376\u00a0mm) of rainfall along the Kansas\u2013Oklahoma border.[5]:\u200a31\u200a More rain fell ahead of a slow-moving cold front between May\u00a028\u201330 over Oklahoma and Arkansas, with localized totals of 2\u20134\u00a0in (51\u2013102\u00a0mm); this event was concentrated further southeast of the earlier rains, primarily affecting southeastern and east-central Oklahoma and northwestern Arkansas.[5]:\u200a34"

The National Weather Service cataloged 31\u00a0river flood events at 22\u00a0river forecast points in eastern Oklahoma. Two of these instances were at record flood stage, including the Arkansas River near Ponca City; 25 of the 31\u00a0flood events were classified as major floods. Several river gauges recorded flooding conditions lasting for more than a week; the longest flood was documented along the Arkansas River near Muskogee, which remained above flood stage for 22\u00a0days and 5\u00a0hours.[4] Numerous state and U.S. highways were closed by the Oklahoma Department of Transportation at various points due to flooding.[9] Over a thousand homes were affected by flooding associated with the Arkansas River.[10] Throughout the state, 4\u00a0people were killed and 87\u00a0others were injured.[11][4][12][13] Prior to the primary flood event, water levels along the Arkansas River at Muskogee had remained just below flood stage. The first round of rainfall on May\u00a018 produced widespread totals of 0.5\u20131\u00a0in (13\u201325\u00a0mm) across eastern Oklahoma and western Arkansas, raising the Arkansas River into flood stage.[5]:\u200a23\u200a With the threat of flood and a tornado outbreak looming, many events scheduled for the evening of May\u00a020 were cancelled or rescheduled.[5]:\u200a24\u200a That evening, heavy and persistent rainfall from a slow-moving line of thunderstorms caused widespread flash flooding primarily along a line from Bristow to Miami and areas northwest, submerging roadways and leading to several evacuations and water rescues. At 11:14\u00a0p.m. CDT on May\u00a020, National Weather Service Tulsa issued a flash flood emergency for southern Osage, Pawnee, northwestern Tulsa County, Oklahoma, and Washington counties. Another flash flood emergency was issued 30\u00a0minutes later for western Mayes, southeastern Osage, Rogers, northern Wagoner, and Tulsa counties.[5]:\u200a23 By 7\u00a0a.m. CDT on May\u00a021 between 4\u20138\u00a0in (100\u2013200\u00a0mm) had fallen across north-central and northeastern Oklahoma. A station in Pawnee recorded the highest 24-hour total with 9.52\u00a0in (242\u00a0mm).[5]:\u200a24\u200a More than 6\u00a0in (150\u00a0mm) of rain fell in a 24-hour period of May\u00a021 over parts of Tulsa and Stillwater.[1]:\u200a4\u200a Atop saturated soils, the rainfall became surface runoff which flowed into streams and the United States Army Corps of Engineers's flood control pools. Flooding affected the watersheds of the upper Arkansas, Neosho, and Verdigris rivers, which all reach a confluence in Muskogee.[5]:\u200a24\u200a The submarine USS Batfish (SS-310) at the Muskogee War Memorial Park briefly took on water due to the swollen Arkansas River.[14] Flash flooding and broader areal flooding caused Bird Creek to inundate areas around Skiatook. Near Avant, the creek rose 30.5\u00a0ft (9.3\u00a0m) in 12\u00a0hours, cresting at 36.52\u00a0ft (11.13\u00a0m) on the morning of May\u00a021. Water releases were necessary to relieve dangerously high lake levels in the absence of surcharge capacity, worsening flooding downstream of Pensacola Dam and Kerr Dam.[5]:\u200a24\u200a Residents were forced to evacuate Webbers Falls on May\u00a022 as the flooded river began to overtake homes.[15] A voluntary evacuation was declared for residents of Broken Arrow living within the 100-year floodplain near the Arkansas River.[16] Flash flooding following 6\u00a0in (150\u00a0mm) of rain in El Reno led to six water rescues.[17] The water levels in Kaw, Keystone, and Oologah lakes began to exceed their flood control limits after the May\u00a022\u201323 rainfall. Kaw Lake's depth reached 112.16% of its flood pool capacity on May\u00a024, causing the associated surcharge pool to completely fill; similar circumstances were present at Keystone and Ooologah lakes, prompting releases of the excess water downstream.[5]:\u200a25\u200a Releases at the Keystone Dam into the Arkansas River reached flow rates more than double the flow rates at Niagara Falls.[15] The Keystone Dam water release was its second largest on record and contributed to the Arkansas River reaching major flood stage in Tulsa during the afternoon of May\u00a023.[5]:\u200a25\u200a Tulsa city officials recommended that people living west of Downtown Tulsa evacuate in acknowledgement of the old age of the levees protecting the city from the swollen Arkansas River. The town of Braggs, approximately 55\u00a0mi (89\u00a0km) southeast of Tulsa, lost power and was fully enveloped by floodwaters.[11] Widespread flooding occurred across numerous streams as the May\u00a022\u201323 rains further exacerbated the elevated river stages from the earlier extreme rainfall event. The entire stretch of the Arkansas River within the warning region of National Weather Service Tulsa\u2014spanning 396\u00a0mi (637\u00a0km)\u2013experienced a major flood. All barge traffic along the McClellan\u2013Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System was suspended on May\u00a022. Two unoccupied barges tethered together broke free from their moorings at the Port of Muskogee that evening, haphazardly floating downstream. They were briefly obstructed by rocks before continuing downstream as the river rose, eventually colliding with the lock and dam system at Webbers Falls Lake and capsizing at around noon on May\u00a023.[5]:\u200a25\u200a All residents in Moffett along the Arkansas River were ordered to evacuate on May\u00a024.[18] The Neosho River crested at 25.5\u00a0ft (7.8\u00a0m) in Miami on May\u00a024. Southern parts of the city were submerged, with some roads under 4\u00a0ft (1.2\u00a0m) underwater. Thirty water rescues took place in Miami during the floods.[19] By May\u00a025, the excess surface runoff flowing into the Arkansas River caused the river to begin piling water upstream into its tributaries. The Poteau River flooded in this manner near Panama and rises were documented upstream to Lake Wister. Lake Hudson reached a record height on May\u00a024 despite concurrent water releases at Kerr Dam. Fort Gibson Lake crested a day later while excess water was being released via Fort Gibson Dam.[5]:\u200a30\u200a Widespread runoff from the May\u00a026 caused Keystone Lake to rise further, reaching a record elevation of 757.19\u00a0ft (230.79\u00a0m) two days later. A second water release from the dam took place on May\u00a029, causing a 23.41\u00a0ft (7.14\u00a0m)-crest on the Arkansas River in Tulsa; this was the river's second highest crest in the city on record.[1]:\u200a1\u200a A neighborhood on the western side of Sand Springs were flooded by both water releases from Keystone Lake.[20] Homes in southern Tulsa and Bixby were also inundated. Two people drowned in Tulsa on May\u00a026 to the floodwaters along the Arkansas River.[4] Other locations along the Arkansas River downstream also set records or near-records for river heights. In addition to Keystone, six other lakes crested between May\u00a025\u201327, with three setting new pools of record. Releases from Oologah Lake caused major flooding along the Verdigris River near Claremore.[5]:\u200a31\u200a Saturated soils and high river levels quickened the development of flash flooding, leading to the issuance of a flash flood emergency for northwestern Muskogee, central Okfuskee, and Okmulgee counties on May\u00a029 following another round of heavy rainfall. Although some lakes and streams had begun to recede, the new rains caused water levels to rise once more along the Arkansas River and Poteau River. Birch Lake exceeded its flood control pool for a second time while Lake Eufaula did so for its first time, requiring another water release into the Arkansas River.[5]:\u200a35 Governor of Oklahoma Kevin Stitt declared a state of emergency for all 77\u00a0counties on May\u00a024, augmenting an earlier state of emergency that had been in place for 52\u00a0counties since the beginning of the month. U.S. President Donald Trump approved a Major Disaster Declaration for Oklahoma on June\u00a01 with an incident period from May\u00a07\u2013June\u00a09.[21] United States National Guard helicopters dropped 4,000\u00a0lb (1,800\u00a0kg) sandbags to reinforce strained levees.[22] The City of Tulsa began allowing flood-stricken evacuees back to their homes on June\u00a01, following over a week of displacement.[23]"

The flooding was considered a 1 in 200 year event near Van Buren, Arkansas, where the river reached a peak streamflow of 570,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s (16,000\u00a0m3/s).[1]:\u200a7\u200a The river at Van Buren reached 40.79\u00a0in (1.036\u00a0m), topping the previous record of 38.1\u00a0ft (11.6\u00a0m).[18] Water from the Arkansas River backed upstream into Lee Creek, causing major flooding.[5]:\u200a25\u200a At Dardanelle, the flooding reached magnitudes with return periods exceeding 200\u00a0years.[1]:\u200a7\u200a At least three levees were breached along the Arkansas River between Fort Smith and Little Rock, with another five sustaining substantial damage.[1]:\u200a1\u200a The breach of a 40\u00a0ft (12\u00a0m)-section of levee near Dardanelle in Yell County prompted evacuations, threatening 300\u2013400\u00a0homes and 5,700\u00a0people.[15][27] While the homes were ultimately not affected, the flooding significantly impacted adjacent farmland. Arkansas Highway 155 sustained major damage. Other highways were also flooded, including Arkansas Highway 22, where one person died on May\u00a028 after circumnavigating a flood barricade. Highway\u00a022 remained closed until June\u00a04, three days after the Arkansas River initially crested.[15] Parks, homes, and businesses in Fort Smith were overtaken by the river, leaving parts of the city accessible only by boat.[18][22] In total, 500\u00a0homes in Fort Smith were affected.[18] Evacuations occurred in Faulkner County due to the rise of Lake Conway and the potential breach of the Lollie Levee. The lake flooded shoreline homes while the Lollie Levee maintained integrity.[15] Mandatory evacuations were also ordered in parts of Jefferson County.[27]  On May\u00a028, a partition of levee 80\u00a0ft (24\u00a0m) wide and 12\u00a0ft (3.7\u00a0m) high in Crawford County slumped against the rising Arkansas River, threatening 250\u00a0people in 152\u00a0residences; the levee remained intact as the river crested on June\u00a01.[18] Governor of Arkansas Asa Hutchinson declared a state of emergency for the entire state on May\u00a021.[21] Hutchinson estimated that flooding caused the state economy to lose $23\u00a0million per day. On May\u00a029, $350,000 in state financial assistance was committed towards flood mitigation.[26] President Donald Trump approved a Major Disaster Declaration for Kansas on June\u00a08 with an incident period from May\u00a021\u2013June\u00a014.[21] The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development disbursed $9\u00a0million in recovery fund grants to twelve Arkansas counties in December\u00a02019.[18]"

        "content": " Tropical Storm Hanna was a moderately strong tropical storm that affected the Gulf Coast and Southeastern regions of the United States. The ninth tropical cyclone and eighth named storm of the 2002 Atlantic hurricane season, Hanna formed over the Gulf of Mexico through the complex interaction of a surface trough, a tropical wave, and an upper-level low pressure system, a disturbance in the upper atmosphere. Designated a tropical depression at 0000\u00a0UTC on September\u00a012, the storm remained disorganized throughout its duration, though it attained tropical storm status and a peak intensity of 1,001\u00a0mbar (29.6\u00a0inHg), with winds of 60\u00a0miles per hour (100\u00a0km/h). Hanna crossed extreme southeastern Louisiana, and made a second landfall along the Alabama\u2013Mississippi border. Because most of the associated convective activity was east of the center of circulation, Louisiana and Mississippi received minimal damage. However, on Dauphin Island, Alabama, the storm caused coastal flooding which closed roads and forced the evacuation of residents. Florida received high wind gusts, heavy rainfall, and strong surf that resulted in the deaths of three swimmers. 20,000\u00a0homes in the state lost electricity. The heavy rainfall progressed into Georgia, where significant flooding occurred. Crop damage was extensive, and about 335 structures were damaged by the flooding. The storm caused a total of about $20\u00a0million in damage (equivalent to $34\u00a0million in 2023)."

        "content": "A broad surface trough extended from the western Atlantic Ocean into the Gulf of Mexico in early September 2002. At the same time, a westward-moving tropical wave entered the gulf on September\u00a010 and spawned a weak low along the trough, with little associated thunderstorm activity. On September\u00a011, an upper-level low over the United States moved into the Gulf and became cut off from the flow, allowing atmospheric convection to develop to the east of the tropical wave. The surface low organized, and convection formed closer to the center of the low. At 0000\u00a0UTC on September\u00a012, a Hurricane Hunters aircraft was able to find a well-defined center of circulation; the National Hurricane Center (NHC) thus designated it a tropical depression while it was about 280 miles (450\u00a0km) south of Pensacola, Florida.[1] After being designated, the cyclone became disorganized, and contained little deep and persistent convection; with dry air infringing on the western edge of the storm, substantial intensification was deemed unlikely.[2] Despite being sheared, the cyclone neared tropical storm status later that day, though it remained a depression due to a partially non-tropical appearance. Initially, the depression meandered towards the northeast due to weak steering currents,[3] and it intensified into a tropical storm at 0600\u00a0UTC. As such, it was named Hanna by the National Hurricane Center. Over the next 24\u00a0hours, the low-level center rotated around the mid- and upper-level centers, and the entire tropical storm turned southwestward by late September\u00a012.[1] After a jog to the northwest, the low-level center became separated from the convection.[4] Meandering, the storm started to turn northward under the steering currents of a southwesterly flow associated with an approaching mid-level trough.[5] Hanna then strengthened sharply to reach to its peak intensity of 60\u00a0miles per hour (100\u00a0km/h) at 0000\u00a0UTC on September\u00a014.[1] Convection shifted towards the eastern semicircle of the circulation, while the still-exposed center became malformed and elongated.[6] On September\u00a014, the poorly organized cyclone crossed southeastern Louisiana, turned towards the north-northeast and made a second landfall close to the Alabama\u2013Mississippi border at 1500\u00a0UTC that day, still at its peak strength. The storm dissipated rapidly as it proceeded inland, and the remnant low pressure area moved into Georgia and South Carolina.[1]"

All tropical cyclone warnings and watches were discontinued by 1800 UTC on September\u00a014, as there was no longer a need for the advisories.[1] After the landfall, officials issued flood watches for inland parts of Mississippi and Alabama as well as for western portions of Georgia and the Carolinas.[7] On Dauphin Island in Alabama, some residents boarded up windows[8] and filled sandbags provided by local fire departments to prepare for Hanna.[9] The Red Cross opened 10 shelters throughout the Gulf Coast region.[10]"

Rainfall was mostly less than 1\u00a0inches (25\u00a0mm), and little rise in tide was reported.[12] Little or no damage occurred in neighboring Mississippi, where similar effects were reported.[1] Damage was greater in Alabama, where rain reached 7.55 inches (192\u00a0mm) at Coden and 5.75 inches (146\u00a0mm) at Belle Fontaine. Sustained winds of 40 miles per hour (64\u00a0km/h) were reported at Dauphin Island, with gusts up to 51\u00a0mph (82\u00a0km/h). The lowest barometric pressure was also at Dauphin Island; it reportedly fell to 1005\u00a0mb. Storm tides of 3.7 feet (1.1\u00a0m) caused minor coastal flooding and beach erosion in some areas, including along the causeway that crosses the Mobile Bay.[13] One tornado, an F0 on the Fujita Scale, touched down in south Mobile County, knocking down trees.[1] Some residents were left without electric power, and there was flooding on both ends of Dauphin Island, leading to road closures. The storm forced the evacuation of some residents on the western end of the island. In addition to the heavy rains, trees were downed in parts of Baldwin County.[14] In Florida, peak gusts were recorded at 68 miles per hour (109\u00a0km/h) near Pensacola Beach.[1] The winds, combined with associated thunderstorms, caused minor damage, and brought down small trees and power lines. Throughout Walton County, Hanna left approximately 15,000 customers without power,[15] forming a statewide total of 20,000 power outages. Due to high winds, bridges to offshore islands were closed.[14] Minor beach erosion was reported along the coast of Walton, Bay and Gulf counties. Three people drowned in high surf; one near Pensacola Beach, one at Seagrove Beach[1] and another at Panama City Beach.[16] The fatalities prompted a local Police Major to comment, \"People are getting into the water and not paying attention to the warning flags.\"[17] Heavy rain fell throughout the central and western Panhandle;[18] the highest reported total was 9.68 inches (246\u00a0mm), at Chipley. As a result, rivers topped their banks, while county roads and homes in Perry,[15] as well as streets in the Tallahassee region, were flooded.[14] The total damage in Florida is estimated at $400,000 (equivalent to $700,000 in 2023[11]).[15]"

Although the heaviest rainfall was mostly confined to southwestern parts of the state,[18] precipitation was widespread within a northwest\u2013northeast feeder band over central and northern Georgia. Associated with the band was up to 2 inches (51\u00a0mm) of rainfall in a matter of hours, as well as gusty thunderstorms. The highest rainfall totals from this individual band were limited to an area north of a line from Atlanta to Athens.[19] The heavy rainfall helped to relieve a persistent drought, bringing vegetation back to life. However, climatologists determined that the rainfall did not fully alleviate the dry conditions.[20] The band of thunderstorms produced gusts of 40 to 50\u00a0mph (64 to 80\u00a0km/h), downing trees and power lines. In the Atlanta metropolitan area, 48,000 customers received power outages.[19] The winds tore a roof off a house and damaged a number of mobile homes.[1] The heavy rainfall caused severe flooding; in Donalsonville, 250\u00a0houses and 50 businesses suffered water damage,[1] while another 35 were damaged in nearby Miller County.[10] Roads were flooded, including parts of U.S. Route 27.[21] Crop damage was significant in the state. According to the Georgia Farm Services Agency, $19\u00a0million in damage (equivalent to $32\u00a0million in 2023[11]) to cotton and peanut crops were reported.[1] Due to the flooding and damage, Governor Roy Barnes declared Seminole, Miller and Decatur counties federal disaster areas.[10] Moderate to heavy rain extended as far north as the Carolinas, and light showers reached the Delmarva Peninsula.[18] Locations in western South Carolina picked up around 3\u00a0inches (75\u00a0mm) of rainfall, causing flooding on some roads and highways.[22] Various streams and ponds topped their banks, and flood waters on some roads reached an estimated 4 to 6 inches (100 to 150\u00a0mm) deep.[23] On South Carolina Highway 20, a motorist became stranded in high waters, and nearby houses were damaged.[24] The rainfall delayed a football game at Williams-Brice Stadium for about 50 minutes.[25] Farther northward, the remnants of Tropical Storm Hanna contributed to around 1\u00a0inch (25\u00a0mm) of rainfall in New England, particularly in Vermont.[26]"

The season has no official bounds but cyclones tend to form between April and December. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northern Indian Ocean. There are two main seas in the North Indian Ocean\u2014the Bay of Bengal to the east of the Indian subcontinent and the Arabian Sea to the west of India. The official Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre in this basin is the India Meteorological Department (IMD), while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) releases unofficial advisories. An average of five tropical cyclones form in the North Indian Ocean every season with peaks in May and November.[1] Cyclones occurring between the meridians 45\u00b0E and 100\u00b0E are included in the season by the IMD.[2]"

It re-intensified into a Severe Cyclonic Storm while making an anticlockwise loop. It then began to weaken rapidly as wind shear tore apart its structure. It made its second landfall at Honnavar in Karnataka as a Depression on November 22 and dissipated on November 23. Many places in the Nagapattinam, Thanjavur, Tiruchirappalli, and Thiruvarur districts received wind gusts up to 165 kmph. 23,000 cattle perished and 560 people were reported to be killed by the storm. 10 Lakh people were affected in Tamil Nadu by the storm. Damages in Indian Rupees were estimated to be 155 crores. During its second landfall at Karnataka, only minor damages were reported to the fishing hamlets there.[citation needed] During its existence over the Arabian Sea, the storm coexisted with the 1977 Andhra Pradesh cyclone which was the first time in the satellite era in the basin to have two cyclones on the either side of the North Indian Ocean (Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea). The next time this happened was in 2018 with Cyclone Titli and Cyclone Luban. If the whole duration of the storm is considered, the cyclone is the longest-lasting storm in the North Indian Ocean basin on record.

It was initially disorganized, without a well-developed circulation.[1] On September\u00a025, while still a tropical depression, the system was named Debbie.[2] Without intensifying further, the depression crossed the northeastern Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula on September\u00a026. The next day, the depression turned toward the north in the central Gulf of Mexico before beginning a northeast motion.[1] On September\u00a028, Debbie intensified into a tropical storm, attaining peak winds of 50\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h).[3] This occurred after the storm developed two distinct spiral rainbands.[4] As Debbie approached the northern Gulf Coast, it failed to intensify, despite warm sea surface temperatures, abundant moisture, and an anticyclone aloft. In addition, the storm never developed good outflow, partially due to stable air related to Tropical Storm Hazel in the eastern Pacific Ocean. After maintaining peak winds for about 12\u00a0hours, Debbie weakened due to cooler, drier air,[1] deteriorating to a tropical depression on September\u00a029. That day, it turned to the northwest, passing just east of the Mississippi Delta. On September\u00a030, the circulation of Debbie dissipated just offshore Mississippi.[3] Its remnants made landfall, accelerated northeastward, and were eventually absorbed by an extratropical cyclone.[5]"

Grand Cayman reported light rains for two days.[6] The government of Cuba advised residents to restrict boating activities around the country. Similarly, the Weather Bureau issued a small craft warning for the Dry Tortugas and for the Florida Keys through Key Largo.[7] Before Debbie dissipated, local Weather Bureau offices issued a gale warning and a hurricane watch from the mouth of the Mississippi River to Cedar Key, Florida. Small boat owners throughout the region were advised to remain at port.[8] The threat of the storm prompted the evacuation of oil platforms, as well as thousands of residents in low-lying areas of St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana.[9] Along the northern Gulf Coast, no gale force winds were reported inland,[1] although oil rigs and ships off the southeast Louisiana coast reported such winds.[4] Debbie produced above-normal tides that generally ranged upwards to 4\u00a0ft (1.2\u00a0m) above normal; however, New Orleans reported a storm tide of 6\u00a0ft (1.8\u00a0m). The tides resulted in flooding along highways in southeastern Louisiana,[1] closing several roads.[9] The storm affected areas that were severely damaged by Hurricane Betsy earlier in September.[10] Despite being a weak storm, Debbie dropped heavy rainfall along the coast,[1] peaking at 17.2\u00a0in (440\u00a0mm) in Mobile, Alabama.[5] Of the total, 15\u00a0in (380\u00a0mm) fell in 15\u00a0hours, which broke the daily rainfall record in the city.[11] The rains resulted in 6\u00a0ft (1.8\u00a0m) of flooding that closed several businesses and roads,[12] causing the worst traffic jam on record in the city. Hundreds of cars were flooded, and more than 200\u00a0people had to leave their inundated homes.[11] Damage in the city was estimated at $25\u00a0million, which was the only significant damage from the storm.[1] Rainfall extended from Louisiana to the east coast of Florida, and as far north as North Carolina.[5] In eastern Georgia near Brunswick, the storm dropped more than 9\u00a0in (230\u00a0mm) of precipitation, causing flooding in airfields and along canals.[13]"

The system developed tropical storm-force winds on October 8, before becoming a nor'easter on the next day. The system then began to organize, and was designated as Subtropical Storm Melissa on October 11. Melissa was then upgraded into a tropical storm, the following day. However, the storm soon began to disorganize and transition into an extratropical low by October 14, before dissipating later that same day. The storm and its precursor brought strong winds, heavy rainfall, rough surf, and coastal flooding to the Mid-Atlantic States and New England. Numerous trees and power lines were downed in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Meanwhile, coastal floods inundated communities mainly along the coasts of Delaware and Maryland. In the United States, damage from Melissa totaled to around $24,000 (2019 USD). As the storm moved out to sea, high winds and power outages were reported in Nova Scotia. No fatalities were reported in association with Melissa."

The cold front began to lift to the northwest, due to an incoming mid-latitude trough across the eastern United States. By 18:00 UTC on October 8, a frontal low began to produce tropical storm-force winds, while located roughly 80 miles (130 km) east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. The frontal low began to intensify offshore the Mid-Atlantic States on October 9, before merging with an occluded front the next day. The system then began to meander to the southeast of New England after being designated as a strong nor\u2019easter. The low then became detached from the occluded front with deep convection developing north of the system\u2019s center, early on October 11. By 6:00 UTC that day, the low was designated as Subtropical Storm Melissa, while located around 210 miles (340 km) south-southeast of Nantucket, Massachusetts. It was designated as a subtropical cyclone due to its large radius of gale-force winds and its association with an upper-level low.[1] Melissa continued to meander offshore New England for the next 36 hours, as deep convection waned and sustained winds decreased.[1][2] The next day, convection began to increase near the center of the storm.[3] At 12:00 UTC that same day, Melissa was upgraded into a tropical storm after the storm\u2019s gale-force wind field significantly contracted while located about 265 miles (425 km) south-southeast of Nantucket.[1] However just a few hours later, westerly wind shear began to degrade convection from the western side of the storm.[4] By 9:00 UTC on October 13, deep convection had become separated from the low-level center, and the structure of the system became disorganized.[5] Despite this, convection began to increase once more, after Melissa moved into more favorable conditions. At this time, the storm also began to accelerate to the east-northeast, around the northern periphery of the Bermuda-Azores High.[6] Just a few hours later, convection decreased for the final time as the inner-core region was taken over by stable cold-air stratocumulus clouds.[7] By early on October 14, Melissa only remained an exposed swirl with decreased convection.[8] After merging with a nearby frontal boundary, Melissa degenerated into an extratropical low at 12:00 UTC that day, while located roughly 400 miles (645 km) south of Cape Race, Newfoundland. Just 6 hours later, the circulation of the low opened up, and the system dissipated shortly afterwards.[1]"

At the time, it was the worst storm to hit Ireland for 300 years.[2][3] Liverpool also suffered severely, with many shipwrecks and much structural damage. 120 people died as a result of such accidents in the city alone. Two major shipwrecks resulted in damage of at least \u00a3500,000, equivalent to \u00a356,000,000 in 2023.[4]"

Heavy snow, rare in Ireland, fell across the country on the night of 5 January, which was replaced on the morning of 6 January by an Atlantic warm front, which brought a period of complete calm with dense, motionless, cloud cover. Through the day, temperatures rose well above their seasonal average, resulting in rapid melting of the snow.[5][6][7] Later on 6 January, a deep Atlantic depression began to move towards Ireland, forming a cold front when it collided with the warm air over land, bringing strong winds and heavy rain. First reports of stormy weather came from western County Mayo around noon, and the storm moved very slowly across the island through the day, gathering strength as it moved.[5][7][6] By midnight the winds reached hurricane force."

It is estimated that between 250 and 300\u00a0people lost their lives in the storm. Severe property damage was caused, particularly in Connacht, but also in Ulster and northern Leinster. Between a fifth and a quarter of all houses in Dublin suffered damage ranging from broken windows to complete destruction.[2] Much of the inland damage was caused by a storm surge that drew large quantities of sea water inland, resulting in widespread flooding.[5][7][6] Even well-built buildings suffered structural damage, including new factories and military barracks. The newly constructed St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church in Derrytrasna was completely destroyed; one of the steeples of the Church of Ireland church in Castlebar was blown down, and a number of large country houses were unroofed. Among the poorly built homes of the poor, damage was more severe and many were completely destroyed. A total of 42 ships, most along the less sheltered west coast, were wrecked while unsuccessfully trying to ride out the storm: a majority of the recorded casualties occurred at sea.[1][5] Stacks of hay and corn were widely destroyed, resulting in severe starvation among livestock in the following months.[5][8]"

The cyclone was first noted on January 5, 1988 as a weak tropical depression to the northeast of Tuvalu, in conjunction with the future Typhoon Roy in the Northern Hemisphere. Over the next few days, the system gradually developed while moving southwestward. Once it became a tropical cyclone, it was named Anne on January 8. The next day, Anne rapidly intensified, becoming the fourth major tropical cyclone to affect Vanuatu within four years. On January\u00a011, Anne peaked in intensity while it was equivalent to a Category\u00a05 on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale, and a Category\u00a04 on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. After turning southward on January 12, Anne struck New Caledonia, becoming the strongest tropical cyclone to affect the French Overseas Territory. The system subsequently weakened as it started to interact with Tropical Cyclone Agi. Anne weakened into a depression and was last noted on January 14 to the south-east of New Caledonia. Several islands within the Solomon Islands reported extensive property and crop damage. Within Vanuatu, Anne brought heavy rains, flooding, and a storm surge. These effects damaged houses, crops, and property, especially on Ureparapara islands and the Torres Islands. Extensive damage was reported in New Caledonia after it was exposed to a prolonged period of storm force winds, with the eastern and southern coasts particularly affected. On January\u00a012, the system produced the highest daily rainfall totals since 1951 in several areas. Two people were killed after they attempted to cross a flooded river, and about 80\u00a0others were injured by the cyclone. Due to the impact of this storm, the name Anne was retired."

Later that day, the JTWC reported that the system had become equivalent to a Category 1 on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS), and the FMS upgraded Anne to a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian Scale.[1][3] Early on January\u00a010, the cyclone passed through Temotu Province and about 55\u00a0km (35\u00a0mi) to the northwest of Anuta Island.[1][3] Later on January\u00a010, Anne directly passed over Vanuatu's Torres Islands and came within 65\u00a0km (40\u00a0mi) of Ureparapara in the Banks Islands.[1] The cyclone continued to move to the south-southwest and affected the northern islands of Vanuatu.[1] Early on January 11, the FMS reported that Anne had peaked, with estimated 10-minute sustained winds near its center of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph), equivalent to a Category 4 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian scale.[1][3] At around the same time the JTWC reported that Anne had peak 1-minute peak sustained winds of 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph), which made it equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane on the SSHWS.[3][6] This made it one of the most intense tropical cyclones of the 1980s.[1] Over the next day, Cyclone Anne turned south and rapidly weakened as it encountered upper-level wind shear, approaching the French overseas territory of New Caledonia.[1] Late on January 12, Anne weakened into a modern-day Category 2 tropical cyclone, before it made landfall on New Caledonia about 110\u00a0km (70\u00a0mi) to the north-northwest of Noumea.[1] After the cyclone re-emerged into the Coral Sea, the JTWC downgraded Anne to tropical storm status.[3] Later on January 13, Cyclone Anne started to interact with Cyclone Agi, which had rapidly moved south-eastward towards the \"relatively deeper\" Anne.[1][3][7] Agi had developed two days prior near the Louisiade Archipelago, about 1,200\u00a0km (745\u00a0mi) northwest of Cyclone Anne.[3][7] Early on January 14, Anne weakened into a depression and subsequently dissipated southeast of New Caledonia as it was caught up in the upper westerly flow.[2][6][3]"

The South Pacific division of the Adventist Development and Relief Agency sent AU$5,000 to New Caledonia for relief efforts.[10][26] Emergency funding of F300,000 was given to New Caledonia to help with the relief effort by the French Minister of the Interior and Minister of Overseas Territories.[37] The European Commission also provided New Caledonia with \u20ac85,000, which was distributed by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in the form of cash donations to the worst-affected families.[38] After the season, the name \"Anne\" was retired by the World Meteorological Organization.[39]"

Over the next few days, the system gradually developed further, before it was classified as a tropical cyclone and named Lola by the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) on 22 October. Later that same day, Lola rapidly intensified into a Category 4 intensity was reached by 12:00 UTC that day, with Lola exhibiting maximum ten-minute sustained winds of 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph). With convective rain bands wrapping into the circulation, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) assessed Lola as having one-minute sustained winds of 215\u00a0km/h (130\u00a0mph). At the same time, the FMS followed suit and upgraded the system to a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone. Over the next few days, the cyclone's weakening accelerated as it moved southwards before degenerated into a tropical depression on 26 October. Cyclone Lola was the third severe tropical cyclone to impact Vanuatu during 2023, after Cyclones Judy and Kevin had impacted the island nation earlier that year. The cyclone caused at four deaths and left at least four injured."

The twenty-first tropical disturbance, third named storm, and second severe tropical cyclone of the annual cyclone season, Donna formed from an area of disturbed weather that was first monitored west-northwest of Fiji on 1 May 2017. The disturbance drifted eastward amid an increasingly favourable environment, and it was designated Tropical Depression 21F late on 2 May. Twelve hours later, it intensified into a Category\u00a01 on the Australian tropical cyclone scale and was designated Tropical Cyclone Donna as the storm's motion shifted west and then south. After reaching its initial peak as a Category\u00a04 cyclone early on 6 May, the effects of wind shear and upwelling caused the storm to weaken. However, it reintensified into a Category\u00a05 cyclone on 8 May. Soon after, Donna entered a region of strong westerly flow and began to rapidly weaken. Continuing to accelerate in a southerly direction, Donna eventually weakened into a tropical low on 10 May. By 16 May, Donna's remnants had fully dissipated. Buffeting the island chain of Vanuatu, Donna has resulted in severe damage throughout the northern provinces, though the exact extent is unknown in the absence of good communication."

        "content": "On 1 May, the day after the official end of the South Pacific cyclone season, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began monitoring an area of disturbed weather about 1,455\u00a0km (905\u00a0mi) west-northwest of Nadi. Though it possessed an oblong area of low pressure partially exposed to the northeast of deep shower and thunderstorm activity, the system was embedded within an environment of moderate wind shear, good upper-level outflow, and warm ocean temperatures.[1] The official warning agency for the South Pacific, the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS), began monitoring the disturbance a short while later.[2] As fragmented spiral bands began wrapping into the centre of circulation, the JTWC assessed that the potential for tropical cyclone formation was high, issuing a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert accordingly at 21:00\u00a0UTC on 1 May.[3] The storm tracked slowly eastward through the northern islands of Vanuatu but consolidated rapidly as upper-level winds became light, prompting the FMS to upgrade the disturbance to Tropical Depression 21F at 18:00\u00a0UTC on 2 May.[4] This was followed by the JTWC's classification of Tropical Cyclone 18P three hours later.\n[5] Following formation, the depression turned west in response to a developing subtropical ridge to its south.[6] A continued favourable environment allowed it to intensify into a Category\u00a01 on the Australian tropical cyclone scale by 06:00\u00a0UTC on 3 May, at which point it was named \"Donna\" by the FMS,[7] and further to Category\u00a02 intensity by 18:00\u00a0UTC.[8] The JTWC, meanwhile, upped the cyclone to the equivalent of a Category\u00a01 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale, citing consolidation of deep convection near the centre and satellite intensity estimates around 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph).[9] Despite some evidence of wind shear along the northern fringes of the storm, it began to clear an eye late on 4 May, prompting the JTWC to classify Donna as a Category\u00a02 equivalent,[10] and the FMS to upgrade to Category\u00a03 strength.[11] At 00:00\u00a0UTC on 6 May, after re-tracking through Vanuatu and beginning a southward track, Donna attained its initial peak as a Category\u00a04 cyclone.[12][13] Shortly thereafter, the effects of increased northeasterly upper-level flow became more prevalent as the storm's cloud pattern changed to a central cold cover and then devolved into patchy areas of moderate convection.[14] Around 09:00\u00a0UTC on 6 May, the JTWC reduced the storm back to a Category\u00a01 equivalent,[15] and by 18:00\u00a0UTC, the FMS indicated Donna had weakened to a Category\u00a03 cyclone on the Australian scale.[16] Drifting south-southwest and then south, Donna continued to struggle under the combined effects of upper-level winds and ocean upwelling.[17] By early on 7 May, however, convection within the eyewall began to increase in intensity,[18] and the FMS upgraded Donna to a Category\u00a04 cyclone for a second time accordingly.[19] Three hours later, the JTWC estimated that it had intensified to a Category\u00a04 equivalent, completely skipping Category\u00a03 status.[20] With a solid ring of deep convection surrounding a well-defined 55\u00a0km (35\u00a0mi) eye,[21] the FMS upgraded Donna to a Category\u00a05 cyclone at 00:00\u00a0UTC on 8 May, estimating that the storm possessed 10-minute sustained winds of 205\u00a0km/h (125\u00a0mph).[22] As a result, Donna became the strongest off-season tropical cyclone on record during the month of May in the South Pacific basin.[23] Weakening began shortly following peak intensity as Donna's eye became partially obscured and the eastern eyewall was eroded;[24] the storm weakened back to Category\u00a04 intensity by 18:00\u00a0UTC on 8 May,[25] Category\u00a01 intensity by 21:00\u00a0UTC on 9 May,[26] and ultimately degenerated into a tropical low by 06:00\u00a0UTC on 10 May as it dodged New Caledonia.[27]"

It accelerated northeast along the U.S. East Coast, ultimately peaking as a moderate storm with winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) before crossing the Mid-Atlantic states and New England; it dissipated on July 31 over southern Canada. It inflicted moderate damage in Florida, the worst since Hurricane Easy of 1950, and dropped heavy rainfall as far north as New York City. Its total damage was estimated at US$5 million, and only indirect deaths were blamed on it."

        "content": "A weak low-pressure area that organized in the northeast Gulf of Mexico began to intensify on July 28, while located west of the Tampa Bay.[1]  Early in its life, the system had a broad circulation with primarily light winds, similar to that of a subtropical storm.[2] The storm is estimated to have become a tropical depression earlier the previous day as it moved toward the northeast.[3] It made landfall along the Florida coast near Cross City and continued inland, gradually accelerating.[1] It likely attained tropical storm status at around 1200 UTC on July 28 while its center was situated west of Tampa.[3] The cyclone was named Brenda after reconnaissance aircraft confirmed that it had reached tropical storm strength.[1] Brenda tracked northward, hugging the Georgia and South Carolina coasts before moving inland over North Carolina on July 29. It attained its peak winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) late that evening, while situated south of Wilmington.[3] The next morning, the storm emerged over the Chesapeake Bay moving northeast at about 30\u00a0mph (48\u00a0km/h).[4] Brenda crossed the Delmarva Peninsula and rapidly tracked into southern New Jersey. The storm crossed the state and eventually made another landfall in Brooklyn, New York before making yet another landfall in coastal Connecticut.[3] At around 0000 UTC on July 31, Brenda moved into Massachusetts. Shortly thereafter, it lost its tropical characteristics and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone.[3] It dissipated by August 1 over southern Canada. Because Brenda was in the vicinity of land for most of its course, it was not able to intensify beyond tropical storm status.[1]"

        "content": "In advance of the storm, tropical storm advisories and wind warnings were issued from Florida to Maine.[5] Rainfall from Tropical Storm Brenda affected at least 16 states. The heaviest precipitation fell in western Florida near Tampa, east of the storm's center; the Tampa International Airport recorded 14.57\u00a0in (370\u00a0mm) of rainfall.[2] Extensive flooding occurred in the west-central Florida Peninsula. Wind gusts exceeded 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h), and the storm produced 10\u00a0ft (3.0\u00a0m) high waves along the coast, leading to considerable erosion. However, storm tides were not severe.[1] Around the Naples area, Brenda's effects were primarily light, although small boat and dock facilities and roads sustained some damage.[6] A private seawall at Clearwater was breached in two places by the cyclone.[7] Brenda was considered the worst storm to strike the area since Hurricane Easy in 1950.[8] While no casualties are directly blamed on the storm, at least one traffic-related death took place.[1] According to an American Red Cross Disaster Service report encompassing eight Florida counties, 11 houses sustained significant damage, while 567 suffered more minor damage. Around 590 families were affected overall. Total monetary damage is placed at near $5 million.[9] Tides along the Outer Banks of North Carolina were generally reported at 2\u00a0ft (0.61\u00a0m) above-normal. In and around Wilmington, the storm caused minor damage to roofs and windows of some beachfront structures. Power was temporarily interrupted due to fallen tree limbs. Heavy rainfall caused flooding on streams and rivers, and in some areas the precipitation helped to end a serious drought.[10] Some boats were swamped, and the winds ripped the roof off a cottage at Long Beach.[11] The heavy rain and high tides flooded tobacco fields.[12] Moderate rains extended northward into the Mid-Atlantic states, with lighter totals reported farther north in New York.[2] At New York City, 4.79\u00a0in (122\u00a0mm) of precipitation fell, beating the one-day July record of 3.80\u00a0in (97\u00a0mm) set in 1872. The heavy rains flooded parts of LaGuardia Airport. Elsewhere, reports of 3 to 5\u00a0in (76 to 127\u00a0mm) were common throughout New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland and Virginia.[12] High winds also affected portions of the northeastern United States, gusting to 55\u00a0mph (89\u00a0km/h) across southern New England. Tides often ran 3 to 4\u00a0ft (0.91 to 1.22\u00a0m) above-normal throughout the region. The storm caused travel delays and ran several ships aground, but otherwise inflicted little serious damage.[13] The storm forced the cancellation of two American League baseball games and the postponement of several other sporting events around the area.[14]"

The season has no official bounds but cyclones tend to form between April and December. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northern Indian Ocean. There are two main seas in the North Indian Ocean\u2014the Bay of Bengal to the east of the Indian subcontinent and the Arabian Sea to the west of India. The official Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre in this basin is the India Meteorological Department (IMD), while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) releases unofficial advisories. An average of five tropical cyclones form in the North Indian Ocean every season with peaks in May and November.[1] Cyclones occurring between the meridians 45\u00b0E and 100\u00b0E are included in the season by the IMD.[2] Sixteen depressions developed during the 1950 season, with four of them becoming cyclonic storms while three of them formed over the land. Most tropical cyclones formed in this season are weak, as there is no severe cyclonic storms formed during this season.[3]"

By April 11, the system intensified and begins to accelerate towards Burma on evening of the same day.[4] In April 13, the system moved ashore across southern Rakhine State coasts and quickly dissipated over land.[5] The system dropped heavy rains on the east coast of Sri Lanka on April 8 and April 9. As the depression moved northeastwards, widespread rains occurred over Napier Bay Islands on April 11 and April 13, killing two people in Port Blair. As system made landfall near Burmese coast, heavy rains caused some damage to the property and five people.[5]"

        "content": "In February 1287 a storm hit the southern coast of England with such ferocity that whole areas of coastline were redrawn. Silting up and cliff collapses led to towns that had stood by the sea finding themselves landlocked, while others that had been inland found themselves with access to the sea. The town of Winchelsea on Romney Marsh was destroyed (later rebuilt on the clifftop behind).[1] Nearby Broomhill was also destroyed. The course of the nearby River Rother was diverted away from New Romney, which was almost destroyed and left a mile from the coast, ending its role as a port. The Rother ran instead to sea at Rye, prompting its rise as a port. The storm contributed to the collapse of a cliff at Hastings, taking part of Hastings Castle with it, blocking the harbour and ending its role as a trade centre, though it continued as a centre for fishing. Whitstable in Kent is also reported to have been hit by the surge. In all, the storm can be seen to have had a powerful effect on the Cinque Ports, two of which were hit (Hastings and New Romney), along with the supporting \"Antient Town\" of Winchelsea. Meanwhile, the other Ancient Town of Rye was advantaged. This was one of two huge storms to strike England in 1287. The other, known in the Netherlands as St. Lucia's flood, struck in December, the following winter. Together with a surge in January 1286,[2] they seem to have prompted the decline of one of England's then-leading ports, Dunwich in Suffolk."

The second tropical storm of the season, Alma formed from a tropical wave located offshore South Florida on August\u00a026. Initially a tropical depression, it subsequently moved inland over South Florida. Impact in the state was minor, generally limited to light rainfall and rough seas. Early on August\u00a027, the depression reemerged into the Atlantic Ocean and strengthened into Tropical Storm Alma later that day. Thereafter, it moved northeastward and remained offshore the East Coast of the United States. Alma strengthened into a hurricane on August\u00a028, while located offshore the Outer Banks of North Carolina. In the eastern portion of the state, strong winds downed electrical poles, which caused power outages. Storm tides caused erosion in some areas. Damage in North Carolina reached $35,000 (1962\u00a0USD). The storm continued to intensify and peaked as an 85\u00a0mph (137\u00a0km/h) Category\u00a01 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale on August\u00a028. The storm's outer bands brought rainfall, rough seas, and strong winds, especially in Massachusetts. However, the precipitation was mostly beneficial, as New England was suffering from drought conditions. In Massachusetts, strong winds caused power and telephone outages, and felled numerous trees. Rough seas offshore Massachusetts destroyed over 100\u00a0boats. Losses in New England were less than $1\u00a0million. Alma curved eastward and weakened to a tropical storm in the northwestern Atlantic on August\u00a030. Several hours later, the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while situated south of Nova Scotia."

The system tracked westward and was observed by a research flight on August\u00a018. Four days later, the system entered the Caribbean Sea and continued to remain disorganized. The wave moved across eastern Cuba on August\u00a024, before emerging into the Straits of Florida on the following day.[1] The system finally began to organize, and at 1200\u00a0UTC on August\u00a026, a tropical depression developed offshore southeastern Florida coast. Shortly thereafter, the depression made landfall near Boca Raton, Florida with winds of 30\u00a0mph (48\u00a0km/h). It traveled barely inland and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean near Fort Pierce early on August\u00a027.[3] The depression moved northeastward and strengthened due to its location beneath an anticyclone.[1] Later on August\u00a027, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Alma while situated about 150\u00a0mi (240\u00a0km) east of the Florida\u2013Georgia border.[3][1] Alma steadily intensified as it paralleled the coastline of The Carolinas, becoming a hurricane on August\u00a028 a few miles off the coast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina.[3][1] Around that time, Alma attained its minimum barometric pressure of 984\u00a0mbar (29.1\u00a0inHg). At 1800\u00a0UTC on August\u00a028, Alma attained its maximum sustained wind speed of 85\u00a0mph (137\u00a0km/h). A high pressure system over Atlantic Canada caused Alma to turn east-southeastward,[1] while weakening to a tropical storm on August\u00a030. Later that day, the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while situated about 180 miles (290\u00a0km) south-southeast of the southwestern tip of Nova Scotia.[3] The high pressure system also caused the extratropical remnants to execute a cyclonic loop between August\u00a031 and September\u00a02.[1] Later that day, the extratropical remnants of Alma curved northeastward, before dissipating south of Newfoundland.[3]"

Rainfall peaked at only 0.64 inches (16\u00a0mm) in Norfolk, causing no flooding. Minor beach erosion occurred due to tides 1.3 feet (0.40\u00a0m) above normal at Hampton Roads. No significant wind damage occurred, as the strongest sustained wind speed in the area was 36\u00a0mph (58\u00a0km/h) in Cape Henry.[8] In Massachusetts, the outer bands of Alma brought 40\u00a0hours of nearly continuous rainfall, as well as gale-force winds for several hours. Precipitation amounts reached up to 3 inches (76\u00a0mm), though it was mostly beneficial, as the region of New England was suffering from drought conditions.[2] Slick roads resulted in several traffic accidents.[9] Tides reached 2\u00a0ft (0.61\u00a0m) above normal in the state of Massachusetts, which resulted in minor coastal flooding. However, Alma produced strong waves that destroyed over 100\u00a0boats.[1] Additionally, many cabin cruisers and smaller vessels broke loose from their moorings and smashed against the rocks. The storm produced northerly wind gust up to 51\u00a0mph (82\u00a0km/h) to the Boston area, in addition to winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) along coastal sections of the state.[10] As a result, many trees fell, causing power and telephone outages, and smashing a house and parked car in Lynn. At the Civil Defense facility in Melrose, winds and rainfall short-circuited the sirens, causing them to wail for more than 2\u00a0hours. At the Fair Grounds in Topsfield, a large tent was blown down.[9] One indirect death occurred when a woman was struck by a truck that skidded off the road in Haverhill.[11] Elsewhere in New England, the storm brought rainfall and 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) winds to coastal Rhode Island. Storm damage was reported as far north as Portsmouth, New Hampshire,[9] while precipitation extended northward into Maine.[5] Damage from the storm in New England was estimated at less than $1\u00a0million.[1]"

The season officially began on June\u00a015, while the first tropical storm developed on June\u00a030. No further activity occurred until late August, when Hurricane Alma brushed the Outer Banks before becoming extratropical southeast of New England, destroying hundreds of boats and producing beneficial rainfall. Around that time, Tropical Storm Becky developed unusually far east in the Atlantic Ocean, becoming the easternmost storm on record to recurve to the northeast. Celia followed in the September, forming east of the Lesser Antilles and executing a loop near Bermuda before dissipating. Hurricane Daisy was the costliest of the season, leaving about $1.1\u00a0million in damage in New England (1962\u00a0USD). The storm dropped the highest rainfall total on record in Maine, and its precipitation caused 22\u00a0traffic fatalities. Ella, the strongest storm of the season, remained offshore of the eastern United States but caused two deaths. The final system, an unnamed hurricane, formed on November\u00a028 and meandered eratically off the Southeastern United States before becoming extratropical on December\u00a04. In addition to the seven named storms, there were two non-developing tropical depressions. The first struck Texas in August, causing street flooding and killing three. The second formed off the west coast of Florida and flooded widespread areas after 1 in 100 year rainfall. The floods affected 5,000\u00a0houses and caused millions in damage. The season officially ended on November\u00a015."

The National Hurricane Center began operations with no new equipment, and the warning agency instead opted to improve with the existing equipment. The agency had access to a system of radars that extended from Brownsville, Texas, to Eastport, Maine, which was set up in 1961. Although satellite imagery technology was available, the system was not fully active to provide daily images of Atlantic hurricanes.[1] The season officially ended on November\u00a015.[2] During the season, four hurricanes developed from seven named storms.[3] This was below the average of 10\u00a0storms per season,[4] and represented the fewest tropical storms since 1946.[5] Four of the five storms developed from the Intertropical Convergence Zone. The decreased activity is partially due to the westerlies extending further south than usual, as well as a persistent ridge. In addition, temperatures in the eastern United States were cooler than usual.[6] Activity through September\u00a010 was the quietest in 30\u00a0years.[7] The only region of the United States threatened by hurricanes was New England, although no stations recorded hurricane-force winds in the country.[6] This was the first such occurrence during the 20th century that no tropical storms or hurricanes hit the country.[8] Overall damage was the lowest in several years.[6]"

A frontal low developed a day later off the coast of South Carolina. The low moved northward and northward, gradually acquiring tropical characteristics. The Atlantic hurricane reanalysis committee assessed that the system transitioned into a tropical storm by late on June\u00a030, while moving over the Outer Banks of North Carolina. The storm at the time was co-located with an upper-level low, suggesting characteristics of a subtropical cyclone. Based on reports from ships and land stations, the maximum sustained winds were estimated at 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h). On July\u00a01, an approaching cold front steered the storm away from the coast. The storm gradually weakened and transitioned back into an extratropical cyclone late on July\u00a02. Turning to the north, the storm moved across Newfoundland, and curved to the west and southwest, striking New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. The storm turned back to the northeast, remaining offshore Nova Scotia until it was absorbed by an approaching extratropical storm on July\u00a06.[9] While in its formative stages, the storm dropped torrential rainfall in coastal portions of North Carolina, causing locally heavy crop damage. Cedar Island reported 17\u00a0in (430\u00a0mm) of rainfall in an 18-hour period; at the time, it was the second-highest single-day rainfall total.[9]"

It moved northward along the coast, located beneath an anticyclone that aided in its intensification. The depression began a motion to the northeast on August\u00a027, and that day it strengthened into Tropical Storm Alma about 150\u00a0mi (240\u00a0km) east of the Florida/Georgia border. This marked the latest development of the first storm since 1941. Alma steadily intensified as it paralleled the coastline of the Carolinas, becoming a hurricane on August\u00a028 a few miles off the coast of Cape Hatteras. Despite its proximity, the storm produced peak wind gusts of only 53\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h) in Nags Head.[6] Wind gusts downed a power pole in Hatteras, which caused an hour long power outage for one-third of the town.[10] There, the storm tide was 3\u00a0ft (0.91\u00a0m) above normal, which resulted in some erosion.[6] The highest rainfall total from Alma in the United States was a report of 10.38\u00a0in (264\u00a0mm) in Cape Hatteras.[11] Damage in the state amounted to $35,000.[6] After passing the Outer Banks, Alma continued to intensify further, reaching peak winds of 85\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) about 85\u00a0mi (140\u00a0km) south of Nantucket.[3] Despite its intensity, the hurricane never developed a well-defined eye. Alma quickly weakened to a tropical storm as it made its closest approach to New England,[6] due to cooler water temperatures.[12] In Rhode Island and Massachusetts along the coast, the storm produced northerly winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h),[6] and one house was damaged by a fallen tree.[13] Tides reached 2\u00a0ft (0.61\u00a0m) above normal, which resulted in minor coastal flooding. However, Alma produced strong waves that destroyed over 100\u00a0boats. Damage from the storm was estimated at less than $1\u00a0million, though its rains were beneficial to drought-stricken areas of New England.[6] Precipitation extended northward through Maine, and storm damage was reported as far north as Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Slick roads resulted in several traffic accidents,[12] although there were no deaths. After moving by the region, Alma turned to the southeast due to a high-pressure system to its north. It became extratropical on August\u00a030.[6]"

For about 30\u00a0hours, the system affected the Cape Verde islands with rainfall, during which it moved slowly to the west and west-northwest. Late on August\u00a028, it was estimated that the depression intensified into a tropical storm. The next day, satellite imagery observed a well-developed tropical cyclone in the far eastern Atlantic Ocean. In addition, a ship reported winds of force\u00a09 on the Beaufort scale, suggesting winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h). On that basis, the Weather Bureau initiated advisories on Tropical Storm Becky, despite the agency only issuing advisories for storms west of 35\u00b0 W. Around that time, the storm moved over an area of anomalously warm water temperatures, which allowed for its intensification. On August\u00a030, Becky turned to the north and northeast due to an approaching trough, becoming the easternmost cyclone since 1886 that a storm began a motion to the north. A hurricane hunters flight on August\u00a031 indicated that Becky became extratropical about 70\u00a0mi (115\u00a0km) south of Santa Maria Island in the Azores. The storm's remnants continued to the northeast, dissipating on September\u00a01 about 320\u00a0mi (515\u00a0km) west of Spain.[6][3]"

Late on September\u00a012, a ship reported winds of 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h), which provided the basis for the San Juan Weather Bureau to initiate advisories on Tropical Storm Celia. The storm quickly attained peak winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h), and on September\u00a013 a hurricane watch was issued for the northern Leeward Islands. However, Celia passed beneath a mid- to upper-level trough and quickly weakened. By late on September\u00a014, a hurricane hunters flight indicated that the storm's structure no longer resembled that of a tropical cyclone. The next day, Celia weakened to a tropical depression, and the Weather Bureau discontinued tropical cyclone advisories. It turned to the north and later to the east, passing well southeast of Bermuda. On September\u00a018, Celia began executing a loop to the north, during which it re-intensified into a tropical storm, as reported by ships. It attained winds of 45\u00a0mph (70\u00a0km/h) on September\u00a019, but again weakened to a tropical depression the next day.

For several days it moved to the west-northwest, passing just north of the islands without intensifying further. This was due to its presence beneath an upper-level trough, although the system began intensifying as the trough dissipated. On October\u00a02, after turning to the northwest between two high-pressure areas, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Daisy. Developing an anticyclone aloft, the storm continued to gradually intensify, reaching hurricane strength on October\u00a03.[6] Two days later, Daisy turned to the north-northeast and attained peak winds of 105\u00a0mph (165\u00a0km/h). Cool air imparted weakening as Daisy turned northwestward, and on October\u00a07, the storm transitioned into an extratropical about 185\u00a0mi (300\u00a0km) east of Chatham, Massachusetts. On the following day, the extratropical remnants of Daisy struck Nova Scotia just south of Yarmouth and later re-emerged into the Atlantic, before dissipating south of Newfoundland on October\u00a09.[3] In New England, Hurricane Daisy's outer rainbands combined with an approaching nor'easter to drop torrential rainfall over the region for 65\u00a0hours, producing upwards of 12\u00a0in (300\u00a0mm) in portions of Massachusetts.[6] The highest total from Daisy alone was 9.47\u00a0in (241\u00a0mm) at Portland International Jetport in Maine;[14] this was the state's highest tropical cyclone rainfall total between 1950 and 2011.[15] Across the region, the rains caused widespread flood damage. In Maine, wind gusts reaching 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) destroyed hundreds of small boats, along with high waves from the storm. In New England, Daisy left five injuries, one direct death, and about $1.1\u00a0million in damage.[6] Slick roads, however, resulted in 22\u00a0traffic fatalities.[16] In Nova Scotia, winds gusted to 85\u00a0mph (137\u00a0km/h), which destroyed three boats and left two towns without power service. Rough seas killed six people in the province.[17]"

On October\u00a014, a tropical depression developed and moved northward. A day after forming, it intensified into Tropical Storm Ella as it began a track to the northwest, located east of a weakening upper-level trough. On October\u00a017, Ella strengthened further into a hurricane as an anticyclone was gradually developing. An approaching trough turned the hurricane to the east-northeast on October\u00a019, and later that day Ella attained its peak intensity of 110\u00a0mph (175\u00a0km/h); that made it the strongest hurricane of the season. It gradually weakened over cooler waters while accelerating to the northeast, and its eye grew to an unusually large diameter of 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km). Ella became extratropical on October\u00a022 over the northern Atlantic as it interacted with an approaching cold front. Shortly thereafter its remnants moved over Newfoundland before dissipating on October\u00a023.[6][3] Ella is historically notable for its role in the Cuban Missile Crisis. The storm greatly complicated naval operations relating to the 'quarantine' blockade of Cuba and badly damaged several Soviet nuclear-armed submarines en route to the island, contributing to the escalation of the B-59 Incident.[18] Early in its duration, Hurricane Ella briefly threatened to strike the North Carolina coastline. Although it remained offshore, the hurricane produced significant beach erosion along the coast. There were two associated deaths from a missing motor boat that left Charleston, South Carolina.[6] The crew of two was declared deceased after a Coast Guard, Navy, and Air Force search failed to locate their bodies.[19] There was no damage in Canada from its remnants.[20]"

A day later, an extratropical storm producing hurricane-force winds developed about 200\u00a0mi (320\u00a0km) south-southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. The storm remained nearly stationary for several days near the coast, drifting westward and later to the south. On November\u00a027, the storm's wind structure became more symmetric, with an inner core developing inside the larger extratropical low. Based on ship reports near the center, the system transitioned into a hurricane early on November\u00a028; due to its interaction with the extratropical storm, the system was potentially a subtropical cyclone, although the lack of satellite imagery prevented such a classification. By later on November\u00a028, the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm, affected by wind shear. By that point, the storm had turned to the east, followed by a turn to the northwest and later west-southwest on the next day. Late on November\u00a030, satellite imagery indicated an eye-like feature in the center of the storm. A day later, the storm re-intensified into a hurricane, reaching its peak intensity of 90\u00a0mph (150\u00a0km/h). On December\u00a02, the hurricane turned back to the southwest as it made its closest approach to the Outer Banks. Stronger wind shear caused the hurricane to weaken to a tropical storm again on December\u00a03, as an approaching cold front steered the storm northeastward. Two days later, the storm transitioned back into an extratropical storm to the east of the Outer Banks, briefly regaining hurricane intensity on December\u00a05. A day later, a larger extratropical storm over the northeastern United States absorbed the former hurricane.[9] For several days, the storm meandered off the southeast coast of the United States, producing high tides and beach erosion from Florida to Virginia; many of these areas were affected by a severe nor'easter in March 1962. The storm's interaction with a ridge to its northeast produced a strong pressure gradient, resulting in gale-force winds across the Virginia and North Carolina coast. In Virginia, a dredge involved in the construction of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge\u2013Tunnel broke loose and rain aground. During the storm's formative stages, it produced wind gusts of 89\u00a0mph (143\u00a0km/h) on Oak Island, North Carolina. High waves washed away dunes, wrecked coastal houses, and sank several boats, including a ferry. The storm washed out a temporary bridge and deepened a temporary inlet on Hatteras Island north of Buxton, both the aftermath of the March 1962 storm. As a tropical cyclone, the hurricane produced tropical storm force winds along the North Carolina coast. Rainfall associated with the storm was generally light, except for portions of the Outer Banks and in Georgia.[9]"

It moved slowly to the north-northwest around a ridge without intensifying beyond winds of 30\u00a0mph (45\u00a0km/h). The system encountered wind shear throughout its duration, which displaced the convection from the center to its northeast. The depression struck just west of the Texas/Louisiana border on August\u00a029 before dissipating on August\u00a030. Rainfall in Texas was minimal, estimated around 1\u00a0in (25\u00a0mm). However, heavy amounts of precipitation fell across Louisiana, peaking at 23.13\u00a0in (588\u00a0mm) near Hackberry. Rainfall extended northeastward through Arkansas and Missouri.[3][21] On August\u00a029 as the depression moved ashore, heavy rainfall caused street flooding in Cameron, Louisiana. Two tornadoes were reported in the town, one of which produced winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h).[22] The storms damaged 115\u00a0houses or trailers, of which one was destroyed. There were 30\u00a0people injured, of whom 18\u00a0required hospital attention,[23] and there were three deaths.[22] An upper-level low spawned a tropical depression off the west coast of Florida on September\u00a020. The depression moved very slowly to the north-northwest, which produced heavy rainfall from Naples to Tampa, Florida. The highest total was 16.60\u00a0in (422\u00a0mm) in Sarasota, although precipitation of over 1\u00a0in (25\u00a0mm) extended into Georgia and extreme southern South Carolina. A developing cyclone off the Carolinas caused the dissipation of the depression on September\u00a023.[3][24] The rains resulted in 3\u00a0ft (0.91\u00a0m) of floodwaters across western Florida,[25] and both the Manatee River and the Phillippi Creek experienced record crests. The flooding entered over 5,000\u00a0houses,[26] which forced the evacuation of more than 100\u00a0families. The floods also caused schools to close in three counties.[27] In addition, floodwaters affected thousands of acres of farmlands in six counties, and some did not dry out for several weeks.[26] Wind gusts reached 58\u00a0mph (93\u00a0km/h) in eastern Florida, and more than 20,000\u00a0people were left without power.[27] There was one death in the state related to the storm, and damage was estimated at $2.78\u00a0million.[26]"

The sixth tropical cyclone, third designated tropical depression, and second named storm of the season, Bret developed as a subtropical storm from a large area of frontal clouds near Bermuda on June\u00a029. Moving westward, the subtropical storm intensified while producing deep convection, and was consequently reclassified as a tropical storm early on June\u00a030. Around that time, Bret peaked with sustained winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h). The storm then began weakening and struck near Oyster, Virginia as a minimal tropical storm early on July\u00a01. Upon moving inland, Bret weakened to a tropical depression and subsequently accelerated prior to dissipating over northern Virginia that same day. In its early stages, Bret dropped light rainfall on Bermuda, peaking at 3.34 inches (85\u00a0mm). Impact in the United States was generally minor. In Virginia, the storm produced up to 4.48 inches (114\u00a0mm) of rain in Big Meadows section of Shenandoah National Park. Along the coast, minor beach erosion occurred due to tides up to 0.9 feet (0.27\u00a0m) above normal. In western Pennsylvania, locally heavy rainfall flooded some streets and basements. Elsewhere, Bret dropped 1 to 3 inches (25 to 76\u00a0mm) of precipitation to several states. One fatality was confirmed after a woman was killed by rip currents at Nags Head, North Carolina."

Thus, the system was designated as a subtropical storm at 1200\u00a0UTC on June\u00a029, while centered approximately 575 miles (925\u00a0km) east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. The system continued to gain convection and intensify while tracking westward toward the Mid-Atlantic states at a forward speed of 20\u00a0mph (32\u00a0km/h). Early on June\u00a030, a well-defined atmospheric circulation became apparent on infrared satellite imagery. As a result, subtropical storm transitioned into Tropical Storm Bret later that day at 0600\u00a0UTC.[1] Upon becoming a tropical cyclone early on June\u00a030, Bret attained maximum sustained winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h). About six hours later, at 1200\u00a0UTC, the storm also attained its minimum barometric pressure of 996\u00a0mbar (29.4\u00a0inHg).[1] Around 2200\u00a0UTC on June\u00a030, a reconnaissance aircraft flight observed hurricane-force winds, though Bret was not upgraded to a hurricane because the minimum barometric pressure was considered too high.[2] About an hour later, the National Hurricane Center noted that Bret was moving westward toward Virginia at 20\u00a0mph (25\u00a0km/h) and entering a region of colder sea surface temperatures, causing further intensification to become unlikely.[3] Subsequently, the storm curved west-northwestward and rapidly weakened. At 0500\u00a0UTC on July\u00a01, Bret made landfall near Oyster, Virginia on the Delmarva Peninsula as a minimal tropical storm. About an hour later, the storm emerged into the Chesapeake Bay and weakened to a tropical depression. Later on July\u00a01, Bret moved inland over mainland Virginia and continued to weaken, until dissipating over the northern portion of the state.[1]"

At 2000\u00a0UTC on June\u00a030, a gale-force warning was issued for a portion of the North Carolina coastline extending from Cape Hatteras northward, including Albemarle and Pamlico sounds.[5] Simultaneously, another gale warning was issued for areas along the Chesapeake Bay south of the Patuxent River in Maryland and on the east coast from Ocean City, Maryland to Virginia Beach, Virginia.[6] Around 0300\u00a0UTC on July\u00a01, all gale warnings were discontinued in North Carolina,[7] while the remaining warnings in Maryland and Virginia were canceled about five hours later.[8] Additionally, a small craft advisory was also posted for the North Carolina and Virginia coastlines.[5] Officials in North Carolina closed off beaches at Nags Head, Kitty Hawk, and Kill Devil Hills from swimmers due to rip currents and tides.[9] After Bret dissipated, the small craft warning remained in effect and mariners were told to remain in port until the weather calmed.[10] In Virginia, Bret produced relatively light rainfall, peaking at 4.48 inches (114\u00a0mm) in Big Meadows, a section of Shenandoah National Park.[4] At the time of Bret's landfall, portions of the Mid-Atlantic states were experiencing a strong drought, though the amounts of precipitation were not enough for farmers in Virginia to save their crops.[11] In Virginia Beach, local street flooding and a brief tornado were reported.[12] Minor beach erosion occurred in the area due to tides reaching about 0.9 feet (0.27\u00a0m) above normal.[13] One fatality was confirmed in North Carolina when a woman was killed after getting stuck in rip currents at Nags Head. Offshore, two boats lost contact with the Coast Guard during the approach to land, one of which washed up at Cape May, New Jersey and the other on the Virginia coast.[14] The Coast Guard began cleanup of an oil spill at Nags Head caused by Bret off the coast. About 8 miles (13\u00a0km) of the shoreline was filled with oil, little of which polluted the water. Most of the oil was thin and easily cleanup private contractor.[15] Locally heavy rainfall in western Pennsylvania flooded streets and basements in some areas, with up to 4 inches (100\u00a0mm) of precipitation in Brookville.[16] Elsewhere, Bret dropped 1 to 3 inches (25 to 76\u00a0mm) of precipitation in several states.[17] Overall, no considerable damage was reported.[1]"

The area, which is a fertile agricultural valley, threatened the livelihoods of some 57,000 people.[3] The flooding had begun as in other places in late July but storms in early September struck the region worse. More than 25,000 hectares of crop land was inundated, killing some 30,000 animals and flooding 18,000 homes in the commune.[3] Approximately  2,000 people were displaced in the communities of  Azowliss\u00e9, D\u00e8m\u00e8, Gangban, Kog\u00e9 and Togbota with the exception of Awonou, located further away from the river. According to one council official, while Benin often experiences flooding, notably in 1995 and 2007, the floods of 2008 were particularly devastating on the livelihoods of the Beninois people, \"People cannot even eat three times a day now. Even to find food once a day is a headache. Normally, agricultural products are bought and sold here at decent prices. But now things have changed.\"[3] The regional mayor of Adjohoun, Gerard Adounsiba, requested a national funding appeal to provide food and medical in what was according to him,  \"the largest humanitarian crisis in the region to date.\"[3] The situation was made worse by the fact that the hospitals in the area were affected by flooding.[3] Livelihoods of local fisherman which depend upon the river were also severely affected."

The low moved southwest towards the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula over the next day, as a tropical wave drifted westwards from the Caribbean Sea.[1] The interaction between the upper-level system and the wave led to the formation of a tropical depression on August 26 around 460 miles (740\u00a0km) south of New Orleans.[1][2] At first the depression drifted westward but, as the western periphery of a high-pressure area weakened, it tracked towards the north and slowly strengthened. After a reconnaissance aircraft found surface winds of 45\u00a0mph (70\u00a0km/h) on August 28, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Debra. The aircraft also recorded a minimum pressure of 1002 mbar (hPa; 29.59 inHg).[1][2][3] While Debra approached the coast of Louisiana, an additional flight into the system found a drop in surface pressure to 1000\u00a0mbar\u00a0(hPa; 29.53\u00a0inHg), as well as peak winds of approximately 60\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h) at 00:00\u00a0GMT on August\u00a029.[1][2][4] Observation stations off the coast recorded sustained winds of 45\u201350\u00a0mph (70\u201380\u00a0km/h) on August\u00a028, as Debra passed 150 miles (240\u00a0km) to the west.[2][3][4] The storm made landfall between Beaumont, Texas, and Lake Charles, Louisiana, on August 28.[4] Two stations recorded surface pressures of 1002\u00a0mbar\u00a0(hPa; (29.59\u00a0inHg)).[3] As Debra moved north-northeast through Louisiana and Arkansas, the central pressure rose slightly. In south central Arkansas the residual low pressure system merged with a frontal trough on August\u00a029; the frontal wave drifted into southern Illinois and traveled eastbound into the Ohio Valley for the next three days.[2][4] Five tornadoes were reported from the system in Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi shortly after Debra's landfall.[note 1]"

In addition, weak upper-level winds, normal for the summer in the region, made it so the storm barely moved locations.[17] Mesoscale convections were reported to be frequently moving over Zhengzhou, which cause intense thunderstorms.[18] According to the China Meteorological Administration, the two main reasons for the storm were Typhoon In-fa, which occurred 1,000 kilometres (620\u00a0mi) from Henan, and the continuous subtropical high pressure that guided a large amount of water vapor to the land. The high pressure was affected by the Taihang Mountains and other topographical areas, causing heavy relief rain in the province.[19]"

        "content": " Typhoon In-fa, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Fabian, was a very large and costly tropical cyclone that brought record amounts of rainfall to China in July 2021, becoming the second-wettest tropical cyclone ever recorded in the country. It was also the first storm to impact the city of Shanghai since Typhoon Mitag of 2019.[1] The ninth depression, sixth tropical storm and third typhoon of the 2021 Pacific typhoon season, the system was first noted by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center as an area of low pressure, located east of the Philippines on July 14. Favorable conditions helped the storm to intensify, becoming a tropical depression, two days later and a tropical storm on July 17, being assigned the name In-fa by the Japan Meteorological Agency. Located in a weak steering environment, the system struggled to organize under dry air and moderate wind shear before organizing further. It continued to move mostly westward, strengthening into a typhoon and deepening quickly. The storm struggled to organize itself significantly due to continuous dry air intrusions and its frequent motion changes. On July 21, it reached its peak intensity according to the JTWC with winds of 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph); the JMA estimated a lower numbers of 150\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph) on the system. Nevertheless, the system reached its minimum barometric pressure of 950\u00a0hPa (28.05\u00a0inHg), three days later after passing through the Ryukyu's. As the system entered the East China Sea, marginal conditions started to take toll on the system, with In-fa weakening steadily and slowly, until it made its consecutive landfalls over Putuo District of Zhoushan and Pinghu on July 25 and 26, respectively, as a tropical storm. For the next couple of days, the storm slowly moved inland while gradually weakening, before turning northward on July 29. Later that day, In-fa weakened into a remnant low over northern China. The remnants continued their northward trek for another couple of days, before dissipating near North Korea on July 31. In-fa caused rough waves along the Japanese islands, along with torrential rainfall and high winds, highly damaging and downing many structures, killing one person. The Philippines experienced flooding due to heavy rainfall, and some winds, resulting in the death of five people. China experienced widespread impacts in agriculture, infrastructure, transportation, and other areas. The typhoon brought flooding rainfall and storm surge to a large area, with some regions experiencing nearly a month's worth of rainfall in just one to two days. Rivers overflowed and some floodwaters were up to the roofs of cars. The storm exacerbated and played a part in starting the 2021 Henan floods, killing at least 302 people and dealing upwards of 82 billion yuan (US$12.7 billion) in damage. At least 50 are missing.[2][3] The typhoon itself has caused at least $1 billion in damages and 6 deaths.[4]"

        "content": "At 06:00 UTC of July 14, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)[nb 1] started to monitor a persistent area of convection, roughly associated with a low-level circulation center, located 484\u00a0nmi (895\u00a0km; 555\u00a0mi) west-northwest of Guam.[6] The disturbance was located in an environment conducive for tropical cyclogenesis, with warm 30\u201331\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u201388\u00a0\u00b0F) sea surface temperatures and good equatorial outflow due to a favorable configuration of an upper low over the western part of the mainland Japan and a tropical upper tropospheric trough (TUTT) to the northwest.[6] Later, it moved through an area of moderate wind shear which made the system's LLC broad while moving west-northwestward: the wind gradient slowly became conducive for the disturbance to slowly intensify.[7] At 20:30 UTC of the next day, the agency upgraded the system's potential trend of intensification to \"high\" and issued the disturbance's Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA).[8] At 00:00 UTC, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the disturbance to a depression,[9][nb 2] followed by the PAGASA's designation of the system as Tropical Depression Fabian as it was now inside of the Philippine Area of Responsibility, being the sixth tropical cyclone in the region in the season, three hours later[11][12] and the JTWC at 09:00 UTC.[13] Located in a complex steering environment, the storm resembled a monsoon depression at that time while moving slowly northwestward before turning northward, both steered by the western periphery of a deep-layered subtropical ridge to the east.[14][15][16] Later, a pocket of dry air from the western semicircle and upper-level westerlies disrupted the system, with the LLC becoming broad and exposed while slowly and steadily intensifying, with the evidence of cooling cloud tops. In addition, the depression was being moved northwestward by a compound monsoon gyre pattern and at the same time, a near-equatorial ridge before being guided by another subtropical ridge to the east of Honshu, still caught under a weak steering flow.[17][18][19] Four hours later, the PAGASA further designated Fabian to a tropical storm and being followed by the JMA at 18:00 UTC that day, being assigned the name In-fa.[20][21] The JTWC did the same at 03:00 UTC on July 18, with the storm remaining slow in motion due to now-weakening westerlies.[22] The PAGASA, meanwhile, reported that the system further intensified to a severe tropical storm at that time.[23] Although the low-level circulation center remained exposed while moving to the north-northwest, animated multispectral imageries on that day revealed a well-defined LLC with a symmetric area of large convection on the western edge and further centered on the central core.[24][25][26]"

        "content": "The large size of In-fa, combined with the continuous dry air entrainment, together restrained the system's rapid development over the warm waters of the Philippine Sea; however, as the storm continued its trajectory towards the Ryukyu Islands, the curved banding of the system further consolidated on its and a microwave eye feature started to emerge. At the same time, the system began to take a northwest track before moving west-northwestward under a subtropical ridge over Japan by the early hours of July 19.[27][28][29] At 00:00 UTC that day, the JMA further upgraded In-fa to a severe tropical storm.[30] The system, decelerates again as it started to impact the Ryukyu's, with In-fa's convection or thunderstorms deepening and an eye further appearing.[31][32] Six hours later, the PAGASA reported in their bulletins that In-fa further became a typhoon, while located approximately 895 kilometres to the east of extreme Northern Luzon.[33] The JTWC followed suit at 09:00 UTC that day and the JMA, three hours later.[34][35] As it passed south of Daito Islands, a 35-nautical-mile (65\u00a0km; 40\u00a0mi) eye was further evident on satellite imageries, which later shrunk; however, In-fa remained a high-end Category 1 system as it started to move westward and later, a west-southwest track.[34][36][37] As the eye started to enlarge again, with the Dvorak countings of T4.5-T5.0, the JTWC further upgraded In-fa to a mid-level Category 2 typhoon at 03:00 UTC on July 21 with winds of 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph); this made the system's peak intensity according to the JTWC's estimates.[38] Radar imagery from Okinawa Island showed a large and clear eye, though at the same time, another satellite imagery revealed an eyewall that was disrupted due to continuous dry air intrusions while moving westward.[39] Later, as it shifted its motion west-southwestward, In-fa's eye became ragged due to another intrusion of dry air. Furthermore, dry northerlies suppressed the system as it dived southward.[40][41] At 03:00 UTC of the next day, In-fa started an eyewall replacement cycle while its northern quadrant started to weaken as it changed its motion yet again to the south-southwest. In addition, the system is being steered by the southern periphery of a high-amplitude ridge over the Sea of Japan. Six hours later, the typhoon started to weaken with its eye expanding and weakening banding on the system while tracking westward and further, northwestward at a slow motion rate.[42][43][44] Its steering movements were caused by a subtropical ridge to the north and another one over the east coast of North Korea. As it continued to approach the Ryukyus while traveling from the northwest, In-fa further weakened to a high-level Category 1 system due to continuous upwelling, its suppressed outflow and slowly cooling sea surface temperatures.[45][46] By 15:00 UTC of July 23, In-fa passed between the Tarama Island and Miyako-jima Island, with its remaining large eye passing over the latter as it slightly shifted its movement towards the north-northwest. The system further degraded to a tropical storm according to the estimates of JTWC, six hours later as it slowly moved away from the Ryukyu Islands and the convection on the eye was not continuous while subsequently entering the East China Sea.[47][48] By 03:00 UTC on the next day, In-fa reintensified to a low-end Category 1 system as it reformed its convective depths and continued to maintain a ragged eye while moving northward.[49] Six hours later (23:00 PST of July 23), In-fa left the PAR, with the PAGASA issuing its last bulletin while located, 640 kilometres to the north-northeast of Itbayat, Batanes.[50] The JMA then analysed that In-fa further reached its peak with maximum sustained winds of 150\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 950\u00a0hPa (28.05\u00a0inHg), three hours later.[51]"

In their last warning on the system, the agency assessed the system as a weak tropical storm.[60] Meanwhile, the JMA downgraded the system to a tropical storm by 12:00 UTC of that day due to further weakening of the storm by the means of land interaction.[61] At 00:00 UTC of the next day, the JMA reported that In-fa further degraded to a tropical depression while moving west-northwest, with its center located at Shou County, Anhui Province.[62] Over the next few days, it moved north and subsequently entered Shandong before turning north-northeast while subsequently slowing down.[63][64] By 06:00 UTC of July 29, the system turned northward yet again before being further downgraded by JMA as a low-pressure area, twelve hours later as it shifted its movement northeastward.[65][66] The remnants of In-fa entered the Bohai Sea later that night.[67]"

Pudong and Minhang districts experienced power outages and other issues.[158][159] Warehouses in Zhengzhou were forced to stop container loading, as well as deliveries to terminals. A large amount of cargo stuck at Pudong, according to Metro Shipping, with weather conditions preventing carriers to recover the material. Traffic and road transport had been affected by flooding in the whole region, with at least 6\u00a0km of road inundated by storm surge.[116] A rail freight train going from China to Europe was disrupted while cargo was being reconfigured to other substitute terminals, adding pressure to already heavy-hit shipping industry. Rail, air, and ocean freight was also disrupted.[160][161][162] In Shanghai, 268 signs and billboards were felled by July 26. Many businesses were temporarily closed due to the storm while nearly 500,000 people were moved to shelters on the same day. 12,700 people were also still out of power, with upwards of 100,000 without power in total.[115] Losses to agriculture were expected to be heavy.[163] Several meter-high waves were reported on the Qiantang river in Haining. Heavy rain and gales also affected coastal areas in Qidong, Jiangsu, damaging properties there. The six ultra-large offshore engineering platforms that were under construction were also affected by In-fa. Waterlogging was recorded in streets in Shanghai.[116] Pictures showed floodwaters reaching the tops of cars.[164] Up to 300\u00a0mm (12\u00a0in) of rainfall fell in Jiangsu province.

Li Changxun, a Henan emergency response official, stated on July 24 that the province would need a large-scale cleaning and disinfecting to prevent epidemics after floods (the \u201cepidemic\u201d here refers to common outbreaks that always happen after floods,[166] not related to COVID-19). Various pictures published by state media and government social media accounts on the same day showed workers shoveling mud and removing uprooted trees.[106] At least 12,000 temporary shelters had opened across Zhejiang Province.[167] Emergency anti-typhoon vessels were put in place to protect the six construction projects, including two high-horsepower tugboats. Strengthening to chains and cables was also done. As of July 25, a total of 97,915 people were evacuated to safe areas in Jiangsu when the typhoon hit.[116] Photos that surfaced showed migrant workers in shelters during In-fa.[164] Due to In-fa's impacts, Salmon's prices in Shanghai had jumped to 135 yuan ($20.75) per kilogram.[168] Firefighters rescued those who had been trapped by flooding in Zheijang province. Footage showed firefighters saving 45 trapped locals. Another part of the video was released that showed crews saving a motorist trapped in an overturned vehicle.[169] Various pumps were used to drain out rainwater from floods in Weihui city.[170] Health authorities started a campaign on July 28 to help Mosquito prevention. Due to In-fa's flooding bringing highly moist conditions, many areas became ripe breeding grounds for the insects. It was said to be going from July 29 to 31. Wet markets, old residential complexes, and construction sites were of particular concern.[171] Coal mining in the country was prioritized after the typhoon made landfall, due to large-scale blackouts. State run miners had collectively sent increased supplies of thermal coal to 27 different power plants around Henan province. Over 340,000 tons of thermal coal reached the province during July 26, highly exceeding the daily amount needed. Coal operations were also quickened in other regions, such as the Yangtze River Delta Area.[172] Footage released by Jiangsu Fire shows efforts by rescue crews to drain floodwater around the province.[165] China's top economic planner collected 795 million yuan ($122.4 million) for reconstruction in regions of several provinces impacted by the typhoon and floods.

        "content": "Hubei[a] is an inland province of China, and is part of the Central China region. The name of the province means \"north of the lake\", referring to its position north of Dongting Lake.[7] The provincial capital, Wuhan, serves as a major transportation hub and the political, cultural, and economic hub of central China. Hubei's name is officially abbreviated to \"\u9102\" (\u00c8), an ancient name associated with the eastern part of the province since the State of E of the Western Zhou dynasty of c.\u20091045\u2013771 BCE; a popular name for Hubei is \"\u695a\" (Ch\u01d4) (suggested by that of the powerful State of Chu, which existed in the area during the Eastern Zhou dynasty of 770 \u2013 256 BCE). Hubei borders the provinces of Henan to the north, Anhui to the east, Jiangxi to the southeast, Hunan to the south, Chongqing to the west, and Shaanxi to the northwest. The high-profile Three Gorges Dam is located at Yichang, in the west of the province. Hubei is the 7th-largest provincial economy of China, the second largest in the Central China region, the third largest in the South Central China region and the third largest among inland provinces. As of 2021[update], Hubei's nominal GDP was US$787 billion (CNY 5 trillion) and its GDP (nominal) per capita exceeded US$13,000, making it the richest landlocked province, the richest province in the Central China region, and 2nd richest province in South Central China region after Guangdong.[8]"

        "header": "History",
        "content": "The Hubei region was home to sophisticated Neolithic cultures.[9][10] By the Spring and Autumn period (770\u2013476 BC), the territory of today's Hubei formed part of the powerful State of Chu. Chu, nominally a tributary state of the Zhou dynasty, was itself an extension of the Chinese civilization that had emerged some centuries before in the north; but Chu also represented a culturally unique blend of northern and southern culture, and it developed into a powerful state that controlled much of the middle and lower Yangtze River, with its power extending northwards into the North China Plain.[11] During the Warring States period (475\u2013221 BC) Chu became the major adversary of the upstart State of Qin to the northwest (in present-day Guanzhong, Shaanxi province), which began to assert itself by outward expansionism. As wars between Qin and Chu ensued, Chu lost more and more land: first its dominance over the Sichuan Basin, then (in 278 BC) its heartland, which correspond to modern Hubei.[12][13] In 223 BC Qin chased down the remnants of the Chu regime, which had fled eastwards during Qin's wars of uniting China.[14] Qin founded the Qin dynasty in 221 BC, the first unified dynasty in China. The Qin dynasty was succeeded in 206 BC by the Han dynasty, which established the province (zhou) of Jingzhou in today's Hubei and Hunan. The Qin and Han played an active role in the extension of farmland in Hubei, maintaining a system of river dikes to protect farms from summer floods.[15] Towards the end of the Eastern Han dynasty in the beginning of the 3rd century, Jingzhou was ruled by regional warlord Liu Biao. After his death in 208, Liu Biao's realm was surrendered by his successors to Cao Cao, a powerful warlord who had conquered nearly all of north China; but in the Battle of Red Cliffs (208 or 209), warlords Liu Bei and Sun Quan drove Cao Cao out of Jingzhou. Liu Bei then took control of Jingzhou and appointed Guan Yu as administrator of Xiangyang (in modern Xiangyang, Hubei) to guard Jing province; he went on to conquer Yizhou (the Sichuan Basin), but lost Jingzhou to Sun Quan; for the next few decades Jingzhou was controlled by the Wu Kingdom, ruled by Sun Quan and his successors.[16] The incursion of northern nomadic peoples into the region at the beginning of the 4th century (Five Barbarians' rebellion and Disaster of Yongjia\n(\u6c38\u5609\u4e4b\u4e71)) began nearly three centuries of division into a nomad-ruled (but increasingly Sinicized) north and a Han Chinese-ruled south. Hubei, to the south, remained under southern rule for this entire period, until the unification of China by the Sui dynasty in 589. In 617 the Tang dynasty replaced Sui, and later on the Tang dynasty placed present-day Hubei under the jurisdiction of several circuits: Jiangnanxi Circuit in the south; Shannandong Circuit (\u5c71\u5357\u4e1c\u9053) in the west, and Huainan Circuit in the east. After the Tang dynasty disintegrated in the early 10th century, Hubei came under the control of several regional regimes: Jingnan in the center, Yang Wu and its successor Southern Tang to the east, the Five Dynasties to the north and Shu to Shizhou (\u65bd\u5dde, in modern Enshi, Enshi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture).[17][citation needed] The Song dynasty reunified the region in 982 and placed most of Hubei into Jinghubei Circuit, a longer version of Hubei's current name. Mongols conquered the region in 1279, and under their rule the province of Huguang was established, covering Hubei, Hunan, and parts of Guangdong and Guangxi.[citation needed] During the Mongol rule, in 1331, Hubei was devastated by an outbreak of the Black Death, which reached England, Belgium, and Italy by June 1348, and which, according to Chinese sources, spread during the following three centuries to decimate populations throughout Eurasia.[18] The Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644) drove out the Mongols in 1368. Their version of Huguang province was smaller, and corresponded almost entirely to the modern provinces of Hubei and Hunan combined. Hubei lay geographically outside the centers of the Ming power. During the last years of the Ming, today's Hubei was ravaged several times by the rebel armies of Zhang Xianzhong and Li Zicheng. The Manchu Qing dynasty which took control of much of the region in 1644, soon split Huguang into the modern provinces of Hubei and Hunan. The Qing dynasty, however, continued to maintain a Viceroy of Huguang, one of the most well-known viceroys being Zhang Zhidong (in office between 1889 and 1907), whose modernizing reforms made Hubei (especially Wuhan) into a prosperous center of commerce and industry. The Huangshi/Daye area, south-east of Wuhan, became an important center of mining and metallurgy.[citation needed] In 1911 the Wuchang Uprising took place in modern-day Wuhan. The uprising started the Xinhai Revolution, which overthrew the Qing dynasty and established the Republic of China. In 1927 Wuhan became the seat of a government established by left-wing elements of the Kuomintang, led by Wang Jingwei; this government later merged into Chiang Kai-shek's government in Nanjing. During World War II the eastern parts of Hubei were conquered and occupied by Japan, while the western parts remained under Chinese control.[citation needed] During the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s, Wuhan saw fighting between rival Red Guard factions. In July 1967, civil strife struck the city in the Wuhan Incident (\"July 20th Incident\"), an armed conflict between two hostile groups who were fighting for control over the city at the height of the Cultural Revolution.[19] As the fears of a nuclear war increased during the time of Sino-Soviet border conflicts in the late 1960s, the Xianning prefecture of Hubei was chosen as the site of Project 131, an underground military-command headquarters.[20] The province\u2014and Wuhan in particular\u2014suffered severely from the 1954 Yangtze River Floods. Large-scale dam construction followed, with the Gezhouba Dam on the Yangtze River near Yichang started in 1970 and completed in 1988; the construction of the Three Gorges Dam, further upstream, began in 1993. In the following years, authorities resettled millions of people from western Hubei to make way for the construction of the dam. A number of smaller dams have been constructed on the Yangtze's tributaries as well.[citation needed] The Xianning Nuclear Power Plant is planned in Dafanzhen, Tongshan County, Xianning, to host at least four 1,250-megawatt (MW) AP1000 pressurized-water reactors.\nWork on the site began in 2010; plans envisaged that the first reactor would start construction in 2011 and go online in 2015. However, construction of the first phase had yet to start as of 2018[update].[citation needed] On 1 December 2019, the first case of COVID-19 in the COVID-19 pandemic was identified in the city of Wuhan. In January 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 virus was officially identified, leading local and federal governments to implement massive quarantine zones across Hubei province, especially in the capital Wuhan (the epicenter of the outbreak). Authorities partially or fully locked down 15 cities, directly affecting 57 million people. Following severe outbreaks in numerous other countries, including in different areas of the world, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 a pandemic in March 2020. However, after more than eight weeks, the lockdown on most cities in the province was lifted.[citation needed]"

        "content": "The Jianghan Plain takes up most of central and southern Hubei, while the west and the peripheries are more mountainous, with ranges such as the Wudang Mountains, the Jing Mountains, the Daba Mountains, and the Wu Mountains (in rough north-to-south order). The Dabie Mountains lie to the northeast of the Jianghan Plain, on the border with Henan and Anhui; the Tongbai Mountains lie to the north on the border with Henan; to the southeast, the Mufu Mountains form the border with Jiangxi. The highest peak in Hubei is Shennong Peak, found in the Daba Mountains of the forestry area of Shennongjia; it has an altitude of 3105 m.[21] The two major rivers of Hubei are the Yangtze River and its left tributary, the Han River; they lend their names to the Jianghan Plain \u2013 Jiang representing the Yangtze and han representing the Han River. The Yangtze River enters Hubei from the west via the Three Gorges; the eastern half of the Three Gorges (Xiling Gorge and part of Wu Gorge) lie in western Hubei, while the western half is in neighbouring Chongqing. The Han River enters the province from the northwest. After crossing most of the province, the two great rivers meet at the center of Wuhan, the provincial capital. Among the notable tributaries of the Yangtze within the province are the Shen Nong Stream (a small northern tributary, severely affected by the Three Gorges Dam project); the Qing, a major waterway of southwestern Hubei; the Huangbo near Yichang; and the Fushui River in the southeast.[citation needed] Thousands of lakes dot the landscape of Hubei's Jianghan Plain, giving Hubei the name of \"Province of Lakes\"; the largest of these lakes are Liangzi Lake and Hong Lake. The numerous hydrodams have created a number of large reservoirs, the largest of which is the Danjiangkou Reservoir on the Han River, on the border between Hubei and Henan.[citation needed] Hubei has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa or Cwa under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification), with four distinct seasons. Winters are cool to cold, with average temperatures of 1 to 6\u00a0\u00b0C (34 to 43\u00a0\u00b0F) in January, while summers are hot and humid, with average temperatures of 24 to 30\u00a0\u00b0C (75 to 86\u00a0\u00b0F) in July; punishing temperatures of 40\u00a0\u00b0C (104\u00a0\u00b0F) or above are widely associated with Wuhan, the provincial capital. The mountainous districts of western Hubei, in particular Shennongjia, with their cooler summers, attract numerous visitors from Wuhan and other lowland cities.[citation needed] Besides the capital Wuhan, other important cities are Jingmen; Shiyan, a center of automotive industry and the gateway to the Wudang Mountains; Yichang, the main base for the gigantic hydroelectric projects of southwestern Hubei; and Shashi.[citation needed]"

The province's recoverable reserves of coal stand at 548 million tons, which is modest compared to other Chinese provinces. Hubei is well known for its mines of fine turquoise and green faustite.[citation needed] Since completion in 2012, the Three Gorges Dam in western Hubei provides plentiful hydroelectricity, with an average annual power production of 95 Twh. Existing hydroelectric stations include Gezhouba, Danjiangkou, Geheyan, Hanjiang, Duhe, Huanglongtan, Bailianhe, Lushui and Fushui. Hubei is the 7th-largest provincial economy of China, the second largest in the Central China region after Henan, the third largest in the South Central China region after Guangdong and Henan and the third largest among inland provinces after Henan and Sichuan. As of 2021[update], Hubei's nominal GDP was US$787 billion (CNY 5 trillion).

        "content": " Inner Mongolia,[a] officially the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region,[b] is an autonomous region of the People's Republic of China. Its border includes two-thirds of the length of China's border with the country of Mongolia. Inner Mongolia also accounts for a small section of China's border with Russia (Zabaykalsky Krai). Its capital is Hohhot; other major cities include Baotou, Chifeng, Tongliao, and Ordos. The autonomous region was established in 1947, incorporating the areas of the former Republic of China provinces of Suiyuan, Chahar, Rehe, Liaobei, and Xing'an, along with the northern parts of Gansu and Ningxia. Its area makes it the third largest Chinese administrative subdivision, constituting approximately 1,200,000\u00a0km2 (463,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) and 12% of China's total land area. Due to its long span from east to west, Inner Mongolia is geographically divided into eastern and western divisions. The eastern division is often included in Northeastern China (Dongbei), with major cities including Tongliao, Chifeng, Hailar, and Ulanhot. The western division is included in North China, with major cities including Baotou and Hohhot. It recorded a population of 24,706,321 in the 2010 census, accounting for 1.84% of Mainland China's total population. Inner Mongolia is the country's 23rd most populous province-level division.[7] Han Chinese make up the majority of the population in the region; Mongols constitute a significant minority with over 4 million people,[8] making it the largest Mongol population in the world (larger than that of the country Mongolia).[9] Inner Mongolia is one of the more economically developed provinces in China with annual GDP per capita at US$14,343 (2022), ranked 8th in the nation. The official languages are Mandarin and Mongolian, the latter of which is written in the traditional Mongolian script, as opposed to the Mongolian Cyrillic alphabet, which is used in the country of Mongolia (formerly often described as Outer Mongolia)."

Inner Mongolia is distinct from Outer Mongolia, which was a term used by the Republic of China and previous governments to refer to what is now the independent state of Mongolia and the Republic of Tuva in Russia. The term Inner \u5185 (Nei) referred to the Nei Fan \u5185\u85e9 (Inner Tributary), i.e., those descendants of Genghis Khan who were granted the title khan (king) in the Ming and Qing dynasties and lived in part of southern Mongolia. Due to the perceived Sinocentric nature of the name \"Inner Mongolia\", some Mongols outside of China, particularly those in the state of Mongolia, prefer the name \"Southern Mongolia\". However, this name has not been adopted officially by any government bodies.[10]"

The historical narrative of what is now Eastern Inner Mongolia mostly consists of alternations between different Tungusic and Mongol tribes, rather than the struggle between nomads and Chinese farmers."

        "content": "Slab Grave cultural monuments are found in Northern, Central and Eastern Mongolia, Inner Mongolia, North-Western China, Southern, Central-Eastern and Southern Baikal territory. Mongolian scholars prove that this culture related to the Proto-Mongols.[11] During the Zhou dynasty, Central and Western Inner Mongolia (the Hetao region and surrounding areas) were inhabited by nomadic peoples such as the Loufan, Linhu and D\u00ed, while Eastern Inner Mongolia was inhabited by the Donghu. During the Warring States period, King Wuling (340\u2013295 BC) of the state of Zhao based in what is now Hebei and Shanxi Provinces pursued an expansionist policy towards the region. After destroying the D\u00ed state of Zhongshan in what is now Hebei province, he defeated the Linhu and Loufan and created the Yunzhong Commandery near modern Hohhot. King Wuling of Zhao also built a long wall stretching through the Hetao region. After Qin Shi Huang created the first unified Chinese empire in 221 BC, he sent the general Meng Tian to drive the Xiongnu from the region and incorporated the old Zhao wall into the Qin dynasty Great Wall of China. He also maintained two commanderies in the region: Jiuyuan and Yunzhong and moved 30,000 households there to solidify the region. After the Qin dynasty collapsed in 206 BC, these efforts were abandoned.[12] During the Western Han dynasty, Emperor Wu sent the general Wei Qing to reconquer the Hetao region from the Xiongnu in 127 BC. After the conquest, Emperor Wu continued the policy of building settlements in Hetao to defend against the Xiong-Nu. In that same year, he established the commanderies of Shuofang and Wuyuan in Hetao. At the same time, what is now Eastern Inner Mongolia was controlled by the Xianbei, who would, later on, eclipse the Xiongnu in power and influence. During the Eastern Han dynasty (25\u2013220 AD), Xiongnu who surrendered to the Han dynasty began to be settled in Hetao and intermingled with the Han immigrants in the area. Later on, during the Western Jin dynasty, it was a Xiongnu noble from Hetao, Liu Yuan, who established the Han Zhao kingdom in the region, thereby beginning the Sixteen Kingdoms period that saw the disintegration of northern China under a variety of Han and non-Han (including Xiongnu and Xianbei) regimes. The Sui dynasty (581\u2013618) and Tang dynasty (618\u2013907) re-established a unified Chinese empire and like their predecessors, they conquered and settled people into Hetao, though once again these efforts were aborted when the Tang empire began to collapse. Hetao (along with the rest of what now consists Inner Mongolia) was then taken over by the Liao dynasty founded by the Khitans, a nomadic people originally from what is now the southern part of Manchuria and Eastern Inner Mongolia. They were followed by the Western Xia of the Tanguts, who took control of what is now the western part of Inner Mongolia (including Western Hetao). The Khitans were later replaced by the Jurchens, precursors to the modern Manchus, who established the Jin dynasty over Manchuria and Northern China."

In 1271, Kublai Khan, the grandson of Genghis Khan established the Yuan dynasty. Kublai Khan's summer capital Shangdu (aka Xanadu) was located near present-day Dolonnor. During that time Ongud and Khunggirad peoples dominated the area of what is now Inner Mongolia. After the Yuan dynasty was overthrown by the Han-led Ming dynasty in 1368, the Ming captured parts of Inner Mongolia including Shangdu and Yingchang. The Ming rebuilt the Great Wall of China at its present location, which roughly follows the southern border of the modern Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (though it deviates significantly at the Hebei-Inner Mongolia border). The Ming established the Three Guards composed of the Mongols there. Soon after the Tumu incident in 1449, when the Oirat ruler Esen taishi captured the Chinese emperor, Mongols flooded south from Outer Mongolia to Inner Mongolia. Thus from then on until 1635, Inner Mongolia was the political and cultural center of the Mongols during the Northern Yuan dynasty.[13]"

        "content": "The eastern Mongol tribes near and in Manchuria, particularly the Khorchin and Southern Khalkha in today's Inner Mongolia intermarried, formed alliances with, and fought against the Jurchen tribes until Nurhaci, the founder of the new Jin dynasty, consolidated his control over all groups in the area in 1593.[14] The Manchus gained far-reaching control of the Inner Mongolian tribes in 1635, when Ligden Khan's son surrendered the Chakhar Mongol tribes to the Manchus. The Manchus subsequently invaded Ming China in 1644, bringing it under the control of their newly established Qing dynasty. Under the Qing dynasty (1644\u20131912), the Mongolian Plateau was administered in a different way for each region: The Inner Mongolian Chahar leader Ligdan Khan, a descendant of Genghis Khan, opposed and fought against the Qing until he died of smallpox in 1634. Thereafter, the Inner Mongols under his son Ejei Khan surrendered to the Qing. Ejei Khan was given the title of Prince (\u89aa\u738b; q\u012bn w\u00e1ng), and Inner Mongolian nobility became closely tied to the Qing royal family and intermarried with them extensively. Ejei Khan died in 1661 and was succeeded by his brother Abunai. After Abunai showed disaffection with Manchu Qing rule, he was placed under house arrest in 1669 in Shenyang and the Kangxi Emperor gave his title to his son Borni. Abunai then bid his time and then he and his brother Lubuzung revolted against the Qing in 1675 during the Revolt of the Three Feudatories, with 3,000 Chahar Mongol followers joining in on the revolt. The revolt was put down within two months, the Qing then crushed the rebels in a battle on 20 April 1675, killing Abunai and all his followers. Their title was abolished, all Chahar Mongol royal males were executed even if they were born to Manchu Qing princesses, and all Chahar Mongol royal females were sold into slavery except the Manchu Qing princesses. The Chahar Mongols were then put under the direct control of the Qing Emperor, unlike the other Inner Mongol leagues which maintained their autonomy. Despite officially prohibiting Han Chinese settlement on the Manchu and Mongol lands, by the 18th century the Qing decided to settle Han refugees from northern China who were suffering from famine, floods, and drought into Manchuria and Inner Mongolia. As a result, the Han Chinese farmed 500,000 hectares in Manchuria and tens of thousands of hectares in Inner Mongolia by the 1780s.[15] Ordinary Mongols were not allowed to travel outside their own leagues. Mongols were forbidden by the Qing from crossing the borders of their banners, even into other Mongol Banners and from crossing into neidi (the Han Chinese 18 provinces) and were given serious punishments if they did in order to keep the Mongols divided against each other to benefit the Qing.[16] Mongol pilgrims wanting to leave their banner's borders for religious reasons such as pilgrimage had to apply for passports to give them permission.[17] During the eighteenth century, growing numbers of Han Chinese settlers had illegally begun to move into the Inner Mongolian steppe. By 1791, there had been so many Han Chinese settlers in the Front Gorlos Banner that the jasak had petitioned the Qing government to legalise the status of the peasants who had already settled there.[18] During the nineteenth century, the Manchus were becoming increasingly sinicised and faced with the Russian threat, they began to encourage Han Chinese farmers to settle in both Mongolia and Manchuria. This policy was followed by subsequent governments. The railroads that were being built in these regions were especially useful to the Han Chinese settlers. Land was either sold by Mongol Princes, or leased to Han Chinese farmers, or simply taken away from the nomads and given to Han Chinese farmers. A group of Han Chinese during the Qing dynasty called \"Mongol followers\" immigrated to Inner Mongolia who worked as servants for Mongols and Mongol princes and married Mongol women. Their descendants continued to marry Mongol women and changed their ethnicity to Mongol as they assimilated into the Mongol people, an example of this were the ancestors of Li Shouxin. They distinguished themselves apart from \"true Mongols\" \u771f\u8499\u53e4.[19][20][21]"

Although almost all banners of Inner Mongolia recognised the Bogd Khan as the supreme ruler of Mongols, the internal strife within the region prevented a full reunification. The Mongol rebellions in Inner Mongolia were counterbalanced by princes who hoped to see a restored Qing dynasty in Manchuria and Mongolia, as they considered the theocratic rule of the Bogd Khan would be against their modernising objectives for Mongolia.[22] Eventually, the newly formed Republic of China promised a new nation of five races (Han, Manchu, Mongol, Tibetan and Uyghur).[23] and suppressed the Mongol rebellions in the area.[24][25] The Republic of China reorganised Inner Mongolia into provinces: Some Republic of China maps still show this structure. The history of Inner Mongolia during the Second World War is complicated, with Japanese invasion and different kinds of resistance movements. In 1931, Manchuria came under the control of the Japanese puppet state Manchukuo, taking some Mongol areas in the Manchurian provinces (i.e., Hulunbuir and Jirim leagues) along. Rehe was also incorporated into Manchukuo in 1933, taking Juu Uda and Josutu leagues along with it. These areas were occupied by Manchukuo until the end of World War II in 1945. In 1937, the Empire of Japan openly and fully invaded the Republic of China. On 8 December 1937, Mongolian Prince Demchugdongrub (also known as \"De Wang\") declared independence for the remaining parts of Inner Mongolia (i.e., the Suiyuan and Chahar provinces) as Mengjiang, and signed agreements with Manchukuo and Japan. Its capital was established at Zhangbei (now in Hebei province), with the Japanese puppet government's control extending as far west as the Hohhot region. The Japanese advance was defeated by Hui Muslim General Ma Hongbin at the Battle of West Suiyuan and Battle of Wuyuan. Since 1945, Inner Mongolia has remained part of China. The Mongol Ulanhu fought against the Japanese. Ethnic Mongolian guerrilla units were created by the Kuomintang Nationalists to fight against the Japanese during the war in the late 30s and early 40s. These Mongol militias were created by the Ejine and Alashaa based commissioner's offices created by the Kuomintang.[26][27] Prince Demchugdongrub's Mongols were targeted by Kuomintang Mongols to defect to the Republic of China. The Nationalists recruited 1,700 ethnic minority fighters in Inner Mongolia and created war zones in the Tumet Banner, Ulanchab League, and Ordos Yekejuu League.[26][28] The Inner Mongolian People's Republic was founded shortly after the Second World War. It existed from 9 September 1945 until 6 November 1945."

By the end of WWII, the Inner Mongolian faction of the ComIntern had a functional militia and actively opposed the attempts at independence by De Wang's Chinggisid princes on the grounds of fighting feudalism. Following the end of World War II, the Chinese Communists gained control of Manchuria as well as the Inner Mongolian Communists with decisive Soviet support and established the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in 1947. The Comintern army was absorbed into the People's Liberation Army. Initially, the autonomous region included just the Hulunbuir region. Over the next decade, as the communists established the People's Republic of China and consolidated control over mainland China, Inner Mongolia was expanded westwards to include five of the six original leagues (except Josutu League, which remains in Liaoning province), the northern part of the Chahar region, by then a league as well (southern Chahar remains in Hebei province), the Hetao region, and the Alashan and Ejine banners. Eventually, nearly all areas with sizeable Mongol populations were incorporated into the region, giving present-day Inner Mongolia its elongated shape. The leader of Inner Mongolia during that time, as both regional CPC secretary and head of regional government, was Ulanhu. During the Cultural Revolution, the administration of Ulanhu was purged, and a wave of repressions was initiated against the Mongol population of the autonomous region.[29] Among the victims in Inner Mongolia, 75 per cent were Mongols, even though they only constituted 10 per cent of the population.[30] In 1969, much of Inner Mongolia was distributed among surrounding provinces, with Hulunbuir divided between Heilongjiang and Jilin, Jirim going to Jilin, Juu Uda to Liaoning, and the Alashan and Ejine region divided among Gansu and Ningxia. This decision was reversed in 1979. Inner Mongolia was underdeveloped until the early 2000s, when huge mineral deposits including coal (such as Dongsheng Coalfield) and rare earth metals were discovered.[31]:\u200a47\u200a GDP growth has continually been over 10%, even 15% and connections with the Wolf Economy to the north has helped development. However, growth has come at a cost with huge amounts of pollution and degradation to the grasslands.[32] Attempts to attract ethnic Chinese to migrate from other regions, as well as urbanise those rural nomads and peasants has led to huge amounts of corruption and waste in public spending, such as Ordos City.[33][34] Acute uneven wealth distribution has further exacerbated ethnic tensions, many indigenous Mongolians feeling they are increasingly marginalised in their own homeland, leading to riots in 2011 and 2013.[35][36] On 31 August 2020, large protests broke out in ethnic Mongol communities due to unannounced plans by the Chinese government to phase out Mongolian-medium teaching.[37][38][39]"

It borders eight provincial-level divisions in all three of the aforementioned regions (Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Ningxia, and Gansu), tying with Shaanxi for the greatest number of bordering provincial-level divisions. Most of its international border is with Mongolia,[c] which, in Chinese, is sometimes called \"Outer Mongolia\", while a small portion is with Russia's Zabaykalsky Krai. Inner Mongolia largely consists of the northern side of the North China Craton, a tilted and sedimented Precambrian block. In the extreme southwest is the edge of the Tibetan Plateau where the autonomous region's highest peak, Main Peak in the Helan Mountains reaches 3,556 metres (11,670\u00a0ft), and is still being pushed up today in short bursts.[2] Most of Inner Mongolia is a plateau averaging around 1,200 metres (3,940\u00a0ft) in altitude and covered by extensive loess and sand deposits. The northern part consists of the Mesozoic era Khingan Mountains, and is owing to the cooler climate more forested, chiefly with Manchurian elm, ash, birch, Mongolian oak and a number of pine and spruce species. Where discontinuous permafrost is present north of Hailar District, forests are almost exclusively coniferous. In the south, the natural vegetation is grassland in the east and very sparse in the arid west, and grazing is the dominant economic activity. Owing to the ancient, weathered rocks lying under its deep sedimentary cover, Inner Mongolia is a major mining district, possessing large reserves of coal, iron ore and rare-earth minerals, which have made it a major industrial region today."

        "content": "Inner Mongolia is divided into twelve prefecture-level divisions. Until the late 1990s, most of Inner Mongolia's prefectural regions were known as leagues (Chinese: \u76df), a usage retained from Mongol divisions of the Qing dynasty. Similarly, county-level divisions are often known as banners (Chinese: \u65d7). Since the 1990s, numerous leagues have been converted into prefecture-level cities, although banners remain. The restructuring led to the conversion of primate cities in most leagues to convert to districts administratively (i.e.: Hailar, Jining and Dongsheng). Some newly founded prefecture-level cities have chosen to retain the original name of league (i.e.: Hulunbuir, Bayannur and Ulanqab), some have adopted the Chinese name of their primate city (Chifeng, Tongliao), and one league (Yekejuu) simply renamed itself Ordos. Despite these recent administrative changes, there is no indication that the Alxa, Hinggan, and Xilingol Leagues will convert to prefecture-level cities in the near future. These prefecture-level divisions are in turn subdivided into 102 county-level divisions, including 22 districts, 11 county-level cities, 17 counties, 49 banners, and 3 autonomous banners. Those are in turn divided into 1425 township-level divisions, including 532 towns, 407 townships, 277 sums, eighteen ethnic townships, one ethnic sum, and 190 subdistricts. At the end of 2017, the total population of Inner-Mongolia is 25.29 million.[46]"

Forestry and hunting are somewhat important in the Greater Khingan ranges in the east. Reindeer herding is carried out by Evenks in the Evenk Autonomous Banner. More recently, growing grapes and winemaking have become an economic factor in the Wuhai area. Mining-related industries are a major part of Inner Mongolia's economy.[31]:\u200a23\u200a Inner Mongolia has an abundance of resources especially coal, cashmere, natural gas, rare-earth elements, and has more deposits of naturally occurring niobium, zirconium and beryllium than any other province-level region in China. The region is also a source of crude oil, with sites such as the Xifeng oil field producing tens of thousands of barrels per day.[50] However, in the past, the exploitation and utilisation of resources were rather inefficient, which resulted in poor returns from rich resources. Inner Mongolia is also an important coal production base, with more than a quarter of the world's coal reserves located in the province.[51] It plans to double annual coal output by 2010 (from the 2005 volume of 260 million tons) to 500 million tons of coal a year.[52] Industry in Inner Mongolia has grown up mainly around coal, power generation, forestry-related industries, and related industries.\nInner Mongolia now encourages six competitive industries: energy, chemicals, metallurgy, equipment manufacturing, processing of farm (including dairy) produce, and high technology. Well-known Inner Mongolian enterprises include companies such as ERDOS, Yili, and Mengniu. As with much of China, economic growth has led to a boom in construction, including new commercial development and large apartment complexes. The GDP of Inner Mongolia in 2022 was CN\u00a52.3 trillion (US$344 billion in nominal),[53] with an average annual increase of 10% from the period 2010\u20132015. Its per capita GDP was CN\u00a596,474 (US$14,343 in nominal), ranking 8th among all the 31 provincial divisions of China.[53] The primary, secondary and tertiary industries contributed \u00a5265 billion ($39.45 billion), \u00a51.12 trillion ($167.1 billion) and \u00a5926 billion ($137.7 billion) to the GDP respectively.[53] In addition to its large reserves of natural resources, Inner Mongolia also has the largest usable wind power capacity in China[51] thanks to strong winds which develop in the province's grasslands. Some private companies have set up wind parks in parts of Inner Mongolia such as Bailingmiao, Hutengliang and Zhouzi. East of Jilantai, Inner Mongolia, there is a ballistic missile training area used by the People's Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) to train missile crews for mobile missile launchers, their support vehicles, and silo-based ballistic missiles.[54]"

As of May\u00a02023[update], the current party secretary is Sun Shaocheng. The Inner Mongolian government and its subsidiaries follow roughly the same structure as that of a Chinese province. With regards to economic policy, as a part of increased federalism characteristics in China, Inner Mongolia has become more independent in implementing its own economic roadmap. The position of Chairman of Inner Mongolia alternates between Khorchin Mongols in the east and the Tumed Mongols in the west.[citation needed] Since the end of the Cultural Revolution, this convention has not been broken. The family of Ulanhu has retained influence in regional politics ever since the founding the People's Republic. His son Buhe and granddaughter Bu Xiaolin both served as Chairman of the region."

While the Hetao region along the Yellow River has always alternated between farmers from the south and nomads from the north, the most recent wave of Han Chinese migration began in the early 18th century with encouragement from the Qing dynasty, and continued into the 20th century. Han Chinese live mostly in the Hetao region as well as various population centres in central and eastern Inner Mongolia. Over 70% of Mongols are concentrated in less than 18% of Inner Mongolia's territory (Hinggan League, and the prefectures of Tongliao and Chifeng). Mongols are the second largest ethnic group, comprising 17.7% of the population as of the 2020 census.[8] They include many diverse Mongolian-speaking groups; groups such as the Buryats and the Oirats are also officially considered to be Mongols in China. In addition to the Manchus, other Tungusic ethnic groups, the Oroqen, and the Evenks also populate parts of northeastern Inner Mongolia. There is also a significant number of Hui and Koreans. Many of the traditionally nomadic Mongols have settled in permanent homes as their pastoral economy was collectivised during the Mao era, and some have taken jobs in cities as migrant labourers; however, some Mongols continue in their nomadic tradition. In practice, highly educated Mongols tend to migrate to big urban centers after which they become essentially indistinct with ethnic Han Chinese populations. Inter-marriage between Mongol and non-Mongol populations is very common, particularly in areas where Mongols are in regular contact with other groups. There was little cultural stigma within Mongol families for marrying outside the ethnic group, and in urban centers in particular, Mongol men and women married non-Mongols at relatively similar rates. The rates of intermarriage stands in very sharp contrast to ethnic Tibetans and Uyghurs in their respective autonomous regions. By the 1980s, for instance, in the former Jirim League, nearly 40% of marriages with at least one Mongol spouse was a mixed Mongol-Han Chinese marriage.[65] However, anecdotal reports have also demonstrated an increase in Mongol-female, Han Chinese-male pairings in which the woman is of a rural background, ostensibly shutting rural Mongol males from the marriage market as the sex ratio in China becomes more skewed with a much higher proportion of men.[66] Population numbers exclude members of the People's Liberation Army in active service based in Inner Mongolia."

        "content": "The use of Mongolian by Inner Mongolia's 4.1 million ethnic Mongols has sharply declined since the 1980s.[73] Across the whole of China, the language is spoken by roughly half of the country's 5.8 million ethnic Mongols (2005 estimate).[74] However, the exact number of Mongolian speakers in China is unknown, as there is no data available on the language proficiency of that country's citizens. The use of Mongolian in China, specifically in Inner Mongolia, has witnessed periods of decline and revival over the last few hundred years. The language experienced a decline during the late Qing period, a revival between 1947 and 1965, a second decline between 1966 and 1976, a second revival between 1977 and 1992, and a third decline between 1995 and 2012.[75] However, in spite of the decline of the Mongolian language in some of Inner Mongolia's urban areas and educational spheres, the ethnic identity of the urbanised Chinese-speaking Mongols is most likely going to survive due to the presence of urban ethnic communities.[76] The multilingual situation in Inner Mongolia does not appear to obstruct efforts by ethnic Mongols to preserve their language.[77][78] Although an unknown number of Mongols in China, such as the Tumets, may have completely or partially lost the ability to speak their language, they are still registered as ethnic Mongols and continue to identify themselves as ethnic Mongols.[74][79] The children of inter-ethnic Mongol-Chinese marriages also claim to be and are registered as ethnic Mongols.[80] By law, all street signs, commercial outlets, and government documents must be bilingual, written in both Mongolian and Chinese. There are three Mongolian TV channels in the Inner Mongolia Satellite TV network. In public transportation, all announcements are to be bilingual. Mongols in Inner Mongolia speak Mongolian dialects such as Chakhar, Xilingol, Baarin, Khorchin and Kharchin Mongolian and, depending on definition and analysis, further dialects[81] or closely related independent Central Mongolic languages[82] such as Ordos, Khamnigan, Barghu Buryat and the arguably Oirat dialect Alasha. The standard pronunciation of Mongolian in China is based on the Chakhar dialect of the Plain Blue Banner, located in central Inner Mongolia, while the grammar is based on all Inner Mongolian dialects.[83] This is different from the Mongolian state, where the standard pronunciation is based on the closely related Khalkha dialect. There are a number of independent languages spoken in Hulunbuir such as the somewhat more distant Mongolic language Dagur and the Tungusic language Evenki. Officially, even the Evenki dialect Oroqin is considered a language.[84] The Han Chinese of Inner Mongolia speak a variety of dialects, depending on the region. Those in the eastern parts tend to speak Northeastern Mandarin, which belongs to the Mandarin group of dialects; those in the central parts, such as the Yellow River valley, speak varieties of Jin, another subdivision of Chinese, due to its proximity to other Jin-speaking areas in China such as the Shanxi province. Cities such as Hohhot and Baotou both have their unique brand of Jin Chinese such as the Zhangjiakou\u2013Hohhot dialect which are sometimes incomprehensible with dialects spoken in northeastern regions such as Hailar. The vast grasslands have long symbolised Inner Mongolia. Mongolian art often depicts the grassland in an uplifting fashion and emphasises Mongolian nomadic traditions. The Mongols of Inner Mongolia still practice their traditional arts. Inner Mongolian cuisine has Mongol roots and consists of dairy-related products and hand-held lamb (\u624b\u6252\u8089). In recent years, franchises based on hot pot have appeared in Inner Mongolia, the best known of which is Little Sheep. Notable Inner Mongolian commercial brand names include Mengniu and Yili, both of which began as dairy product and ice cream producers. Among the Han Chinese of Inner Mongolia, Shanxi opera is a popular traditional form of entertainment. See also: Shanxi. A popular career in Inner Mongolia is circus acrobatics. The internationally known Inner Mongolia Acrobatic Troupe travels and performs with the renowned Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus."

In all, the storm impacted 22 states, killing 383[3][4][5] people, injuring over 160, and causing $66.7 million in damage (equivalent to $845,000,000 in 2023).[5] U.S. insurance companies paid out more money to their policy holders for damage resulting from the cyclone than for any previous storm or hurricane at the time.

The former occluded front to its northwest became a warm front which moved back to the west around the strengthening, and now dominant, southern low pressure center. By the evening of November 25, the cyclone retrograded, or moved northwestward, into Ohio due to a blocking ridge up across eastern Canada. It was at this time that the pressure gradient was its most intense across southern New England and eastern New York. A wide area of +4 standard deviation 850mb winds occurred.[8] The cyclone moved west over Lake Erie to the north of the upper cyclone before looping over Ohio as the low-level and mid-level cyclone centers coupled. Significant convection within its comma head led to the development of a warm seclusion, or a pocket of low level warm air, near its center which aided in further development due to the increased lapse rates a warmer low level environment affords under a cold low. After the system became stacked with height, the storm slowly spun down as it drifted north and northeast into eastern Canada over the succeeding few days.[9]"

On April 28, the storm began to accelerate northeastwards under the influence of the southwesterlies, and rapidly intensified to super cyclonic storm strength near the coast of Bangladesh on April\u00a029. After making landfall in the Chittagong district of southeastern Bangladesh with winds of around 250\u00a0km/h (155\u00a0mph), the cyclone rapidly weakened as it moved through northeastern India, degenerating into a remnant low over the Yunnan province in western China. One of the most powerful tropical cyclones ever recorded in the basin, the tropical cyclone caused a 6.1\u00a0m (20\u00a0ft) storm surge, which inundated the coastline, causing at least 138,866 deaths and about US$1.7\u00a0billion (1991 USD) in damage. As a result of the catastrophic damage, the United States and other countries carried out Operation Sea Angel, one of the largest military relief efforts ever carried out."

        "content": "On April\u00a022, 1991, a circulation formed in the southern Bay of Bengal from a persistent area of convection, or thunderstorms, near the equator in the eastern Indian Ocean. Within two days, the cloud mass encompassed most of the Bay of Bengal, focused on an area west of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.[2][3] On April\u00a024, the India Meteorological Department (IMD)[nb 1] designated the system as a depression, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)[nb 2] labeled the system as Tropical Cyclone 02B. Ships in the region reported winds of around 55\u00a0km/h (35\u00a0mph) around this time.[6] From its genesis, the storm moved northwestward, and early forecasts from the JTWC anticipated that trajectory would continue toward Andhra Pradesh in southeastern India, due to a westward-moving ridge over India. The cyclone gradually strengthened, amplified by a wind surge from the south. The IMD upgraded the depression to a cyclonic storm on April\u00a025, and to a severe cyclonic storm on the following day. By April\u00a026, wind shear had decreased to near zero as an anticyclone developed aloft the hurricane. Around this time, the cyclone rounded the western periphery of a large subtropical ridge over Thailand, and the storm turned northward between the ridge to the northeast and northwest. The IMD upgraded the system to a very severe cyclonic storm on April\u00a027, estimating winds of 142\u00a0km/h (89\u00a0mph). By this time, the JTWC anticipated a future track toward the Ganges Delta region of eastern India and Bangladesh.[6][2] On April\u00a028, the flow of the southwesterlies caused the cyclone to accelerate to the north-northeast. This flow also amplified the storm's outflow, and the cyclone intensified further. By 12:00\u00a0UTC on April\u00a028, or about 31\u00a0hours before landfall, the JTWC was correctly forecasting a landfall in southeastern Bangladesh.[2] Early on April\u00a029, the IMD upgraded the system to a super cyclonic storm \u2013 the highest category \u2013 and estimated peak winds of 235\u00a0km/h (145\u00a0mph). The JTWC estimated peak winds of 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph), the equivalent to a Category\u00a05 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale or a super typhoon. The IMD also estimated a minimum barometric pressure of 918\u00a0hPa (27.11\u00a0inHg), while the JTWC estimated a minimum pressure of 898\u00a0hPa (26.52\u00a0inHg). The cyclone's high winds and low pressure, a rarity for the Bay of Bengal, ranked it among the most intense cyclones in the basin. At 19:00\u00a0UTC on April\u00a029, the cyclone made landfall about 55\u00a0km (35\u00a0mi) south of Chittagong in southeastern Bangladesh while slightly below its peak strength. Moving through the mountainous terrain of the Chittagong Hill Tracts, the cyclone quickly weakened and crossed into northeast India, where it degenerated into a remnant low-pressure area.[7][6][2]"

        "content": "Until 2004, tropical cyclones were not named in the north Indian Ocean.[8] Through its role as Regional Specialized Meteorological Center, the IMD issued warnings on the storm, designating it Super Cyclonic Storm BoB 1. The agency tracked the storm using satellite imagery, radar, and other meteorological stations.[4][7] The JTWC, providing warnings and support to American military interests, designated the storm as Tropical Cyclone 02B, and also referred to it as a \"super cyclone\".[2] Although the cyclone was officially unnamed, documents from the United States Agency for International Development and the United States Army referred to the storm as Cyclone Marian.[9][10] Time magazine referred to the storm as Cyclone Gorky.[11] The Bay of Bengal is prone to large storm surges, which is the rise in sea water accompanying a cyclone landfall. The low-lying coast of Bangladesh along the Bay of Bengal is heavily populated,[2] with at least 120\u00a0million people.[12] In 1970, a cyclone struck the then East Pakistan (currently Bangladesh) and killed at least 300,000\u00a0people.[2] Before the cyclone moved ashore, an estimated 2\u20133\u00a0million people evacuated the Bangladeshi coast. In a survey by the American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the main reason more people did not evacuate was underestimating the severity of the cyclone. The JTWC maintained contact with the American embassy in Bangladesh's capital Dhaka, assuring that it would not have to be evacuated due to a projected track farther southeast.[2]"

The storm also brought winds of around 240\u00a0km/h (150\u00a0mph).[2] Winds exceeding 220\u00a0km/h (135\u00a0mph) lashed a populated region of the coast for about 12\u00a0hours, as well as 12\u00a0offshore islands.[6] An estimated 138,000\u00a0people were killed by the cyclone.[2] More than 20,000\u00a0people died on Kutubdia Upazila, an island offshore Chittagong where 80\u201390% of homes were destroyed, and all livestock were killed. Some smaller offshore islands lost their entire populations.[9] There were around 25,000 dead in Chittagong, 40,000 dead in Banshkali. About 13.4\u00a0million people were affected.[9] Around 1\u00a0million homes were destroyed, leaving 10\u00a0million people homeless.[2] The storm surge caused whole villages to be swept away. The storm caused an estimated $1.5\u00a0billion (1991 US dollars) in damage.[13] The high velocity wind and the storm surge devastated the coastline. Although a concrete levee was in place near the mouth of the Karnaphuli River in Patenga, it was washed away by the storm surge. A large number of boats and smaller ships ran aground. The Bangladesh Navy and Bangladesh Air Force, both of which had bases in Chittagong, were also heavily hit. The Isha Khan Naval Base at Patenga was flooded, with heavy damages to the ships.[14] Most of the fighter planes belonging to the air force were damaged. The extensive damage caused the price of building materials to greatly increase. For an additional three to four weeks after the storm had dissipated, mass land erosion resulted in more and more farmers losing their land, and therefore, the number of unemployed rose.[15] In several areas, up to 90 percent of crops had been washed away. The shrimp farms and salt industry were left devastated."

This was part of Operation Sea Angel, one of the largest military disaster relief efforts ever carried out, with the United Kingdom, China, India, Pakistan and Japan also participating.[19] Operation Sea Angel began on May 10, 1991, when President Bush directed the US military to provide humanitarian assistance.[20] A Contingency Joint Task Force under the command of Lieutenant General Henry C. Stackpole, consisting of over 400 Marines and 3,000 sailors, was subsequently sent to Bangladesh to provide food, water, and medical care to nearly two million people.[12]  The efforts of U.S. troops, which included 3,300\u00a0tons of supplies, are credited with having saved as many as 200,000 lives.[21] The relief was delivered to the hard-hit coastal areas and low-lying islands in the Bay of Bengal by helicopter, boat and amphibious craft. The US military also provided medical and engineering teams to work with their Bangladeshi counterparts[9] and international relief organisation to treat survivors and contain an outbreak of diarrhea, caused by contaminated drinking water. Water purification plants were built and prevalence of diarrhea amongst the population was reduced to lower than pre-cyclone levels.[22] After the departure of the task force, 500 military personnel, two C-130 cargo planes, five Blackhawk helicopters and four small landing craft from the task force remained to help finish off relief operations in outlying districts and rebuild warehouses. The amphibious landing ship USS\u00a0St. Louis (LKA-116) delivered large quantities of intravenous solution from Japan to aid in the treatment of cyclone survivors.[23][24]"

The system influenced the trade winds over the Pacific Ocean and was partially responsible for one of the strongest trade wind reversals ever observed. The system was first noted as a tropical disturbance during March 8, 2015, while it was located to the southeast of Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. Over the next couple of days the system moved north-westwards through the Marshall Islands, before it was classified as a tropical depression during March 10. The system subsequently moved north-westwards and continued to develop further, before it was classified as the third tropical storm of the 2015 Pacific typhoon season and named Bavi by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) during March 11. After continuing its north-westwards movement, the system peaked as a tropical storm during March 14, before it started to weaken as it approached the Mariana Islands. The system subsequently passed over Guam during the next day, before continuing its west-northwestwards movement as it gradually weakened over the next few days. The system entered the Philippine area of responsibility, where it was named Betty by PAGASA during March 17 as the system weakened into a tropical depression. The system was subsequently last noted during March 21, as it dissipated over the Philippines. Bavi and its precursor tropical disturbance impacted eastern Micronesia, with strong to gale-force winds of between 45\u201365\u00a0km/h (30\u201340\u00a0mph), reported on various atolls in the Marshall Islands. Considerable damage was reported on the islet of Ebeye, on the main atoll of Kwajalein, a small amount of tree damage was reported, while several old steel structures were made too dangerous to use. Overall damages in the Marshall Islands were estimated at US$2.1 million, while a fishing vessel and its crew of nine were reported missing during March 12. Bavi and its precursor also had severe impacts in Kiribati. After impacting Eastern Micronesia, Bavi approached the Mariana Islands, with its circulation passing over Guam during March 15, where it caused the highest waves to be recorded on the island in a decade. Bavi also impacted the Northern Mariana Islands of Rota, Tinian and Saipan, where power outages were reported and five houses were destroyed. Total property damages within the Mariana Islands were estimated at around US$150 thousand."

As a result of this the system's low level circulation passed over Guam during March 15, while convection associated with the system passed over the Northern Mariana islands.[1][11] Over the next couple of days the system moved westwards and continued to weaken, before it weakened into a tropical depression during March 17, as it moved into the Philippine area of responsibility where it was named Betty by PAGASA.[5][12][13] The JTWC stopped monitoring Bavi during March 19, after the system had weakened into a tropical disturbance, however, the JMA continued to monitor the system as a tropical depression, until it dissipated within the Philippines, during March 21.[5][6][10]"

Andrea caused large waves and tropical-storm force winds along the southeast coast of the United States. The first named storm and the first subtropical cyclone of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season, Andrea developed out of a non-tropical low on May 9 about 150 miles (240\u00a0km) northeast of Daytona Beach, Florida, three weeks before the official start of the season. After encountering dry air and strong vertical wind shear, Andrea weakened to a subtropical depression on May 10 while remaining nearly stationary, and the National Hurricane Center discontinued advisories early on May 11. Andrea's remnant was subsequently absorbed into another extratropical storm on May 14. Andrea was the first pre-season storm to develop since Tropical Storm Ana in April 2003. Additionally, the storm was the first Atlantic named storm in May since Tropical Storm Arlene in 1981.[1] The storm produced rough surf along the coastline from Florida to North Carolina, causing beach erosion and some damage. In some areas, the waves eroded up to 20 feet (6.1\u00a0m) of beach, leaving 70\u00a0homes in danger of collapse. Offshore North Carolina, high waves of 34 feet (10\u00a0m) and tropical-storm-force winds damaged three boats; their combined nine passengers were rescued by the Coast Guard, although all nine sustained injuries. Light rainfall was also reported in some coastal locations. Damage was minimal, but six people drowned as a result of the storm."

        "content": "In early May, an upper-level trough dropped southward through the western Atlantic Ocean, forcing a back-door cold front\u2014a cold front that moves southwestward ahead of a building surface ridge to its north or northeast\u2014southward. For several days, forecast models had anticipated for the trough to evolve into a closed low pressure area,[2] and on May 6, a frontal low with a large and well-defined circulation developed about 90 miles (140\u00a0km) east of Cape Hatteras. The low maintained scattered convection around its circulation center, and in conjunction with the strong high pressure to its north, a very tight pressure gradient produced gale-force winds near the coastline.[3] The extratropical storm tracked southeastward and later turned to the southwest while steadily deepening; on May 7, it attained hurricane-force winds.[4] On the same day, the storm reached its extratropical peak, with a minimum central pressure of 988 millibars (29.2\u00a0inHg).[4] With a lack of tropical moisture, the storm's corresponding convection was minimal and scattered.[5] The National Hurricane Center first mentioned the possibility of tropical cyclogenesis on May 8, while the storm was located about 230 miles (370\u00a0km) east-southeast of the South Carolina coastline. Its associated convection had steadily increased as it tracked slowly westward at 5\u201310\u00a0mph (8.0\u201316.1\u00a0km/h).[6] The system changed little in organization throughout the day,[7] though by the following morning, hurricane specialists indicated the low was acquiring subtropical characteristics[8] as it tracked over progressively warmer waters.[4] Early on May 9, a Hurricane Hunters flight into the system revealed winds of 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h) and a flat thermal core, which indicated the system was neither warm-core nor cold-core. In addition, satellite imagery indicated a consolidation of the convection near the center, as well as hints of upper-level outflow and a contraction of the radius of maximum winds from more than 115 miles (185\u00a0km) to about 70 miles (110\u00a0km). Based on the observations and the hybrid structure of the system, the National Hurricane Center classified the low as Subtropical Storm Andrea at 1500\u00a0UTC on May 9 about 150 miles (240\u00a0km) northeast of Daytona Beach, Florida.[9] During a subsequent analysis of the storm, researchers estimated that the storm had transitioned into a subtropical cyclone nine hours earlier.[4] As Andrea developed before June 1\u2014the traditional start of hurricane seasons in the Atlantic Ocean\u2014it became the first pre-season storm since Tropical Storm Ana in April\u00a02003. Additionally, the storm was the first Atlantic named storm in May since Tropical Storm Arlene in\u00a01981.[1] Upon first becoming a subtropical cyclone, Andrea was embedded within a large, nearly stationary deep-layer trough, resulting in a westward movement. Drifting over sea surface temperatures of no more than 77\u00a0\u00b0\u00a0F (25\u00a0\u00b0C),[9] the organization of the system deteriorated with a significant decrease in convection.[10] By early on May 10, much of the associated weather was located to the east of the cyclone within a band of moderate convection due to a brief spell of westerly vertical wind shear. The center of circulation had become disorganized, with several small cloud swirls within the larger circulation.[11] This disorganization of the center, combined with increasing wind shear and dry air suppressing convective activity, caused it to begin weakening later that morning.[12] By 1500\u00a0UTC on May 10, only a few thunderstorms remained near the center, and thus the NHC downgraded Andrea to subtropical depression status.[13] Though a few intermittent thunderstorms persisted over the eastern semicircle, the depression remained disorganized and weak; the National Hurricane Center discontinued advisories early on May 11, after it had been without significant deep convection for 18\u00a0hours about 80 miles (130\u00a0km) northeast of Cape Canaveral, Florida.[14] Later on May 11, convection re-fired over the center as the system drifted south-southeastward, though it lacked sufficient organization to qualify as a tropical cyclone.[15] By May 12, shower activity had organized greatly to the east of the center, and the National Hurricane Center remarked that a small increase in convection would result in the formation of a tropical depression.[16] It accelerated east-northeastward away from the continental United States without redeveloping, and after passing over cooler waters,[17] the remnants of Andrea merged with an approaching cold front on May 14.[18]"

The season ran from November 1, 1984, to April 30, 1985, with tropical cyclones officially monitored by the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS), Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) and New Zealand's MetService. The United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) and other national meteorological services including M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France and NOAA also monitored the basin during the season. During the season there was nine tropical cyclones occurring within the basin, including three that moved into the basin from the Australian region. The BoM, MetService and RSMC Nadi all estimated sustained wind speeds over a period of 10-minutes, which are subsequently compared to the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale, while the JTWC estimated sustained winds over a 1-minute period, which are subsequently compared to the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS)."

Eric subsequently passed through the Tonga's Ha'apai islands just to the south of Nomuka during January 18, before it gradually weakened and was last noted during January 20, over 1,800\u00a0km (1,120\u00a0mi) to the south of Papeete, French Polynesia.[5][6]"

Most atmospheric rivers that impact the Pacific Northwest are typically oriented from southwest to northeast, but this one was unusual in that it was oriented west to east. Because of the orientation of mountain ranges such as the Cascade Range, the west to east trajectory is more efficient at producing precipitation on the windward side of the ranges. This, combined with the duration of the rainfall on near-average snowpack, led to widespread flooding that was record breaking on some rivers.[3] Before the system impacted the region, the National Weather Service issued flood warnings for multiple rivers.[4] In parts of the Washington Cascades, over 15 inches (380\u00a0mm) inches of water-equivalent precipitation was observed, with over 10 inches (250\u00a0mm) on the west slopes of the Blue Mountains.[5]"

One family had to seek shelter on the roof of their home and water reached high enough to overtop levees in the downtown area of that city. The body of a Pendleton-area woman who is believed to have been attempting to evacuate was found a few days later.[2] Downstream, the Umatilla River overran Interstate 84 leading to a 200 miles (320\u00a0km) stretch of the freeway being closed for several days.[6] Around 50 homes in Echo took damage along with some homes and businesses near Stanfield. Riverfront Park west of Hermiston was under water for the second year in a row and homeless families living in makeshift camps nearby were displaced.[7] A mudslide 26 miles (42\u00a0km) east of Pendleton caused a closure on a railroad owned by Union Pacific.[8] Flooding in the Walla Walla River watershed was also extensive. The largest city in the area, Walla Walla, was protected from flooding on Mill Creek which was placed in a deep channel through the city following flooding in 1931. On either side of the city, the creek overflowed its banks to wash out roads, inundate fields, and damage buildings. In an effort to manage flows in the creek the Army Corps of Engineers released water from Bennington Lake, a reservoir east of Walla Walla, into nearby Russell Creek. The reservoir was not at risk of being overtopped, but it took about 40 days to get it back to normal levels.[9] Much of Milton-Freewater was evacuated when the Walla Walla River overtopped a levee protecting that city. Upstream, the river and some of its tributaries rendered some roads in and near the Blue Mountains impassable.[9] US 12 was closed between Wallula and Touchet because of flooding from the Walla Walla River, as well as between Prescott and Dayton where the Touchet River flowed out of its banks and damaged the levee system.[10][11] Many rivers and streams that drain the Blue Mountains eclipsed records that were set during the 1996 Pacific Northwest floods with other spots falling just short of that benchmark. By contrast, rivers draining the east slopes of the Cascades, such as the Yakima only experienced minor flooding because of the orientation of the 2020 atmospheric river and lack of snow on the valley floor.[10]"

Sumas residents were asked by authorities to delay pumping water from their homes because of high water in parts of town.[12] North of the border, some fields were flooded and Fraser Health issued a notice to calm concerns about naturally occurring asbestos in Sumas River sediment.[13] Major flooding on the Snohomish River did not reach high enough to impact businesses in Snohomish, but many roads near town were covered by water.[4] As water receded on the Skagit River, it was discovered that a levee protecting Burlington had taken damage and would need to be stabilized. Strong winds in that area also caused many to lose power.[14] By controlling flow through the Howard Hanson Dam, the Army Corps of Engineers kept the Green River from flooding the Seattle suburb of Kent.[15]"

The Oregon Army National Guard was mobilized to rescue residents who were stuck on the slopes of the Blue Mountains above Milton-Freewater due to washed out roads, warning those who stayed behind that it may be several weeks before they would be able to get out otherwise.[16][10] After a bridge across Mill Creek washed out southeast of Walla Walla, the volunteer fire department attempted to rescue residents using a converted military vehicle. This got stuck and extra equipment had to be called in to get it out.[9] As a precautionary measure the city of Walla Walla closed some bridges across Mill Creek, but the artificial channel did not overflow and the bridges reopened once the water level dropped.[10] Among the numerous roads that were damaged by flooding was Interstate 84, the only east\u2013west Interstate in Oregon. Near Echo, the Umatilla River completely covered the road, forcing the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) to close it for a time with some motorists abandoning their vehicles on the road.[6] Once the waters receded, ODOT opened one lane each direction with a lowered speed limit, but full repairs took some time to complete.[2] Six other state highways were closed in northeast Oregon, and it is estimated that the cost of damage in that region was $48 million.[16][17]"

The sixth tropical cyclone and the second severe tropical cyclone of the 2020\u201321 Australian region cyclone season, while being the third severe tropical cyclone of the annual South Pacific cyclone season, Niran was the second Category 5 severe tropical cyclone in the South Pacific cyclone season, following Cyclone Yasa. The cyclone formed from a tropical low in the Coral Sea on 27 February. The tropical low gradually intensified while stalling offshore of Queensland for several days, although disorganized at the time. Early on 3 March, Niran pulled away from the coast of Australia, while it started undergoing rapid intensification. Eventually, Niran reached its peak intensity as a Category 5 tropical cyclone on both the Australian Tropical Cyclone Scale and the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale, on 5 March, well offshore of Australia. Soon afterward, Niran initiated an eyewall replacement cycle and encountered some wind shear, causing the storm to weaken on 6 March, as it passed just to the south of Grande Terre, the main island of New Caledonia. Afterwards, Niran continued rapidly weakening as wind shear increased further, before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone late on 6 March. Niran was absorbed into another extratropical storm two days later. Before its strengthening phase, Niran significantly affected the banana crop in far-north Queensland. Several farms abroad were damaged, and some farmers lost 100% of their banana crop. Prices for the fruit were expected to rise. Estimates placed damage to the crop at a minimum of AU$180 million (US$140 million). Other infrastructure damage was minor. In New Caledonia, many houses had their roofs and infrastructure damaged, and nearly 70,000 people lost power in total. Multiple roads became impassable. Two people in New Caledonia were injured, though no one was killed. Total economic losses reached $200 million (2021 USD).[1]"

Shortly afterward, the storm crossed into the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS)'s area of responsibility, even as it accelerated southeastward towards New Caledonia. Around that time, Niran reached its peak intensity, attaining maximum 10-minute sustained winds of 205\u00a0km/h (125\u00a0mph), maximum 1-minute sustained winds of 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph), and a central minimum pressure of 931 millibars (27.5\u00a0inHg).[8] However, several hours later, Niran began an eyewall replacement cycle and encountered wind shear, causing the storm to begin yet another significant weakening trend, with the storm falling down back to Category 4 status on the SSHWS. At 12:00 UTC on 6 March, Niran made its closest approach to New Caledonia's main island of Grande Terre, as a Category 3-equivalent tropical cyclone, as the eye of the storm passed just south of the island's southeastern flank. As wind shear continued to substantially increase over the storm, it weakened to a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian scale and a Category 2 tropical cyclone on the SSHWS, later that day, as it began undergoing extratropical transition. Late that day, Niran had completed its extratropical transition as it continued accelerating towards the southeast. Niran continued moving southeastward for another couple of days, before being absorbed into a larger extratropical cyclone to the south on 8 March.[citation needed]"

Some farmers said they had lost nearly 100% of their banana crops. In total, over 42,000 people lost power from the storm, due to high winds. State emergency teams were sent to attend to downed poles and damaged homes, and they reported minor structural damage in the Cairns region. The Australian Banana Growers\u2019 Council said on 2 March that it was too early to estimate damage, but stated it would be significant. In the Cassowary Coast Region, farmers were expected to be without income until September or October. Two people were rescued from floodwaters.[11] On 5 March, farmers assessed the crop damage to range between AU$180\u2013200 million.[12] There were fears that the prices for bananas would increase drastically again, as had occurred after Cyclone Larry in 2006 and Cyclone Yasi in 2011. They were expected to increase by 50 cents to $1 a kilo after Niran.[13] Damage to farm infrastructure was labeled \"catastrophic\" and \"severe\" by locals. In production nurseries, shade houses and tree crops were damaged. Stephen Lowe, the council chief executive of the Australian Banana Growers\u2019 Council, estimated about 5,000 hectares of crops were affected, and 150 farms were damaged;[8][14] however, over 11,000 hectares (27,000 acres) may have been damaged, and clean-up could take upwards of a year.[13] Niran was estimated to have destroyed around one-third of Australia's banana crops.[15] The highest recorded total for rainfall was in Clump Point, which saw 276\u00a0mm (10.9\u00a0in) of rain in 24 hours.[10]"

Yasa was the second tropical disturbance, as well as the first tropical cyclone and severe tropical cyclone of the 2020\u201321 South Pacific cyclone season. Yasa was first noted as an area of low pressure to the north of Port Vila in Vanuatu during December 10. Over the next few days, the system gradually developed further as it absorbed Tropical Depression 01F, before it was classified as a tropical cyclone and named Yasa by the Fiji Meteorological Service on December 13. The system gradually moved through the South Pacific Ocean, going through a small, slow loop whilst rapidly intensifying. In about a day, it became a Category\u00a05 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian scale and a few hours later, a Category\u00a05-equivalent cyclone on the Saffir-Simpson scale, with 1-minute sustained winds of 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph) and a minimum pressure of 917\u00a0hPa (27.1\u00a0inHg). This made Yasa the earliest Category 5 tropical cyclone on both the Australian and Saffir-Simpson scales in the South Pacific basin since reliable records began, beating the old record by Cyclone Zoe in 2002\u201303. Yasa maintained its intensity and became more defined on satellite imagery as it bore down on Fiji. An address was sent to the entire country from the nation's Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama regarding preparations for the storm. Shipping services were halted, and fishermen were advised to not go out into sea, due to fears of Yasa possibly injuring or killing them. Multiple warnings were issued, including heavy rain, heavy wind, and flood warnings. Soon, the entirety of Fiji was under warnings as Yasa neared. A high wind warning was put in place for Vanuatu as the storm's wind field reached the country. Impacts began to be felt on mid-day December 16, as villages in the Malolo and Yasawa groups began to feel the winds and rain of Yasa. The impacts felt from Yasa were large and wide. As of December 22, impacted areas are beginning to restore communication. Transportation was hampered as 72 roads in the country were closed due to fallen trees, power lines, and flooding. Heavy rain was recorded in most of the country. Four deaths were confirmed, while one person remains missing.[1] Damage estimates in Fiji were calculated at a minimum total of FJ$500 million, or US$246.7 million (2020 USD).[2] Many affected people had their access to food and water cut off following Yasa's passage through Fiji. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies provided funding and relief items to about 17,700 Fijians by December 18, and provided the Fijian Ministry of Health and Medical Services with supplies. Australia pledged its assistance and sent HMAS Adelaide to help with recovery efforts."

        "content": "The area of low pressure that would eventually become Severe Tropical Cyclone Yasa was first noted by the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) during December 10, while it was located about 655\u00a0km (405\u00a0mi) to the north of Port Vila in Vanuatu.[3][4] At this stage, the disturbance had a broad and fully exposed low level circulation, with little to no atmospheric convection surrounding the system.[3] The system was also located within a marginally favourable environment for further development, with high levels of vertical wind shear, being offset by warm sea surface temperatures of around 29\u201330\u00a0\u00b0C (84\u201386\u00a0\u00b0F).[3] During that day, the system gradually organized further as it moved south-eastwards, before it was classified as Tropical Disturbance 02F by the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) during December 11.[4][5][6] During that day, the system continued to develop and was classified as a tropical depression by the FMS, while Tropical Depression 01F/04P moved along its southern periphery.[7][8] The JTWC subsequently initiated advisories on the system and classified it as Tropical Cyclone 05P during December 12.[9] Over the next day, the system continued to consolidate and absorbed Tropical Depression 01F, as it moved south-westwards along the northeastern edge of a subtropical ridge of high pressure.[10] During December 13, the FMS classified the system as a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale and named it Yasa, while it was located over open waters between Fiji and Vanuatu.[5][11] After it had been named, Yasa made a small anti-cyclonic loop, while its overall organisation improved significantly, with a compact eye feature appearing on microwave imagery.[5][12][13] As a result, the FMS reported that the system had intensified into a Category 2 tropical cyclone, while the JTWC reported that Yasa had become equivalent to a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS).[4][12] Yasa subsequently performed a second anti-cyclonic loop as the subtropical ridge weakened, while its primary steering mechanism started to change, which caused the system to move north-eastwards towards the Equator.[5][14][15] During December 14, the FMS reported that Yasa had become a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone, before the system rapidly intensified into a Category 4 severe tropical cyclone later that day.[5] During December 15, Yasa continued to rapidly intensify with its eye becoming well defined, before the FMS reported that the system had become the earliest Category 5 severe tropical cyclone on record.[16][17]  The system subsequently turned south-eastwards as a subtropical ridge of high pressure built in from the cyclones southeast before a ridge of high pressure near the equator caused the system to start moving south-eastwards towards Fiji.[5][18][19] The JTWC reported that Yasa had peaked with 1-minute sustained wind speeds of 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph), which made it equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane on the SSHWS during December 16.[4][20] Later that day, the FMS reported that Yasa had peaked with 10-minute sustained wind speeds of 230\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph), as well as a minimum pressure of 917\u00a0hPa (27.08\u00a0inHg), although it was operationally assessed at 250\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph), and a minimum pressure of 899\u00a0hPa (26.55\u00a0inHg).[21] The system subsequently started to weaken with its cloud tops starting to warm before Yasa made landfall in Bua Province on Vanua Levu as a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone, at around 06:00\u00a0UTC (18:00\u00a0FJT) on December 17.[22][23] After it had made landfall, Yasa's eye became cloud-filled and dissipated, as it completed an eyewall replacement cycle over Vanua Levu.[24][25] The system subsequently moved into the Koro Sea, where it passed near or over several of the Lau Islands and started to interact with an upper-level trough of low pressure.[4][25] This caused increased vertical wind shear over the system, which in turn caused Yasa to significantly weaken and become a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone during December 18.[25][26][27] Over the next couple of days, the system gradually weakened further, as it brushed Tonga with hurricane-force winds, before it was classified as a former tropical cyclone by the FMS during December 19 as it degenerated into an extratropical low.[4][28][29] Over the next few days, the JTWC continued to monitor Yasa as a subtropical cyclone, before the system was last noted during December 24.[4][30]"

Over the next few days, various gale, storm, hurricane, storm surge and damaging swell warnings were issued for the group. On December 16, shipping services were halted and the Ministry of Fisheries strongly advised fishermen to refrain from travelling out to sea.[36][37] The Ministry of Education, Heritage and Arts ordered the closure of all schools as schools would be used as evacuation centers[38] and an Emergency Operations Center was activated by the National Disaster Management Office.[39] The Fiji Police Force activated its Cyclone Response Operation with police officers deployed around the country with necessary resources.[40] Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama in a video address urged all Fijians to prepare for the cyclone.[41] The National Disaster Management Office posted on social media that storm surges with waves as high as 16\u00a0m (52\u00a0ft) were expected.[42] Fiji Airways said that its larger aircraft will either operate repatriation services to Sydney, Auckland, Los Angeles and Hong Kong, or be ferried to Sydney or Auckland in the next two days.[43] The aircraft will remain at those airports to avoid storm damage.[44] Evacuation centers were opened nationwide and the government put the military on standby to help.[45] On December 17, a nationwide curfew was enacted starting at 4:00 p.m local time[46] and the National Disaster Management Office declared a state of emergency.[47] Early on December 17, Bainimarama said in a video posted to Facebook that over 850,000 Fijians, or about 95% of the country's population, were in the direct path of Yasa. He added that weather forecasts anticipated \"severe coastal inundation\", with waves up to 10 meters high. Police enforced a public ban on public transport.

This is a climate emergency.\"[67] Reports showed that much of the homes in villages were completely destroyed and crops were flattened by the extensive wind brought in by Yasa.[67] As with many disasters during the COVID-19 pandemic, recovery was anticipated to be much harder and slower due to restrictions and measures still needed to be taken while thousands remained in evacuation centers.[68] Damage to agriculture across the nation reached FJ$150\u00a0million (US$73\u00a0million).[69] Costs to repair and restore damage to Energy Fiji Limited's power infrastructure reached FJ$7\u20138\u00a0million (US$3.4\u20133.9\u00a0million).[70] Damage to medical infrastructure reached FJ$2.5\u00a0million (US$1.2\u00a0million), including FJ$1.5\u00a0million (US$730,000) for the destruction of Kia Island's only nursing station.[71] A damage survey performed later in February 2021 indicated total damage was upwards of FJ$500 million, or US$246.7 million, with 2,141 homes completely destroyed and another 6,184 partially damaged.[2]"

Many WASH kits, school in a boxes, and school boxes were stored at a warehouse in Brisbane, Australia, to be sent to Fiji. Meanwhile, some of the same supplies were prepositioned in Fiji ahead of the storm.[74] A Royal New Zealand Air Force reconnaissance flight flew over the areas affected to further assess damage; the disaster zone was compared to that of a \"war zone\".[75] The Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs Marise Payne released a statement on December 19 pledging that Australia would provide emergency humanitarian relief in whatever capacity possible with their condolences and thoughts with every person effected by the cyclone.[76] Payne further affirmed that \"Throughout our long history of cooperation, Fiji and Australia have become more than just neighbors \u2013 we are family.  [...] Australia pledges our ongoing support to our Fijian vuvale following TC Yasa.\"[76][77] Australia's HMAS Adelaide, carrying personnel from the Australian Army's 6th Engineering Support Regiment and equipment was sent to assist Fiji in its recovery efforts.[78] Many families across affected areas lost access to food, and were left without it just before the Christmas season. Waves higher than 3 meters (9.8 feet) prevented ships from leaving Suva, on the island of Viti Levu.

Hermine developed from a tropical wave that emerged from the west coast of Africa on September 5. The wave moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean, and on entering the northwest Caribbean interacted with other weather systems. The resultant system was declared a tropical depression on September 17 in the central Gulf of Mexico. The storm meandered north slowly, and after being upgraded to a tropical storm made landfall on Louisiana, where it quickly deteriorated into a tropical depression again on September 20. Before the storm's arrival, residents of Grand Isle, Louisiana, were evacuated. As a weak tropical storm, damages from Hermine were light. Rainfall spread from Louisiana through Georgia, causing isolated flash flooding. In some areas, the storm tide prolonged the coastal flooding from a tropical cyclone. Gusty winds were reported. Associated tornadoes in Mississippi damaged mobile homes and vehicles, and inflicted one injury. While Hermine was not of itself a particularly damaging storm, its effects combined with those of other tropical cyclones, and resulted in agricultural damage."

        "content": "On September 5, 1998, a tropical wave emerged from the west coast of Africa and entered the Atlantic Ocean. The wave was not associated with any  thunderstorm activity until it reached the Windward Islands, when cloud and shower activity began to increase. Continuing westward, the disturbance approached the South American coastline and turned into the northwest Caribbean. The wave interacted with an upper-level low-pressure system and another tropical wave that entered the region. At the time, a large monsoon-type flow prevailed over Central America, part of the Caribbean Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico.[1] An area of low pressure developed over the northwestern Caribbean, and at about 1200 UTC on September 17, the system was sufficiently organized to be declared a tropical depression in the central Gulf of Mexico.[1][2] Initially, the cloud pattern associated with the system featured a tight and well-defined circulation, as well as clusters of deep convection south of the center. Due to the proximity of a large upper-level low-pressure area in the southern Gulf of Mexico, the surrounding environment did not favor intensification.[3] Influenced by the low, the depression moved southward.[4] The system completed a cyclonic loop in the central gulf,[1] and by early on September 18 was drifting northward.[5] As a result of wind shear, the center of circulation was separated from the deep convective activity.[6] Early the next day, deep convection persisted in a small area northeast of the center. Forward motion was nearly stationary, with a gradual drift east-southeastward.[7] Despite the wind shear, the depression attained tropical storm status at 1200 UTC on September\u00a019; as such, it was named Hermine by the National Hurricane Center.[1] Shortly after being upgraded to a tropical storm, Hermine reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 45\u00a0mph (75\u00a0km/h).[1] The tropical storm-force winds were confined to the eastern semicircle of the cyclone.[8] Hermine tracked northward and approached the coast, where it nearly stalled.[9] A continually weakening storm, it moved ashore near Cocodrie, Louisiana at 0500 UTC on September 20 with winds of 40 miles per hour (64\u00a0km/h), and then deteriorated into a tropical depression.[1] On its landfall, associated rain bands were deemed \"not very impressive\", although there was a rapid increase in thunderstorm activity east of the center. The thunderstorms produced heavy rainfall in parts of southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi. The storm progressively weakened as the circulation moved northeastward, and dissipated at 1800 UTC.[10] Initially, it was believed that Hermine's remnants contributed to the development of Hurricane Karl; however, this belief was not confirmed.[11]"

The warning was promptly extended westward from Morgan City to Intracoastal City, Louisiana, and by 1200 UTC on September 20 all tropical cyclone watches and warnings were discontinued.[1] As the storm moved inland, flood advisories were issued for southern Mississippi.[10] On Grand Isle, a mandatory evacuation order was declared for the third time in three weeks,[12] and residents in low-lying areas of Lafourche Parish were ordered to leave.[13] Shelters were opened,[14] but few people used them.  Only fifteen people entered the American Red Cross shelter in Larose, Louisiana, which had been designed to hold 500.[15]  Workers were evacuated from oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico,[16] and energy futures rose substantially in anticipation of the storm, though when Hermine failed to cause significant damage, they retreated.[17] The Coast Guard evacuated its Grand Isle station in preparation.[18]"

A man died on U.S. Route 441 after losing control of his vehicle.[21] Upon landfall in Louisiana, winds were primarily of minimal tropical storm-force and confined to squalls. Offshore, a wind gust of 46 miles per hour (74\u00a0km/h) was reported near the mouth of the Mississippi River, and near New Orleans, wind gusts peaked at 32 miles per hour (51\u00a0km/h). Along the coast, storm tides generally ran 1 to 3 feet (0.30 to 0.91\u00a0m) above normal, which prolonged coastal flooding in some areas from previous Tropical Storm Frances.[22] Winds on Grand Isle reached 25 miles per hour (40\u00a0km/h), and storm tides on the island averaged 1 foot (0.30\u00a0m).[23] Hermine brought 3 to 4 inches (76 to 102\u00a0mm) of rainfall to the state, triggering isolated flash flooding. Near Thomas, part of Louisiana Highway 438 was submerged under flood waters.[22] An oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico reported sustained winds of 48 miles per hour (77\u00a0km/h) with gusts to 59 miles per hour (95\u00a0km/h).[24] At around 8:30 AM on September 20, a man was presumed drowned in Lake Cataouatche, southwest of New Orleans.[25] The man had been shrimping in the lake in choppy waters caused by the storm, and dove into the water without a life vest to untangle a net from his boat's propeller.  After he freed the propeller, the boat was carried away by the current in the lake, and he was last seen swimming after the boat.  After the disappearance, the Coast Guard launched a search with rescue boats and search dogs but could not locate him.[26] His body was eventually found on the morning of September 22.[27] Captain Pat Yoes, of the St. Charles Parish Sheriff's Office, said that the storm \"obviously\u00a0... played a part\" in the man's death,[26] but Lieutenant Commander William Brewer of the United States Coast Guard told the press that he did not \"think it was directly storm-related.\"[25] Hermine spawned two tornadoes in Mississippi. One destroyed two mobile homes, damaged seven cars, and resulted in one minor injury;[28] the other caused only minor damage. Rainfall of 4 to 5 inches (100 to 130\u00a0mm) caused localized flooding; in southern Walthall County, parts of Mississippi Highway 27 were under 1 foot (0.30\u00a0m) of water.[29] Over 6 inches (150\u00a0mm) of rainfall was reported in Alabama, resulting in the flooding of apartments and several roads and the closure of several highways. Numerous cars were damaged, and motorists were stranded on Bibb County Route 24.[30]  Floodwaters also covered U.S. Route 11 near Tuscaloosa, Alabama stranding several motorists and a milk truck.[31] Flash flood warnings were issued in Bibb and Shelby counties as northern Alabama experienced its first rainfall in the month of September.[32] The rainfall extended eastward into Georgia, where the rains led the state to lift a fire alert for three northern counties,[19][33] South Carolina and North Carolina.[34] The remnants of the storm dumped 10.5 inches (27\u00a0cm) of rain on Charleston, South Carolina and rainfall of up to one foot was reported in other parts of the state. The rain in Charleston led to over five feet of standing water in some neighborhoods, forcing several families to evacuate their mobile homes and stranding a number of vehicles.  As a result, the local police closed several roads, including sections of Interstate 526.[35] Overall, damage totaled $85,000 (1998 USD);[36] the effects were described as minor.[37] Although the effects from Hermine were small, counties in Louisiana and Texas were declared disaster areas due to damage associated with the earlier Tropical Storm Frances and the Louisiana Office of Emergency Preparedness extended these funds to cover damages from Hermine as well.[38]"

After the swamps began to drain, the low-oxygen water flowed into streams, canals, and bayous in the area, and testing in the days following the storm showed that the water was \"almost devoid of oxygen.\" Without sufficient oxygen, local fish population died quickly, filling waterways, particularly in the area of Lake Charles and Lafayette, according to the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries.[39]  In total, the fish kills affected at least a dozen separate lakes and bayous in the state.[40] The combined effects of Hermine and other storms caused significant damage to Louisiana agriculture.  The standing water after Hermine provided ideal hatching conditions for mosquitoes, who formed swarms large enough to kill livestock in the days after the storm.  At least twelve bulls and horses were killed by mosquito bites in the next week, including bulls who drowned after wading into deep water to escape the insects.  The rains and standing water from the storm also prevented farmers from drying out soybeans for harvest and ruined sugar cane.  According to Louisiana Agriculture Commissioner Bob Odom, the combined effects of Hurricane Earl, Tropical Storm Frances, and Tropical Storm Hermine caused $420\u00a0million in direct and indirect losses for Louisiana farmers.[41]"

The storm cell developed on the morning of New Year's Day, a public holiday in Australia, over the Blue Mountains, hitting the city and dissipating east of Bondi in the mid-afternoon. At the time, it was the most severe storm to strike the city since recorded observations began in 1792.[1][2] The high humidity, temperatures and weather patterns of Sydney increased the strength of the storm. The cost of damages from the storm were, at the time, approximately \u00a3750,000 (US$3\u00a0million); this is the equivalent of around A$45\u00a0million in modern figures.[3] The supercell dropped hailstones larger than 8 centimetres (3.1\u00a0in) in diameter,[4][5] with the most significant damage occurring in the central business district and eastern suburbs of Sydney.[6][7] The event caused around 1000 injuries, with between 200 and 350 people requiring hospitalisation or other medical attention, predominantly caused by broken glass shards.[4][8] The majority of severe injuries reported were suffered by people on Sydney's beaches, where many were without shelter.[1] The size of the hailstones were the largest seen in Sydney for 52 years, until the 1999 Sydney hailstorm caused A$1.7 billion in insured damage in becoming the costliest natural disaster in Australian history.[5]"

The variation of air temperature in the atmosphere; with warm and humid air close to the ground and colder air above it causes instability, and the cold upper atmosphere temperatures allow the precipitation to fall in solid form as hailstones.[9] Since records began in 1791, hailstorms in the month of January form approximately 13% of the total number of hailstorms in the Sydney metropolitan area, and over 15% of all events with 'large hail'.[10] Hailstorms have a history of significant damage in Australia. Since records on insured losses began in 1967, four hailstorms\u2014Sydney in 1986, 1990 and 1999, as well as Brisbane in 1985\u2014have featured on the top ten list of most insured damages caused by a single Australian natural disaster. Hailstorms caused more than 30% of all insured damages inflicted as a result of natural disasters in Australia during this period, and around three quarters of all hailstorm damage has occurred in New South Wales.[11] The conditions on New Year's Day, 1947 were meteorologically sound for the formation of a storm. The day was hot and humid, with the maximum temperature recorded during the day being 32.7\u00a0\u00b0C (90.9\u00a0\u00b0F) and humidity reaching 73%.[12] Many Sydneysiders travelled to the beaches along the coastline to benefit from the afternoon sea breeze. The general weather pattern for Sydney in summer is movement from the west to the east\u2014from over the Blue Mountains to across the city and into the Tasman Sea.[1]"

        "content": "Developing from the Blue Mountains to the south-west of Sydney in the morning of 1 January 1947, the storm cell was first identified at 10:00\u00a0am by weather observers at Mascot.[7] The formation of storms in this region is not unusual, especially given the hot and humid conditions at ground level which causes atmospheric instability. However, the Bureau of Meteorology reported that the formation of the storm was different from most others, describing how \"the underpart of the cloud was mottled and serrated or curtained, rather than mammilated, and looked angry black, while false cirrus tufts were discernible at the top\".[1][2] The storm cell dropped hailstones the size of billiard balls across the south-western suburbs of Sydney. It moved directly over Liverpool at 2:25\u00a0pm, heading in a north-east direction before slowly bending its path and travelling almost due east as it passed over the southern part of the central business district.[7] \"Large explosion-like sounds\", presumed to be thunder by the Bureau, were heard around the Sydney Harbour Bridge.[13] The sounds were described by the Bureau\u2014who were based at Observatory Hill, next to the southwest pylon of the Bridge, in 1947\u2014as a \"terrific noise\" akin to \"several trains\u00a0... passing over [the Bridge]\".[2] The storm intensified as it cut through the suburbs, and eventually unleashed its full power across the eastern suburbs of Sydney. The suburbs most seriously affected were Surry Hills, south of the central district, as well as Bondi and Rose Bay in the Waverley region which were struck at around 2:40\u00a0pm.[6][8] The hailstorm pelted beach-goers, particularly at Bondi Beach, and the situation was described by a World War II veteran as \"though [he] was back in the firing line overseas\".[13] The hail in the coastal regions was described as being of similar size to a cricket ball.[7]"

        "content": "The most damage was caused when the storm was its most intense, over the eastern suburbs of the city. According to the Bureau of Meteorology, over 5,000 roofs were damaged in Waverley by the lumps of hail which weighed up to 1.8\u00a0kg (4.0\u00a0lb).[5][8] No official cost total exists for the amount of damage caused by the 1947 hailstorm, however a Reuters article published in The New York Times on 2 January estimated preliminary damage to be worth around US$3\u00a0million, equivalent to \u00a3750,000.[3] This is approximately equal to A$45\u00a0million in modern figures, placing it well below the costliest natural disasters in Australian history; this, given the severity of the storm cell, is attributable mainly to the relative inexpensiveness of buildings and other items of the era.[13][14] More definite historical accounts exist for damage caused to certain buildings. The historic skylight which runs through the centre of the main Central railway station building was smashed, and the shards reportedly fell in sizes up to 26\u00a0cm2 (4\u00a0sq\u00a0in) on around 100 waiting passengers.[13][15] Convertible cars, in fashion at the time of the storm, also sustained severe damage, mainly punctures to the soft-top roofs, and trams that ran through the eastern suburbs at the time also suffered damage.[7][13] According to veteran meteorologist Richard Whitaker, \"Sydney was staggered by the enormity of the incident, as there had not been even a remotely similar storm in living memory\".[4] The problems were exacerbated due to a lack of building materials available for use in repair work, a result of World War II which had concluded only 18 months prior. This contributed to the delays which resulted in houses still covered with only temporary tarpaulins several years later.[4] Most of the approximately 1000 injuries were caused by the hailstones directly striking people or from flying debris, with the latter mainly from shattered windows.[4][16] Of these, between 200 and 350 people required hospitalisation or other medical attention, however figures vary between different sources.[4][8] The storm struck during the afternoon of a public holiday\u2014New Year's Day\u2014which produced hot and humid conditions, and the beaches in the eastern suburbs were significantly populated.[1] The beach-goers were exposed to the large hail when the storm cell reached the coastline, and according to the front-page report in the Sydney Morning Herald the following day, \"[f]or nearly three hours, ambulance wagons travelled from the eastern suburbs beaches with the injured\".[15] The 8\u00a0cm (3.1\u00a0in) hailstones which fell during the 1947 event were not matched in Sydney for 52 years, until the 1999 hailstorm, which caused A$1.7\u00a0billion in insured damage\u2014the costliest natural disaster in Australian history.[5]"

Located on Australia's east coast, the metropolis surrounds Sydney Harbour and extends about 80 km (50 mi) from the Pacific Ocean in the east to the Blue Mountains in the west, and about 80 km (50 mi) from the Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park and the Hawkesbury River in the north and north-west, to the Royal National Park and Macarthur in the south and south-west.[5] Greater Sydney consists of 658 suburbs, spread across 33 local government areas. Residents of the city are colloquially known as \"Sydneysiders\".[6] The estimated population in June 2023 was 5,450,496,[1] which is about 66% of the state's population.[7] The city's nicknames include the \"Emerald City\" and the \"Harbour City\".[8] Aboriginal Australians have inhabited the Greater Sydney region for at least 30,000 years, and their engravings and cultural sites are common. The traditional custodians of the land on which modern Sydney stands are the clans of the Darug, Dharawal and Eora peoples.[9] During his first Pacific voyage in 1770, James Cook charted the eastern coast of Australia, making landfall at Botany Bay. In 1788, the First Fleet of convicts, led by Arthur Phillip, founded Sydney as a British penal colony, the first European settlement in Australia.[10] After World War II, Sydney experienced mass migration and by 2021 over 40 per cent of the population was born overseas. Foreign countries of birth with the greatest representation are mainland China, India, the United Kingdom, Vietnam and the Philippines.[11] Despite being one of the most expensive cities in the world,[12][13] Sydney frequently ranks in the top ten most liveable cities.[14][15][16] It is classified as an Alpha city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network, indicating its influence in the region and throughout the world.[17][18] Ranked eleventh in the world for economic opportunity,[19] Sydney has an advanced market economy with strengths in education, finance, manufacturing and tourism.[20][21] The University of Sydney and the University of New South Wales are ranked equal 19th in the world.[22] Sydney has hosted major international sporting events such as the 2000 Summer Olympics. The city is among the top fifteen most-visited,[23] with millions of tourists coming each year to see the city's landmarks.[24] The city has over 1,000,000\u00a0ha (2,500,000 acres) of nature reserves and parks,[25] and its notable natural features include Sydney Harbour and Royal National Park. The Sydney Harbour Bridge and the World Heritage-listed Sydney Opera House are major tourist attractions. Central Station is the hub of Sydney's suburban train, metro and light rail networks and longer-distance services. The main passenger airport serving the city is Kingsford Smith Airport, one of the world's oldest continually operating airports.[26]"

Aboriginal clan names within the Sydney region were often formed by adding the suffix \"-gal\" to a word denoting the name for their territory, a specific place in their territory, a food source, or totem. Greater Sydney covers the traditional lands of 28 known Aboriginal clans.[31]"

        "content": "The first people to inhabit the area now known as Sydney were Aboriginal Australians who had migrated from southeast Asia via northern Australia.[32] Flaked pebbles found in Western Sydney's gravel sediments might indicate human occupation from 45,000 to 50,000 years ago,[33] while radiocarbon dating has shown evidence of human activity in the region from around 30,000 years ago.[34] Prior to the arrival of the British, there were 4,000 to 8,000 Aboriginal people in the greater Sydney region.[35][9] The inhabitants subsisted on fishing, hunting, and gathering plants and shellfish. The diet of the coastal clans was more reliant on seafood whereas hinterland clans ate more forest animals and plants. The clans had distinctive equipment and weapons mostly made of stone, wood, plant materials, bone and shell. They also differed in their body decorations, hairstyles, songs and dances. Aboriginal clans had a rich ceremonial life, part of a belief system centring on ancestral, totemic and supernatural beings. People from different clans and language groups came together to participate in initiation and other ceremonies. These occasions fostered trade, marriages and clan alliances.[36] The earliest British settlers recorded the word 'Eora' as an Aboriginal term meaning either 'people' or 'from this place'.[37][9] The clans of the Sydney area occupied land with traditional boundaries. There is debate, however, about which group or nation these clans belonged to, and the extent of differences in language and rites. The major groups were the coastal Eora people, the Dharug (Darug) occupying the inland area from Parramatta to the Blue Mountains, and the Dharawal people south of Botany Bay.[9] Darginung and Gundungurra languages were spoken on the fringes of the Sydney area.[38] The first meeting between Aboriginals and British explorers occurred on 29 April 1770 when Lieutenant James Cook landed at Botany Bay (Kamay[41]) and encountered the Gweagal clan.[42] Two Gweagal men opposed the landing party and one was shot and wounded.[43][44] Cook and his crew stayed at Botany Bay for a week, collecting water, timber, fodder and botanical specimens and exploring the surrounding area. Cook sought to establish relations with the Aboriginal population without success.[45]"

        "content": "Britain had been sending convicts to its American colonies for most of the eighteenth century, and the loss of these colonies in 1783 was the impetus to establish a penal colony at Botany Bay. Proponents of colonisation also pointed to the strategic importance of a new base in the Asia-Pacific region and its potential to provide much-needed timber and flax for the navy.[46] The First Fleet of 11 ships under the command of Captain Arthur Phillip arrived in Botany Bay in January 1788. It comprised more than a thousand settlers, including 736 convicts.[47] The fleet soon moved to the more suitable Port Jackson where a settlement was established at Sydney Cove on 26 January 1788.[48] The colony of New South Wales was formally proclaimed by Governor Phillip on 7 February 1788. Sydney Cove offered a fresh water supply and a safe harbour, which Philip described as \"the finest Harbour in the World ... Here a Thousand Sail of the Line may ride in the most perfect Security\".[49] The settlement was planned to be a self-sufficient penal colony based on subsistence agriculture. Trade and shipbuilding were banned in order to keep the convicts isolated. However, the soil around the settlement proved poor and the first crops failed, leading to several years of hunger and strict rationing. The food crisis was relieved with the arrival of the Second Fleet in mid-1790 and the Third Fleet in 1791.[50] Former convicts received small grants of land, and government and private farms spread to the more fertile lands around Parramatta, Windsor and Camden on the Cumberland Plain. By 1804, the colony was self-sufficient in food.[51] A smallpox epidemic in April 1789 killed about half the region's Indigenous population.[9][52] In November 1790 Bennelong led a group of survivors of the Sydney clans into the settlement, establishing a continuous presence of Aboriginal Australians in settled Sydney.[53] Phillip had been given no instructions for urban development, but in July 1788 submitted a plan for the new town at Sydney Cove. It included a wide central avenue, a permanent Government House, law courts, hospital and other public buildings, but no provision for warehouses, shops, or other commercial buildings. Phillip promptly ignored his own plan, and unplanned development became a feature of Sydney's topography.[54][55] After Phillip's departure in December 1792, the colony's military officers began acquiring land and importing consumer goods from visiting ships. Former convicts engaged in trade and opened small businesses. Soldiers and former convicts built houses on Crown land, with or without official permission, in what was now commonly called Sydney town. Governor William Bligh (1806\u201308) imposed restrictions on commerce and ordered the demolition of buildings erected on Crown land, including some owned by past and serving military officers. The resulting conflict culminated in the Rum Rebellion of 1808, in which Bligh was deposed by the New South Wales Corps.[56][57] Governor Lachlan Macquarie (1810\u20131821) played a leading role in the development of Sydney and New South Wales, establishing a bank, a currency and a hospital. He employed a planner to design the street layout of Sydney and commissioned the construction of roads, wharves, churches, and public buildings. Parramatta Road, linking Sydney and Parramatta, was opened in 1811,[58] and a road across the Blue Mountains was completed in 1815, opening the way for large-scale farming and grazing west of the Great Dividing Range.[59][60] Following the departure of Macquarie, official policy encouraged the emigration of free British settlers to New South Wales. Immigration to the colony increased from 900 free settlers in 1826\u201330 to 29,000 in 1836\u201340, many of whom settled in Sydney.[61][62] By the 1840s Sydney exhibited a geographic divide between poor and working-class residents living west of the Tank Stream in areas such as The Rocks, and the more affluent residents living to its east.[62] Free settlers, free-born residents and former convicts now represented the vast majority of the population of Sydney, leading to increasing public agitation for responsible government and an end to transportation. Transportation to New South Wales ceased in 1840.[63]"

        "content": "In 1804, Irish convicts led around 300 rebels in the Castle Hill Rebellion, an attempt to march on Sydney, commandeer a ship, and sail to freedom.[64] Poorly armed, and with their leader Philip Cunningham captured, the main body of insurgents were routed by about 100 troops and volunteers at Rouse Hill. At least 39 convicts were killed in the uprising and subsequent executions.[65][66] As the colony spread to the more fertile lands around the Hawkesbury River, north-west of Sydney, conflict between the settlers and the Darug people intensified, reaching a peak from 1794 to 1810. Bands of Darug people, led by Pemulwuy and later by his son Tedbury, burned crops, killed livestock and raided settler stores in a pattern of resistance that was to be repeated as the colonial frontier expanded. A military garrison was established on the Hawkesbury in 1795. The death toll from 1794 to 1800 was 26 settlers and up to 200 Darug.[67][68] Conflict again erupted from 1814 to 1816 with the expansion of the colony into Dharawal country in the Nepean region south-west of Sydney. Following the deaths of several settlers, Governor Macquarie dispatched three military detachments into Dharawal lands, culminating in the Appin massacre (April 1816) in which at least 14 Aboriginal people were killed.[69][70]"

Sydney was declared a city the same year, and a governing council established, elected on a restrictive property franchise.[63] The discovery of gold in New South Wales and Victoria in 1851 initially caused economic disruption as men moved to the goldfields. Melbourne soon overtook Sydney as Australia's largest city, leading to an enduring rivalry between the two. However, increased immigration from overseas and wealth from gold exports increased demand for housing, consumer goods, services and urban amenities.[71] The New South Wales government also stimulated growth by investing heavily in railways, trams, roads, ports, telegraph, schools and urban services.[72] The population of Sydney and its suburbs grew from 95,600 in 1861 to 386,900 in 1891.[73] The city developed many of its characteristic features. The growing population packed into rows of terrace houses in narrow streets. New public buildings of sandstone abounded, including at the University of Sydney (1854\u201361),[74] the Australian Museum (1858\u201366),[75] the Town Hall (1868\u201388),[76] and the General Post Office (1866\u201392).[77] Elaborate coffee palaces and hotels were erected.[78] Daylight bathing at Sydney's beaches was banned, but segregated bathing at designated ocean baths was popular.[79] Drought, the winding down of public works and a financial crisis led to economic depression in Sydney throughout most of the 1890s. Meanwhile, the Sydney-based premier of New South Wales, George Reid, became a key figure in the process of federation.[80]"

        "content": "When the six colonies federated on 1 January 1901, Sydney became the capital of the State of New South Wales. The spread of bubonic plague in 1900 prompted the state government to modernise the wharves and demolish inner-city slums. The outbreak of the First World War in 1914 saw more Sydney males volunteer for the armed forces than the Commonwealth authorities could process, and helped reduce unemployment. Those returning from the war in 1918 were promised \"homes fit for heroes\" in new suburbs such as Daceyville and Matraville. \"Garden suburbs\" and mixed industrial and residential developments also grew along the rail and tram corridors.[62] The population reached one million in 1926, after Sydney had regained its position as the most populous city in Australia.[81] The government created jobs with massive public projects such as the electrification of the Sydney rail network and building the Sydney Harbour Bridge.[82] Sydney was more severely affected by the Great Depression of the 1930s than regional New South Wales or Melbourne.[83] New building almost came to a standstill, and by 1933 the unemployment rate for male workers was 28 per cent, but over 40 per cent in working class areas such as Alexandria and Redfern. Many families were evicted from their homes and shanty towns grew along coastal Sydney and Botany Bay, the largest being \"Happy Valley\" at La Perouse.[84] The Depression also exacerbated political divisions. In March 1932, when populist Labor premier Jack Lang attempted to open the Sydney Harbour Bridge he was upstaged by Francis de Groot of the far-right New Guard, who slashed the ribbon with a sabre.[85] In January 1938, Sydney celebrated the Empire Games and the sesquicentenary of European settlement in Australia. One journalist wrote, \"Golden beaches. Sun tanned men and maidens...Red-roofed villas terraced above the blue waters of the harbour...Even Melbourne seems like some grey and stately city of Northern Europe compared with Sydney's sub-tropical splendours.\" A congress of the \"Aborigines of Australia\" declared 26 January \"A Day of Mourning\" for \"the whiteman's seizure of our country.\"[86] With the outbreak of Second World War in 1939, Sydney experienced a surge in industrial development. Unemployment virtually disappeared and women moved into jobs previously typically reserved for males. Sydney was attacked by Japanese submarines in May and June 1942 with 21 killed. Households built air raid shelters and performed drills.[87] Military establishments in response to World War II in Australia included the Garden Island Tunnel System, the only tunnel warfare complex in Sydney, and the heritage-listed military fortification systems Bradleys Head Fortification Complex and Middle Head Fortifications, which were part of a total defence system for Sydney Harbour.[88] A post-war immigration and baby boom saw a rapid increase in Sydney's population and the spread of low-density housing in suburbs throughout the Cumberland Plain. Immigrants\u2014mostly from Britain and continental Europe\u2014and their children accounted for over three-quarters of Sydney's population growth between 1947 and 1971.[89] The newly created Cumberland County Council oversaw low-density residential developments, the largest at Green Valley and Mount Druitt. Older residential centres such as Parramatta, Bankstown and Liverpool became suburbs of the metropolis.[90] Manufacturing, protected by high tariffs, employed over a third of the workforce from 1945 to the 1960s. However, as the long post-war economic boom progressed, retail and other service industries became the main source of new jobs.[91] An estimated one million onlookers, most of the city's population, watched Queen Elizabeth II land in 1954 at Farm Cove where Captain Phillip had raised the Union Jack 165 years earlier, commencing her Australian Royal Tour. It was the first time a reigning monarch stepped onto Australian soil.[92] Increasing high-rise development in Sydney and the expansion of suburbs beyond the \"green belt\" envisaged by the planners of the 1950s resulted in community protests. In the early 1970s, trade unions and resident action groups imposed green bans on development projects in historic areas such as The Rocks. Federal, State and local governments introduced heritage and environmental legislation.[62] The Sydney Opera House was also controversial for its cost and disputes between architect J\u00f8rn Utzon and government officials. However, soon after it opened in 1973 it became a major tourist attraction and symbol of the city.[93] The progressive reduction in tariff protection from 1974 began the transformation of Sydney from a manufacturing centre to a \"world city\".[94] From the 1980s, overseas immigration grew rapidly, with Asia, the Middle East and Africa becoming major sources. By 2021, the population of Sydney was over 5.2 million, with 40% of the population born overseas. China and India overtook England as the largest source countries for overseas-born residents.[95]"

Sydney spans two geographic regions. The Cumberland Plain lies to the south and west of the Harbour and is relatively flat. The Hornsby Plateau is located to the north and is dissected by steep valleys. The flat areas of the south were the first to be developed; it was not until the construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge that the northern reaches became more heavily populated. Seventy surf beaches can be found along its coastline, with Bondi Beach being the most famous. The Nepean River wraps around the western edge of the city and becomes the Hawkesbury River before reaching Broken Bay. Most of Sydney's water storages can be found on tributaries of the Nepean River. The Parramatta River is mostly industrial and drains a large area of Sydney's western suburbs into Port Jackson. The southern parts of the city are drained by the Georges River and the Cooks River into Botany Bay. There is no single definition of the boundaries of Sydney. The Australian Statistical Geography Standard definition of Greater Sydney covers 12,369\u00a0km2 (4,776\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) and includes the local government areas of Central Coast in the north, Hawkesbury in the north-west, Blue Mountains in the west, Sutherland Shire in the south, and Wollondilly in the south-west.[96] The local government area of the City of Sydney covers about 26 square kilometres from Garden island in the east to Bicentennial Park in the west, and south to the suburbs of Alexandria and Rosebery.[97]"

The sandstone has shale lenses and fossil riverbeds.[99] The Sydney Basin bioregion includes coastal features of cliffs, beaches, and estuaries. Deep river valleys known as rias were carved during the Triassic period in the Hawkesbury sandstone of the coastal region. The rising sea level between 18,000 and 6,000 years ago flooded the rias to form estuaries and deep harbours.[99] Port Jackson, better known as Sydney Harbour, is one such ria.[100] Sydney features two major soil types: sandy soils (which originate from the Hawkesbury sandstone) and clay (which are from shales and volcanic rocks), though some soils may be a mixture of the two.[101] Directly overlying the older Hawkesbury sandstone is the Wianamatta shale, a geological feature found in western Sydney that was deposited in connection with a large river delta during the Middle Triassic. The Wianamatta shale generally comprises fine grained sedimentary rocks such as shales, mudstones, ironstones, siltstones and laminites, with less common sandstone units.[102] The Wianamatta Group is made up of Bringelly Shale, Minchinbury Sandstone and Ashfield Shale.[103]"

Sydney also features a few areas of wet sclerophyll forests in the wetter, elevated areas in the north and northeast. These forests are defined by straight, tall tree canopies with a moist understory of soft-leaved shrubs, tree ferns and herbs.[107] The predominant vegetation community in Sydney is the Cumberland Plain Woodland in Western Sydney (Cumberland Plain),[108] followed by the Sydney Turpentine-Ironbark Forest in the Inner West and Northern Sydney,[109] the Eastern Suburbs Banksia Scrub in the coastline and the Blue Gum High Forest scantily present in the North Shore \u2013 all of which are critically endangered.[110][111] The city also includes the Sydney Sandstone Ridgetop Woodland found in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park on the Hornsby Plateau to the north.[112] Sydney is home to dozens of bird species,[113] which commonly include the Australian raven, Australian magpie, crested pigeon, noisy miner and the pied currawong. Introduced bird species ubiquitously found in Sydney are the common myna, common starling, house sparrow and the spotted dove.[114] Reptile species are also numerous and predominantly include skinks.[115][116] Sydney has a few mammal and spider species, such as the grey-headed flying fox and the Sydney funnel-web, respectively,[117][118] and has a huge diversity of marine species inhabiting its harbour and beaches.[119]"

The weather is moderated by proximity to the ocean, and more extreme temperatures are recorded in the inland western suburbs.[127] At Sydney's primary weather station at Observatory Hill, extreme temperatures have ranged from 45.8\u00a0\u00b0C (114.4\u00a0\u00b0F) on 18 January 2013 to 2.1\u00a0\u00b0C (35.8\u00a0\u00b0F) on 22 June 1932.[128][129][130] An average of 14.9 days a year have temperatures at or above 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F) in the central business district (CBD).[127] In contrast, the metropolitan area averages between 35 and 65 days, depending on the suburb.[131] The hottest day in the metropolitan area occurred in Penrith on 4 January 2020, where a high of 48.9\u00a0\u00b0C (120.0\u00a0\u00b0F) was recorded.[132] The average annual temperature of the sea ranges from 18.5\u00a0\u00b0C (65.3\u00a0\u00b0F) in September to 23.7\u00a0\u00b0C (74.7\u00a0\u00b0F) in February.[133] Sydney has an average of 7.2 hours of sunshine per day[134] and 109.5 clear days annually.[4] Due to the inland location, frost is recorded early in the morning in Western Sydney a few times in winter. Autumn and spring are the transitional seasons, with spring showing a larger temperature variation than autumn.[135] Sydney experiences an urban heat island effect.[136] This makes certain parts of the city more vulnerable to extreme heat, including coastal suburbs.[136][137] In late spring and summer, temperatures over 35\u00a0\u00b0C (95\u00a0\u00b0F) are not uncommon,[138] though hot, dry conditions are usually ended by a southerly buster,[139] a powerful southerly that brings gale winds and a rapid fall in temperature.[140] Since Sydney is downwind of the Great Dividing Range, it occasionally experiences dry, westerly foehn winds typically in winter and early spring (which are the reason for its warm maximum temperatures).[141][142][143] Westerly winds are intense when the Roaring Forties (or the Southern Annular Mode) shift towards southeastern Australia,[144] where they may damage homes and affect flights, in addition to making the temperature seem colder than it actually is.[145][146] Rainfall has a moderate to low variability and has historically been fairly uniform throughout the year, although in recent years it has been more summer-dominant and erratic.[147][148][149][150] Precipitation is usually higher in summer through to autumn,[122] and lower in late winter to early spring.[125][151][127][152] In late autumn and winter, east coast lows may bring large amounts of rainfall, especially in the CBD.[153] In the warm season black nor'easters are usually the cause of heavy rain events, though other forms of low-pressure areas, including remnants of ex-cyclones, may also bring heavy deluge and afternoon thunderstorms.[154][155] Snowfall was last reported in 1836, though a fall of graupel, or soft hail, in the Upper North Shore was mistaken by many for snow, in July 2008.[156] In 2009, dry conditions brought a severe dust storm towards the city.[157][158]"

The Sydney CBD is characterised by narrow streets and thoroughfares, created in its convict beginnings.[167] Several localities, distinct from suburbs, exist throughout Sydney's inner reaches. Central and Circular Quay are transport hubs with ferry, rail, and bus interchanges. Chinatown, Darling Harbour, and Kings Cross are important locations for culture, tourism, and recreation. The Strand Arcade, located between Pitt Street Mall and George Street, is a historical Victorian-style shopping arcade. Opened on 1 April 1892, its shop fronts are an exact replica of the original internal shopping facades.[168] Westfield Sydney, located beneath the Sydney Tower, is the largest shopping centre by area in Sydney.[169] Since the late 20th century, there has been a trend of gentrification amongst Sydney's inner suburbs. Pyrmont, located on the harbour, was redeveloped from a centre of shipping and international trade to an area of high density housing, tourist accommodation, and gambling.[170] Originally located well outside of the city, Darlinghurst is the location of the historic Darlinghurst Gaol, manufacturing, and mixed housing. For a period it was known as an area of prostitution. The terrace-style housing has largely been retained and Darlinghurst has undergone significant gentrification since the 1980s.[171][172][173] Green Square is a former industrial area of Waterloo which is undergoing urban renewal worth $8\u00a0billion. On the city harbour edge, the historic suburb and wharves of Millers Point are being built up as the new area of Barangaroo.[174][175] The suburb of Paddington is known for its restored terrace houses, Victoria Barracks, and shopping including the weekly Oxford Street markets.[176]"

These areas have undergone gentrification in the late 20th century, and many parts are now highly valued residential suburbs.[178] As of 2021, an Inner West suburb (Strathfield) remained one of the 20 most expensive postcodes in Australia by median house price (the others were all in metropolitan Sydney, all in Northern Sydney or the Eastern Suburbs).[179] The University of Sydney is located in this area, as well as the University of Technology, Sydney and a campus of the Australian Catholic University. The Anzac Bridge spans Johnstons Bay and connects Rozelle to Pyrmont and the city, forming part of the Western Distributor. The Inner West is today well known as the location of village commercial centres with cosmopolitan flavours, such as the \"Little Italy\" commercial centres of Leichardt, Five Dock and Haberfield,[180] \"Little Portugal\" in Petersham,[181] \"Little Korea\" in Strathfield[182] or \"Little Shanghai\" in Ashfield.[183] Large-scale shopping centres in the area include Westfield Burwood, DFO Homebush and Birkenhead Point Outlet Centre. There is a large cosmopolitan community and nightlife hub on King Street in Newtown. The area is serviced by the T1, T2, and T3 railway lines, including the Main Suburban Line, which was the first to be constructed in New South Wales. Strathfield railway station is a secondary railway hub within Sydney, and major station on the Suburban and Northern lines. It was constructed in 1876.[184] The future Sydney Metro West will also connect this area with the City and Parramatta. The area is also serviced by the Parramatta River services of Sydney Ferries,[185] numerous bus routes and cycleways.[186]"

Macarthur Square, a shopping complex in Campbelltown, has become one of the largest shopping complexes in Sydney.[213] The southwest also features Bankstown Reservoir, the oldest elevated reservoir constructed in reinforced concrete that is still in use and is listed on the State Heritage Register.[214] The southwest is home to one of Sydney's oldest trees, the Bland Oak, which was planted in the 1840s by William Bland in Carramar.[215]"

The city now has a world heritage listed building, several national heritage listed buildings, and dozens of Commonwealth heritage listed buildings as evidence of the survival of Macquarie's ideals.[217][218][219] In 1814, the Governor called on a convict named Francis Greenway to design Macquarie Lighthouse.[220] The lighthouse's Classical design earned Greenway a pardon from Macquarie in 1818 and introduced a culture of refined architecture that remains to this day.[221] Greenway went on to design the Hyde Park Barracks in 1819 and the Georgian style St James's Church in 1824.[222][223] Gothic-inspired architecture became more popular from the 1830s. John Verge's Elizabeth Bay House and St Philip's Church of 1856 were built in Gothic Revival style along with Edward Blore's Government House of 1845.[224][225] Kirribilli House, completed in 1858, and St Andrew's Cathedral, Australia's oldest cathedral,[226] are rare examples of Victorian Gothic construction.[224][227] From the late 1850s there was a shift towards Classical architecture. Mortimer Lewis designed the Australian Museum in 1857.[228] The General Post Office, completed in 1891 in Victorian Free Classical style, was designed by James Barnet.[229] Barnet also oversaw the 1883 reconstruction of Greenway's Macquarie Lighthouse.[220][221] Customs House was built in 1844.[230] The neo-Classical and French Second Empire style Town Hall was completed in 1889.[231][232] Romanesque designs gained favour from the early 1890s. Sydney Technical College was completed in 1893 using both Romanesque Revival and Queen Anne approaches.[233] The Queen Victoria Building was designed in Romanesque Revival fashion by George McRae; completed in 1898,[234] it accommodates 200 shops across its three storeys.[235] As the wealth of the settlement increased and Sydney developed into a metropolis after Federation in 1901, its buildings became taller. Sydney's first tower was Culwulla Chambers which topped out at 50\u00a0m (160\u00a0ft) making 12 floors. The Commercial Traveller's Club, built in 1908, was of similar height at 10 floors. It was built in a brick stone veneer and demolished in 1972.[236] This heralded a change in Sydney's cityscape and with the lifting of height restrictions in the 1960s there came a surge of high-rise construction.[237] The Great Depression had a tangible influence on Sydney's architecture. New structures became more restrained with far less ornamentation. The most notable architectural feat of this period is the Harbour Bridge. Its steel arch was designed by John Bradfield and completed in 1932. A total of 39,000 tonnes of structural steel span the 503\u00a0m (1,650\u00a0ft) between Milsons Point and Dawes Point.[238][239] Modern and International architecture came to Sydney from the 1940s. Since its completion in 1973 the city's Opera House has become a World Heritage Site and one of the world's most renowned pieces of Modern design. J\u00f8rn Utzon was awarded the Pritzker Prize in 2003 for his work on the Opera House.[240] Sydney is home to Australia's first building by renowned Canadian-American architect Frank Gehry, the Dr Chau Chak Wing Building (2015). An entrance from The Goods Line\u2013a pedestrian pathway and former railway line\u2013is located on the eastern border of the site. Contemporary buildings in the CBD include Citigroup Centre,[241] Aurora Place,[242] Chifley Tower,[243][244] the Reserve Bank building,[245] Deutsche Bank Place,[246] MLC Centre,[247] and Capita Centre.[248] The tallest structure is Sydney Tower, designed by Donald Crone and completed in 1981.[249] Due to the proximity of Sydney Airport, a maximum height restriction was imposed, now sitting at 330 metres (1083 feet).[250] Green bans and heritage overlays have been in place since at least 1977 to protect Sydney's heritage after controversial demolitions in the 1970s.[251]"

Due to environmental and economic pressures, there has been a noted trend towards denser housing, with a 30% increase in the number of apartments between 1996 and 2006.[257] Public housing in Sydney is managed by the Government of New South Wales.[258] Suburbs with large concentrations of public housing include Claymore, Macquarie Fields, Waterloo, and Mount Druitt. A range of heritage housing styles can be found throughout Sydney. Terrace houses are found in the inner suburbs such as Paddington, The Rocks, Potts Point and Balmain, many of which have been the subject of gentrification.[259][260] These terraces, particularly those in suburbs such as The Rocks, were historically home to Sydney's miners and labourers. In the present day, terrace houses now make up some of the most valuable real estate in the city.[261] Surviving large mansions from the Victorian era are mostly found in the oldest suburbs, such as Double Bay, Darling Point, Rose Bay and Strathfield.[262] Federation homes, constructed around the time of Federation in 1901, are located in a large number of suburbs that developed thanks to the arrival of railways in the late 19th century, such as Penshurst and Turramurra, and in large-scale planned \"garden suburbs\" such as Haberfield. Workers cottages are found in Surry Hills, Redfern, and Balmain. California bungalows are common in Ashfield, Concord, and Beecroft. Larger modern homes are predominantly found in the outer suburbs, such as Stanhope Gardens, Kellyville Ridge, Bella Vista to the northwest, Bossley Park, Abbotsbury, and Cecil Hills to the west, and Hoxton Park, Harrington Park, and Oran Park to the southwest.[263]"

This makes them the oldest botanic garden in Australia.[272] The Gardens host scientific research with herbarium collections, a library and laboratories.[273] The two parks have a total area of 64\u00a0ha (0.2\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) with 8,900 individual plant species and receive over 3.5\u00a0million annual visits.[274] To the south of The Domain is Hyde Park, the oldest public parkland in Australia which measures 16.2\u00a0ha (0.1\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[275] Its location was used for both relaxation and grazing of animals from the earliest days of the colony.[276] Macquarie dedicated it in 1810 for the \"recreation and amusement of the inhabitants of the town\" and named it in honour of Hyde Park in London."

Governor Macquarie created two coins from every Spanish silver dollar in circulation.[283] The economy was capitalist in nature by the 1840s as the proportion of free settlers increased, the maritime and wool industries flourished, and the powers of the East India Company were curtailed.[283] Wheat, gold, and other minerals became export industries towards the end of the 1800s.[283] Significant capital began to flow into the city from the 1870s to finance roads, railways, bridges, docks, courthouses, schools and hospitals. Protectionist policies after federation allowed for the creation of a manufacturing industry which became the city's largest employer by the 1920s.[283] These same policies helped to relieve the effects of the Great Depression during which the unemployment rate in New South Wales reached as high as 32%.[283] From the 1960s onwards Parramatta gained recognition as the city's second CBD and finance and tourism became major industries and sources of employment.[283] Sydney's nominal gross domestic product was AU$400.9\u00a0billion and AU$80,000 per capita[284] in 2015.[285][282] Its gross domestic product was AU$337\u00a0billion in 2013, the largest in Australia.[285] The financial and insurance services industry accounts for 18.1% of gross product, ahead of professional services with 9% and manufacturing with 7.2%.

A catchment called the Tank Stream sourced water from what is now the CBD but was little more than an open sewer by the end of the 1700s.[456] The Botany Swamps Scheme was one of several ventures during the mid-1800s that saw the construction of wells, tunnels, steam pumping stations, and small dams to service Sydney's growing population.[456] The Upper Nepean Scheme came into operation in 1886. It transports water 100\u00a0km (62\u00a0mi) from the Nepean, Cataract, and Cordeaux rivers and continues to service about 15% of Sydney's water needs.[456] Dams were built on these three rivers between 1907 and 1935.[456] In 1977 the Shoalhaven Scheme brought several more dams into service.[457] The state-owned corporation WaterNSW now manages eleven major dams: Warragamba, one of the largest domestic water supply dams in the world,[458] Woronora, Cataract, Cordeaux, Nepean, Avon, Wingecarribee Reservoir, Fitzroy Falls Reservoir, Tallowa, the Blue Mountains Dams, and Prospect Reservoir.[459] Water is collected from five catchment areas covering 16,000\u00a0km2 (6,178\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) and total storage amounts to 2.6\u00a0TL (0.6\u00a0cu\u00a0mi).[459] The Sydney Desalination Plant came into operation in 2010.[456] WaterNSW supplies bulk water to Sydney Water, a state-owned corporation that operates water distribution, sewerage and storm water management services. Sydney's electricity infrastructure is maintained by Ausgrid and Endeavour Energy.[460][461] Their combined networks include over 815,000 poles and 83,000\u00a0km (52,000\u00a0mi) of cables. Submarine communications cable systems in Sydney include the Australia\u2013Japan Cable, Telstra Endeavour and the Southern Cross Cable, which link Australia and countries in the Pacific.[462][463][464]"

The air quality was 11 times the hazardous level in some days,[467][468] worse than New Delhi's;[469] it was compared to \"smoking 32 cigarettes\" by Brian Oliver, a respiratory diseases scientist at the University of Technology Sydney.[470] Since Sydney is surrounded by bushland and forest,[471] bushfires can ring the region in a natural phenomena that is labelled \"ring of fire\".[472][473][474][475][476] The City of Sydney became the first council in Australia to achieve formal certification as carbon-neutral in 2008.[477][478] The city has reduced its 2007 carbon emissions by 6% and since 2006 has reduced carbon emissions from city buildings by up to 20%.[479][480] The Sustainable Sydney 2030 program presented a guide to reducing energy in homes and offices by 30%.[479][481] Reductions in energy consumption have slashed energy bills by $30\u00a0million a year.[482] Solar panels have been established on many CBD buildings to minimise carbon pollution by around 3,000 tonnes a year.[483] The city also has an \"urban forest growth strategy\", in which it aims to regular increase the tree coverage in the city by frequently planting trees with strong leaf density and vegetation to provide cleaner air and create moisture during hot weather, thus lowering city temperatures.[484] Sydney has also become a leader in the development of green office buildings and enforcing the requirement of all building proposals to be energy-efficient. The One Central Park development, completed in 2013, is an example of this implementation.[485][486][487][488]"

Despite its high ranking for an Australian city, Sydney has a low level of mass-transit services, with a historically low-density layout and significant urban sprawl, thus increasing the likelihood of car dependency.[491][492] Strategies have been implemented to reduce private vehicle pollution by encouraging mass and public transit,[493] initiating the development of high density housing and introducing a fleet of 10 new electric cars, the largest order of the pollution-free vehicle in Australia.[494] Electric cars do not produce carbon monoxide and nitrous oxide, which contribute to climate change.[495][496] Cycling trips increased by 113% across Sydney's inner-city from 2010 to 2015, at which point about 2,000 bikes were passing through top peak-hour intersections on an average weekday.[479] Transport developments in the north-west and east of the city have been designed to encourage use of the expanding public transportation system."

The tenth depression, sixth deep depression and fifth cyclonic storm of the active 2021 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, its predecessor was first tracked by Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) in the South China Sea as an area of low pressure. It then moved west-northwestwards into the Gulf of Thailand, where it crossed into the Andaman Sea by December 1. Near midnight of that day, the JTWC issued a TCFA on the system and on the next day, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) upgraded the system to a depression after passing through the Nicobar Islands. Further intensification ensued as the depression tracked through environmental conditions favorable for strengthening, and the system was upgraded into a deep depression on December 3 and into a cyclonic storm by 06:00 UTC that day, with the IMD naming it Jawad. However, this intensification was short-lived, as the system weakened to a deep depression back due to wind shear. Widespread preparations were conducted due to Jawad. School and train operations were disrupted and canceled, and disaster teams were deployed in Andhra Pradesh and Odisha for the storm. Individuals living in coastal areas were evacuated, including over 54,000 people in the former state. Essential stocks were also prepared for possible emergencies, as well as disaster relief. Two fatalities were confirmed from the system so far, both from Srikakulam. Both teenagers were crushed to their deaths by falling coconut trees."

Located about 131 nautical miles (243\u00a0km; 151\u00a0mi) to the north-northwest of Phuket Island in Thailand, the agency analysed a low-level circulation along with its sprawling convection, while taking a west-northwestward track across the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. They also evaluated the environment around the storm as \"favorable\", with strong outflow, 29\u201330\u00a0\u00b0C (84\u201386\u00a0\u00b0F) sea surface temperatures and moderate wind shear.[4] Meanwhile, the IMD had already started to monitor this low-pressure area earlier at 03:00 UTC (8:30 IST), while it was located over southern Thailand.[5] Nevertheless, it moved over the Nicobar Islands and into the Bay of Bengal around December 1, with the IMD also upgrading the system to a well-marked low-pressure on that day.[6][7] However, moderate wind shear had displaced the system's convection to the northwest by 18:00 UTC that day.[8] Shortly before that midnight, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on the system, as numerical guidance forecast models revealed further strengthening of the storm.[9] On the next day, the low-pressure system turned to the northwest, before the IMD upgraded the storm into a depression, with the agency designating the storm as \"BOB 07\" at 12:00 UTC.[10][11] At 03:00 UTC (08:30 IST), the IMD further upgraded the system to a deep depression, as a Dvorak number of T 2.0 calculated for the system, indicating further organization.[12] Meanwhile, the JTWC designated the system as \"Tropical Cyclone 05B\" at the same time, as another Dvorak fix revealed a wind speed of 35 knots (65\u00a0km/h; 40\u00a0mph).[13] The deep depression took a west-northwestward track again, and approximately three hours later, the system strengthened into a cyclonic storm, with the IMD naming it Jawad, the fifth name from the naming lists of the annual cyclone season, which was submitted by Saudi Arabia,[14][15] which means \"generous\" or \"merciful\" in Arabic.[1][16][17] However, starting at 12:00 UTC, Jawad began to slow down, while retaining its organization.[18] Possibly due to decreasing sea surface temperatures along the storm's track with unfavorable wind shear, Jawad lost its organization and the IMD downgraded the storm back into a deep depression by 12:00 UTC of December 4.[19] This same reasoning was also used by the JTWC in the agency's final warning on the system, three hours earlier.[20] At the same time by the next day, Jawad was further downgraded into a depression as it started to make a northwestward move, and by December 6 at 00:00 UTC, the system further degenerated into a well-marked low-pressure over the northwest Bay of Bengal without making landfall; its convection moved inland over West Bengal and Bangladesh, however.[21]"

The sixteenth tropical cyclone, fourteenth named storm, and fifth hurricane of the record-breaking 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, Nana originated from a tropical wave that moved off the coast of West Africa on August\u00a023. The system progressed westward with little development for the next week before crossing into the Caribbean Sea. The wave gradually developed organized convection and a defined surface low on September\u00a01, signifying the formation of Tropical Storm Nana as it approached Jamaica. Persistent wind shear stifled development of the storm, though following repeated bursts of deep convection, it intensified into a minimal hurricane on September\u00a03. Nana attained peak winds of 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h)[nb 1] and a minimum pressure of 994\u00a0mbar (994\u00a0hPa; 29.4\u00a0inHg) shortly before striking Belize. Once onshore, the hurricane rapidly degraded and its surface low dissipated over Guatemala on September\u00a04. The mid-level remnants of Nana later reorganized over the Gulf of Tehuantepec and became Tropical Storm Julio. Throughout the Caribbean, Nana produced gusty winds and heavy rainfall in several nations. Damage was largely limited to flooding and landslides, with the most significant effects being felt in Belize and Mexico. More than 2,500 homes were flooded or otherwise damaged between the two nations. Belize also experienced significant agricultural damage. Collectively, economic losses in Central America and Mexico exceeded US$20\u00a0million[nb 2] as a result of the hurricane; however, no fatalities were reported."

        "content": "On August\u00a023, 2020, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) identified a westward-moving tropical wave over West Africa.[1] A broad area of disorganized convection, primarily east of the wave axis, accompanied the system as it emerged over the Atlantic Ocean early the next day.[1][2] Convection increased by August\u00a027 as the wave traversed the central Atlantic, and the NHC noted the possibility of gradual tropical cyclogenesis over the following days.[3] Little development occurred over the next few days as it approached the Windward Islands.[4] Upon entering the Caribbean Sea on August\u00a030, the system started to organize with evidence of a broad surface low apparent on satellite-derived observations.[5] Convection gradually increased as the system continued west across the Caribbean and appeared well-organized on satellite imagery. Scatterometer data and ship observations revealed tropical storm-force winds south of Haiti and southeast of Jamaica early on September\u00a01 and post-storm analysis indicated the system developed into Tropical Storm Nana at 06:00\u00a0UTC.[1][6][7] At the time, Nana was situated 180\u00a0mi (290\u00a0km) southeast of Kingston, Jamaica.[1] This marked the earliest formation of a season's fourteenth named storm, surpassing the previous record set by Hurricane Nate on September\u00a06, 2005.[8] Operationally, the NHC did not name the system at that point because it was unclear whether it had a well-defined low-level-circulation. However, with the storm posing an imminent threat to Central America, the NHC initiated advisories on the system as Potential Tropical Cyclone Sixteen at 15:00\u00a0UTC.[9] It was not warned on as a tropical storm until 17:00\u00a0UTC when aircraft reconnaissance confirmed a well-defined low with winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) aloft with estimated surface winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h).[10] With a defined anticyclone aloft providing ample outflow, high sea surface temperatures, and low to moderate wind shear, steady intensification was expected.[11] A small cyclone with tropical storm-force winds extending no more than 70\u00a0mi (110\u00a0km) from the center, Nana progressed along a generally westward trajectory in response to a subtropical ridge to the north. Persistent moderate wind shear and intrusions of dry air inhibited significant development of the system as it passed 155\u00a0mi (249\u00a0km) south of the Cayman Islands.[1] Early on September\u00a02, a burst of deep convection with cloud tops as cold as \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C (\u2212112\u00a0\u00b0F) developed over the storm's center and microwave satellite imagery revealed the formation of an eye-like feature. Furthermore, rainbands organized along the southwestern periphery of Nana.[12][13] Wind shear briefly disrupted this development, with Nana's surface center displaced to the northeastern edge of the convective mass, before abating later that day. The ridge over the Gulf of Mexico reoriented along a west-southwest to east-northeast axis, causing Nana to turn to the west-southwest. Another convective burst early on September\u00a03 led to the storm intensifying to a Category\u00a01 hurricane by 03:00\u00a0UTC. Nana reached its peak intensity at this time with maximum winds of 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 994\u00a0mbar (994\u00a0hPa; 29.4\u00a0inHg). Just three hours later, the hurricane made landfall near Sittee Point, Belize\u2014about 50\u00a0mi (80\u00a0km) south of Belize City.[1] Nana was the first hurricane to hit the country since Hurricane Earl in August 2016.[14] Rapid weakening ensued as the cyclone moved inland over mountainous terrain and into Guatemala.[1][15] Nana degraded to a tropical depression by 18:00\u00a0UTC, as it approached the Guatemala\u2013Mexico border, before degenerating into a remnant low by 00:00\u00a0UTC. The system's surface low dissipated soon thereafter, as it approached the southwestern coast of Guatemala.[1] The mid-level remnant of Nana then entered the Gulf of Tehuantepec and redeveloped a small surface low by 12:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a04.[16] Global weather models indicated conditions in the region were unfavorable for tropical cyclone development, and accordingly, the NHC did not expect Nana to redevelop.[16][17] Organized convection re-fired over the system and it regenerated into a tropical storm around 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a05. Since the low-level circulation of Nana dissipated during its crossing of Central America and was thus considered dissipated by the NHC, the reborn system was classified as Tropical Storm Julio. This new storm moved at an unusually-brisk pace to the west-northwest, attaining peak winds of 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h) on September\u00a06. Hostile conditions caused the small system to weaken to a tropical depression a day later, and a remnant low soon thereafter. Julio ultimately dissipated early on September\u00a07 to the southwest of Socorro Island.[16]"

Nearby \u00celes des Saintes recorded 3.1\u00a0in (80\u00a0mm).[23] In St. Lucia, increased turbidity and clogging due to heavy rain forced the temporary closure of the Theobalds Treatment Plant, which cut the water supply to residents in northern parts of the country.[24]"

The majority of evacuations were in southern districts, with 2,079 in Toledo and 980 in Stann Creek.[26][27] A collision between a pickup truck and container truck near Belize City may have been related to the hurricane, with residents rushing to prepare for the storm.[28] Hurricane Nana made landfall in a sparsely-populated area of Belize. Rainfall associated with its passage was heaviest to the south of the hurricane's center due to its lopsided structure. Accumulations reached 3 to 5\u00a0in (76 to 127\u00a0mm) in the Toledo District, with a peak of 5.7\u00a0in (144\u00a0mm) in Corazon.

Belize City saw peak winds of 47\u00a0mph (76\u00a0km/h) and just 0.69\u00a0in (18\u00a0mm) of rain. There were no known observations of storm surge or accompanying damage according to the National Meteorological Service of Belize. Large swells did cause minor damage to piers in Placencia.[1] A waterspout was observed offshore after Nana's landfall.[29] Wind damage was confined to a very small area of the Stann Creek District surrounding Nana's landfall point.[1] Structural damage occurred in Georgetown, Hopkins, Independence, Silk Grass, and Sittee River. Residences across Dangriga, Hopkins, and Placencia lost power.[30][31] A total of 24 homes were damaged by the storm: 13 in Silk Grass, 7 in Hopkins, and 4 in Dangriga. More than 960 acres (390 hectares) of banana and plantain crops worth BZ$20.5\u00a0million (US$10\u00a0million) were destroyed. The nation's citrus industry escaped significant losses.[32] The Government of Belize quickly distributed aid to the hardest-hit areas. The National Emergency Management Organization conducted damage surveys while the Ministry of Humanitarian Development coordinated relief efforts. Total aid, including zinc, zinc plywood, and foodstuffs, was valued at BZ$8\u201310\u00a0million (US$4\u20135\u00a0million).[33]"

Flooding in the Comayagua Department undermined rural roads, primarily in agricultural areas.[36] Flash floods stranded cars in Tegucigalpa.[37] Flooding also occurred in the Bay Islands and Gracias a Dios departments.[34] Strong winds and rough seas prompted evacuations in Roat\u00e1n.[38] A lightning strike in the El Corpus municipality damaged a church bell tower. Several farms suffered crop losses in the municipality.[36] There were no reports of tropical storm-force winds throughout the affected areas.[1] In Jamaica, Nana's rainfall caused some flooding in parts of the southern part of the country. In the Cayman Islands, Nana's rainfall caused some minor flooding in some low-lying areas on Grand Cayman.[25] Guatemala's National Coordinator for Disaster Reduction (Conred) alerted residents to potential flash floods, damaging winds, and power and water supply interruptions.[34] Authorities emphasized that the region was vulnerable to floods due to soil saturation from the annual rainy season and the prolific rains from tropical storms Amanda and Cristobal in May and June earlier that year.[39] However, no evacuations took place.[27] Heavy rains affected the country on September\u00a03\u20134, especially along its border with Mexico near the Pacific coast. Accumulations reached 5 to 7\u00a0in (130 to 180\u00a0mm) in this region, with a peak of 7.2\u00a0in (183\u00a0mm) in Trinidad.[1] A bridge collapsed in the Alta Verapaz Department, affecting 500\u00a0people.[26] Fallen trees blocked some roads and highways in the Izabal Department.[40][41] A tree fell on a home in Finca Salinas de Amatitl\u00e1n, injuring one person inside. Throughout the nation, a total of 18,865\u00a0people were directly affected though overall damage was not major.[42][43] A \"preventative alert\" was issued in El Salvador.[44] In Mexico, the primary impact from Nana was heavy rainfall across parts of Campeche, Chiapas, Oaxaca, Tabasco, and Veracruz.[45] A swath of up to 8\u00a0in (200\u00a0mm) was forecast along Nana's path in Eastern Mexico.[14] Heavy rain in Veracruz led to flash floods, primarily across the Papaloapan River basin. The Tesechoacan River, a tributary of the Papaloapan, overflowed its banks. Floodwaters reached a depth of 3.3\u00a0ft (1\u00a0m) in several areas, leaving 14 communities temporarily isolated in the Jos\u00e9 Azueta and Isla municipalities.[46] Nineteen municipalities reported damage, with 2,446\u00a0homes flooded and 9,800\u00a0people affected. A total of 397\u00a0homes were flooded in Tlacojalpan, and municipal authorities opened two shelters to house displaced residents. Both Acula and Tres Valles reported at least 100 damaged structures. Two bridges were damaged along the swollen La Palma stream in the Playa Vicente municipality. The Secretariat of National Defense distributed bilge pumps to several of the affected communities.[47] Officials in Oaxaca opened two shelters, housing 60\u00a0families, and members of the Mexican Army were deployed in the Tuxtepec District. Flooding occurred along the Blanco and Colorado rivers. At least 54 homes were damaged across the state, with the most affected areas being along the border with Veracruz.[48]"

This is partly due to the fact that there are relatively high numbers of strong/violent long tracked tornadoes and higher population density of this region, as well as the Southern United States having the highest percentage of manufactured homes in the US, where 63% of the overall tornado-related fatalities occur.[10] According to the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC), for the period January 1, 1950 \u2013 October 31, 2006, Alabama and Kansas received the largest amount of F5 tornadoes. Complicating matters is that tornadoes are rarely visible in this area, as they are more likely to be rain-wrapped, embedded in shafts of heavy rain, and that the hilly topography and heavily forested landscape makes them difficult to see.[10]"

        "header": "Prevalent tornado characteristics",
        "content": "Dixie Alley is part of a region of enhanced tornadic activity extending between the Appalachian and Rocky Mountains,[11] but tornadoes and outbreaks in the Dixie Alley region exhibit some statistically distinguishable characteristics from the more well known Tornado Alley.[12] Tornadic storms in Dixie Alley are most often high precipitation supercells due to an increase of moisture from proximity to the nearby Gulf of Mexico. The Dixie Alley tornadoes accompanying the HP supercells are often partially or fully wrapped in rain, impairing the visibility of the tornadoes to storm spotters and chasers, law enforcement, and the public.[10][13] Increases of warmth and instability in conjunction with strong wind shear in the Dixie Alley region impacts the times when tornadoes form. In the traditional Tornado Alley, tornadoes most often form from the mid afternoon to early evening. Dixie Alley's instability can be maintained long after sunset due to being adjacent to the Gulf, increasing the frequency of intense nighttime and early morning tornadoes.[10] There is also a less focused tornado season which tends to be most active in early spring and late autumn but can continue throughout the winter and into late spring, which can lead to complacency among residents of the region. The region often is subject to tornadoes much earlier than the general national peak from May and June, usually from February to Mid-April,[14] and several notorious outbreaks have struck during the late winter and early spring and also in late fall.[10] The complacency situation was noted after the 2008 Super Tuesday tornado outbreak in February 2008 that hit the Dixie Alley killing 57 people, many people indicated that they had underestimated the threat of severe weather on that day since it was well before the peak of tornado season.[10] A 2018 study found in the U.S. an overall eastward shift of tornado frequency and impacts \u2013 toward Dixie Alley.[15] The study found relatively-lower tornado frequency and impacts in parts of the traditional Tornado Alley, especially areas from north-central Texas toward the Houston, Texas area, and relatively-higher tornado frequency and impacts in parts of the Mid-South, especially eastern Arkansas, the greater Memphis, Tennessee area and northern Mississippi \u2013 all areas near the heart of Dixie Alley (see especially Figure 4).[16] Variations in climate patterns and teleconnections, such as the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO) can also have significant impacts on tornadic activity in the region from year to year. Climate change is also expected to affect tornado activity in the region.[17][18]"

The 1974 Super Outbreak also hit the area very hard, producing multiple F5 tornadoes in Alabama, and F4 tornadoes in North Georgia and the Appalachian southwest of North Carolina. More recently the region was hit by the 2008 Super Tuesday tornado outbreak followed by the tornado outbreak of April 14\u201316, 2011, the deadliest since the 2008 outbreak.[10] Two weeks after the April 14\u201316 event, Dixie Alley was the epicenter of the 2011 Super Outbreak, which was the largest tornado outbreak ever recorded, as well as the fourth-deadliest outbreak in United States history, with over 300 people dead.[19] The Easter 2020 Tornado Outbreak also happened in Dixie Alley. It spawned over 100 tornadoes and has a spot in the top most tornadoes in 24 hours in an outbreak."

The flooding had its beginnings in heavy rain in March 1900[1] over a very broad area extending from North West Cape to the southeastern corner of the state. It was in the middle of April over the Easter long weekend, however, that flooding began in earnest, and at the end of the month the majority of the normally arid parts of the state were completely inundated: by Easter Monday, all houses in Roebourne were completely surrounded by water from the Harding River.[2] During April and May, the rain was associated with what was described in the press of the time as \"a gentle easterly flow\"[3] but today is recognised to be a northwest cloudband. There were several of these cloudbands during the month, and the result was some astonishing rainfall totals, for instance Wiluna received 527.1 millimetres (20.8\u00a0in) and Cossack (near Port Hedland) as much as 636.4 millimetres (25.1\u00a0in). The heaviest rainfall of all occurred in the Pilbara during the middle of the month,[4] and resulted in rivers such as the Gascoyne, Ashburton and Murchison overflowing their banks for extraordinarily sustained periods. (Unfortunately, there were no gauges at the time so we do not know what the exact heights were). So heavy indeed was the rainfall that the normally arid \"North West\" (as the region was known at the time) was completely boggy and the primitive horse-drawn carts could not traverse the country not only in April, but well into May, especially as another major rainband affected the State early that month, with Onslow recording as much as 9.31 inches (236\u00a0mm) in a day on the third. The busy Easter mail services were most severely hit of all, with the mail vans from Perth bogged down at Peak Hill after crossing a Gascoyne River that was supposedly 3 miles (4.8\u00a0km) wide as the rain extended at the end of Easter to the Murchison River\u2019s basin.[5] Wash-outs on the telegraph line with which the remote regions affected by the floods communicated with Perth were indeed not repaired until well into June, a month after flooding peaked in the Pilbara and Gascoyne and had spread eastward to the goldfields of Western Australia. In the interim, communication about the flooding was delayed almost uniformly by at least three or four days, aided by a severe famine and shortage of food for pack horses and salt lakes in the Goldfields such as Lake Carnegie and Lake Maitland filled for probably the only time in centuries - they were never seen with any water between the first European settlement of Western Australia and these floods were thus unprecedented for an extremely long period of time."

The 1994 cyclone formed on April\u00a029 as a depression, which organized and intensified significantly over the subsequent few days. On May\u00a02, the cyclone attained winds of 215\u00a0km/h (135\u00a0mph), according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD). That day, the storm made landfall in southeastern Bangladesh, and rapidly weakened over land, before dissipating on May\u00a03. Ahead of the storm's landfall, about 450,000\u00a0people evacuated to storm shelters built since the 1991 storm. Upon moving ashore, the cyclone dropped 190\u00a0mm (7.5\u00a0in) of precipitation and produced winds of 278\u00a0km/h (173\u00a0mph) in Teknaf Upazila. Total storm damage was estimated at $125\u00a0million (1994\u00a0USD). The cyclone damaged or destroyed more than 78,000\u00a0houses, leaving about 500,000\u00a0people homeless. Along its path, the storm killed at least 350\u00a0people, including at least 126\u00a0fishermen from Thailand who were lost and presumed killed. In southeastern Bangladesh, the cyclone wrecked Rohingya refugee camps, killing 85\u00a0people.

That day, the American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) mentioned the weather system in its Significant Tropical Weather Outlook. The area of thunderstorms moved to the west-northwest through the Nicobar Islands, gradually organizing around a developing circulation. On April\u00a029, the IMD first classified the system as a depression, and the JTWC initiated advisories on the storm, designating it Tropical Cyclone 02B. By the end of the day, the IMD had upgraded the depression to a cyclonic storm. This was due to the convection organizing into a central dense overcast, with an eye feature in the storm's center.[1][2] Steered by a ridge to the northeast, the storm tracked north-northwestward at first, before turning northeastward while rounding the ridge. Late on April\u00a030, the JTWC upgraded the storm to the equivalent of hurricane status, with sustained winds estimated at 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph). A day later, the IMD upgraded the storm to a very severe cyclonic storm, by which time the eye had become better organized. The agency upgraded it to an extremely severe cyclonic storm on May\u00a02 as the storm neared the northeast coast of the Bay of Bengal. That day at 06:00\u00a0UTC, the JTWC estimated peak winds of 230\u00a0km/h (145\u00a0mph), but the agency assessed that the cyclone subsequently weakened. At 12:00\u00a0UTC on the same day, the IMD estimated peak winds of 215\u00a0km/h (135\u00a0mph). As the storm neared the Bangladesh coast, the storm was tracked by radar, with the eye diameter estimated at 30\u00a0km (19\u00a0mi). At around 17:00\u00a0UTC on May\u00a02, the cyclone made landfall in southeastern Bangladesh about 30\u00a0km (19\u00a0mi) north of Teknaf Upazila. The storm rapidly weakened over land while continuing northeastward into Myanmar. The JTWC and IMD discontinued advisories by May\u00a03.[1][2]"

Nearby Cox's Bazar reported winds of 139\u00a0km/h (86\u00a0mph). Along its path, the cyclone left U$125\u00a0million in damage, injured 3,559\u00a0people, and killed at least 350\u00a0people. The death toll included at least 126\u00a0fishermen from Thailand, 133\u00a0people in Bangladesh, and 17\u00a0fatalities in Myanmar. A fleet of 400\u00a0fishermen from Thailand encountered the storm, with 19 of 26\u00a0vessels sunk during the storm; 181 fishermen survived and were shipped by the Thai Navy about two weeks after the storm, with at least 200\u00a0fishermen listed as missing and presumed dead.[1][2][4][8][9][10][11] Throughout Bangladesh, the cyclone destroyed 52,097\u00a0houses and damaged another 17,476, especially those not made of brick. The resulting damage left about 500,000\u00a0people homeless. The storm also wrecked or damaged 194\u00a0schools and 28\u00a0churches. The storm damaged or destroyed 81,898 acres (33,143\u00a0ha) of crops, with 10,550\u00a0farm animals killed. About 169\u00a0km (105\u00a0mi) of roads were damaged, along with 98\u00a0bridges.[1][2][4][12] High waters from the cyclone inundated St. Martin's Island. The island, as well as Sandwip and other offshore islands, lost communications with the mainland.[13][14] 192\u00a0fishermen from Thailand lost their boats in the storm.[15][16] In the Teknaf region where the storm moved ashore, the storm damaged more than 95% of houses, knocked down 95% of the trees, and completely destroyed the local rice and betel crops. Debris and downed trees blocked roads connecting Teknaf with Cox's Bazar, while floods washed away the main coastal road between Cox's Bazar and Chittagong. About 25% of houses were damaged in Cox's Bazar, with about half of the local crops destroyed. High winds knocked down power lines across the region. Much of western Ukhia Upazila was damaged. About half of the crops were lost on Kutubdia island. On Maheshkhali island, the storm wrecked 25% of the boats and damaged more than one-third of the houses. The cyclone damaged or destroyed 80\u00a0Rohingya refugees camps, leaving about 100,000\u00a0refugees homeless; 85\u00a0refugees killed during the storm, many of whom killed by flying debris.[17][18][19][20] In neighboring Myanmar, the cyclone left heavy damage in the westernmost portions of the country, particularly Maungdaw and Buthidaung townships. The storm damaged or destroyed 8,872\u00a0houses, leaving more than 8,000\u00a0people homeless. In the country, the storm left at least K60\u00a0million (US$10\u00a0million) in damage.

It may be caused by heavy rain associated with a severe thunderstorm, hurricane, or tropical storm, or by meltwater from ice or snow flowing over ice sheets or snowfields. Flash floods may also occur after the collapse of a natural ice or debris dam, or a human structure such as a man-made dam, as occurred before the Johnstown Flood of 1889. Flash floods are distinguished from regular floods by having a timescale of fewer than six hours between rainfall and the onset of flooding.[1] Flash floods are a significant hazard, causing more fatalities in the U.S. in an average year than lightning, tornadoes, or hurricanes. Flash floods can also deposit large quantities of sediments on floodplains and can be destructive of vegetation cover not adapted to frequent flood conditions."

In areas on or near volcanoes, flash floods have also occurred after eruptions, when glaciers have been melted by the intense heat. Flash floods are known to occur in the highest mountain ranges of the United States and are also common in the arid plains of the Southwestern United States. Flash flooding can also be caused by extensive rainfall released by hurricanes and other tropical storms, as well as the sudden thawing effect of ice dams.[2][3] Human activities can also cause flash floods to occur. When dams fail, a large quantity of water can be released and destroy everything in its path.[3]"

        "header": "Hazards",
        "content": "The United States National Weather Service gives the advice \"Turn Around, Don't Drown\" for flash floods; that is, it recommends that people get out of the area of a flash flood, rather than trying to cross it. Many people tend to underestimate the dangers of flash floods. What makes flash floods most dangerous is their sudden nature and fast-moving water. A vehicle provides little to no protection against being swept away; it may make people overconfident and less likely to avoid the flash flood. More than half of the fatalities attributed to flash floods are people swept away in vehicles when trying to cross flooded intersections.[4] As little as 2 feet (0.61\u00a0m) of water is enough to carry away most SUV-sized vehicles.[5] The U.S. National Weather Service reported in 2005 that, using a national 30-year average, more people die yearly in floods, 127 on average, than by lightning (73), tornadoes (65), or hurricanes (16).[6] In deserts, flash floods can be particularly deadly for several reasons. First, storms in arid regions are infrequent, but they can deliver an enormous amount of water in a very short time. Second, these rains often fall on poorly absorbent and often clay-like soil, which greatly increases the amount of runoff that rivers and other water channels have to handle.[7] These regions tend not to have the infrastructure that wetter regions have to divert water from structures and roads, such as storm drains, culverts, and retention basins, either because of sparse population or poverty, or because residents believe the risk of flash floods is not high enough to justify the expense. In fact, in some areas, desert roads frequently cross a dry river and creek beds without bridges. From the driver's perspective, there may be clear weather, when a river unexpectedly forms ahead of or around the vehicle in a matter of seconds.[8] Finally, the lack of regular rain to clear water channels may cause flash floods in deserts to be headed by large amounts of debris, such as rocks, branches, and logs.[9] Deep slot canyons can be especially dangerous to hikers as they may be flooded by a storm that occurs on a mesa miles away. The flood sweeps through the canyon; the canyon makes it difficult to climb up and out of the way to avoid the flood. For example, a cloudburst in southern Utah on 14 September 2015 resulted in 20 flash flood fatalities, of which seven fatalities occurred at Zion National Park when hikers were trapped by floodwaters in a slot canyon.[10]"

        "header": "Flash flood impacts",
        "content": "Flash floods induce severe impacts in both the built and the natural environment. The effects of flash floods can be catastrophic and show extensive diversity, ranging from damages in buildings and infrastructure to impacts on vegetation, human lives and livestock. The effects are particularly difficult to characterize in urban areas.[11] Researchers have used datasets such as the Severe Hazards Analysis and Verification Experiment (SHAVE) and the U.S. National Weather Service (NWS) Storm Data datasets to connect the impact of flash floods with the physical processes involved in flash flooding. This should increase the reliability of flash flood impact forecasting models.[12] Analysis of flash floods in the United States between 2006 and 2012 shows that injuries and fatalities are most likely in small, rural catchments, that the shortest events are also the most dangerous, that the hazards are greatest after nightfall, and that a very high fraction of injuries and fatalities involve vehicles.[13] An impact severity scale is proposed in 2020 providing a coherent overview of the flash flood effects through the classification of impact types and severity and mapping their spatial extent in a continuous way across the floodplain. Depending on the affected elements, the flood effects are grouped into 4 categories: (i) impacts on built environment (ii) impacts on man-made mobile objects,(iii) impacts on the natural environment (including vegetation, agriculture, geomorphology, and pollution) and (iv) impacts on the human population (entrapments, injuries, fatalities). The scale was proposed as a tool on prevention planning, as the resulting maps offer insights on future impacts, highlighting the high severity areas.[11] Flash floods can cause rapid soil erosion.[14] Much of the Nile delta sedimentation may come from flash flooding in the desert areas that drain into the Nile River.[15] However, flash floods of short duration produce relatively little bedrock erosion or channel widening, having their greatest impact from sedimentation on the floodplain.[16] Some wetlands plants, such as certain varieties of rice, are adapted to endure flash flooding.[17] However, plants that thrive in drier areas can be harmed by flooding, as the plants can become stressed by the large amount of water.[18][19]"
