This prompted the train's operator, SMRT, to suspend all service from Ang Mo Kio to Marina South Pier. SMRT provided free bridging buses along the affected stretch of stations.[4] At 7:07\u00a0p.m., the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) received a call from SMRT about a flooding situation in the tunnels between the two affected stations. SMRT then officially reported the flooding on social media at 7.30\u00a0p.m. Train service between the Newton MRT station and Marina South Pier was restored, but service between Newton and Ang Mo Kio remained down. SMRT also mentioned that its engineers were working with SCDF personnel to pump water out of the affected stretch of tunnels.[5][6] At 1:50\u00a0p.m. the next day, SMRT said that the water had been cleared and that service would resume, and test trains were deployed to ensure passenger safety.

        "content": " The 1925 Atlantic hurricane season was the second least active Atlantic hurricane season on record in terms of accumulated cyclone energy. The season featured four tropical cyclones forming. Only one of them was a hurricane. The first storm developed on August\u00a018, and the last dissipated on December\u00a01. The season began at a late date, more than two months after the season began. The official start of the season is generally considered to be June\u00a01 with the end being October\u00a031;[1] however, the final storm of the season formed nearly a month after the official end.[2] Due to increased activity over the following decades, the official end of the hurricane season was shifted to November\u00a030.[1] The final two storms of the season impacted several areas, with the final storm affecting areas from Cuba to Rhode Island. The third storm caused little or no damage along the Texas coastline with gale-force winds being recorded only along the coast. The last storm caused severe damage along the beaches of the Florida Peninsula, with damages estimated in the millions along with four fatalities near Tampa. At least $600,000 was lost in damages dealt to the citrus industry and several maritime incidents resulted in over 55 fatalities.[2] The season's activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 7,[3] one of the lowest totals ever and far below the 1921\u20131930 average of 76.6.[3][4] ACE is a metric used to express the energy used by a tropical cyclone during its lifetime. Therefore, a storm with a longer duration will have high values of ACE. It is only calculated at six-hour increments in which specific tropical and subtropical systems are either at or above sustained wind speeds of 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h), which is the threshold for tropical storm intensity. Thus, tropical depressions are not included here.[3]"

Roughly 18\u00a0hours later, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm, the first of the season while located to the north-northeast of the Bahamas. Gradual intensification took place throughout most of the storm's life[6] as it traveled towards the northeast[7] until becoming a hurricane around 0600\u00a0UTC on August\u00a020.[6] About 30\u00a0minutes later, a ship recorded winds of 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h)[5] and a pressure of 993.6\u00a0mbar (hPa),[2] the lowest pressure recorded in relation to the small storm.[2][5] Shortly after, the storm reached its peak intensity with winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h).[6] Increasing in forward motion, the storm became extratropical early on August\u00a021 after turning towards the north.[6][7]"

In Jacksonville, Florida, the storm produced 0.47\u00a0in (12\u00a0mm) of rain on August\u00a025.

The system weakened and soon became extratropical. The extratropical cyclone emerged over the eastern Atlantic several hours later and regained hurricane-force winds. By 0000\u00a0UTC, the extratropical system peaked with winds of 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 980\u00a0mbar (29\u00a0inHg).[6] Around this time, the U. S. S. Patoka, which was in the vicinity of the storm, recorded a pressure of 978.5\u00a0mbar (28.90\u00a0inHg).[2] The northeastward movement slowed shortly after crossing Florida.[6] Around 2300\u00a0UTC, it made landfall between Wilmington and Cape Hatteras[2] with winds equivalent to a minimal hurricane. Shortly after landfall, maximum sustained winds in the storm dropped below 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h).[6] A strong area of high pressure located over the Canadian Maritimes caused the system to turn east-southeastward.[2] On December\u00a05, the storm weakened further to the equivalent of a tropical depression as the system began to move towards the south.[6] The remnants of the storm continued eastward, passing several hundred miles north of Bermuda later that day. The cyclone was reported near the Azores on December\u00a09, before finally merging with another cyclone over the North Atlantic.[2] The storm caused significant property and crop damage along the Gulf Coast of Florida. Trees, power lines, and telegraph wires were uprooted or knocked down by high winds along the Suwannee River. Structures which were previously considered to be safe from storms, being over 100\u00a0ft (30\u00a0m) inland, sustained significant damage from what was likely storm surge. The beaches along the Atlantic coast also sustained considerable damages from the storm.[2] Four people were killed near Tampa in two separate incidents. The first occurred when a house collapsed on three men, pinning them to the ground. The second incident occurred after a woman ran outside her home and was struck by a tree limb.[11] In North Carolina, heavy rains and strong winds were reported along the coast. Near record high water rises were recorded around Wilmington.[12] Cape Hatteras was temporarily isolated from the surrounding areas as the high winds from the storm knocked down power lines throughout the area. Several buildings along the coast and numerous boats sustained considerable damage.[13] Property loses were estimated in the millions, with $1\u00a0million in Jacksonville alone. Damages to the citrus industry were also significant, with total losses exceeding $600,000. In addition to the severe impacts on land, numerous shipping incidents resulted in several deaths. A schooner carrying seven people sunk with no survivors. A tug boat sank off the coast of Mobile, Alabama, while towing a lumber barge, the fate of the crew is unknown. A ship named the American SS Cotopaxi sank between Charleston, South Carolina and the northern coast of Cuba; all 30 crew members drowned. A ship carrying about 2,000 cases of liquor with a crew of six sank near Daytona Beach. Near Savannah, Georgia, a yacht sank, drowning 12 crew members. At least 55\u00a0deaths occurred at sea.[2]"

That kind of business give profit to many people earning millions of euros but destroying the native forests,[6] also there is a liking of pollution in the sea (Ence, Celulosa, Paper pulp mill in Pontevedra). The eucalyptus grow fast and takes a lot of water[7][8] The brush clearing, the lack of autochthonous Galician horses that eat the gorse and help to clean the forest, the disastrous forestry policy, the contracts in aircraft rentals, the lack of means and brigades for the extinction, or the increase of the plantation of eucalyptus that devastates the mountains and forests where there used to be native trees that protected it from fire. According to the media and experts,[9] fires in Galicia could be avoided if there were means and an effective plan to avoid them. Another major problem that has not been solved is the emerging plantation of eucalyptus, an invasive species from Australia that destroys the land and is a business that proliferates among many owners of forests, to supply the only pulp company in Pontevedra, being many years, the point of attention among ecologists and people living from the collection of shellfish in the estuary of Pontevedra. The Galician Government began a compensation initiative to encourage the substitution of eucalyptus for native vegetation or to achieve its elimination in those areas where, by nature, no type of plantation existed.[10] In Portugal and Galicia, ecologists, schools and environmental protection groups have taken the initiative[11] to uproot the eucalyptus and plant other species. This is the case of Ferraria de Sao Joao, a village in the municipality of Penela (Portugal), which was threatened by recent large forest fires that devastated thousands of hectares, a threat that Casal de Sao Simao also suffered, so both decided to act to protect its population by uprooting eucalyptus. In addition, environmentalists in the area denounce the lack of control over illegal plantations of this alien arboreal species.[12] In Galicia and Portugal, brigades of dissatisfied citizens have been created to remove the eucalyptus shoots.[13] United Nations (UN) recognizes the recovering of natural spaces in the mountains of Frox\u00e1n and Santiago de Covelo - in A Coru\u00f1a municipality of Lousame and Covelo (Pontevedra), respectively. They have become the first in Spain and third in Europe to enter the ICCA registry, under the United Nations Program United for the Environment. This international distinction recognizes those natural spaces that are managed, recovered or rehabilitated effectively by local or indigenous communities.[14] Eucalyptus is a support for the expansion of Velutina wasp, due to the high altitude of this species[15] and to be a perennial leaf that protects and camouflages throughout the year. This insect kills bees of honey that affects beekeepers and has already become a plague[16] and also kill people.[17]"

He died after a long reign and was succeeded by Ere, his eldest son. A battle for power soon erupted between the wife of the last Ogiso and prince Ekaladerhan, son of the last Ogiso. Prince Ekaladerhan was framed by his father's wife and sentenced to death. The men sent to kill him, however, released him at Ughoton. The exiled prince made his way to where he changed his name to Izoduwa, meaning \"I have found prosperity\". It was during this period of confusion in Benin that the elders, led by Chief Oliha, mounted a search for the banished Prince Ekaladerhan \u2013 whom the Ife people now called Oduduwa.[9] The exiled Ekaladerhan, now Oduduwa, refused to come to Benin because of how he was treated, having found out that he was not killed.[10] He devised to send one of his sons, Oramiyan. He refused to return from Ile-Ife but sent his son \u1eccranmiyan to become king in his place.[11] Prince \u1eccranmiyan took up residence in the palace built for him at Uzama by the elders, now a coronation shrine. Soon after he married a beautiful lady, \u1eb8rinmwide, daughter of Osa-nego, the ninth Enogie of Egor.[12] He and Erinmwide had a son. After some years he called a meeting of the people and renounced his office, remarking that the country was a land of vexation, Ile-Ibinu, and that only a child born, trained, and educated in the arts and mysteries of the land could reign over the people.[13] The country was afterward known by this name. He caused his son born to him by \u1eb8rinmwide to be made King in his place and returned to Benin land. After some years in Ife, he left for Benin, where he also left a son behind upon leaving, and his son Ajaka ultimately became the first Oba of Benin of the present line, while \u1eccranmiyan himself was reigning as \u1ecc\u1ecdni of If\u1eb9. Therefore, \u1eccranmiyan of Ife, the father of \u1eb8w\u1eb9ka I, the \u1eccba of Benin, was also the father of Ajaka, Alaafin of \u1eccy\u1ecd.[14] \u1ecc\u1ecdni of If\u1eb9. \u1eccba \u1eb8w\u1eb9ka later changed the name of the city of Ile-Binu, the capital of the Benin kingdom, to \"Ubinu.\" This name would be reinterpreted by the Portuguese as \"Benin\" in their own language. Around 1470, \u1eb8wuare changed the name of the state to \u1eb8do.[15] This was about the time the people of \u1ecckp\u1eb9kp\u1eb9 migrated from Benin City. Alternatively, the Yoruba nation has a different conception of Oduduwa.[16] According to Yoruba tradition, because of his power and military might, he was able to defeat the enemies invading Benin and that is why the people of Benin made him the King or \u1eccba of Benin. In any case, it is agreed upon by both the Yoruba and the Edo that Oduduwa sent his son Prince Oranmiyan of Ife to rule Benin City and founded the Oba dynasty in Benin City.[17][18] Benin imperialism was started in the last decade of the thirteen century by Oba Ewedo.[19]"

        "content": "The Portuguese visited Benin City around 1485. Benin grew rich during the 16th and 17th centuries due to trade within southern Nigeria, as well as through trade with Europeans, mostly in pepper and ivory. In the early 16th century, the \u1eccba sent an ambassador to Lisbon, and the King of Portugal sent Christian missionaries to Benin. Some residents of Benin could still speak a pidgin Portuguese in the late 19th century. Many Portuguese loan words can still be found today in the languages of the area. A Portuguese captain described the city in 1691:\"Great Benin, where the king resides, is larger than Lisbon; all the streets run straight and as far as the eye can see. The houses are large, especially that of the king, which is richly decorated and has fine columns. The city is wealthy and industrious. It is so well governed that theft is unknown and the people live in such security that they have no doors to their houses\".[20][21] On 17 February 1897, Benin City fell to the British.[7] In the \"Punitive Expedition\", a 1,200-strong British force, under the command of Admiral Sir Harry Rawson, captured, sacked, and burnt the city after all but two men from a previous British delegation led by Acting Consul General James Robert Phillips were ambushed and killed.[22][23] Alan Boisragon, one of the survivors of the Benin Massacre, included references of the practice of human sacrifice in the city in a firsthand account written in 1898 (one year after the Punitive Expedition).[24] Historian James D. Graham notes that although \"there is little doubt that human sacrifices were an integral part of the Benin state religion from very early days,\" first-hand accounts regarding such acts often varied significantly, with some reporting them and others making no mention of them.[25][26] The \"Benin Bronzes\", portrait figures, busts and groups created in iron, carved ivory, and especially in brass (conventionally called \"bronze\"), were looted from the Benin City palace by the expeditionary force.[7] Some of the bronzes were auctioned off to compensate for the expenses incurred during the capture and occupation of the city. Most of these artifacts can be found today in western museums at locations around the world. In recent years, appeals have gone to various museums and governments to return such artifacts. The most prominent of these artifacts was the famous Queen Idia mask used as a mascot during the Second Festival of Arts Culture (FESTAC '77) held in Nigeria in 1977 now known as \"Festac Mask\".[27] The capture of Benin paved the way for British colonization and the merging of later regional British incorporation of African kingdoms into the Niger Coast Protectorate, the Protectorate of Southern Nigeria and finally, into the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria. The British permitted the restoration of the Benin monarchy in 1914, but true political power still lay with the colonial administration of Nigeria.[28]"

It generally flows to the east and southeast as it traverses the U.S. states of Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas. The river's source basin lies in Colorado, specifically the Arkansas River Valley. The headwaters derive from the snowpack in the Sawatch and Mosquito mountain ranges. It flows east into Kansas and finally through Oklahoma and Arkansas, where it meets the Mississippi River. At 1,469 miles (2,364\u00a0km), it is the sixth-longest river in the United States,[7] the second-longest tributary in the Mississippi\u2013Missouri system, and the 45th longest river in the world. Its origin is in the Rocky Mountains in Lake County, Colorado, near Leadville. In 1859, placer gold discovered in the Leadville area brought thousands seeking to strike it rich, but the easily recovered placer gold was quickly exhausted.[8] The Arkansas River's mouth is at Napoleon, Arkansas, and its drainage basin covers nearly 170,000 square miles (440,000\u00a0km2).[5] Its volume is much smaller than the Missouri and Ohio rivers, with a mean discharge of about 40,000 cubic feet per second (1,100\u00a0m3/s). The Arkansas from its headwaters to the 100th meridian west formed part of the U.S.\u2013Mexico border from the Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty (in force 1821) until the Texas Annexation or Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo."

        "content": "The Arkansas has three distinct sections in its long path through central North America. At its headwaters beginning near Leadville, Colorado, the Arkansas runs as a steep fast-flowing mountain river through the Rockies in its narrow valley, dropping 4,600 feet (1,400\u00a0m) in 120 miles (190\u00a0km).[12] This section supports extensive whitewater rafting, including The Numbers (near Granite, Colorado), Brown's Canyon, and the Royal Gorge. At Ca\u00f1on City, Colorado, the Arkansas River valley widens and flattens markedly. Just west of Pueblo, Colorado, the river enters the Great Plains. Through the rest of Colorado, Kansas, and much of Oklahoma, it is a typical Great Plains riverway, with wide, shallow banks subject to seasonal flooding and periods of dwindling flow. Tributaries include the Cimarron and the Salt Fork Arkansas rivers. In eastern Oklahoma, the river begins to widen further into a more contained consistent channel. To maintain more reliable flow rates, a series of dams and large reservoir lakes have been built on the Arkansas and its intersecting tributaries, including the Canadian, Verdigris, Neosho (Grand), Illinois, and Poteau rivers.[13] These locks and dams enable the river to be navigable by barges and large river craft downriver of Muskogee, Oklahoma, where the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System joins the Verdigris River. Into western Arkansas, the river path works between the encroaching Boston and Ouachita mountains, including many isolated, flat-topped mesas, buttes, or monadnocks such as Mount Nebo, Petit Jean Mountain, and Mount Magazine, the highest point in the state. The river valley expands as it encounters much flatter land beginning just west of Little Rock, Arkansas. It continues eastward across the plains and forests of eastern Arkansas until it flows into the Mississippi River near Napoleon, Arkansas. Water flow in the Arkansas River (as measured in central Kansas) has dropped from approximately 248 cubic feet per second (7.0\u00a0m3/s) average from 1944\u20131963 to 53 cubic feet per second (1.5\u00a0m3/s) average from 1984\u20132003, largely because of the pumping of groundwater for irrigation in eastern Colorado and western Kansas. Important cities along the Arkansas River include Canon City, Pueblo, La Junta, and Lamar, Colorado; Garden City, Dodge City, Hutchinson, and Wichita, Kansas; Tulsa, Oklahoma; and Fort Smith and Little Rock, Arkansas. The May 2002 I-40 bridge disaster took place on I-40's crossing of Kerr Reservoir on the Arkansas River near Webbers Falls, Oklahoma."

Colorado. The problems over the possession and use of Arkansas River water by Colorado and Kansas led to the creation of an interstate compact or agreement between the two states.[14] While Congress approved the Arkansas River Compact in 1949,[14] the compact did not stop further disputes by the two states over water rights to the river. The Kansas\u2013Oklahoma Arkansas River Basin Compact was created in 1965 to promote mutual consideration and equity over water use in the basin shared by those states. The Kansas\u2013Oklahoma Arkansas River Commission was established, charged with administering the compact and reducing pollution. The compact was approved and implemented by both states in 1970 and has been in force since then.[13]"

Through Oklahoma and Arkansas, dams which artificially deepen and widen the river to sustain commercial barge traffic and recreational use give the river the appearance of a series of reservoirs.[15] The McClellan\u2013Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System diverts from the Arkansas River 2.5\u00a0mi (4.0\u00a0km) upstream of the Wilbur D. Mills Dam to avoid the long winding route which the lower Arkansas River follows. This circuitous portion of the Arkansas River between the Wilbur D. Mills Dam and the Mississippi River was historically bypassed by river vessels. Early steamboats instead followed a network of rivers\u2014known as the Arkansas Post Canal\u2014which flowed north of the lower Arkansas River and followed a shorter and more direct route to the Mississippi River. When the McClellan\u2013Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System was constructed between 1963 and 1970, the Arkansas Post Canal was significantly improved, while the lower Arkansas River continued to be bypassed by commercial vessels.[16]"

        "content": "Many nations of Native Americans lived near, or along, the 1,450-mile (2,334-km) stretch of the Arkansas River for thousands of years. The first Europeans to see the river were members of the Spanish Coronado expedition on June 29, 1541. Also in the 1540s, Hernando de Soto discovered the junction of the Arkansas with the Mississippi. The Spanish originally called the river Napeste.[13] \"The name \"Arkansas\" was first applied by French Father Jacques Marquette, who called the river Akansa in his journal of 1673. The Joliet-Marquette expedition travelled the Mississippi River from Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin toward the Gulf of Mexico, but turned back at the mouth of the Arkansas River. By that time, they had encountered Native Americans carrying European trinkets and feared confrontation with Spanish conquistadors. Jean-Baptiste B\u00e9nard de la Harpe, a French trader, explorer, and nobleman had led an expedition into what is now Oklahoma in 1718\u201319. His original objective was to establish a trading post near the present city of Texarkana, Arkansas, but he extended his trip overland as far north as the Arkansas River (which he designated as the Alcansas). The explorer wrote that he and nine other men, including three Caddo guides and 22 horses loaded with trade goods, had come to a native settlement overlooking the river, where there were about 6,000 natives, who gave the strangers a warm welcome. La Harpe's party was honored with the calumet ceremony and spent ten days at this location.[17] In 1988, evidence of a native village was discovered along the Arkansas River 13 miles (21\u00a0km) south of present-day Tulsa, Oklahoma. By then, the site was known as the Lasley Vore Site.[17][a] French traders and trappers who had opened up trade with Indian tribes in Canada and the areas around the Great Lakes began exploring the Mississippi and some of its northern tributaries. They soon learned that the birchbark canoes, which had served them so well on the northern waterways, were too light for use on southern rivers such as the Arkansas. They turned to making and using dugout canoes, which they called pirogues, made by hollowing out the trunks of cottonwood trees.[b] Cottonwoods are plentiful along the streams of the southwest and grow to large sizes. The wood is soft and easily worked with the crude tools carried by both the French and Indians. The pirogues were sturdier and could be more useful for navigating the sandbars and snags of the Southern waterways.[18] In 1819, the Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty set the Arkansas as part of the frontier between the United States and Spanish Mexico. This continued until the United States annexed Texas after the Mexican\u2013American War, in 1846. The treaty was made shortly after the \"Old Settler\" Cherokee were pushed out of Texas and moved near what became known as Webbers Falls on the Arkansas River. They planned to reunite with the Cherokee who had moved there on the Trail of Tears in 1839. That area, then part of Arkansas Territory, would become Indian Territory and later Oklahoma. This area had long been the traditional territory of the Osage. They resisted the new Native Americans moving in with armed conflict. The US encouraged a peace treaty made in 1828 but the territory issue was still unresolved by the time thousands of additional Cherokee refugees moved to the area during the Trail of Tears.[19][20] By the time Fort Smith was established in 1817, larger capacity watercraft became available to transport goods up and down the Arkansas. These included flatboats (bateaus) and keelboats. Along with the pirogues, they transported piles of deer, bear, otter, beaver, and buffalo skins up and down the river. Agricultural products such as corn, rice, dried peaches, beans, peanuts, snakeroot, sarsaparilla, and ginseng had grown in economic importance.[18] On March 31, 1820, the Comet became the first steamboat to successfully navigate part of the Arkansas River, reaching a place called Arkansas Post,[c] about 60 miles (97\u00a0km) above the confluence of the Arkansas and the Mississippi rivers.[21] In mid-April 1822, the Robert Thompson, towing a keelboat, was the first steamboat to navigate the Arkansas as far as Fort Smith. For five years, Fort Smith was known as the head of navigation for steamboats on the river. It lost the title to Fort Gibson in April 1832, when three steamboats, Velocipede, Scioto, and Catawba, all arrived at Fort Gibson later that month.[18][d] Later, the Santa Fe Trail followed the Arkansas through much of Kansas, picking it up near Great Bend and continuing through to La Junta, Colorado. Some users elected to take the challenging Cimarron Cutoff starting at Cimarron, Kansas.[22]"

Initially, the Union Army abandoned its forts in the Indian Territory, including Fort Gibson and Fort Smith, to maximize its strength for campaigns elsewhere. The Confederate Army sent troops from Texas to support its Native American allies. Union troops returned to the area later in the war, after defeating the Confederates at the Battle of Pea Ridge and the Battle of Fort Smith. They began recovering the position it had previously abandoned, most notably Fort Gibson and reopened the Arkansas River as a supply route. In September 1864, a body of Confederate irregulars led by General Stand Watie (Cherokee) successfully ambushed a Union supply ship bound for Fort Gibson. The vessel was destroyed, and a part of its cargo was looted by the Confederates."

An area of convection was first observed on October 17 in the Philippine Sea. After killing 17 while crossing the archipelago, the system developed into a tropical storm on October 23. Warren moved north and later north-northwest but late on October 24, the storm began to meander in the South China Sea. On October 26, Warren drifted west while attaining peak strength. Two days later, Warren turned back to the east-northeast and away from the Philippines. A weakened trend began on October 29 as the storm entertained cooler, drier air. Despite this, the storm's center of circulation remained well-defined until Warren moved ashore in Vietnam on November 1. Warren dissipated the next day. Offshore the Philippines, the vessel Venus sunk due to rough seas caused by the storm. As a result of the shipwreck, 29 people were killed. a total of 174 were rescued, including 96 people that were rescued via a fishing boat. Nearby, another cargo container ship, the Lorcon 8, sank but all 19 crewmen were rescued. Across the island chain, 73 people died, 25 due to landslides, while 18 others were injured. Greater than 10,000 people were directly affected by the typhoon. Moreover, 740 houses were destroyed, with an additional 891 damaged. Damage was estimated at $239,000 (1984 USD), with $59,000 from crops and $180,000 from infrastructure."

        "content": "The precursor of Tropical Storm Warren was first noted on October 17 as a poorly organized area of convection over 550\u00a0km (340\u00a0mi) northeast of Mindanao Island. Initially, synoptic data suggested that the storm's circulation was broad, ill-defined, and positioned over the monsoon trough. The disturbance began to encounter lower wind shear, prompting a small increase in organization. At 15:00 UTC on October 18, a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) was issued. The alert was cancelled less than 24 hours later, however, in response to a decrease in the storm's convection, as well as, strong wind shear and its close proximity to land. Over the next few days, the system moved over the Philippines, disrupting its surface circulation. Moving west-southwest, the disturbance entered the South China Sea on October 22. Despite initially remaining poorly organized, conditions aloft became much more conducive for development that evening, and aided by the monsoonal flow, the system developed a well-defined surface circulation.[1] At 00:00 UTC on October 23, both the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) and the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started tracking the system.[2][nb 1][4] The aforementioned circulation was at first exposed from the deep convection, but by 03:00 UTC on October 23, the storm had rapidly become better organized. Following a further increase in the system's organization, a second TCFA was issued at 11:30 UTC. Based on a Dvorak estimate of T2.5, the JTWC upgrade the system into a tropical depression at 18:00 UTC,[1] although post-season analysis from the agency suggests that the cyclone was a tropical storm by this time. Early on October 24, the JMA followed suit and upgraded Warren into a tropical storm.[5][nb 2] Also around this time, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) started tracking the storm and assigned it with the local name Reming.[7] Initially, Tropical Storm Warren drifted north[1] and then north-northwest.[8] Later on October 24, the center once again became partially exposed from the deep convection. Thereafter, Warren began to move erratically.[1] Early on October 25, the JMA classified Warren as a severe tropical storm.[2] After performing a small cyclonic loop, Warren, still embedded in the monsoon trough, began to drift westward, while a mid-latitude cyclone was located to the cyclone's north.[1] Later that day, Warren existed PAGASA's area of responsibility.[9] At 06:00 UTC on October 26, the JTWC designated Warren a typhoon while increasing the intensity of Warren to 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph), its maximum intensity. Meanwhile, the JMA estimates that Warren peaked in intensity, with winds of 115\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 980\u00a0mbar (29\u00a0inHg), an intensity it would remain at for several days.[5] Starting midday on October 26, Warren stalled out for the next 12 hours, only to drift east-northeast in response to the inflow to Typhoon Vanessa and a trough to its north. On October 28, after re-entering PASAGA's warning responsibility,[9] Warren slowed and made a cyclonic turn back to the east-northeast as the trough moved to the east of Warren and a subtropical ridge became center to the north of the cyclone.[1] By October 29, Warren began to expand in size in response to a monsoonal surge of moisture into the South China Sea. This also caused the storm to inherit cooler, drier air, which prompted weakening[1] while also recurving towards the northeast.[8] At 00:00 UTC on October 29, the JTWC downgraded Warren into a tropical storm,[4] though the JMA would not follow suit until 36 hours later.[2] On August 30, the storm exited PASAGA's warning zone.[9] Thunderstorm activity continued to decrease, and by October 31, the low-level center had become displaced to the convection and the upper-level center. At 06:00 UTC that day, the JTWC issued the final warning on the cyclone while it was still producing winds of 55\u00a0km/h (35\u00a0mph). Despite this, the storm's center remained well-defined for an additional 24 hours. The remnants of the storm later crossed the coast of Vietnam, with winds of 55 to 65\u00a0km/h (35 to 40\u00a0mph). Late on November 1, the circulation had become less defined and increasingly difficult to locate, and the JTWC estimated that Warren dissipated the next day.[1] During the afternoon of November 2, the JMA ceased tracking Warren.[2]"

All U.S. Navy and Air Force bases in the region were placed in \"Condition of Readiness I\" early that day. Although no major damage ultimately occurred on the naval bases, winds of 45\u00a0km/h (27\u00a0mph) and 222\u00a0mm (8.74\u00a0in) of rain were recorded at Clark Air Base.[1] In the province of Bataan, 30 houses were destroyed, which led to 200 people without a home.[11] A family of 13 died after their house was buried in a landslide in Aurora.[12] Elsewhere, twelve other people died due landslides.[13] Offshore Marinduque Island, strong waves generated by the storm sunk a 745\u00a0t (745,000\u00a0kg) vessel, Venus,[11] within three minutes.[14] Officially, the ship consisted of 83 passengers and 42 crewmen when it left Laoang for Samar Island, even though the captain claimed that there were as many as 240 aboard.[15] Later reports indicates that vessel had 200 passengers and 42 crewman on board.[16] A total of 174 were rescued,[13] including 96 people that were rescued via a fishing boat[11] and many others that was rescued by fishermen.[16] Twenty-nine people,[17] including two children, drowned due to the incident.[11] Nearby, a cargo container ship, the Lorcon 8, sank, but all 19 crewmen were rescued.[10] Nationwide, 73 people perished,[17] with 18 others hurt.

It was first classified as a tropical disturbance on February\u00a021 between Vanuatu and Fiji. The system tracked northwestward, gradually organizing and intensifying. After attaining tropical storm status on February\u00a023, Ivy strengthened more quickly as it turned southwestward toward Vanuatu. It attained peak winds of 165\u00a0km/h (103\u00a0mph) while moving over Vanuatu, making it an intense Category\u00a04 cyclone on the Australian Region Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale. By the time it passed through Vanuatu, Ivy had turned southeastward, and it gradually weakened while accelerating. After becoming extratropical on February\u00a028, it passed just east of New Zealand and eventually dissipated on March\u00a02. The third significant cyclone in 14\u00a0months to affect the region, Ivy produced heavy rainfall and high winds in Vanuatu. Due to advance warning, only two people were killed, and several people were injured. The high winds damaged about 11,000\u00a0houses, leaving many people homeless. The cyclone passed very close to the Vanuatu capital city of Port Vila, forcing the evacuation of about 2,000\u00a0people and shutting down the main port. Cyclone Ivy also affected the Solomon Islands and New Caledonia with rainfall, and later it produced high waves in New Zealand that killed two people. Because of its severe damage on Vanuatu, the name Ivy was retired following its usage."

        "content": "In the middle of February 2004, a monsoon trough formed in the southwest Pacific Ocean during the middle of a Madden\u2013Julian oscillation pulse. A low-pressure area developed along the trough,[1] and the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) designated it Tropical Disturbance 5F on February 21 about halfway between Vanuatu and Fiji.[2] Initially, the system was moving little and had a circulation that was detached from the primary area of convection.[1] On February 22 after the thunderstorms increased, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) initiated advisories on the disturbance with the designation Tropical Cyclone 13P.[2][3] Shortly thereafter, the FMS reported that the disturbance developed into a tropical depression, although the convection was transient and displaced from the circulation.[4] The system tracked west-northwestward, due to a ridge located to its south.[3] With low wind shear and good outflow, the system gradually organized,[1] with the circulation becoming situated underneath the convection.[4] At 0300\u00a0UTC on February 23, the FMS upgraded it to a tropical cyclone and gave it the name Ivy while the storm was about 510\u00a0km (320\u00a0mi) northeast of Port Vila, Vanuatu.[1][5] After being named, Ivy quickly intensified after its convection was drawn into the circulation.[1] Late on February 23, the JTWC upgraded Ivy to the equivalent of a Category\u00a01 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale,[3] and the FMS followed suit the following day by upgrading Ivy to a severe tropical cyclone as continued favourable conditions allowed for rapid deepening.[1] On February 24 the cyclone began a turn to the southwest as it moved around the ridge,[2] and the next day it turned to the south toward Vanuatu as an approaching shortwave trough passed to the south and created a weakness in the ridge. A nearby upper-level low temporarily cut off outflow, although once it moved further away the low enhanced ventilation.[3] Strengthening continued and, late on February 25, the FMS reported that Ivy attained peak 10\u2013minute sustained winds of 165\u00a0km/h (103\u00a0mph) over the Vanuatu archipelago; this made it a Category\u00a04 on the Australian Region Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale.[5] Around the same time, the JTWC estimated peak 1\u2013minute sustained winds of 195\u00a0km/h (121\u00a0mph),[5] after a 19\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi) eye developed.[3] After passing slowly through Vanuatu, Ivy began accelerating to the southeast and its eye passed very close to the capital city of Port Vila,[1] after moving over the island of Epi.[6] As the cyclone moved away from the island group, it underwent an eyewall replacement cycle. In addition, the combination of cooler water temperatures, greater wind shear, less outflow, and land interaction with Vanuatu caused gradual weakening.[3][4] Late on February 27, Ivy entered the area of warning responsibility of New Zealand's MetService.[1] The convection rapidly diminished and left the circulation exposed,[3] and Ivy transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on February 28.[1] It remained strong and maintained a well-defined circulation as it passed just east of East Cape, New Zealand.[1][2] Continuing southeastward, the extratropical remnants crossed the International Date Line on February 29, and Ivy dissipated about 1,800\u00a0km (1,120\u00a0mi) southeast of New Zealand on March 2.[5]"

In addition, the cyclone dropped heavy rainfall, reaching 254.4\u00a0mm (10.02\u00a0in) at Bauerfield International Airport in Port Vila.[2] The central area of deep convection moved across every island in the archipelago.[6] As the cyclone moved through Vanuatu, it cut off communications between the various islands,[6] and also knocked Radio Vanuatu offline. Overall there was widespread moderate damage, with small areas of heavier damage.[7] The cyclone affected more than 54,000\u00a0people \u2013 about 25% of the population \u2013 on various islands,[8] including Paama, Epi, Ambrym, eastern Malekula, northern Aoba, and northern Maewo. On Ambrym island, the winds wrecked the roofs of houses and downed trees and vegetables.[2] Overall, about 11,000\u00a0houses were damaged,[8] and a large proportion of the 24,000\u00a0people in Ivy's path became homeless due to the destruction of their houses,[2] with many buildings made of iron and bamboo wrecked. In addition, the winds downed trees and power lines.[9] Heavy damage occurred in the capital city of Port Vila, where flooding washed out small bridges.[10] Strong waves wrecked the main port there and also capsized two boats.[11]  High winds downed trees and blocked roads across the capital,[12] with 70% of the nation's roads affected.[13] Several people were injured due to flying debris,[12] and one person was severely injured due to the storm.[8] The high winds affected 80% of the nation's food crops,[13] including the loss of much of the mango and banana crops as well as the ruination of about 75% of the coconut and cocoa crops.[2] The latter loss was significant due to its status as a cash crop.[1] The cyclone damaged 90% of the water facilities across the archipelago. It also damaged about 60% of the health centers, as well as 112\u00a0schools,[13] some of which were completely destroyed.[8] Monetary damage was estimated at VT427.6\u00a0million (2004\u00a0VUV, $3.8\u00a0million 2004\u00a0USD).[13] Due to advance warning, there were only two deaths in Vanuatu,[8] including one when a landslide killed a woman on Malakula island.[7] In addition to affecting Vanuatu, Ivy produced heavy rainfall in Tikopia and Anuta, two small islands in the southeastern Solomon Islands.[6] Later, intense rainbands spread across the Loyalty Islands in New Caledonia.[10] Along the Bay of Plenty in New Zealand, the extratropical remnants of Ivy produced high waves that killed two people in Whakat\u0101ne.[14] The storm produced a 1 in 10 year storm surge as it passed the country that peaked at 1.04\u00a0m (3.4\u00a0ft) at Omaio. The surge, in combination with waves, reached about 5\u00a0m (16\u00a0ft) at Papamoa, based on the position of debris on the beach. Wind gusts reached 79.7\u00a0km/h (49.5\u00a0mph) at the Whakatane Airport, and the combination of winds and waves produced beach erosion along the coast.[15]"

The Red Cross distributed various relief supplies to the affected citizens, including candles, matches, water, and blankets.[17] By about two weeks after the storm, about 30,000\u00a0household relief packages were distributed.[8] The Vanuatu government allocated VT25\u00a0million (2004\u00a0VUV, $236,000 2004\u00a0USD) for the affected citizens.[18] Overall, the cyclone severely affected the daily lives of the Vanuatu citizens. On Tanna island, the cyclone's passage produced a malaria outbreak.[8] In the immediate aftermath, the New Zealand Red Cross provided $10,000 (2004\u00a0NZD) for essential relief supplies.[12] In addition, the New Zealand government provided $70,000 for assistance in the most affected areas, after the country's Air Force dispatched a plane over Vanuatu to determine the extent of damage.[16] The Government of Australia similarly sent a helicopter reconnaissance mission to determine damage, as well as two planes with $200,000 (2004\u00a0AUD) in relief supplies, including 2,400\u00a0tarps, 2,600\u00a0water containers, and 5,200\u00a0packets of water purification tablets.[19] The French government also sent a helicopter and assistance as per the 1992 FRANZ Agreement between New Zealand, Australia, and France.[20] Due to the severity of damage wrought by the cyclone, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Ivy following its usage and replaced it with Irene. Ivy was retired along with earlier Cyclone Heta; the two were the only named storms to form within the basin that season.[4][21]"

In the middle of 1997 forest fires burning in Indonesia began to affect neighbouring countries, spreading thick clouds of smoke and haze to Malaysia and Singapore. Then Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad searched desperately for a solution,[1] and based on a plan by the head of the Malaysian fire and rescue department sent a team of Malaysian firefighters across to Indonesia under code name Operation Haze. This is to mitigate the effect of the Haze to Malaysia economy. The value of the Haze damage to Malaysian GDP is estimated to be 0.30 per cent.[2] Seasonal rains in early December brought a brief respite but soon after the dry conditions and fires returned. By late 1997 and early 1998 Brunei, Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines and Sri Lanka[3] had also felt the haze from the smoke of the forest fires. By the time the 1997\u201398 forest fires were finally over some 8 million hectares of land had burned while countless millions of people suffered from air pollution."

Indonesian forests have historically been resistant to burning even during long dry seasons and despite the use of fire to clear land for swidden agriculture. The land use changes that led to the fires were a combination of industrial-scale logging, draining peatlands for conversion to oil palm and fast-growing tree plantations, and a massive government program to drain swamps and convert them to rice paddies.[4] A total of 240 people perished in the wildfires.[5] Due to the heavy smoke caused by the fires, an Airbus A300 operating as Garuda Indonesia Flight 152 crashed on approach to Medan's Polonia Airport. All 234 people on board died, making it the worst crash in Indonesian history.[6]"

Forest fires in Indonesia in 1997 were estimated to have released between 0.81 and 2.57 gigatonnes of carbon into the atmosphere, which is between 13 and 40% of the annual carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels.[8][9] As part of steps taken to avoid the recurring of the Haze, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) approved the need for an early warning system in the Regional Haze Action Plan (RHAP) in 1998 to prevent forest fires and the resulting haze through improved management policies and enforcements, example via Fire Danger Rating System (FDRS).[10]"

A total of 77 workers were underground when they broke into a large pool of Ordovician limestone water early in the morning.[1] By Monday evening, 45 were rescued and one was confirmed dead.[2][3] All rescue operations were stopped after 14 days, when medical teams believed that the 31 trapped coal miners had no chance of survival.[2] The rescue work was the largest coal mine mobilization in China's history with 40 professional rescue teams involved, comprising 20,384 people.[1] Infrared surveillance cameras and echo megaphones were used to try to detect life underground,[2] but were unsuccessful. Workers continued pumping water out of the mine and attempting to stop the flooding after the rescue efforts were called off. 3,850 cubic meters of water were being pumped out every hour since the rescue efforts began, with around 100,000 cubic meters of water remaining in the mine on March 24. Yi Lan, a spokesperson for the rescue headquarters, said that workers were hoping to seal the mine pit with 50 million cubic meters of cement, rubble and water glass by April 4.[1] The construction of the mine, which was still underway at the time of the incident, began in 2006 with the goal of producing 1.5 million tons of coal per year.

        "content": " Severe Tropical Cyclone Lam was the strongest storm to strike Australia's Northern Territory since Cyclone Monica in 2006. It formed from the monsoon trough on February\u00a012, 2015 in the Coral Sea. For much of its duration, the system moved westward due to a ridge to the south. The system crossed over the Cape York Peninsula and moved into the Gulf of Carpentaria, whereupon it gradually organized due to warm waters and favorable outflow. On February\u00a016, the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) classified it as a Category\u00a01 on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale and gave it the name Lam. The storm intensified further while drifting toward the Wessel Islands, developing an eye and strengthening to the equivalence of a minimal hurricane on February\u00a018. It strengthened to reach maximum sustained winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph) early on February\u00a019 before turning to the southwest, making it a Category\u00a04 cyclone. That day, it made landfall on Northern Territory between Milingimbi and Elcho Island at peak intensity, and it rapidly weakened over land. About six hours after Lam moved ashore, Cyclone Marcia struck Queensland as a Category\u00a05 cyclone, marking the first time on record that two storms of Category\u00a04 intensity struck Australia on the same day. In its formative stages, Lam produced heavy rainfall and flooding in Far North Queensland. Later, the cyclone's rainfall set daily precipitation records in Northern Territory. However, the winds caused the most damage, with gusts estimated as high as 230\u00a0km/h (145\u00a0mph). The highest gust was 170\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph) at Cape Wessel on Rimbija Island. Lam caused considerable destruction, particularly affecting local aboriginal communities. Total damage in the Northern Territory exceeded A$100\u00a0million (US$78.1\u00a0million)."

        "content": "On February\u00a012, the monsoon trough extended through the Coral Sea, developing a weak tropical low in the northern portion of the sea, according to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM).[2] The system had a persistent area of convection, or thunderstorms, around a consolidating circulation. Conditions were moderately favorable for further development, including the presence of some wind shear and favorable outflow to the south.[3] The system moved slowly westward into the Cape York Peninsula without much development,[4] entering the Gulf of Carpentaria on February\u00a015,[5] as it was steered by a ridge to the south. Thereafter, the convection consolidated and organized while the mid- and low-level circulations aligned. As a result, the BoM began classifying it as Tropical Low 13U at 06:00\u00a0UTC on February\u00a016 while the system was about 235\u00a0km (145\u00a0mi) northwest of Weipa, Queensland.[6] On the same day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert, noting the decreasing wind shear and warm water temperatures of over 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F).[7] Within six hours of its classification as Tropical Low 13U, the system developed a central dense overcast, which is an organized area of convection around the center.[8] At 18:00\u00a0UTC on February\u00a016, the BoM upgraded the low to a Category\u00a01 on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale, naming it Lam. At that time, the BoM anticipated the cyclone would intensify to peak 10 minute sustained winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph) within 72 hours,[9] which proved very accurate.[5] Also at 18:00\u00a0UTC on February\u00a016, the JTWC began classifying the system as Tropical Cyclone 12P.[10] Early on February\u00a017, an eye feature began forming within the convection.[11] That day, Lam moved quicker to the west-northwest and slowed its rate of strengthening as it approached the Wessel Islands.[5] Early on February\u00a018, the eye became better defined, moving over Cape Wessel. At 06:00\u00a0UTC that day, the BoM upgraded Lam to a Category\u00a03 Severe Tropical Cyclone with 10 minute winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph), equivalent to a minimal hurricane.[5][12] When Lam was passing near Cape Wessel, the lower and middle level circulations were slightly displaced, although the center was embedded within the deepest convection.[13] The eyewall became smaller and more defined over time as the outflow strengthened, indicating that the cyclone was undergoing rapid deepening late on February\u00a018. Around the same time, Lam turned to the southwest as the ridge to the south weakened.[14] At 12:00\u00a0UTC on February\u00a019, the BoM upgraded Lam to a Category\u00a04 cyclone, estimating peak 10 minute winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph); this was based on the well-defined eye and rainbands on satellite imagery.[15] At the same time, the JTWC estimated the same intensity, only in 1 minute winds.[16] At around 16:30\u00a0UTC (2:00\u00a0a.m. local time) on February\u00a019, Lam made landfall along Northern Territory between Milingimbi Island and Elcho Island at peak intensity.[17][18] The eye quickly deteriorated as the cyclone moved through the Top End.[18] The storm weakened rapidly over land, deteriorating into a tropical low about 12 hours after landfall.[5] The JTWC continued tracking Lam until February\u00a022, when the weak circulation was located in the northeastern portion of Western Australia.[16] About six hours after Lam moved ashore, Cyclone Marcia made landfall along Queensland, making it the first time on record that two storms of at least Category\u00a04 intensity struck Australia on the same day.[17] Lam was the first severe tropical cyclone to strike Northern Territory since Cyclone Monica in April 2006.[5] In addition, Lam's landfall on February\u00a019 marked the third latest date for Australia to receive its first landfall, and the latest since 1988.[19]"

        "content": "When the BoM first classified Lam as Tropical Low 13U, the agency also issued a cyclone watch for the Cape York Peninsula and Arnhem Land.[20] Before the storm struck, officials transported residents in Lam's path by air to the capital city Darwin.[21] All 426\u00a0people living in Warruwi were airlifted, and the storm caused many schools in the region to be closed; students from Warruwi continued classes after they evacuated to Darwin.[22] Residents anticipated Lam's intensity to be lower at landfall, which left some off guard.[23] The origins of Lam brought heavy rainfall and flooding to Far North Queensland.[19] Upon striking Northern Territory, Cyclone Lam produced estimated wind gusts of 230\u00a0km/h (145\u00a0mph), which knocked down many trees and power lines.[22] The highest observed wind gust was 170\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph) at Cape Wessel on Rimbija Island.[5] The winds were strong enough to cause two anemometers to fail, with peak recordings of 150\u00a0km/h (93\u00a0mph) on Elcho Island and 93\u00a0km/h (58\u00a0mph) on Milingimbi Island.[24] Offshore Northern Territory, Lam destroyed several houses along Elcho Island and left residents without water or electricity.[21] In the town of Galiwinku on the island, two-thirds of the houses were affected, with 130 having roof damage, ten seriously damaged, and six destroyed.[25] By a week after the storm, 250\u00a0residents were still displaced.[26] However, water and power were restored to Galinwinku by February\u00a025. Damage on Elcho Island estimated to be A$80\u00a0million (US$62.5\u00a0million).[27] Total damage in the Northern Territory exceeded A$100\u00a0million (US$78.1\u00a0million).[28] In Ramingining, the winds damaged a court house and police offices,[22] and killed one dog.[29] \"Thousands\" of people were homeless or displaced due to the storm, many residing in shelters.[30] Farther inland, Lam dropped heavy rainfall that caused flooding, peaking at 258.5\u00a0mm (10.18\u00a0in) at Diljin Hill along the Waterhouse River.[5] The rains set daily precipitation records at three Northern Territory locations.[31] A girl required medical treatment after stepping on a downed power line.[32] There were no deaths or other serious injuries due to the storm, and damage was less than expected despite the intensity; this was possibly due to the storm moving ashore at low tide.[22] Following the storm, the Northern Territory government declared a state of emergency for the hardest hit areas. It provided financial assistance to families affected by the storm, totaling $1,245 (AUD) for each family.[32] The government sent a Royal Australian Air Force plane with emergency supplies to Darwin after a request from the Northern Territory.[33] Officials sent crews to Elcho Island to help clear debris and restore power. Residents in Ramingining were under a boil-water advisory following the storm.[21] A crew of 15\u00a0volunteers flew from Alice Springs and Maningrida to help emergency workers. An online crowdfunding group raised over $12,000 (AUD) within one day to provide emergency supplies.[34] Emergency officials also advised residents not to drive around disaster areas for \"sightseeing\" due to the potential to disrupt repairs.[22] A water and power worker estimated the power lines would be restored within one week, although that was dependent on internal building damage or tree removal.[30] Following the storm, many residents returned to their damaged homes and lived instead in tents.[35] The Northern Territory government established a tent city on the offshore Elcho Island,[36] which was dismantled on March\u00a020 due to the threat of approaching Cyclone Nathan.[37]"

Although only 170 were killed as a direct result of the floods, 600,000 people were evacuated from their homes and in the end the damage caused around $3 billion.[1] Affecting an estimate of 85,000 people solely in Paraguay, the flood waters had risen from an average of 2.6 meters to above 9 meters.[2] This resulted in several national along with international voluntary agencies donating over $70,000. [2] The floods caused a great deal of damage to housing, prompting a structural redesign in building in Paraguay in the aftermath. Houses were constructed and designed to provide safe shelter, even if the floods submerged single story houses.[3]"

At around 3 p.m. (MST), many of the people, including children, were swimming in the waters of the canyon when all of a sudden they hear a loud prolonged sound. When the people looked upstream, they saw a large wall of black muddy water rushing towards them. The water was carrying rocks and large logs the size of cars. The flood waters were approximately 6-foot tall and 40-feet wide. The flood swept away many of the swimmers while many other people were holding onto trees waiting to be rescued.

Thirteen of the state's municipalities had declared state of emergency.[5] On 23 April, it was reported that the disaster had already killed three people, including a one-month-old child from Salvador, the capital of Bahia, who was suffocated by a mudslide.[7] Over 33,000 people had been made homeless at that stage; 30,000 of these were in Maranh\u00e3o and 3,400 were in the adjacent state of Bahia.[7] At least 3,000 people lost their homes in Santa Catarina, whilst one died.[5] The governor of Amazonas, Eduardo Braga, initiated a state of emergency in every one of his state's sixty-two municipalities.[5] Fourteen people were reported dead within one month and at least 62,600 others were left homeless by 2 May 2009.[4] Nineteen people were dead by 5 May 2009, as a sharp rise in homelessness occurred.[3] Homeless totals have been estimated at 186,000 individuals.[3] Images of citizens travelling around in boats and barely visible rooftops were broadcast on television.[3] Emergency shelters were said to be \"packed\" with homeless people.[3] At least six major highways were closed in Maranh\u00e3o.[3] A railway used to transport iron ore and 1,300 people each day was also shut down.[1] The governor of the state of Piau\u00ed declared state of emergency in nineteen of the state's towns and cities, and requested help from the military in rescuing people from the floods.[6] By this time, over 186,000 people were homeless. The death toll by 6 May was reported at twenty-nine.[8] The death toll by 8 May was thirty-nine and 270,000 people were reported homeless.[2] By 10 May, it was being reported that over 300,000 people were homeless and 44 had been killed.[9]"

        "content": "Hurricane Omar was a powerful tropical cyclone that took an unusual southwest to northeast track through the eastern Caribbean Sea during mid-October 2008. Forming out of a tropical disturbance on October\u00a013, Omar initially moved slowly in the eastern Caribbean Sea. By October\u00a015, Omar began to quickly intensify as deep convection developed around the center of circulation. Later that day, an eye developed and the storm began to accelerate to the northeast. Early on October\u00a016, Omar reached its peak intensity with maximum winds of 130\u00a0mph (210\u00a0km/h) and a barometric pressure of 958\u00a0mbar (958\u00a0hPa; 28.3\u00a0inHg). Shortly after, the hurricane rapidly weakened to Category 1 intensity. After slightly re-strengthening the next day, Omar weakened to a tropical storm before degenerating into a non-convective low pressure area. The remnants of Omar persisted until October\u00a021, at which time they dissipated to the west of the Azores. Throughout the eastern Caribbean, Omar affected numerous islands, most of which only recorded minor impacts. Large swells and heavy rains impacted the ABC islands. Antigua and Barbuda sustained $54\u00a0million in damages, mainly on Antigua as nine homes were destroyed, several others damaged and many farms were inundated by flood waters. One person died in Puerto Rico after suffering a stress-induced cardiac arrest. The United States Virgin Islands also sustained significant damage, costing roughly $6\u00a0million. Numerous boats and homes were damaged and over 100 power poles were snapped. Total losses from the storm were estimated at $79\u00a0million."

        "content": "On September\u00a030, a well-developed tropical wave moved off the eastern coast of Africa and entered the Atlantic Ocean. Deep convection formed around a prominent mid-level circulation as it moved towards the west. However, the convection diminished on October\u00a02 before entering the Caribbean Sea a week later. Upon entering the Caribbean Sea, shower and thunderstorm activity redeveloped around the low. Continued development followed and the low was designated as Tropical Depression Fifteen at 0600\u00a0UTC on October\u00a013 while located about 190 miles (310 kilometres) south of the southeastern tip of the Dominican Republic.[1] The previous steady westward motion that the system took across the Atlantic halted as it entered an area of weak steering currents and significant motion was not expected for another day or two.[2] As the structure of the storm improved, it was upgraded to a tropical storm and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) gave it the name Omar.[1] Located to the southeast of a broad and deep tropospheric trough and to the west of a low to mid-level ridge, Omar took a counter-clockwise turn on October\u00a014. Upon becoming a tropical storm, Omar began to undergo an extended period of rapid intensification as very deep convection developed around the center of circulation.[1] Wind shear around the storm, which was previously inhibiting quick development, weakened, allowing for further strengthening.[3] Later that day, an 11.5 to 17.2\u00a0mi (18.5 to 27.7\u00a0km) wide eye formed[4] as the storm began to turn towards the northeast due to the trough.[1] With the formation of an eye, the Dvorak technique rendered an intensity of 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h), signifying that Omar had intensified into a hurricane.[5] The intensification briefly stalled as the eyewall eroded and the center of the storm became slightly elliptical. However, deep convection persisted and strengthening was forecast as the storm neared Puerto Rico.[6] Shortly after, the eye quickly became well-defined and appeared on visible satellite images, an indication the storm was intensifying. The chances of rapid intensification were good as the storm featured well-developed outflow and prominent banding features.[1][7] With very warm sea surface temperatures, high ocean heat content, low wind shear, and a moist air mass, Omar quickly reached its peak intensity early on October\u00a016 as a Category 4 hurricane with winds of 130\u00a0mph (210\u00a0km/h).[1] During the intensification phase, the forward motion of the hurricane increased to 20\u00a0mph (32\u00a0km/h).[8] Once in the Atlantic Ocean, Omar began to rapidly weaken, with winds decreasing by 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) in 12 hours. Visible satellite images depicted an exposed low-level circulation with convection displaced to the east due to a combination of very high wind shear and dry air. By October\u00a017, most of the deep convection associated with the system dissipated; however, a brief decrease in wind shear allowed Omar to re-strengthen to its secondary peak, with winds of 85\u00a0mph (137\u00a0km/h). During this phase, convection redeveloped around the center and an eye reformed. Later that day, the trough that caused the rapid northeastern motion bypassed Omar, leading to decreasing movement.[1] A weakening storm, Omar continued towards the northeast due to a mid to upper-level ridge located south of the system and the mid-latitude westerlies to the north. Late on October\u00a017, wind shear increased once more as Omar tracked over waters below 26\u00a0\u00b0C (79\u00a0\u00b0F). Around 0000\u00a0UTC on October\u00a018, Omar weakened to a tropical storm as deep convection associated with it dissipated. Twelve hours later, while still producing tropical storm-force winds, the storm degenerated into a remnant low-pressure area. The remnants of Omar persisted until 0600\u00a0UTC on October\u00a021, when they dissipated about 805\u00a0mi (1,296\u00a0km) west of the Azores.[1]"

        "content": "On October\u00a015, the governor of the United States Virgin Islands announced the final preparations for Hurricane Omar as he signed a State of Emergency declaration for the territory. Public schools would be closed on October\u00a016. All non-essential workers would be dismissed at 10 a.m. local time. At 6 p.m. curfew was put in place for the same day. Only those with valid passes would be allowed to be out after the curfew was put in place. That same day, a Hurricane Warning and flash flood watch were put in place in anticipation of hurricane-force winds and torrential rains from Omar. The American Red Cross planned to open shelters throughout the islands before the hurricane struck. Sandbags were also being distributed in St. Croix.[9] A large oil refinery, which produces 500,000 barrels per day (79,000\u00a0m3/d), was shut down and only necessary workers remained at the refinery.[10] On Sint Maarten, officials advised residents to start all necessary actions to prepare for a hurricane. Residents were told to clear their yards of any debris or lose furniture that could become airborne during the storm, place shutters over windows and doors and assist elderly neighbors with shuttering their homes, and mariners should find a safe haven. A curfew from 10:00\u00a0p.m. on October\u00a015 to 10:00\u00a0a.m. on October\u00a016 was put in place. Due to the possibility of flash flooding, residents were to unclog and free up all waterways around their homes. Officials also warned people to stay away from areas prone to landslides until the \"all-clear\" was given. Owners of livestock were advised to have insured that they were secured in holding areas. As a precaution, the water supply would be shut down from 8:00\u00a0p.m. October\u00a015 to 8:00\u00a0a.m. October\u00a016. Four public areas, St. Peters Community Center, Dutch Quarter Community Center, Genevieve de Weever School, and the Salvation Army building would be used as emergency shelters.[11] All public activities, flights, and schools were either closed or canceled on Puerto Rico. Eighteen shelters were open on the eastern part of the island.[10] Also, on Anguilla, residents in the Sandy Ground, Valley Bottom, Welches and Mount Fortune areas were placed under evacuation orders. Shelters were opened throughout the island for those in need of shelter. Schools and government offices were also closed and visitors were told to leave the island.[12]"

        "content": "Omar produced moderate damage throughout numerous islands, amounting to at least $80\u00a0million (2008\u00a0USD) and one death was related to the storm. While it was moving little over the south-central Caribbean, Omar brought prolonged tropical storm conditions to the ABC Islands. Sustained winds to near gale force battered the islands, although peak gusts to 58\u00a0mph (93\u00a0km/h) were confined to Bonaire. In 24 hours, a maximum precipitation total of 4\u00a0in (100\u00a0mm) was recorded on Aruba, while 1.7 and 1.5\u00a0in (43 and 38\u00a0mm) of rain fell in Cura\u00e7ao and Bonaire, respectively. The high winds damaged roofs on all three islands, and rough seas caused beach erosion and significant damage to coastal facilities. Some rain damage also occurred, with significant flooding reported in some parts of Aruba.[13] In the SSS Islands (Saba, St. Eustatius, and Sint Maarten) strong winds from Omar, gusting up to 76\u00a0mph (122\u00a0km/h), and high waves caused significant damage and coastal flooding. On Sint Maarten, rainfall from the storm totaled to 5.4\u00a0in (140\u00a0mm).[14] Damage in Sint Maarten was mainly limited to beach erosion and scattered power outages.[15] The island of Dominica suffered severe damage from Hurricane Omar. The village of Scotts Head, with a population of 450, was cut off from the rest of the country as roads were extensively damaged. The village also suffered water losses, electricity shortage, and landline telephones were cut off. Ports throughout the country were severely damaged. All barge access for hauling sand and stones were destroyed. The airport also sustained some damage. Seven boats ran aground during the storm.[16] Minor damage was reported in Anguilla. Two hotels sustained roof damage, downed treed knocked down power lines causing scattered power outages, and the rough seas caused severe beach erosion. Three cargo ships and seven boats ran aground and two other boats sank.[17] In Antigua and Barbuda, winds from Omar were recorded at 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h), with gusts to 48\u00a0mph (77\u00a0km/h). Intense squall lines brought torrential rains, falling at rates of 2\u00a0in (51\u00a0mm) at times, peaking at 2.22\u00a0in (56\u00a0mm) per hour from 0900\u00a0UTC to 1200\u00a0UTC on October\u00a016. The maximum recorded rainfall was 9.1\u00a0in (230\u00a0mm) however, up to 11\u00a0in (280\u00a0mm) was estimated to have fallen in the mountains. Storm Surge was estimated at 2\u20134\u00a0ft (0.61\u20131.22\u00a0m) with waves reaching 5\u20138\u00a0ft (1.5\u20132.4\u00a0m) in height. Nine homes were destroyed and several landslides were reported. No fatalities were associated with Omar, and only a few sustained minor injuries. The most severe damage was dealt to roads and agriculture due to flooding.[18] Seventy-five people were forced to evacuate to shelters as their homes were flooded.[19]  Several farms were washed away, including their livestock. Numerous farmers lost their harvest due to flooding.[20] Damages in Barbuda were estimated at $18\u00a0million.[18] Agricultural losses in Antigua amounted to around $11\u00a0million (2008 USD)[21] and property damage amounted to $25 million.[22] In Puerto Rico, a man died after he collapsed from cardiac arrest while trying to install storm shutters on his home.[23] As a tropical wave, the precedent to Omar produced heavy rains over the island, causing minor flooding.[24] After passing by Puerto Rico a second time, Omar produced locally heavy rains, which caused minor street flooding.[25] On St. Croix, waves up to 15\u00a0ft (4.6\u00a0m) from Omar sank about 47 boats,[26] leading to a large oil spill around the islands. About 400 ships broke lose from the docks, 200 of which lost their anchors.[27] Omar produced upwards of 7\u00a0in (180\u00a0mm) of rain on the island within a 24\u2011hour span. Although St. Croix was brushed by the eyewall, sustained winds reached 53\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h) with gusts to 72\u00a0mph (116\u00a0km/h).[26] Three people needed to be rescued when their ship struck a reef and began to sink. Most of the islands 55,000 residents were without power as over 100 utility poles were destroyed. Damages on the island were estimated at $700,000 with another $1\u00a0million in clean-up costs.[27] St. Thomas, one of the hardest hit islands, was left completely without power in the wake of the hurricane. All of the major intersections were shut down as traffic lights were either on the ground or without power. Damages on the island totaled to $5.3\u00a0million.[28] In the Gros Islet Quarter on St. Lucia, rough seas damaged a jetty and grounded a yacht. In Soufri\u00e8re, four homes were destroyed by the storm surge, which also made some areas impassible. The storm surge also flooded parts of the Anse la Raye Quarter, leading to officials declaring a mandatory evacuation of the area.[29] On Montserrat, very little damage was reported. A few minor landslides occurred in rural areas; no impact was caused by them.[17] On Nevis there was relatively little damage although the beachfront part of the Four Seasons Resort was severely damaged and was subsequently closed for an extended period.[30] Throughout St. Kitts and Nevis, damage was estimated at $19\u00a0million.[31]"

        "content": "The damage dealt to the agricultural sector of Antigua and Barbuda fueled major concerns for \"food security\" in 2009. The government allocated about $33,897,420 to help develop and repair the industry. Significant expansions of croplands were discussed, 15,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (1,400\u00a0m2) area, to help promote growth of the sector.[32] On October\u00a029, in the wake of Omar, President George W. Bush signed a major disaster declaration for the United States Virgin Islands, allowing public aid to assist the islands. The Federal Emergency Management Agency or FEMA, had received 60 requests for public assistance throughout the area. Monetary value for the assistance was estimated at $3\u00a0million and growing. Twenty-five departments and agencies were approved of for federal support, namely the U.S. V.I. Department of Public Works. Several non-profit organizations also received support from FEMA, while those that did not meet the criteria were referred to the Small Business Administration's low-interest loan program.[33] On Dominica, Omar's close pass to the island left 30 families homeless and severely hampered the fishing community. On December\u00a015, the Board of Directors of the Caribbean Development Bank approved $9.16\u00a0million for assistance to those affected by Omar on the island and to restore the infrastructure damaged by the hurricane.[34] On December\u00a018, the government of Dominica invested $4\u00a0million in aid for the fishing communities impacted by Omar. A total of 140 fishermen were provided with $250 per week for a total of four weeks. Sixty-two of which continued to receive funds due to their circumstances. The government also purchased 121 boat engines to distribute to fishers. Another $794,000 was spent to repair 47 boats and construct another 28 that had been damaged or destroyed by Omar. The government also bought replacement fishing gear.[35]"

        "content": " Severe Tropical Cyclone Val (also known as Hurricane Val) was considered to be the worst tropical cyclone to affect the Samoan Islands since the 1889 Apia cyclone. The system was first identified during the opening days of December 1991, as a small circulation, within the Intertropical Convergence Zone to the north of Tokelau. Over the next few days, the system moved westwards towards Rotuma and Tuvalu and gradually developed further, before it was named Val on December 5, after it had become a category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. The system subsequently continued to intensify as it moved towards the Samoan Islands and peaked as a category 4 severe tropical cyclone, as it made landfall on the island of Savaii on December 6. After Val had passed over the island, weakening upper-level winds caused the system to slow down before it made a sharp clockwise loop which almost brought it over Savaii for a second time. On December 9, Val completed its loop and started to move eastwards and gradually weakened before it passed over American Samoa early the next day. After passing over American Samoa, Val appeared to threaten the Southern Cook Islands and was expected to pass close to Palmerston Island. However, as the system continued to weaken, it started to move more towards the south-southeast than had been expected, which spared the Cook Islands. During December 13, Val became a strong extratropical depression, before the system was captured and sheared apart by strong environmental westerlies associated with the Antarctic Circumpolar Current as it approached 50\u00b0S during December 16. The cyclone lasted for five days in American Samoa and was designated by the United States Government as a major disaster on December 13, 1991. Western Samoa suffered more damage than American Samoa.[1][2] The cyclone devastated the islands with 150-mile-per-hour (240\u00a0km/h) winds and 50-foot (15\u00a0m) waves. The overall damages caused by Cyclone Val in American Samoa have been variously assessed. One estimate put the damages at $50\u00a0million in American Samoa and $200\u00a0million in Western Samoa due to damage to electrical, water, and telephone connections and destruction of various government buildings, schools, and houses.[3]"

The firm would only pay up to $6.1\u00a0million for the damages, arguing that the insurance did not cover water damage, only that caused by the wind.[3] Attorney William Shernoff investigated and discovered that the insurance company had altered American Samoa's insurance policy to exclude damages caused by \"wind-driven water\", despite the fact that it still covered cyclones.[3] The case was taken to court, and in 1995, the jury awarded the American Samoa Government $28.9\u00a0million. Soon after, the amount was doubled to $57.8\u00a0million to include punitive damages. The total damages awarded by the judgment was $86.7\u00a0million, which the judge stated to be \"the largest insurance bad faith verdict in the state of California in 1995\".[3] The revenues of American Samoa for the fiscal years 2002 and 2003, which had been showing a downward trend, registered a substantial increase attributed to the insurance settlement of claims made to cover the damages caused by Cyclone Val. This resulted in fiscal surpluses. The deficit of US$23.1\u00a0million at the start of 2001 changed to a surplus of US$43.2\u00a0million by end of 2003.[26]"

The Yuan dynasty was waning, and the emperor conscripted enormous teams to build new embankments for the river. The harsh working conditions helped fuel rebellions that led to the founding of the Ming dynasty.[1] The Yellow River had shifted south of the Shandong Peninsula during the 1194 flood near the end of the Jin but this flood shifted it from the course of one previous river to another's. The river remained on various courses south of Shandong for the next five hundred years until floods in the 1850s returned it to its more northerly course."

The second tropical storm of the 2002 Atlantic hurricane season, Bertha developed in the northern Gulf of Mexico out of a trough of low pressure that extended into the Atlantic on August 4. It quickly organized and reached tropical storm strength before making landfall on southeastern Louisiana. Bertha turned to the southwest over the state, and re-entered the Gulf of Mexico on August 7. It remained disorganized due to proximity to land, and after making landfall on south Texas, Bertha dissipated on August 9. Bertha was one of only three tropical cyclones to make landfall on both Louisiana and Texas; the others being Allison in 2001 and Fern in 1971.[1] Heavy surf killed one person in Florida. The storm dropped moderate amounts of rainfall along its path, peaking at over 10 inches (250\u00a0mm) in eastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi.

On August 3, the western portion developed into a low pressure area. The eastern portion slowly organized and ultimately developed into Tropical Storm Cristobal. The low pressure area in the Gulf of Mexico steadily organized,[2] and late on August 4 the circulation was organized enough for the National Hurricane Center to classify it as Tropical Depression Two while located 40 miles (64\u00a0km) east of Port Eads, Louisiana. Northeasterly wind shear initially prevented organization of the cloud pattern,[3] though the depression was able to strengthen to become Tropical Storm Bertha about five hours after it formed.[2] Outflow became much better organized as Bertha became a tropical storm, and well-defined banding features persisted to the north of the storm. Though convection waned, forecasters predicted the friction between land and the warm atmosphere to redevelop more deep convection, potentially resulting in further strengthening.[4] However, the storm failed to intensify, and Bertha made landfall near Boothville, Louisiana as a minimal tropical storm early on August 5. It slowly weakened over the swampy portions of southeastern Louisiana, and degenerated to a tropical depression later on the 5th after crossing Lake Pontchartrain.[2] Initially it was expected that a ridge of high pressure to its north would keep Bertha moving to the west and result in it slowly dissipating.[5] However, it turned to the southwest, and reached the Gulf of Mexico again on August 7.[2] The circulation persisted over land, and Tropical Depression Bertha quickly redeveloped convection. Though the environment was not unfavorable, its proximity to land prevented re-strengthening to tropical storm status.[6] Though the system showed periods of increased organization as it moved southwestward, Bertha remained a weak tropical depression until making landfall on south Texas to the east of Kingsville on August 9.

Another family rescued the two children.[9] The large circulation of Bertha produced light rainfall across Florida,[10] with Pensacola and Destin reporting 2.75\u00a0inches.[11] Extreme southern portions of Alabama received over 3 inches (76\u00a0mm) of rain from the storm, while western Dauphin Island reported over 5 inches (130\u00a0mm).[10] Upon making landfall, Waveland, Mississippi recorded a peak storm surge of 4.12 feet (1.26\u00a0m). Sustained winds there peaked at 31\u00a0mph (50\u00a0km/h), and a peak gust of 41\u00a0mph (66\u00a0km/h). Tropical Storm Bertha produced moderate to heavy precipitation across southern Mississippi, including a total of 10.25 inches (260\u00a0mm) in Pascagoula.[2] In Moss Point, the rainfall resulted in flooding which entered 15 to 20\u00a0houses and several cars. The rainfall also flooded roadways and streets. Damage in Mississippi totaled to at least $50,000 (2002\u00a0USD, $60,000 2008\u00a0USD).[12] The storm dropped heavy rainfall in Louisiana, which peaked at 10.25 inches (260\u00a0mm) in Norwood.

Supposedly as a result of this flood, the Cimbri migrated south and, together with the Ambrones and Teutons, came into conflict with the Romans, precipitating the Cimbrian War (113 to 101 BCE). The contemporary Greek geographer Strabo, though sceptical, describes the flood and its consequences thus: As for the Cimbri, some things that are told about them are incorrect and others are extremely improbable. For instance, one could not accept such a reason for their having become a wandering and piratical folk as this that while they were dwelling on a peninsula they were driven out of their habitations by a great flood-tide; for in fact they still hold the country which they held in earlier times; and they sent as a present to Augustus the most sacred kettle in their country, with a plea for his friendship and for an amnesty of their earlier offences, and when their petition was granted they set sail for home; and it is ridiculous to suppose that they departed from their homes because they were incensed on account of a phenomenon that is natural and eternal, occurring twice every day. And the assertion that an excessive flood-tide once occurred looks like a fabrication, for when the ocean is affected in this way it is subject to increases and diminutions, but these are regulated and periodical.[1] Researchers such as J\u00fcrgen Spanuth (1907\u20131998) have sought to push back the date of the Cymbrian flood by more than a millennium, severing its historical links with the wanderings of the Cimbri and Teutons and linking it instead with the Invasions of the Sea Peoples of the late 13th and early 12th centuries BCE, driven from their northern homelands to attack the settled kingdoms of the Mediterranean.[2]"

An area of convection developed on May 11, and the next day the India Meteorological Department (IMD) classified it as a depression.[1] The system drifted northward,[2] and initially moderate wind shear kept the deep convection on the periphery of the consolidating low-level circulation center.[3] Gradually, banding features developed along the eastern semicircle, and with decreasing amounts of wind shear the system organized further.[4] By May 13, the pressure had dropped to 1000\u00a0mbar as wind shear levels dropped significantly. An anticyclone developed over the system, while a mid-latitude trough over northeastern India provided favorable outflow. Convection continued to consolidate around the low-level circulation,[5] and with well-defined banding features and a central dense overcast over the center of circulation, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) upgraded it to Tropical Cyclone 01B at 1121\u00a0UTC on May 13 while located about 545\u00a0km (339\u00a0mi) west-northwest of Yangon, Burma.[6] Upon first being upgraded, the storm tracked steadily northward due to a break in a mid-level ridge.[6] Early on May 14, IMD upgraded the system to deep depression status,[7] and six hours later classified it as Cyclonic Storm Akash after attaining 3-min sustained winds of 40\u00a0mph (65\u00a0km/h).[8] Akash continued to organize, with deep convection wrapping fully around the low-level circulation.[9] An eye began to form as the storm approached land, and at 1800 UTC on May 14 JTWC estimated 1-min sustained winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph).[10] Officially, Akash attained peak 3-min sustained winds of 85\u00a0km/h (55\u00a0mph) and a minimum central pressure of 988\u00a0hPa.[11] Additionally, meteorologists in Burma estimated Akash peaked with winds of 160\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph).[12] As it interacted with the mid-latitude westerlies, it began to become extratropical.[10] Shortly after reaching peak winds, Akash made landfall about 115\u00a0km (71\u00a0mi) south of Chittagong. The storm weakened rapidly as it continued inland,[13] and early on May 15 IMD issued its final advisory on the system;[14] shortly thereafter, JTWC discontinued advisories.[13] The name was contributed by India, Akash means Sky in Hindi language."

        "content": "  On 25 October 1964, a devastating flood of the River Sava struck Zagreb, Socialist Republic of Croatia, Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (today the capital of Croatia). High rainfall upriver caused rivers and streams in the Sava catchment basin to swell and spill over their banks in many places throughout Slovenia and northern Croatia. The worst of the flooding occurred in Zagreb. Sava floods were a known hazard in the city, having affected the development of the area since the Roman times, and the 1964 flood did not have the largest extent. However, it occurred following several decades of large-scale industrialisation and urban growth which had caused the city to expand into the most flood-vulnerable areas. The quality of building construction and flood defences in the floodplain was mostly low. Regulation of the Sava and its tributaries upriver from Zagreb cut off many natural detention basins, such as fields and pastures, which caused water to pile up ahead of the city. To make matters worse, the soil was already saturated from a mid-month episode of fairly high rainfall. A second episode of high rainfall, during 22\u201325 October upriver in Slovenia, produced a record-high water wave in the Sava. At Zagreb's Sava River gauge, the water crested at 514\u00a0cm (16\u00a0ft 10\u00a0in) above zero level, exceeding the previous high water mark by more than half a metre (2\u00a0ft). This proved too much for the city's embankments. Around 60\u00a0km2 (23\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of the city was flooded, including most neighbourhoods on the western side of the floodplain. The worst-stricken areas were the working-class suburbs of Trnje and Tre\u0161njevka. A network of arterial roads raised on small embankments failed to hold the water. In some areas single-storey houses were submerged whole. The onset of the flood was quick, the warnings came late and the intensity and height of the flood was not communicated to the residents in time. Many were unable to save their belongings and ended up stranded in attics and on the rooftops. The brunt of the flood lasted from 25 to 28\u00a0October as the water progressed through the city from west to east, mostly on the more populous left (northern) bank. The neighbourhoods on the right bank only saw groundwater flooding for the most part. The railway embankment and sandbag dykes successfully protected the northern and eastern part of the floodplain, and Donji grad and much of Pe\u0161\u010denica were spared. A total of 17 people died in the flood. The living quarters of 183,000 people were flooded; 40,000 of these lost their homes. The damage was estimated to 160\u00a0billion Yugoslav dinars, or, alternatively, over US$100\u00a0million.[1] The flood was followed by urban redevelopment, changing Zagreb's cityscape. Around 26,000 new flats and houses were constructed in the next four years. The challenge of housing flood refugees led to the creation of several new planned neighbourhoods. Existing neighbourhoods where much of the housing had been condemned due to water damage were rebuilt, often as high-rise housing estates. Several factories were moved eastward from the flood-prone central part of the city. The disaster also prompted a rework of the flood defences on the Sava. The Sava embankments in Zagreb were reconstructed, raised and lengthened, and the river was channelised throughout the city. Diversion canals were built around several cities in the Sava basin, including the Sava\u2013Odra\u2013Sava Canal bypassing Zagreb. As a result, although there have been several destructive Sava Valley floods since 1964, their effects in Zagreb were limited to groundwater flooding in a few streets. However, changes in the riverbed are believed to have somewhat decreased the effectiveness of the defences as of the early 21st century."

        "content": "Located in northwest Croatia near the border with Slovenia, Zagreb's geography is largely defined by two features: the Medvednica Mountain whose foothills contain the city's historic core and northern suburbs, and the River Sava floodplain to the south, which contains most of the city, including the post-19th-century city centre, Donji grad.[2][3] Originating in Slovenia, the Sava drains much of Slovenia and northern Croatia. It is the Danube's biggest tributary by discharge.[4] The river exhibits a nivo-pluvial regime. The water level peaks with spring snowmelt and autumn rains, while the minimums occur in summer and winter. The autumn peak is more pronounced in the Sava's upper course.[5] Due to the low permeability of the hilly and mountainous terrain of Slovenia and northwest Croatia, the river exhibits a high seasonal flow variability, exacerbating the risk of flooding.[6] Before the river regulation works at the turn of the 20th century, Sava's flow in Zagreb was described as \"torrential\".[7] The average annual discharge at the Zagreb gauging station is around 300 cubic metres per second (11,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s), while flows over 1,000\u00a0m3/s (35,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s) occur on a yearly basis.[8] Average yearly precipitation over the Sava's upper course in Slovenia measures 1,570 millimetres (61.8\u00a0in), contributing the largest part of the Sava's water over its entire course.[5] High rainfall events can increase water level in the Sava and its tributaries to flood levels within days.[9] The location of the city on a transition from hilly to flat terrain increases flood risk. The Sava flows at an incline of 1\u00a0per cent through Zagreb, but between Rugvica (about 20\u00a0km or 12\u00a0mi east of the city core) and Sisak, the river is highly sinuous with sharp meanders, and flows on a nearly flat terrain with an incline of 0.05\u00a0per cent. The latter part sustains much lower flows than the former, which can cause the water to pile up upstream.[10] Numerous torrential streams on the Medvednica Mountain pose an additional flood risk. The Medve\u0161\u010dak stream caused the city's deadliest natural disaster in 1651, when a flash flood swept away houses in Tkal\u010di\u0107eva Street, killing 52 people.[11] The most recent notable flash flooding event occurred in 2020.[12] Floods of the Sava in Zagreb have been recorded since the antiquity. The development of Andautonia, a Roman town on the fringes of the modern-day city, was influenced by a devastating flood in early 2nd century AD.[13] The first floods attested in modern records date back to 14th century.[14] The first chronicled flood occurred in 1469.[15] The twin cities of Kaptol and Gradec, which are located at the lower end of Medvednica foothills and form the core of modern-day Zagreb together with the adjacent Donji grad, controlled land in the floodplain on both banks of the Sava as early as the 13th century. This waterlogged area contained a few small villages and was mostly used for hunting, planting orchards and harvesting wood from willow trees as a construction material.[16] The city was slow to expand since even the Donji grad area, which lies on the northern edge of the plain, was prone to flooding until it was artificially raised around the beginning of the 20th century.[7] In the 19th century, floods would sometimes reach the bottom of the foothills, destroying houses in Ilica Street.[17] Only with the 1850 unification of Kaptol and Gradec, which made financing flood defence projects possible, and the 1892 construction of the railway embankment which doubled as a flood barrier, did Zagreb's urban area begin to approach the river.[18][7]"

        "content": "Industrialisation brought factories, whose number greatly increased after 1900. These were located near the railway, which divides the plain between Medvednica and the Sava into two parts. The land south of the railway had been largely owned by the Catholic Church until the land reform of 1918 which made it available for development, and it was settled in great numbers by factory workers, who migrated into the city from the countryside, constructing houses and shacks on small subdivided lots in the quickly growing suburbs of Tre\u0161njevka, Trnje and Pe\u0161\u010denica. Most dwellings were built without permits because underemployed factory workers could not afford the fees. Illegally constructed buildings were ineligible for insurance from flooding, which was a frequent occurrence in the new suburbs.[18] Large floods occurred in 1876, twice in 1895, in 1923, 1925, 1926 and 1933, but smaller ones were almost a yearly occurrence.[11][19][9][1] In 1900, only 4,000 of Zagreb's 57,000 inhabitants lived in Trnje and Tre\u0161njevka, while Pe\u0161\u010denica had not yet been incorporated into the city.[20] By the 1931 census, the population of Tre\u0161njevka alone had grown to 21,350 residents, increasing the necessity and value of river regulation.[21] The surroundings of the Sava, which had many meanders, oxbow lakes and islands, were partially protected when the river was channelised at the beginning of the 20th century. The oxbow lakes were fenced off by fascines.[22] Work on flood defences was sporadic and of poor quality due to a scarcity of funding. An embankment protecting Trnje was partially built in 1924\u201325, but washed away by the November 1925 flood.[22] By 1929 the central part of the suburbs was protected by an embankment,[19] which was in the 1930s extended away from the river to Radni\u010dka Road in Pe\u0161\u010denica in the east, and along the \u010crnomerec stream up to the northern border of Tre\u0161njevka in the west.[23][24] These defences were not enough to protect the city from the 1933 flood, when the Sava, at a height of 455 centimetres (14\u00a0ft 11\u00a0in),[25] breached the embankments, causing flooding that lasted seven weeks.[26] The embankments were mended and somewhat improved over the next several years, which were nevertheless marked by successive floods.[27] Further works were carried out in 1945 and 1960\u201361 by youth work actions organised by the Communist government. Embankments were extended and flood defences improved in Tre\u0161njevka, Trnje, and Pe\u0161\u010denica.[28][29][30] However, the embankments were still low and of poor construction quality, and protected only the central part of the city, leaving the flanks exposed.[31][24] Following World War II, the three suburbs were responsible for much of the city's high population growth. By 1961, Zagreb numbered 430,802 inhabitants; the population of Tre\u0161njevka had surpassed Rijeka, Croatia's third most populous city.[32] After a lull in construction following the war, late 1950s and early 1960s saw the creation of new neighbourhoods of apartment buildings, such as the prefabricated buildings in Voltino\u00a0[hr] (Tre\u0161njevka), Folnegovi\u0107evo naselje\u00a0[hr] (Pe\u0161\u010denica) and Trnjanska Savica, and the low-rise cohousing estate in Vesla\u010dka Street.[33][34] The southern districts became home to new University of Zagreb faculty buildings, and industry complexes such as the Rade Kon\u010dar factory in Tre\u0161njevka and the \u017ditnjak industrial zone in Pe\u0161\u010denica, while district heating was introduced with new thermoelectric and heat plants.[35] However, living standards in general remained low; only 10 per cent of Tre\u0161njevka's streets was paved in 1960.[36] During Mayor Ve\u0107eslav Holjevac's term, the city began to expand to the Sava's right bank, forming Novi Zagreb. Savski Gaj, the first planned neighbourhood in Novi Zagreb, was built in 1957. The Zagreb Fair was also moved from the city centre to its modern-day position in Novi Zagreb's Kajzerica near the Sava Bridge.[37]"

Ljubljana saw 113.0\u00a0mm (4.45\u00a0in) of rainfall on 22\u201325 October; Sava Bohinjka's source received 101.3\u00a0mm (3.99\u00a0in) and Novo Mesto received 90.0\u00a0mm (3.54\u00a0in).[25] Although the rainfall totals were several times lower than in the 1933 flood,[25] river levels increased rapidly. During the afternoon and evening hours of 24 October, the gauge station in Rade\u010de near Zidani Most, Slovenia (roughly halfway between Ljubljana and Zagreb) crested at 40\u00a0cm (16\u00a0in) less than the 1933 maximum, but this was preceded by a rise of nearly 6\u00a0m (20\u00a0ft) in a matter of hours.[38] This rise was likely accelerated by the saturation of the drainage basin by moderate rainfall the previous week, which had produced a smaller water wave that ended up cresting at 304\u00a0cm (10\u00a0ft 0\u00a0in) in Zagreb on 16 October.[39]"

The undefended plain between Zapre\u0161i\u0107 and Samobor, directly upstream from the urban area, was the first to flood in the Zagreb metropolitan area.[40] At 11:45, water topped the right-bank embankment opposite Podsused\u00a0[hr], on the westernmost fringes of Zagreb.[41] One of the first urban neighbourhoods to be affected was Rude\u0161, in the western part of Tre\u0161njevka, which was flooded by 14:00. The Tempo quarry near modern-day Lake Jarun was inundated around 15:30, when water breached makeshift dykes, and the company's cement supply was flooded.[42] In the following hours the flood reached Jankomir, Lu\u010dko, Pre\u010dko\u00a0[hr], Vrbanov Put (today Vrbani) and Kajzerica. Kajzerica was on the right (southern) bank of the river and was protected by the embankment, but endangered by groundwaters.[43] Further east, settlements near the river, such as Petru\u0161evec (Pe\u0161\u010denica) and Drenje (right bank), were also inundated, since the embankments ended at the recently built Zagreb Thermoelectric Heat Plant  near modern-day Savica Lakes\u00a0[hr] and Folnegovi\u0107evo naselje.[24][44] By the evening, all the city's bridges were closed as the water neared the tops of the embankments. The embankments were initially defended by makeshift dykes made out of sandbags supplied by the city's construction companies, including 100,000 sandbags provided by Paromlin\u00a0[hr]. The sandbags were used to raise the embankments and block the breaches near the Sava Bridge \u2013 the left embankment was breached near the Mladost sports facilities at 20:20 and in Vesla\u010dka Street at 22:00. At that point, the level at the Sava Bridge gauge was 460\u00a0cm (15\u00a0ft 1\u00a0in), slightly exceeding the high water of 1933,[45] which had been the record high since the gauge became operational in November 1849.[46] At 470\u00a0cm (15\u00a0ft 5\u00a0in), the water filled the southern half of Tre\u0161njevka. This area included the neighbourhoods of Jarun and Kne\u017eija, west of Savska Road and south of today's Ljubljana Avenue (then part of the Ljubljana\u2013Zagreb\u2013Belgrade Highway, running east\u2013west through Zagreb). These two roads were slightly elevated from the surrounding terrain and acted as barriers to the waters. At this point, the water was at the level of the crown of the embankments west of the Sava Bridge.[24]"

The high water at the Sava Bridge gauge was reached at 08:00, reading 514\u00a0cm (16\u00a0ft 10\u00a0in), or 59\u00a0cm (23\u00a0in) higher than in 1933. At that time, much of Tre\u0161njevka was flooded except for some areas north of today's Ozaljska Street (then part of Kon\u010dar Street), and Voltino.[48] Under the railway overpass near Stadion Kranj\u010devi\u0107eva, where the sandbags were stacked to protect the city centre, the water reached the height of the traffic signs.[49] The Rade Kon\u010dar factory in Voltino was at the edge of the flooded area and defended by over 2,000 factory workers and employees, and the army, over the following two days.[50][51] The last remaining passable thoroughfare in Tre\u0161njevka was a section of Samobor Road, an east-west street along the railway.[51] On the western side of Trnje, University of Zagreb's Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences building in Vrbik\u00a0[hr] was flooded around 08:00\u201309:00.[52] Surging from Tre\u0161njevka, breaching the embankments west of the Sava Bridge and topping them near the Liberty Bridge where they were lower, the water enveloped most of Trnje. Trnje's northwestern corner, Martinovka, was flooded, but the part of the eastern neighbourhood of Kruge\u00a0[hr] north of the highway remained dry. On 27 October, the eastern line of defence was Dr\u017ei\u0107 Street, west of Sige\u010dica\u00a0[hr] and Folnegovi\u0107evo naselje.[24][53] The northernmost extent of the flooded area was the railway embankment at the fringe of Donji grad, Zagreb's central district, where sandbag dykes at railway underpasses protected the city core. In some places in Donji grad the groundwaters rose through the sewers. Backflow destroyed machinery in the Josip Kra\u0161 biscuit factory on Branimir Street. The neighbouring Nada Dimi\u0107 textile factory was saved by its workers, who plugged all sewer drains with sandbags in time to stop the flood.[54]"

As the streets in Ljubljanica (Tre\u0161njevka), north of the highway, became passable again,[55] and Liberty Bridge and Kon\u010dar Street were re-opened to bus and tram traffic, respectively,[56] water rose on the eastern side of the city, where the defence line at the time ran along Dr\u017ei\u0107eva Street. In the afternoon of 26 October, Trnjanska Savica was flooded and quickly found itself under 1.5 metres (5\u00a0ft) of water, while Folnegovi\u0107evo naselje and Sige\u010dica were flooded by groundwaters. When water began to flow along Dr\u017ei\u0107eva Street during the night of 27\u201328 October, endangering Kanal and inner city neighbourhoods to the north, channels were dug through the street with jackhammers, redirecting the water towards the Savica oxbow (today the Savica Lakes) and surrounding meadows.[57][58] Water then began piling up against Radni\u010dka Road as the embankment of the rail spur for the heat plant prevented outflow from the Savica oxbow. The spur was dynamited in two places, after which the water relatively quickly receded from most of the flooded area.[48] On the right bank of the Sava, flooding was extensive in rural areas, reaching past Karlovac Road near Samobor and Lu\u010dko, upriver from Zagreb.[47] Urban areas in Novi Zagreb were largely unaffected. Apart from Kajzerica,[59] there was no flooding in the first two days of the flood,[60] but in the night of 27\u201328 October rising groundwaters began to cause localised flooding in Trnsko, Trokut and Savski Gaj. Groundwater flooding on the right bank was worst in Blato. The Zagreb Fair, which was in the off-season used as a warehouse for factories, lies close to the Sava, and was also affected. The authorities, aided by local residents, evacuated machinery from the fairground buildings.[61][62]"

About 221,900\u00a0ha (548,000 acres) of Croatia's territory, of which 158,000\u00a0ha (390,000 acres) was farmland, was flooded. Apart from Zagreb, affected areas included Istria, Zagorje, Podravina near Vara\u017edin, and Me\u0111imurje.[69] In Zagorje, the River Sutla (Slovene: Sotla), a left tributary of the Sava, washed out the railway in Kumrovec and stopped road traffic in Klanjec.[41] Flooding in Kumrovec began on the night of 24\u201325 October. By 03:00, residents of a dozen houses in the village of Gmajna were stranded on the roofs of their homes.[70] Major roads near Krapina and Pregrada were rendered impassable.[71][72] Flooding on the right bank of the Drava upriver of Vara\u017edin affected villages along the river, as well as the area around Mato\u0161 Square in the city.[73] In Istria, material damage to agribusinesses in Umag and Labin was estimated at 3\u00a0billion Yugoslav dinars. The central and western Istria waterworks was knocked out, leaving 80,000 customers without tap water for at least three days. The Kupa overflowed near Karlovac, but had returned to normal flow on 28 October, as did the Sutla.[74] In Sisak, the next city downriver from Zagreb, the village of Ti\u0161ina Kaptolska was evacuated as the water began to rise on the night of 26\u201327 October. The city was saved by dynamiting the embankments upstream at Lijevi Dubrov\u010dak, Martinska Ves and Zablatje. This caused the water to spill onto cornfields, and the water level at Sisak subsequently decreased by a metre (3.3\u00a0ft).[60][75]  By 28 October, all the bridges along the River Sava were closed, and the Jasenovac and Slavonski Koba\u0161 pontoon bridges were pre-emptively dismantled[76] because the river was carrying uprooted trees and large debris.[74] Flooding was also intense in Slovenia. Houses were flooded in Celje. Numerous roads were flooded in northeast Slovenia, including the road connecting Lendava, Slovenia, with Mursko Sredi\u0161\u010de, Croatia, where a bridge over the Drava was destroyed by the torrent. In the southeast, in Kr\u0161ko, the waters caused damage to the \u0110uro Salaj paper factory. In the Nova Gorica District in the southwest, the worst damage occurred in Vipava, which was still under 30\u00a0cm (12\u00a0in) of water on 27 October.[73]"

The embankments had been improved to hold against a flood of the scale of the 1933 event, but it immediately became obvious they would be topped. All emergency services together with the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) were mobilised to help with flood defence efforts. By this point, the water level at the gauge at the bathhouse near the Sava Bridge\u00a0[sh], located at the border of Tre\u0161njevka and Trnje, had already reached 288\u00a0cm (9\u00a0ft 5\u00a0in), nearly the height of the previous week's water wave crest.[78] The first radio warning of the flood was broadcast on Radio Zagreb on 25 October,[79] as well as on television,[80] and bells were rung in the city centre to alarm the citizens. Unfortunately, the riverside suburbs were too far from the centre to hear the bells,[81] and many households did not own radio nor TV sets.[66] The warnings also arrived fairly late; the first radio warning was only issued at 13:30, when parts of Podsused were already underwater.[79][41] As most of the flooding happened at night and the warnings did not reach residents, many remained unaware of the danger until the water reached their houses.[66] Many people who received the warnings were initially unwilling to leave their houses.[55][82][83] During the floods of the 1920s and 1930s, almost none of the residents had dared leave their houses unattended for fear of looting.[84] Many residents sent their children away with rescue services, planning to wait out the flood and take care of their possessions, only to find themselves trapped in attics and on the rooftops of their single-storey and two-storey homes as the water kept rising.[50][55][82] For instance, in Folnegovi\u0107evo naselje, during the night of 26\u201327 October, the water reportedly rose by 2\u00a0m (6\u00a0ft 7\u00a0in) in three hours.[60] In the later days of the flood, residents who successfully took shelter at the upper floors of taller buildings were also evacuated, as they were without access to tap water and sanitation.[85] Newspapers noted that the sudden arrival of the flood created a confusion among many in the unaffected parts of the city who attempted to visit or commute to the flooded neighbourhoods, unaware of the disaster.[86]"

The flood inundated 6,000\u00a0ha (15,000 acres; 60\u00a0km2) of urban area and a third of the city's residential buildings, including 300 tower blocks. The maximum north\u2013south span of the flooded area was 4\u00a0km (2.5\u00a0mi) in Trnje.[89] The flood reached the railway embankment situated between Trnje and the city core.[54] In Zagreb's surroundings, around 30,000\u00a0ha (74,000 acres) of farmland was underwater in the municipalities of Samobor, Zapre\u0161i\u0107, Velika Gorica, Dugo Selo and Sesvete.[90] 40,000 citizens lost their homes as 10,000 flats and single-family houses were condemned. Another 35,000 housing units were damaged but deemed fit for repairs.[89][66] In Tre\u0161njevka, 8,254 households, accounting for half the district's inhabitants, suffered property damage.[91] Two kilometres (1.2\u00a0mi) of the Ljubljana\u2013Zagreb\u2013Belgrade Highway were washed out. The flood scoured the foundations of Jankomir\u00a0[sh] and Jaku\u0161evec Bridges\u00a0[sh].[89] The roadway of the latter was underwater during the flood.[92] While many employees aided by citizen volunteers tried to protect their workplaces, a total of 120 companies reported damage from the flood. 65 per cent of building material was lost, which complicated the rebuilding efforts.[93][89][94][95] A total of 3,297 industrial property units were destroyed.[1][89] The Jugomont construction company suffered 1\u00a0billion dinars in losses. Nearly all of its facilities were destroyed.[96] In the \u017ditnjak industrial zone in Pe\u0161\u010denica, the facilities of Auto-Hrvatska,[97][98] Hidroelektra,[99][98] Viadukt and Gramat were flooded.[98] The Zagreb tram depot in Ljubljanica (Tre\u0161njevka) was flooded soon after midnight on 25\u201326 October, but all tram cars were quickly evacuated and parked on higher ground on Mirogoj Road. Tram traffic remained in operation on the \u010crnomerec\u2013Dubrava line along the dry northern rim of the river plain.[100] Some factories endangered by the Sava and its tributaries outside Zagreb proper included Serum Zavod (today Pliva) in Kalinovica,[101] \u017dumberak in Savski Marof, Jugomonta\u017ea in Brdovec, and Karbon\u00a0[sh; hr] and Jugokeramika in the Zapre\u0161i\u0107 area.[54][102] In the Tre\u0161njevka Square Nama, only six per cent of the inventory was saved from the flood.[55] The \u0160imecki shoe shop sold wet shoes at a 95 per cent discount, finding a great demand.[67] The initial estimate of damages was 100\u00a0billion dinars, not including personal property.[90] This was later revised to 160\u00a0billion dinars, which was 9.18\u00a0per cent of SR Croatia's gross domestic product.[88] Another estimate puts the damages at \"more than US$100\u00a0million\".[1] For decades, the 1964 flood remained the costliest natural disaster in the history of the city.[88] Zagreb's mass media were substantially affected by the flood. Zagreb's most widely read dailies, Vjesnik and Ve\u010dernji list, and a number of weeklies, had their headquarters and print works in the Vjesnik Building\u00a0[hr], located in the low-lying Cvjetno naselje. Most of the machinery, paper, supplies, storage space and offices were in the basement and the first few floors of the building,[103] as the higher floors were still under construction.[104] Consequently, they were immediately under threat from the floodwaters which began entering the building at 03:00 on 26 October, and in several hours overcame impromptu defences and flooded most of the equipment, causing around 1\u00a0billion dinars in damages. Some parts of the building were in up to 4\u00a0m (13\u00a0ft) of water. This event left Zagreb without daily newspapers until Vjesnik and Ve\u010dernji list managed to publish a limited-run joint two-page issue on 27 October, printed at the old print works in Donji grad.[103][105] This joint arrangement between the two newspapers continued for a week.[106] The Radio Television Zagreb, whose headquarters were close by, in Vrbik, faced a similar ordeal.[79] As a consequence of these mishaps, there is some confusion as to the details of the events.[107]"

Injured and sick children were transferred to the Bistra Hospital in Zagorje.[110] Over 10,000 people took part in maintaining flood defences, evacuating neighbourhoods, caring for the flood refugees at the shelters, treating injuries, and other mitigation efforts.[67] The rescue efforts were hampered by the fact that there was no electricity in the flooded area, and rescue crews had to rely on torches.[79][59][111] The proceeds of the NK Zagreb\u00a0\u2013 A.S. Roma association football match held on 28 October for the 1964\u201365 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup were donated toward recovery from the flood. The game was held at the Maksimir Stadium. NK Zagreb's home ground, Stadion Kranj\u010devi\u0107eva, was in flooded Tre\u0161njevka.[112][113][49] Numerous cities in Croatia and Yugoslavia, as well as foreign countries, offered help with relief efforts. The United States, Italy, West Germany, and Austria offered medical supplies and equipment. Belgrade, Bjelovar, Karlovac, Kragujevac, Rijeka, Split, and Virovitica offered assistance with relief efforts. Belgrade sent tankers for street cleaning, and electric generators. Bjelovar, Karlovac, Vara\u017edin, Donja Stubica, and Jastrebarsko sent generator-powered water pumps.[114][115] The SR Croatia Red Cross set up camp beds in Zagreb hospitals, and distributed clothing, blankets and some food supplies to the evacuees.[116] Food supplies were donated by various companies, including Sljeme, Mosor and Lova\u010dki Rog.[117] Firewood was brought in from other cities and Yugoslav republics, as Zagreb's firewood stores were flooded.[118] A chlorination campaign was carried out due to the contamination of the city's water supply. In addition, the hygiene crisis prompted an organised mass vaccination of Zagrebers for typhoid and paratyphoid fever.[119][118] Karlovac, Novo Mesto, Opatija, Ljubljana and Kranj sent tankers with clean water.[119]"

Costly damages were incurred in university laboratories, libraries and telephone exchanges, which tended to be located on the ground floor or in the basement.[124] Citizens whose homes were flooded were evacuated to student dormitories and school classrooms.[125][82] The consequences of the flood changed the cityscape of southern Zagreb. The worst damage occurred in Trnje. The neighbourhood of Vrbik was almost completely destroyed: 90 per cent of its housing units was condemned.[108] The recovery efforts, organised by Mayor Pero Pirker, led to the creation of a number of new neighbourhoods to replace and compensate for lost housing.[126] As a first recourse for those made homeless by the flood, the city government passed a motion to begin construction of 1,000 flats with another 9,000 slated for construction in 1965.[127] Estates of prefabricated small single-family houses and single-storey apartment houses were erected in many suburban locations, including Botinec, Retkovec,[108] Prilesje,[77][128] Maksimirsko naselje, Gajnice and others.[129][130] These neighbourhoods were meant to be temporary until the residents could be assigned a free replacement flat; however, due to a housing shortage, many residents ended up living in the temporary buildings into the 21st century.[131] In total, around 26,000 new housing units and 34 schools were built during the next three years.[126] In the next decade, the neighbourhoods of Kne\u017eija, Kalinovica and Srednjaci\u00a0[sh] in the Jarun area, which had been mostly occupied by single-storey and two-storey houses, were turned into high-rise housing estates, home to 29,300 people by the early 1970s.[126][132] On the whole, 6,731 new housing units were built in Tre\u0161njevka between the Ljubljana\u2013Zagreb Highway and the river.[91] The worst hit part[57] of Kruge similarly evolved into the modern-day high-rise Trnjanska Savica neighbourhood,[133] and further high-rise estates were constructed in Novi Zagreb.[126] Despite the flood, Zagreb's population increased by a third during the decade of 1961\u20131971.[126][134] In the latter half of the 1960s a number of factories were moved from the inner city to the outskirts, outside the flood zone.[126] The Kra\u0161 factory was moved to its present-day location in Ravnice.[135] The Gredelj railway workshop facilities in Trnje, next to Zagreb Main Railway Station, were gradually closed as a new plant was opened in 1968 in Pe\u0161\u010denica.[136]"

        "header": "Improvements to flood defences",
        "content": "The government quickly set out to improve Zagreb's flood defences. On 28 October, the authorities began making repairs to the embankments. More flooding was feared,[56] because the wave action of the receding waters deepened the breaches.[137] Several months after the flood, an overhaul of embankments was started with youth work actions.[29] The embankments, whose tops had been 1.5\u20132\u00a0m (5\u20137\u00a0ft) above the floodplain,[138] were reconstructed and elevated to a height of 4\u20136\u00a0m (13\u201320\u00a0ft) on the 27\u00a0km (17\u00a0mi) stretch from Podsused to Ivanja Reka.[139] On this stretch, the embankments were built 300\u00a0m (980\u00a0ft) apart; the river was placed in a roughly 100\u00a0m (330\u00a0ft) wide channel flanked by detention fields of a similar width.[139][140] The regulation works significantly altered the terrain near the parts of the river which had not been covered by the old embankments. Among other changes, this included draining the marshes and lakes in the village of Jaku\u0161evec[141] and separating Lake Jarun from the Sava.[142] During the flood, the city's landfills were under water, so the refuse was dumped at a temporary site in Dubrava.[119] During the river regulation works, a new landfill was built in 1965 in Jaku\u0161evec.[141] The floods prompted work on flood defences on the entire course of the Sava,[31] including diversion canals protecting Zagreb, Sisak and Karlovac.[106] Construction of the Sava\u2013Odra\u2013Sava Canal in Zagreb started in 1965,[108] and ended in the early 1970s.[143] Branching from the Sava's right bank upriver of the inner city, at Jankomir, the canal extends 32\u00a0km (20\u00a0mi) in the southeast direction, connecting the river with the River Odra and the Odra Field\u00a0[hr], a natural detention basin[144][145] which can accommodate up to 1,809,000,000\u00a0m3 (1,467,000\u00a0acre\u22c5ft) of water.[146] The canal has a capacity of more than 1,500\u00a0m3/s (53,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s).[1] The 1,000\u00a0m (3,300\u00a0ft) wide[63] Jankomir weir is opened by dynamiting the lip of the embankment.[147] It is designed to accept water into the canal when the water level at the Sava Bridge gauge exceeds 350\u00a0cm (11\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in), which corresponds to a flow of 1,900\u00a0m3/s (67,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s).[145] This acts to reduce the amount of water entering the urban area during high water events, and decrease the risk of the floodwater rising past the crown of Zagreb's embankments.[139] According to Hrvatske vode, in the Zagreb urban area between Podsused\u00a0[sh] and Mi\u010devec\u00a0[sh] Bridges, the embankments exceed the crest of a 1,000-year flood by a metre (3.3\u00a0ft).[31][144] However, surrounding towns and villages are protected by lower and less secure embankments. As such, low-lying parts of the surrounding area remain in danger from flooding. The flood of 1964 was the last devastating river flood in Zagreb. Some of the later Sava Valley floods, such as the ones in 1979[139] and 2014[148][149] have produced localised groundwater flooding in a few streets in Kajzerica and Jarun.[150] The 1990 Sava Valley flood broke the 1933 high water mark in Rade\u010de by another 54\u00a0cm (21\u00a0in) and caused much damage in Zagreb's surroundings, especially the area of Samobor and Zapre\u0161i\u0107, but the city proper was spared, except for the (by then already decommissioned) Jaku\u0161evec Bridge, which was carried away by the river current.[151] The levels of flooding of 1964 and before have not recurred[150] as of 2021. Progress on the Sava\u2013Odra\u2013Sava Canal stopped in the 1970s. It was initially intended to extend along the Odra's course all the way to the Sava,[139] but today ends in the Odra Field.[152] This increases the flood risk in the Odra Valley; during the 1990 Sava Valley flood, high inflow into the canal caused the Odra to flood the village of \u010ci\u010dka Poljana.[153] Near Samobor and Zapre\u0161i\u0107, the river in parts completely lacks embankments.[154][155] According to academic Stjepan \u0160terc, cutting off the detention basins in this area without completing the Sava\u2013Odra\u2013Sava Canal would increase the risk of flooding in Zagreb.[139] The water flow necessary to activate the canal has increased over the years due to the incision of the Sava's riverbed in Zagreb by more than 3\u00a0m (9.8\u00a0ft).[156] Already in 1979, a level of 382\u00a0cm (150\u00a0in) at the Zagreb gauge was not enough to cause water to flow over the Jankomir weir.[157] The issue of river profile changes due to sediment transport was intended to be solved by a series of hydroelectric dams between Podsused and Rugvica,[158] but these plans were not carried out. The incision trend stopped and began to reverse in 1994 following the construction of a weir near the Zagreb Thermoelectric Heat Plant  in Pe\u0161\u010denica.[159] Despite the riverbed changes and the diversion canal, a 2011 study found no statistically significant changes in yearly water level maximums. This was partly attributed to a detrimental effect due to the new dams and flood defence work conducted upriver in Slovenia.[156] In addition, due to river incision, the Jankomir weir was as of 2008 functional only at flows exceeding 2,350\u00a0m3/s (83,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s).[160] As of 2015, the canal has been opened nine times.[161]"

Out of all Zagreb mayors, he is perceived as the most affected by the flooding of Sava, although mayors before him also suffered calamitous floods.[77] The recovery of the city from the catastrophe made Pirker a highly popular mayor, and he continued his career at the national level, but fell into oblivion following the suppression of the Croatian Spring in 1971 and his death from cancer the next year.[126]"

        "content": " Tropical Cyclone Alessia was the first tropical cyclone to affect the Northern Territory of Australia in November since Cyclone Joan in 1975. The storm was first identified as a tropical low on 20\u00a0November 2013 well to the northwest of Australia. Tracking generally west to west-southwest, the small system steadily organized into a tropical cyclone by 22\u00a0November.[nb 1] Maintaining a small central dense overcast, Alessia brushed the Kimberley region before making landfall in the Top End region with winds of 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph) on 23 and 24\u00a0November respectively.[nb 2] Some weakening took place as the system moved over land; however, reorganization occurred as it neared the Gulf of Carpentaria. After moving over water on 26\u00a0November, it redeveloped gale-force winds. Alessia reached its peak intensity on 27\u00a0November with winds of 85\u00a0km/h (53\u00a0mph) and a barometric pressure of 991\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.26\u00a0inHg) and subsequently made its final landfall near Wollogorang. Weakening ensued once more as the storm traveled over land; though, Alessia's remnants looped eastward back over water before doubling back to the west. The system was last noted moving inland again over the Northern Territory on 1\u00a0December. Throughout Alessia's existence, it caused only minimal damage. Several areas experienced gale-force winds, with gusts measured up to 109\u00a0km/h (68\u00a0mph) on Centre Island. Moderate to heavy rains accompanied the system as well, with a storm maxima of 290.4\u00a0mm (11.43\u00a0in) also occurring on Centre Island."

        "content": "On 20\u00a0November 2013, an area of low pressure, accompanied by persistent deep convection, developed over the southern Indian Ocean, roughly 1,465\u00a0km (910\u00a0mi) north of RAAF Learmonth in Western Australia. At the mid-levels, the circulation appeared more broad in nature, with notable rainbands wrapping into the low. Environmental conditions favored tropical cyclogenesis, with moderate wind shear, high sea surface temperatures, and prominent outflow that extended into the mid-latitude westerlies.[1] By this time, the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) noted this system as a tropical low just outside their area of responsibility.[2] Owing to increasing organization over the following day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the system late on 21\u00a0November.[3][nb 3] Subsequently, the JTWC began issuing advisories on the system under the identifier Tropical Cyclone 02S on 22\u00a0November, estimating it to have attained gale-force winds. Situated along the edge of a near-equatorial ridge, the storm tracked generally east and was forecast to maintain this movement for much of its existence.[5] Later on 21\u00a0November, the BOM classified the system as a Category\u00a01 tropical cyclone on the Australian cyclone intensity scale and assigned it the name Alessia, at which time it was located 390\u00a0km (240\u00a0mi) north of Broome. A smaller-than-average cyclone, Alessia featured a core of deep convection but no notable banding features, making Dvorak satellite intensity estimates difficult.[6][7] The storm, having a maximum diameter of no more than 335\u00a0km (208\u00a0mi) with gale-force winds covering less than half that distance, maintained a very small central dense overcast as it approached the Kimberley region.[8] Around 0600\u00a0UTC on 23\u00a0November, the JTWC estimated Alessia to have attained one-minute sustained winds of 85\u00a0km/h (53\u00a0mph).[9] Throughout 23\u00a0November, a slight northerly component took place in the track, with Alessia remaining offshore as it brushed the Kimberley region. However, dry air from over Australia was drawn into the system, causing a dramatic decrease in convection.[10] At this time, Alessia became the first storm since Tropical Cyclone Anika in 2008 to affect Western Australia during November.[6] Later that day, the storm passed over Troughton Island where gale-force winds were measured.[6] Moving over the Joseph Bonaparte Gulf at the southern end of the Timor Sea early on 24\u00a0November, a burst in convection over Alessia's center indicated it was maintaining its intensity as a minimal tropical cyclone.[11] Continued reorganization of the cyclone's structure took place as it accelerated east toward the Top End region, with defined banding apparent on satellite imagery and a tight circulation center seen on local radar.[12] Alessia made landfall at 0930\u00a0UTC on 24\u00a0November near the Daly River mouth, south of Darwin, Northern Territory, before rapidly weakening to a tropical low. Alessia's movement onshore marked the first time since Cyclone Joan in 1975 that a tropical cyclone affected the Northern Territory during November.[6] In light of the system moving overland, the JTWC issues their final advisory on the cyclone.[13] Moving steadily eastward across Top End, Alessia remained weak but its proximity to water allowed significant bursts of convection to develop during this time.[14] Early on 26\u00a0November, the former cyclone emerged over the Gulf of Carpentaria near Blue Mud Bay. Once offshore, a break in the upper-level ridge previously steering the storm eastward caused a southward shift in the track, bringing it directly over Groote Eylandt for several hours.[6][15] Gale-force winds soon redeveloped over the southeastern quadrant of Alessia; however, it was not re-designated as a tropical cyclone until 27\u00a0November when the winds extended halfway around the circulation.[16] As Alessia re-intensified over the southwestern Gulf, its movement became more southeasterly, taking the circulation parallel to the coast.[15] With an anticyclone over the Northern Territory providing modest outflow for the cyclone, it continued to intensify; the JTWC also re-initiated advisories on the storm by 0600\u00a0UTC on 27\u00a0November.[17] Hours later, Alessia reached its peak strength with winds of 85\u00a0km/h (53\u00a0mph) and a barometric pressure estimated at 991\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.27\u00a0inHg).[6] Simultaneously, it moved ashore near Wollogorang, roughly 130\u00a0km (81\u00a0mi) east of Borroloola. Increasing shear and land interaction caused the low- and mid-level circulations to separate, with the later continuing eastward over water.[18] The storm soon weakened to a tropical low and its movement became erratic.[6] Its remnants persisted for several days in the same general region, executing a clockwise loop before moving back over the Gulf of Carpentaria on 28\u00a0November. While environmental conditions favored redevelopment once again and deep convection had formed over the system, its low-level circulation remained poorly organized.[14] Failing to regenerate, Alessia moved eastward before doubling back to the west, passing near the Sir Edward Pellew Group of Islands on 30\u00a0November.[19] It was last noted on 1\u00a0December over the Top End region.[20][21]"

Additionally, areas from Mitchell Plateau to Cockatoo Island were placed under a cyclone warning.[23] The following day, watches extended to Cape Hotham Light in the Northern Territory, including the city of Darwin and the Tiwi Islands.[24] As the cyclone intensified, warnings gradually spread eastward.[25] Warnings reached as far east as Point Stuart prior to Alessia's landfall.[26] All watches and warnings were dropped on 24\u00a0November as Alessia moved inland and degraded to a tropical low.[27] Though impact from the storm was expected to be fairly minimal, residents were still advised to stock up on emergency supplies and be prepared.[28] Northern Territory Police Commissioner, John McRoberts, urged residents to heed warnings despite the generally non-threatening nature of the storm, \"complacency can often be your worst enemy in these types of events.\"[29] Many stores across Darwin reported a sharp increase in the sales of bottled water due to the storm.[28] Despite the approaching storm, regional airports, schools, and businesses remained open.[30] Ferry service to the Tiwi Islands, however, was suspended for 24\u00a0November.[31] On 23\u00a0November, Cyclone Alessia brushed the Kimberley coastline of Western Australia as a low-end Category\u00a01. The strongest winds were measured on Troughton Island at 69\u00a0km/h (43\u00a0mph) with gusts to 94\u00a0km/h (58\u00a0mph). The storm's brisk forward motion limited rainfall, however, with only 24.8\u00a0mm (0.98\u00a0in) falling on the island.[6][32] Farther west, Kalumburu received 37.8\u00a0mm (1.49\u00a0in) of rain.[33] Effects across the Top End region were similar to Kimberly, some reports of gale-force winds with generally light to moderate rain,[6] peaking at 126\u00a0mm (5.0\u00a0in) along the Upper Wickham River. Owing to previously dry conditions, the rains proved mostly beneficial to the region.[34] Flash flooding along the Goomadeer River in Arnhem Land caught at least seven people off-guard, including one infant, as their two vehicles were overcome with water. Six people safely made it out while another was swept downstream. He was rescued two days later by local police.[35] In Darwin, strong winds downed a few trees in the Northern Suburbs and Howard Springs while localised flooding occurred in Palmerston. Additionally, one power line was downed in the city. Local authorities reported no serious traffic accidents in relation to the storm nor injuries.[36][37] In Milne, a few residents seeking shelter at a local fire station found themselves locked out despite officials advising people to seek shelter if necessary.[38]"

It formed from a trough of low pressure that moved south into the Gulf of Mexico, and became stationary. A low pressure center developed along this trough, and on September 5, a Hurricane Hunter aircraft reported that the system had gained sufficient organization to be classified a tropical depression, 95 miles (153\u00a0km) southeast of Galveston.[1] The depression drifted south-southwest while strengthening, reaching its peak strength of 60 miles per hour (97\u00a0km/h) on the morning of September 6.[2] The system then made an abrupt turn to the west-northwest, and remained steady in strength and course until landfall the next day, near Matagorda.[3] The system weakened rapidly after landfall degenerating into a remnant low on September 8, but the storm's circulation survived for another three days.[1] The storm caused extremely heavy rainfall in inland areas; damage reached $4.5\u00a0million (2002\u00a0USD), though there were no fatalities due to Fay.[1]"

        "content": "In the first few days of September 2002, an upper-level trough emerged in the Gulf of Mexico and stalled.[1] Thunderstorms developed along the trough and concentrated around a weak low pressure system. Slowly, the trough and associated low pressure drifted south into the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico. A low pressure area in the northwest Gulf of Mexico became the dominant circulation and slowly developed persistent convection near the center. On September 5, a reconnaissance aircraft investigated the system. During the flight, a low-level center became evident and some deep convection persisted; as a result, it was classified as a tropical depression.[1] Wind shear within the Gulf of Mexico was weak and remained favorable to tropical cyclone formation.[4] A reconnaissance flight later that day discovered an ill-defined circulation which led to low confidence of the location of the center of circulation. However, enough convection persisted for the depression to be upgraded into Tropical Storm Fay that evening.[5] Stationary in movement, the associated convection became removed from the center of circulation; despite this, the system gradually intensified.[2][6] On September 6, the storm reached its peak intensity of 60\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h). Light wind shear prevented Fay from intensifying further, and the gradual movement was dictated by a weak mid-level ridge to the north.[2][6] A low pressure system to the south of Fay produced wind shear and resulted in decreased convection on the southern half of the circulation, with the majority of convective activity located on the northern half.[7] Fay soon became disorganized which prompted National Hurricane Center forecaster Avila to state, \"[Fay] rather resembles a subtropical storm\".[8] Fay moved little, and intensified slightly late on September 6.[8][9] On September 7, Fay began to drift northwest towards the Texas coast as its rainbands reached the northwest portion of the Texas coastline.[10] Fay accelerated towards the Texas coast and made landfall early that day. The storm meandered throughout inland Texas, and as the system moved inland, forward speed decreased and Fay weakened to a tropical depression. The last advisory was issued on Fay later on the same day, and the storm degenerated into a remnant low on September 8, although the depression's remnants persisted for a few more days just inland of the Texas Coast.[3][11] On September 11, Fay's remnants dissipated to the northwest of Monterrey, Mexico.[1]"

In total, 400\u00a0houses sustained damage from flooding.[15][16]\nAlong the coast, a waterspout spawned by Fay made landfall, and caused minor damage along the northern end of Galveston Island.[17] Storm surge along the Texas coast was 4.5\u00a0feet (1.1\u00a0m) above the normal high tide.[18] Peak rainfall throughout the area was  in the range of 10-15\u00a0inches (250\u2013380\u00a0mm).[18] Severe damage resulted from Fay in Sweeny, where about 1,000\u00a0homes and businesses were damaged by the storm, and there was $3.5\u00a0million (2002\u00a0USD) in damage. Rainfall totals up to 24\u00a0inches (600\u00a0mm) caused severe flash flooding there, and in areas near there. Another area that received severe damage from Fay was Matagorda County, where flooding from the storm left $1.3\u00a0million (2002\u00a0USD) in damage to roads and public facilities. Twelve tornadoes were reported during Fay's landfall. The most notable one destroyed a mobile home, and damaged a barn.[1] Heavy rain from Fay's remnants also dropped 2\u20133\u00a0inches (50\u201375\u00a0mm) of rain over Frio County. Rainfall of 8\u00a0inches (200\u00a0mm) was reported near the Atascosca County line with an isolated report of 12\u00a0inches (300\u00a0mm) in other areas. The rainfall caused severe flashflooding which forced people to flee to roof tops. Damage to buildings, roads and crops totaled up to $800,000 (2002\u00a0USD).[19] In Mexico, effects were mostly related to rainfall. Up to 16\u00a0inches (400\u00a0mm) of rain fell in some areas.[14] When Fay flooded areas such as Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, 100\u00a0families were evacuated from their homes, and 120\u00a0people were stranded in hotels. It was reported that 10\u00a0trees fell in Nuevo Laredo, but causing little or no damage. Also, the Rio Grande flooded its banks to 3.3\u00a0meters (10\u00a0ft) above flood stage. 300\u00a0families were reported to be not able to return to their homes for several weeks as a result of the flooding.[20]"

        "content": " Tropical Storm Bill was a tropical cyclone that produced widespread rainfall across East Texas, Oklahoma, the Midwest, and Mid-Atlantic. The second named storm of the season, Bill developed from a broad area of low pressure over the northwestern Gulf of Mexico on June\u00a016. Because the system was already producing tropical storm force winds, it was immediately classified as Tropical Storm Bill. Initially continuing northwestward, Bill re-curved west-northwestward later on June\u00a016. Around 12:00\u00a0UTC, the storm peaked with maximum sustained winds of 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h). Just under five hours later, Bill made landfall near on Matagorda Island, Texas, at the same intensity. The cyclone weakened to a tropical depression and turned northward early on June\u00a017. Bill remained a tropical cyclone until late on June\u00a018, when it degenerated into a remnant low. The remnant low moved east-northeastward until dissipating over West Virginia on June\u00a021. The precursor to Bill produced widespread heavy rain in Central America. In Guatemala, flooding affected more than 100\u00a0homes while a landslide killed two people. Two others died in Honduras due to flooding with two more missing. Heavy rains fell across parts of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, with accumulations peaking at 13\u00a0in (330\u00a0mm) in Canc\u00fan, the highest daily total seen in the city in nearly two years. One person died from electrocution in the city. In Texas, flooding was exacerbated by record rainfall in some areas in May. A number of roads were inundated and several water rescues were required in Alice and San Antonio. Major traffic jams occurred in the Houston and Dallas areas. Coastal flooding left minor damage, mostly in Galveston and Matagorda counties. One death occurred when a boy was swept into a culvert. In Oklahoma, numerous roads were also inundated by water. Interstate 35 was closed near Turner Falls due to a rockslide and near Ardmore because of high water. There were two fatalities in Oklahoma, both from drowning. There was also flooding in several others states. Across the United States, Bill was responsible for approximately $100\u00a0million in damage.[1]"

        "content": "The National Hurricane Center\u00a0(NHC) first noted the potential of the formation of a tropical cyclone in the Gulf of Mexico during the mid-afternoon hours of June\u00a012. At the time, an upper-level trough was producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms over the northwestern Caribbean Sea, Belize, and the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. However, the NHC assessed a low probability as atmospheric conditions were assessed to be unfavorable in the Gulf of Mexico.[2] Moving northwestward, the system tracked over the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, and development chances increased as forecasts showed a more favorable environment within the Gulf of Mexico.[3] Early on June\u00a014, the trough began to interact with an upper-level low over the Gulf of Mexico, producing additional showers over portions of Central America.[4] Later that day, Hurricane Hunters aircraft reconnaissance began investigating the system, and discovered an ill-defined but intact and broad low-pressure area over the south-central Gulf of Mexico.[5] The system continued to possess an elongated circulation through June\u00a015,[6] but on June\u00a016, reconnaissance aircraft indicated that the storm had become sufficiently organized to be considered a tropical cyclone. As winds were already found to have met the threshold for a tropical storm, the NHC began issuing advisories on Tropical Storm Bill at 03:00\u00a0UTC that day, skipping the tropical depression classification.[7] Moving towards the west-northwest and already near the United States Gulf Coast, the NHC's official forecast at the time of Bill's formation indicated that the storm would not have much time to strengthen over water.[7] However, meteorologists Jeff Masters and Bob Henson of Weather Underground noted the possibility of Bill strengthening over land via the brown ocean effect due to floods in the previous month that helped saturate soils in Texas and Oklahoma.[8] The cyclone's organization remained steady as the storm approached the coast, with most of the convection taking place around the storm's eastern half, with rainbands primarily occupying the eastern and southern portions of Bill's circulation.[9] At 15:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a016, Bill reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 997\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.44\u00a0inHg) as the storm was located 15\u00a0mi (20\u00a0km) south of Port O'Connor, Texas.[10] At peak intensity, Bill made landfall on Matagorda Island at 16:45\u00a0UTC and began moving into inland Texas.[11] At 09:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a017, Bill was downgraded to tropical depression intensity, though it maintained an organized structure.[12] The next day, Bill had rapidly deteriorated as it moved northeastward. However, the system's strength slowly weakened. Operationally, it was announced that Bill stayed tropical throughout most of its lifetime, being declared a remnant low on June 20 by the WPC, however the NHC's post storm analysis revealed that Bill had degraded into a remnant low on June 18, while the storm was situated over Tulsa, Oklahoma. Bill's remnant low continued to move eastward for several more days, before being absorbed by another extratropical system on June 23."

A voluntary evacuation order was issued by the Galveston County Office of Emergency Management for people living on the Bolivar Peninsula.[18] The United States Coast Guard closed waterways from Matagorda Bay to Galveston Bay as the storm approached, prohibiting the use of small crafts. Ferry services were suspended due to rising tide levels.[19] Boat owners in Port Lavaca secured their boats to their docks.[20] Early on June\u00a017, Sealy's local police department warned locals to stay indoors due in response to heavy rain expected later in the day. A tornado watch was also issued by the Storm Prediction Center; the storm would spawn four tornadoes in the state. As the cyclone made landfall, both Palacios and Port O'Connor recorded peak wind gusts to 53\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h), while the storm tide rose to 3\u00a0ft (0.9\u00a0m) above normal in Port Lavaca.[21] Heavy rainfall accompanied Bill, with accumulations peaking at 11.77\u00a0in (298.96\u00a0mm) west of Ganado.[22] In Matagorda County a number of roads were closed in the Sargent area due to flooding. Water approached, but did not damage homes in the city of Matagorda. In Brazoria County, storm surge caused minor coastal flooding at San Luis Pass Park, Surfside Beach, and Treasure Island. Inland, precipitation led to overflowing of Chocolate and Halls bayous. Similarly, minor coastal flooding and erosion also occurred in Galveston County along the Bolivar Peninsula and on Galveston Island. In the towns on the western side of the island, waves deposited sand and other debris onto the streets. Two parking garages were damaged and two roads were closed due to coastal flooding at Jamaica Beach. In Harris County, minor storm surge and freshwater flooding was reported in Shoreacres, with the Taylor Bayou exceeding its banks. A number of low-lying roads in Chambers County also experienced light storm surge inundation. On June\u00a016, Highway 87 was closed from Gilchrist to Highway 124 due to debris.[23] Port Lavaca, the water level was reported to be 3\u00a0ft (0.91\u00a0m) above normal early in the day. In Sealy, power outages occurred and water rescues were necessitated as a result of flooding.[24] Rising water levels near Indianola forced the closure of several roads, preventing residents from returning.

A few vehicular accidents also occurred due to slick roads.[39] In Virginia, an EF0 tornado spawned near Bowling Green downed several trees and damaged a mobile home. Winds mainly knocked down power lines, trees, and branches in eastern Virginia, resulting in numerous road closures and damaging a shed in Sussex and several cars in Powhatan and Richmond.[31]  In Washington, D.C., the White House recorded 1.95\u00a0in (50\u00a0mm) of rain from the storm, while Reagan Washington National Airport set a record for June 20, 2.37\u00a0in (60\u00a0mm) of rain.[40] The storm dropped nearly 2\u00a0in (51\u00a0mm) of precipitation in York County, Pennsylvania. A very small mudslide collapsed a few walls of a home in York. The Yellow Breeches Creek near Camp Hill crested at 10.3\u00a0ft (3.1\u00a0m), which is more than 7\u00a0ft (2.1\u00a0m) above flood stage.[41] In Maryland, a tornado touched-down in Tuscarora, but caused no damage.

Rainfall led to flooding in low-lying areas, with 1\u00a0ft (0.30\u00a0m) of water left on roads in Point of Rocks. Fire crews in Frederick County rescued a few people and cars trapped in the floodwaters.[42] The remnants of Bill produced precipitation in many other portions of the Mid-Atlantic and New England regions.

The remnants of the storm moved ashore between Louisiana and Mississippi early on July\u00a025, prompting severe thunderstorm and tornado warnings in the area. The precursor to Bonnie produced considerable amounts of rainfall across the Greater Antilles, resulting in light to moderate flooding. In the Dominican Republic, hundreds of people were displaced, and several bridges collapsed over rushing waters. One person drowned after being swept away by a swollen river in Puerto Rico. Elsewhere, light amounts of rainfall was reported in Haiti, the Bahamas and Florida.

Although its cloud pattern remained disorganized\u2014with the circulation center disassociated from the deepest convection[11]\u2014a reconnaissance aircraft flight into the cyclone found that the winds had increased.[12] It was therefore upgraded to Tropical Storm Bonnie southeast of Nassau, Bahamas, about five hours after NHC initiated advisories on the system.[13] Around 2100 UTC, Bonnie moved over Ragged Island in the Bahamas with winds of 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h), and shortly thereafter it attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h).[2] Due to increasingly unfavorable conditions aloft, little change in intensity occurred during the following day as the storm accelerated toward Florida.[14] Though tropical storm-force winds prevailed, they were confined to a few rainbands to the north and east of the center at that time, with the deepest convection dislocated over southeast Florida.[15] On July 23 at 1430 UTC, the center of Bonnie made landfall near Elliott Key with winds of 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h).[2] Interaction with land caused the organization to deteriorate further,[16] and its corresponding convection quickly diminished. In addition, a second reconnaissance flight affirmed a lack of significant winds; it is estimated the cyclone lost tropical storm status around 1800 UTC that same day.[2][17] On the morning of July\u00a024, deep convection briefly redeveloped over the center as Bonnie emerged into the Gulf of Mexico. Despite the redevelopment, the storm subsequently entered a region of intense upper-level winds, causing associated convection to become sheared away rapidly.[18] Embedded within a well-established steering flow, Bonnie further degenerated to a tight swirl of low clouds, with no more than a few remaining patches of strong thunderstorms.[19] Subsequent satellite images confirmed Bonnie no longer maintained a definable structure; following the final advisory by the NHC, the system was pronounced dissipated while located about 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km) from the mouth of the Mississippi River.[20] The remnant low of Bonnie drifted west-northwestward before dissolving over southeast Louisiana on July\u00a025.[21]"

In Florida, a tropical storm watch was issued for Golden Beach northward to Jupiter Inlet, and included Lake Okeechobee. In addition, a tropical storm warning was issued from Golden Beach to Bonita Springs on the west coast of the state, and included the Florida Keys and Florida Bay.[2][22] By early July\u00a023, the tropical storm warning from Golden Beach to Bonita Springs was discontinued, while a tropical storm warning was issued from Englewood to Deerfield Beach, Florida. Six hours later, a tropical storm watch was put into effect for Destin, Florida to Morgan City, Louisiana; it was later upgraded to a tropical storm warning. Three hours later, the tropical storm watch from Deerfield Beach to Jupiter Inlet, Florida and all tropical storm warnings in the Bahamas were discontinued. All tropical storm watches and warnings had been discontinued by 1500\u00a0UTC July\u00a024, shortly before Bonnie dissipated.[2] Three cruise ships, Carnival Pride, Carnival Destiny, and Grandeur of the Seas had to alter their courses due to the presence of Bonnie.[23] Due to the threat of a tropical storm, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal declared a state of emergency on July\u00a022.[24] Along the Gulf Coast, concerns arose regarding the potential effects of the storm on the BP oil spill earlier in the year. Due to risk of intoxicated storm surge, authorities prepared for possible evacuations of low-lying areas along coastlines.[25] On July\u00a023, Admiral Thad Allen ordered the oil spill site to be evacuated, as Bonnie posed a safety threat to nearly 2,000 people in that area. The ships and vessels in the area began preparation for evacuation on July\u00a024. Closer to shore, approximately 1,300 fishing boats laying boom had to evacuate.[26]"

Tropical storm-force winds were recorded in several areas, although sustained winds of over 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h) were confined to Virginia Key. Rainfall was also minimal, with a maximum of 3.25\u00a0in (83\u00a0mm) falling in northern Miami-Dade County.[31] Overall, monetary losses as a result of the storm in Florida amounted to $2,000 (2010\u00a0USD).[31] In Pinellas County, one person was hospitalized after being struck by lightning at Fred Howard Park on July\u00a024.[32] On July\u00a025, the remnants of Bonnie brought torrential rainfall to parts of Louisiana. In a 90-minute span, between 8 and 9\u00a0in (200 and 230\u00a0mm) of rain fell in West Baton Rouge Parish. About 110 homes were flooded throughout the parish, resulting in $500,000 (2010\u00a0USD) losses.[33] Along Highway 15, 2\u00a0ft (0.61\u00a0m) of water was reported to have covered the road.[34] In Washington Parish, more than 20 bridges and roads were washed out by flash flooding, the losses is about $200,000 (2010 USD).[35] Strong thunderstorms associated with the system also produced strong winds, estimated up to 69\u00a0mph (111\u00a0km/h), which downed several trees, leading to $6,000 (2010 USD) losses.[36] A second day of severe weather on July\u00a026 brought hurricane-force wind gusts to portions of Vernon Parish; two chicken houses were destroyed by the winds, killing 22,000 chickens. Losses from the winds were estimated at $310,000 (2010\u00a0USD).[37] After moving through Louisiana, Bonnie's remnants brought heavy rain to parts of Texas. In Hidalgo County, U.S. Route 69 was reportedly covered with high water.[38] Further inland, moisture from Bonnie combined with a cold front to produce widespread thunderstorms over Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee. In Arkansas, lightning from a severe thunderstorm knocked out power to much of the city of Rison after striking a transformer.[39] Significant wind damage took place in Dallas County where awnings were blown off homes, structures sustained roof damage, and trees were felled.[40] Heavy rains also triggered localized flash flooding, covering several highways.[41] Throughout the state, storm damage was estimated at $344,000 (2010\u00a0USD).[42]"

The adjusted economic impact was not as great as subsequent floods because of the small population in the region at the time. The flood devastation was particularly widespread since the region had few levees at the time, so the waters were able to spread far from the normal banks. Among the hardest hit in terms of mortality were the Wyandot Indians, who lost 100 people in the diseases that occurred after the flood in the vicinity of today's Kansas City, Kansas. The flood formed a large sandbar in front of the Wayne City Landing at Independence, Missouri, causing settlers to go further west to Westport Landing in Kansas City, which resulted in significant local economic and cultural impact.[1] Independence had been the trailhead for several key emigrant trails, prior to 1846, both the Santa Fe Trail and one alternative eastern starting branch of the Oregon Trail. After the Mexican\u2013American War treaty of 1848, the Oregon Trail's trailhead became a trailhead of the California Trail and an alternative beginning for the Mormon Trail. In 1850, the United States Congress passed the Swamp Land Act providing land grants to build stronger levees. The flood is the highest recorded for the Mississippi River at St. Louis. The discharge was 1,300,000 cubic feet per second (37,000\u00a0m3/s) in 1844, while  782,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s (22,100\u00a0m3/s) in 1951 and 1,030,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s (29,000\u00a0m3/s) in 1993."

The creek overflowed, flooding Hays (the location of Fort Hays State University) to a depth of 4 feet (1.2\u00a0m) in most locations inhabited by the students on campus, necessitating a midnight evacuation of the barracks by families on the G.I. Bill and dorms to the Stadium's third floor, which was still dry. Dr. Charles F. Wiest,  Professor of Philosophy and Religion, and his seven-year-old daughter perished when their home caved in under the weight of the water while he was attempting to save prized texts in his basement. All records at the college were ruined and no graduation was held on the appointed date of May 23. Graduates were mailed their diplomas one month later. At the time, there were no warning sirens in Hays.  Two police officers drove the low riding streets with their sirens blaring, shouting to evacuate.  They are credited with saving many lives. The flooding continued into June 1951 with heavy rains. The flooding reached its zenith when between 8 and 16 inches (410\u00a0mm) fell on the region between July 9 and July 13.  The flood levels reached their highest point since the Great Flood of 1844 and Flood of 1903.  July 13 experienced the single highest levels of flood, leading to the greatest destruction by flood in the Midwest as of then. The specific flood-levels are not accurately known for the Kansas River, as the water crested above all official flood gauges.  However, between Manhattan and Bonner Springs flood levels were between 4 feet (1.2\u00a0m) and 6 feet (1.8\u00a0m) above all previous records.  The Marais Des Cygnes River, Verdigris River, and Neosho River crested more than 9 feet (2.7\u00a0m) above previous records. The heaviest initial damage by the flood crest was to Manhattan and Fort Riley.  Barracks at the Fort were destroyed, and in Manhattan the downtown business district was deluged under 8 feet (2.4\u00a0m) of water and two people were killed.[2] Then, Topeka and Lawrence were damaged by the same crest. Approximately 24,000 people were evacuated from Topeka. In the Kansas City Metropolitan Area, the flood began running over the top of the levees protecting the Argentine and Armourdale areas, resulting in the evacuation of 15,000 people. Water reached the rooftops of houses in Armourdale. The flood devastated the Kansas City Stockyards in the West Bottoms at the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri Rivers.  The Stockyards never fully recovered. The flood destroyed the TWA overhaul base at Fairfax Airport in Kansas City, Kansas prompting the city of Kansas City, Missouri, to relocate TWA to a new airport in Platte County, Missouri that later became Kansas City International Airport. On July 13, a total of 1,074,000 acres (4,350\u00a0km2) in Kansas and 926,000 acres (3,750\u00a0km2) in Missouri were flooded. The crest continued downstream passing through Boonville, Missouri on July 17, Jefferson City, Missouri on July 18, Hermann, Missouri on July 19, and St. Charles, Missouri on July 20, resulting in further flooding. On July 17, President Harry Truman toured the damage by airplane, as far west as Manhattan, and declared the disaster \"one of the worst this country has ever suffered from water\".[3]"

This new network of flood control structures helped to prevent widespread damage when the region was hit by the Great Flood of 1993. Prior to the flood, five federal flood control dams were operating in the Kansas River basin: Bonny Dam in Colorado, Enders Dam and Medicine Creek Dam in Nebraska, and Cedar Bluff Dam and Kanopolis Dam in Kansas. Several others had been planned by the United States Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation, both authorized by the Flood Control Act of 1944. Since then, many dams have been constructed with a total of eighteen dams controlling the flow of the Kansas River, such as Webster Dam and Kirwin Dam on tributaries of the Solomon River in Kansas.  Many other reservoirs and levees were built in other nearby basins, which were also built as part of the response to this flood. This includes the Osage River basin above the Lake of the Ozarks. North Lawrence has a building shaped like a teepee, with a mark on the side indicating the water height of 7 feet (2.1\u00a0m) around the building.[4] In 2011, the painting Flood Disaster by Thomas Hart Benton was sold for $1.9 million in an auction at Sotheby's in New York City.

Here is a comparison of the three big floods since the early 19th century. The Great Flood of 1844 was the biggest flood of the three in terms of rate of discharge at Westport Landing in Kansas City.  It is estimated that 625,000 cubic feet per second (17,700\u00a0m3/s) was discharged in the flood. On July 16, 1844, the crest was almost one foot lower than the 1993 flood. The Great Flood of 1951 was the second biggest in rate of discharge at 573,000 cubic feet per second (16,200\u00a0m3/s). The 1951 crest on July 14, 1951, was almost 2 feet (0.61\u00a0m) lower than the 1844 flood and 3 feet (0.91\u00a0m) lower than 1993.  However, the flood was the most devastating of all modern floods for Kansas City because its levee system was not built to withstand it.  It destroyed the city's stockyards and forced the building of an airport away from the Missouri River bottoms. In the Missouri River Flood of 1952 in the following year, flooding just upstream on the Missouri River caused the Rosecrans Memorial Airport to be cut off from the City of St. Joseph, Missouri.  This was part of a larger series of floods affecting the entire Missouri River basin.[7] The Great Flood of 1993 was the highest of any of the three but had the lowest rate of discharge at 541,000 cubic feet per second (15,300\u00a0m3/s). Though the 1993 flood had devastating impacts elsewhere, Kansas City survived it relatively well because of levee improvements after the 1951 flood."

Most of the northern half of the country was under a dome of very cold air which was triggered by a weak Alberta clipper and associated front that crossed the continent prior to the storm and which brought significant lake-effect snows across the Great Lakes on November 29 and 30. The newly formed storm then moved across the central parts of North America from Colorado to the Great Lakes bringing significant snows from the Dakotas to northern Ontario as well as in the mountain regions of New Mexico and Colorado. The storm was expected to strengthen as it approached the Atlantic Coast on December 3 and affected New England, Quebec, eastern Ontario and the Canadian Maritimes with a major winter storm, primarily snow, with some mixing in the southernmost areas. On December 5, the storm departed Newfoundland and Labrador, an area that was previously hit with a powerful storm which caused extensive power outages. After the passage of the storm, more cold air was funneled across most of the eastern half of the country where additional lake-effect snows occurred for portions of Upper Michigan, New York state and south-central Ontario."

The storm produced a wintry mix across much of the region, including significant icing due to freezing rain of up to three-quarters of an inch (near 20\u00a0mm) thick locally in Iowa and Nebraska.[8] Icing on the runways shut down Des Moines International Airport for several hours, after an American Airlines flight with 44 passengers skidded off a taxiway.[9]  Several events were also canceled throughout the day across much of the area. In Iowa, several presidential campaigns were forced to cancel events, including a rally near Des Moines by Bill Clinton for his wife, presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton, as well as three campaign stops planned by presidential hopeful Mitt Romney in southern Iowa.[6] Most areas of Iowa saw about a half an inch of ice, with isolated reports as high as 2 inches (51\u00a0mm).[10] The storm knocked out power to as much as 65,000 customers in Iowa, according to MidAmerican.[11] The storm moved into Illinois and Wisconsin in the afternoon of December 1. An inch or two of snow fell in many areas, before a wintry mix of icy precipitation (up to a half-inch of ice accumulation)[12] made things even more treacherous. Numerous highway accidents were reported, resulting in three deaths in Wisconsin and one in Illinois, as well as numerous injuries.[6][13] In addition, a Mesa Airlines plane with 25 passengers slid off the runway at Dane County Regional Airport in Madison, but no injuries were reported.[14] 400 flights were canceled at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, 28 at Midway International Airport and dozens more at Milwaukee's General Mitchell International Airport.[13][15] At the height of the storm, 140,000 customers were without power in Illinois, due to the storm.[16] In Madison, the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison\u2019s Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences department postponed its annual Solstice Party.[17] The storm also affected parts of Michigan, where three traffic deaths were reported,[18][19] and Indiana, where one member of the Purdue University ice hockey team was killed and seven others were injured when the team van overturned 20 miles (32\u00a0km) southwest of Lafayette.[20] Nearly 8 inches (200\u00a0mm) fell over parts of Lower Michigan (with higher amount towards the Upper Peninsula) along with one-quarter of an inch of ice.[21] Farther north, portions of North Dakota, Minnesota, northern Wisconsin, and northern Michigan received between 6 and 12\u00a0inches of snow. Twenty inches (fifty-one centimetres) of snow fell in Grand Marais on the north shore of Lake Superior, and a December 1st record of 10.3 inches (260\u00a0mm) was reported at Duluth. In the Twin Cities metropolitan area, 4 to 8 inches (20\u00a0cm) were reported across the area. Snow emergencies were declared for both Minneapolis and St. Paul.[22] The Minnesota State Patrol reported 338 accidents, but no fatalities.[23] In North Dakota, numerous traffic accidents were reported,[24] including one fatality.[25]"

Over northern Ontario, the town of Marathon received as much as 50\u00a0cm (19.5\u00a0in) while Thunder Bay received over 1\u00a0ft (30\u00a0cm).[33][34] Ontario Provincial Police had reported over 200 accidents before Sunday afternoon alone across southern Ontario and a total of nearly 500 province-wide. Greyhound, GO and Via Rail service experienced delays of nearly one hour[35] while several flights from Toronto's Pearson International Airport were canceled. During the overnight of December 2 to December 3, a large zone of precipitation across the Ohio Valley moved across the Great Lakes and into eastern Ontario and southern Quebec where 12 to 14 inches (30 to 36 centimetres) fell over the cities of Montreal and Ottawa[36][37] in 12 hours with freezing rain along the north shores of Lake Ontario. London received 60\u00a0cm (23.5\u00a0in) from the storm proper, followed by several days of unrelenting snowsqualls.[38] The snow amounts broke records for most snow for the day of December 3. The old one was set in 1991 when about 6\u00a0inches fell over both regions. It was also the third biggest fall snowstorm in Montreal behind December 16, 2005 and November 30, 1944.[39] For Ottawa, it was the biggest snowfall since nearly 14 inches (36\u00a0cm) fell on February 23, 2003, but fell well short of its all-time snowfall record of 29 inches (74\u00a0cm) set on March 2\u20133, 1947.[34][40] In Quebec City, the 16 inches (41\u00a0cm) received in 24 hours were 4 centimeters short of its worst in such a period, the record being the same date as Montreal's worst 24-hour snowfall, March 4, 1971.[41] General accumulations in Quebec and northeastern Ontario were between 8 and 16 inches (20 and 41 centimetres) from the Timmins region to east of Quebec City. Numerous schools were closed across western Quebec including all schools in the Gatineau area while all school transportation was cancelled across Ottawa and Eastern Ontario. OC Transpo's articulated bus fleet experienced similar problems as during the Winter Storm of December 2005 when some buses jackknifed or were stuck in the snow in many areas across the city, although the problem was less severe than in 2005. That incident however involved similar accumulations of about one foot.[34] Numerous flights from Macdonald\u2013Cartier International Airport and Pierre-Elliott Trudeau International Airport (133 flights) were canceled.[42][43][44] The storm was blamed for three deaths in Quebec including two in car accidents on Quebec Route 153 near Yamachiche and Quebec Autoroute 955 near Victoriaville.[45] One day later, in the aftermath of the storm, a third person died in Val-des-Monts when a temporary garage structure collapsed and trapped the victim under a heavy load of snow that was in process of being removed.[46][47] As the storm redeveloped off the Atlantic Coast on December 3 and 4, it gave another round of heavy and mixed precipitation for New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia. Areas of northern and eastern New Brunswick received over a foot of snow, causing the city of Moncton to shut down all services, while several flights from airports in Moncton, Saint John, Fredericton and Halifax were cancelled. In Fredericton, a unique phenomenon consisting of blowing and heavy snow along with winds produced several giant snowballs, called snowrollers, across several front lawns.[48] About 24,000 homes in New Brunswick,[49] 8,000 in Nova Scotia,[50] and 14,500 in Prince Edward Island[51] were without power due to the snow, mixing and strong winds."

        "content": "The Great Lakes region has experienced the remnants of several hurricanes, most commonly those which originally made U.S. landfall along the Gulf of Mexico.[2] Very few such storms have retained any tropical characteristics by the time they reached the Great Lakes. In general, the strongest of these storms resulted from interactions between a hurricane remnant and an extratropical weather system. Only two such storms had hurricane-force winds over the Great Lakes.[2][4][5] After merging with a strong cold front, the remnant of the 1941 Texas hurricane had hurricane-force winds over Lake Huron and Lake Ontario, with steady winds of 56 miles per hour (90\u00a0km/h) reported over Detroit.[2] Half of the resulting deaths occurred in Toronto, and many injuries resulted from windows blown out in Detroit.[2][4] Although the center of the storm was tracked over Chicago and other highly populated areas, no other inland region reported similar damage. Similar to the 1996 Lake Huron cyclone, the 1941 hurricane tracked over the Great Lakes in September, when the lakes are at their warmest.[2] Hurricane Hazel entered the Great Lakes region as an extratropical storm just west of Toronto. The storm had lost most of its intensity after tracking over 600 miles (970\u00a0km) inland. However, the remnant interacted with a trough just south of Lake Erie, resulting in explosive strengthening as it entered the Great Lakes region.[5] Hurricane Hazel was an October storm with winds equivalent to a Category 1 hurricane by the time it reached Canada, but most of its damage was caused by extreme rainfall on already-saturated ground.[5] Despite not having hurricane-force winds, Hurricane Connie of 1955 is also notable as it is one of very few storms to make a tropical landfall in the Great Lakes as well. In contrast, the 1996 Lake Huron cyclone developed tropical characteristics over the Great Lakes region completely independent of precursor tropical cyclones. This makes it unique among Great Lakes storms."

        "content": "On September 11, 1996, a weak low-pressure area was situated close to Lake Superior,[6] as well as a shortwave trough over Ontario. The storm was centered over Lake Michigan, and its central pressure was 1012\u00a0mbar (29.9\u00a0inHg). The northwest tilt of the low in the atmosphere indicated that the surface center was strengthening, due to baroclinic forcing. In addition to this, analyses of the atmosphere concluded that the cyclone's circulation extended into the upper troposphere.[6] The cyclone's overall strength increased dramatically while meandering over the Great Lakes, with surface sustained winds building from 11 to 67\u00a0mph (18 to 108\u00a0km/h).[6][nb 1] By September 12, the cyclone had been steered by a cold front to a position over Lake Huron, with the cyclone's upper-level circulation centered to the west, over Michigan. During this 24-hour period, the cyclone's central pressure fell from 1012 to 1006\u00a0mbar (29.9 to 29.7\u00a0inHg). After 12:00\u00a0UTC on September 12, the low moved southeastward and became more vertically organized.[6] The cyclone briefly passed over Lake Huron as it proceeded southeastward. The cyclone's lower levels experienced the highest intensification. As the cyclone's component layers were well-stacked, the storm was ripe for development. Eventually, the cold front to the north, which was connected to the surface low, became an occluded front, as it entangled with the surface warm front. The occluded front extended from Lake Huron to Pennsylvania on September 13. A 155-mile (250\u00a0km) swath of showers and thunderstorms was positioned across the area. More showers were centered near the occluded low.[6] Between 12:00\u00a0UTC on September 13 and 00:00\u00a0UTC on September 14, a shortwave trough rotated throughout the area of the occluded front. This caused the mid-level portion of the cyclone to move eastward, centering itself just east of Lake Huron.[6] During the same period, the surface circulation of the storm moved slowly over Lake Huron, beginning to align with the mid-level circulation, and deepened to 999\u00a0mbar (29.5\u00a0inHg). In response to this intensification, the maximum sustained winds of the storm increased as well. After 00:00\u00a0UTC on September 14, the lower-level and mid-level circulations of the cyclone moved westward, becoming vertically stacked again. In contrast to the earlier developments, the baroclinic processes of the system weakened rapidly, and the system became more shallow. However, the low-level circulation of the cyclone continued to intensify, and the storm's central pressure dropped to 992\u00a0mbar (29.3\u00a0inHg), as the storm reached its peak intensity,[6] due to increased circulation. At the time of its peak intensity, the cyclone had maximum sustained winds of 73 miles per hour (117\u00a0km/h), equivalent to that of a high-end tropical storm, and on the threshold of a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale (SSHWS).[7] Between 12:00\u00a0UTC on September 14 and 00:00\u00a0UTC on September 15, visible satellite imagery of the cyclone revealed that it resembled subtropical cyclone, as it possessed multiple characteristics of a tropical cyclone while also possessing hybrid characteristics, with an eye-like feature about 19 miles (30\u00a0km) wide.[6][3] In addition to the eye, convective clouds had also formed, creating an eyewall resembling that seen in tropical cyclones.[2] Furthermore, bands of convection continued extending westward about 310 miles (500\u00a0km). Soon afterward, prevailing winds in the area shifted to the east-northeast and rapidly increased, shearing the system, causing it to weaken. In contrast to the earlier stages of the system's life, the system was now much shallower and harbored energy closer to the surface. Surface analysis indicated that the cyclone had multiple central circulations at the time, with a weaker cyclonic circulation persisting over the eastern shore of Lake Huron and another center north of Lake Ontario.[6] During this 12-hour period, the cyclone decayed rapidly, mainly in the lower troposphere. Twelve-hour height rises also occurred in the structure of the cyclone, with the air pressure increasing at various layers of the cyclone, ranging from 197 feet (60\u00a0m) at the surface level to 66 feet (20\u00a0m) at the 300\u00a0mbar (8.9\u00a0inHg)-level. On September 15, the cyclone weakened into a remnant low and left Lake Huron, before dissipating soon afterward. High waves were also created by the storm in Lake Erie.[6]"

        "content": " Sarawak (/s\u0259\u02c8r\u0251\u02d0w\u0252k/ s\u0259-RAH-wok, Malay: [sa\u02c8rawa\u0294]) is a state[18][19] of Malaysia. The largest among the 13 states, with an area almost equal to that of Peninsular Malaysia, Sarawak is located in East Malaysia in northwest Borneo, and is bordered by the Malaysian state of Sabah to the northeast, Kalimantan (the Indonesian portion of Borneo) to the south, and Brunei in the north. The state capital, Kuching, is the largest city in Sarawak, the economic centre of the state, and the seat of the Sarawak state government. Other cities and towns in Sarawak include Miri, Sibu, and Bintulu. As of the 2020 Malaysia census, the population of Sarawak was 2.453 million.[9] Sarawak has an equatorial climate with tropical rainforests and abundant animal and plant species. It has several prominent cave systems at Gunung Mulu National Park. Rajang River is the longest river in Malaysia; Bakun Dam, one of the largest dams in Southeast Asia, is located on one of its tributaries, the Balui River. Mount Murud is the highest point in the state. Sarawak is the only state of Malaysia with a Christian majority.[20] The earliest known human settlement in Sarawak at the Niah Caves dates back 40,000 years. A series of Chinese ceramics dated from the 8th to 13th century AD was uncovered at the archaeological site of Santubong. The coastal regions of Sarawak came under the influence of the Bruneian Empire in the 16th century. In 1839, James Brooke, a British explorer, arrived in Sarawak. He, and his descendants, governed the state from 1841 to 1946. During World War II, it was occupied by the Japanese for three years. After the war, the last White Rajah, Charles Vyner Brooke, ceded Sarawak to Britain, and in 1946 it became a British Crown Colony. On 22 July 1963, Sarawak was granted self-government by the British and subsequently became one of the founding members of Malaysia, established on 16 September 1963. However, the federation was opposed by Indonesia, leading to a three-year confrontation. The creation of Malaysia also prompted a communist insurgency that lasted until 1990. The head of state is the governor, also known as the Yang di-Pertua Negeri, while the head of government is the premier. Sarawak is divided into administrative divisions and districts, governed by a system that is closely modelled on the Westminster parliamentary system and was the earliest state legislature system in Malaysia. Under the Malaysian constitution, Sarawak has greater autonomy than the states in Peninsular Malaysia. Because of its natural resources, Sarawak specialises in the export of oil and gas, timber and palm oil, but also possesses strong manufacturing, energy and tourism sectors. It is ethnically, culturally, religiously and linguistically diverse; ethnic groups including Iban, Chinese, Malay, Bidayuh, Melanau, Orang Ulu, Indian, Eurasian and Kedayan.[21] English and Malay are the two official languages of the state;[22][23] there is no official religion.[24][25]"

        "content": "The generally-accepted explanation of the state's name is that it is derived from the Sarawak Malay word Serawak or Cerava by Portuguese cartographers in the 16th century, which means antimony.[26] A popular alternative explanation is that it is a contraction of the four Malay words purportedly uttered by Pangeran Muda Hashim (uncle to the Sultan of Brunei), \"Saya serah pada awak\" (I surrender it to you), when he gave Sarawak to James Brooke, an English explorer, in 1841.[26] However, the latter explanation is incorrect: the territory had been named Sarawak before the arrival of James Brooke, and the word awak was not in the vocabulary of Sarawak Malay before the formation of Malaysia.[27] Sarawak is nicknamed \"Land of the Hornbills\" (Bumi Kenyalang). These birds are important cultural symbols for the Dayak people, representing the spirit of God. It is also believed that if a hornbill is seen flying over residences, it will bring good luck to the local community. Sarawak has eight of the world's fifty-four species of hornbills, and the Rhinoceros hornbill is the state bird of Sarawak.[28]"

        "content": "Foragers are known to have lived around the west mouth of the Niah Caves (located 110\u00a0km (68\u00a0mi) southwest of Miri) 40,000 years ago.[29][30] A modern human skull found near the Niah Caves is the oldest human remain found in Malaysia and the oldest modern human skull from Southeast Asia.[29][30][31][32] Chinese ceramics dating to the Tang and Song dynasties (8th to 13th century AD, respectively) found at Santubong (near Kuching) hint at its significance as a seaport.[33] One of the earliest Chinese records of an independent kingdom in Borneo is the 977 AD letter to the Chinese emperor from the ruler of Boni, which some scholars believe to refer to Borneo.[34] The Bruneians regained their independence from Srivijaya due to the onset of a Javanese-Sumatran war.[35] In 1225, the Chinese official Zhao Rukuo reported that Boni had 100 warships to protect its trade, and that there was great wealth in the kingdom.[36] Marco Polo suggested in his memoirs that the Great Khan or the ruler of the Mongol Empire, attempted and failed many times in invading \"Great Java\" which was the European name for Bruneian controlled Borneo.[37][additional citation(s) needed] In the 1300s the Chinese annals, Nanhai zhi, reported that Brunei invaded or administered Sarawak and Sabah as well as the Philippine kingdoms of Butuan, Sulu, Ma-i (Mindoro), Malilu \u9ebb\u88cf\u8606 (present-day Manila), Shahuchong \u6c99\u80e1\u91cd (present-day Siocon), Yachen \u555e\u9673 (Oton), and \u6587\u675c\u9675 Wenduling (present-day Mindanao),[38] which would regain their independence at a later date.[39] In the 14th century, the Javanese manuscript Nagarakretagama, written by Prapanca in 1365, mentioned Barune as the constituent state of Hindu Majapahit,[40] which had to make an annual tribute of forty katis of camphor. In 1369, Sulu which was also formerly part of Majapahit, successfully rebelled and then attacked Boni, and had invaded the Northeast Coast of Borneo[41] and afterwards had looted the capital of its treasure and gold including sacking two sacred pearls. A fleet from Majapahit succeeded in driving away the Sulus, but Boni was left weaker after the attack.[42] A Chinese report from 1371 described Boni as poor and totally controlled by Majapahit.[43] The Bruneian Empire was established in the coastal regions of Sarawak by the mid-15th century,[44] and the Kuching area was known to Portuguese cartographers during the 16th century as Cerava, one of the five great seaports of Borneo.[45][46] The Sultanate of Sarawak was established during this time and lasted for almost half a century before being reunited with Brunei in 1641.[47][48] By the early 19th century, the Bruneian Empire was in decline, retaining only a tenuous hold on the coastal regions of Sarawak which were otherwise controlled by semi-independent Malay leaders. Away from the coast, territorial wars were fought between the Iban and a Kenyah-Kayan alliance.[49] The discovery of antimony ore in the Kuching region led Pengiran Indera Mahkota, a representative of the Sultan of Brunei, to increase development in the territory between 1824 and 1830. Increasing antimony production in the region led the Brunei Sultanate to demand higher taxes, which ultimately led to civil unrest.[50] In 1839, Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin II (1827\u20131852) assigned his uncle Pengiran Muda Hashim the task of restoring order but his inability to do so caused him to request the aid of British sailor James Brooke. Brooke's success in quelling the revolt was rewarded with antimony, property and the governorship of Sarawak, which at that time consisted only of a small area centred on Kuching.[51][52] The Brooke family, later called the White Rajahs, set about expanding the territory they had been ceded.[53] With expansion came the need for efficient governance and thus, beginning in 1841, Sarawak was separated into the first of its administrative divisions[54] and the Sarawak dollar, entered circulation in 1858.[55] By 1912, a total of five divisions had been established in Sarawak, each headed by a Resident.[54] The Brooke family generally practised a paternalistic form of government with minimal bureaucracy, but were pressured to establish some form of legal framework. Since they were unfamiliar with local customs, the Brooke government created an advisory Supreme Council, mostly consisting of Malay chiefs. This council is the oldest state legislative assembly in Malaysia, with the first general council meeting taking place at Bintulu in 1867.[56] In 1928, a judicial commissioner, Thomas Stirling Boyd, was appointed as the first legally trained judge. A similar system relating to matters concerning various Chinese communities was also formed.[57] Members of the local community were encouraged by the Brooke regime to focus on particular functions within the territory; the Ibans and other Dayak people were hired as militia while Malays were primarily administrators. Chinese, both local and immigrant, were mostly employed in plantations,[58] mines and as bureaucrats.[57] Expanding trade led to the formation of the Borneo Company Limited in 1856. The company was involved in a wide range of businesses in Sarawak including trade, banking, agriculture, mineral exploration, and development.[59] Between 1853 and 1862, there were a number of uprisings against the Brooke government but all were successfully contained with the aid of local tribes.[57] To guard against future uprisings, a series of forts were constructed to protect Kuching, including Fort Margherita, completed in 1871. By that time Brooke's control of Sarawak was such that defences were largely unnecessary.[60] Charles Anthoni Brooke succeeded his uncle as White Rajah in 1868. Under his rule, Sarawak gained Limbang and the Baram and Trusan valleys from the Sultan of Brunei, later becoming a protectorate in 1888 with Britain handling foreign affairs but the Brooke government retaining administrative powers.[61] Domestically, Brooke established the Sarawak Museum \u2013 the oldest museum in Borneo \u2013 in 1891,[60][62] and brokered a peace in Marudi by ending intertribal wars there. Economic development continued, with oil wells being drilled from 1910 and the Brooke Dockyard opening two years later. Anthony Brooke, who would become Rajah Muda (heir apparent) in 1939.[63] A centenary celebration of Brooke rule in Sarawak was held in 1941. During the celebration, a new constitution was introduced that would limit the power of the rajah and grant the Sarawak people a greater role in running the government. However, this constitution was never fully implemented due to the Japanese occupation.[64][57][note 1] That same year saw the British withdrawing its air and marine forces defending Sarawak to Singapore. With Sarawak now unguarded, the Brooke regime adopted a scorched earth policy where oil installations in Miri were to be destroyed and the Kuching airfield held as long as possible before being destroyed. A Japanese invasion force led by Kiyotake Kawaguchi landed in Miri on 16 December 1941 and captured Kuching on 24 December 1941, with British ground forces retreating to Singkawang in neighbouring Dutch Borneo. The Allied forces surrendered on 1 April 1942 after ten weeks of fighting there.[65] Charles Vyner Brooke, the last Rajah of Sarawak, had already left for Sydney, Australia; his officers were captured by the Japanese and interned at the Batu Lintang camp.[66] Sarawak remained part of the Empire of Japan for three years and eight months. During this time it was divided into three provinces \u2013 Kuching-shu, Sibu-shu, and Miri-shu \u2013 each under their respective Provincial Governor. The Japanese otherwise preserved the Brooke administrative structure and appointed Japanese people to important government positions.[67] Allied forces later carried out Operation Semut to sabotage Japanese operations in Sarawak.[68] During the Battle of North Borneo, the Australian forces landed at Lutong-Miri area on 20 June 1945 and penetrated as far as Marudi and Limbang before halting their operations in Sarawak.[69] After the surrender of Japan, the Japanese surrendered to the Australian forces at Labuan on 10 September 1945.[70][71] The following day, the Japanese forces at Kuching surrendered, and the Batu Lintang camp was liberated.[72] Sarawak was immediately placed under British Military Administration and managed by the Australian Imperial Force until April 1946.[73][74] Lacking the resources to rebuild Sarawak after the war, Charles Vyner Brooke decided to cede Sarawak as British Crown Colony[75] and a cession bill was put forth in the Council Negri (now Sarawak State Legislative Assembly), which was debated for three days. The bill passed on 17 May 1946 with 19 votes to 16.[76] Hundreds of Malay civil servants resigned in protest, sparking an anti-cession movement and the assassination of the second colonial governor of Sarawak, Sir Duncan Stewart.[77] Despite the resistance, Sarawak became a British Crown colony on 1 July 1946.[3] Anthony Brooke opposed the cession of Sarawak to the British Crown,[78] for which he was banished from Sarawak by the colonial government.[57][note 2] He was only allowed to return 17 years later after Sarawak had become part of Malaysia.[79] In 1950 all anti-cession movements in Sarawak ceased after a clamp-down by the colonial government.[49] On 27 May 1961, Tunku Abdul Rahman, the prime minister of the Federation of Malaya, announced a plan to form a greater federation together with Singapore, Sarawak, North Borneo and Brunei, to be called Malaysia. On 17 January 1962, the Cobbold Commission was formed to gauge the support of Sarawak and Sabah for the plan; the Commission reported 80 per cent support for federation.[80][81] On 23 October 1962, five political parties in Sarawak formed a united front that supported the formation of Malaysia.[82] Sarawak was officially granted self-government on 22 July 1963,[3][4] and federated with Malaya, North Borneo (now Sabah), and Singapore to form the Federation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963.[83][84] The governments of the Philippines and Indonesia opposed the new federation, as did the Brunei People's Party and Sarawak-based communist groups, and in 1962, the Brunei Revolt broke out.[85] Indonesian president Sukarno responded by deploying armed volunteers and, later, military forces into Sarawak.[86][87] Thousands of Sarawak communist members went to Kalimantan, Indonesian Borneo, and underwent training with the Communist Party of Indonesia. The most significant engagement of the confrontation was fought at Plaman Mapu in April 1965. The defeat at Plaman Mapu ultimately resulted in the fall of Sukarno and his replacement with Suharto as President of Indonesia.[88] Negotiations were restarted between Malaysia and Indonesia and led to the end of the confrontation on 11 August 1966.[89][note 3] A number of communist groups existed in Sarawak, the first of which, the Sarawak Overseas Chinese Democratic Youth League, formed in 1951.[49][note 4] Another group, the North Kalimantan Communist Party (NKCP, also known as Clandestine Communist Organisation (CCO) by government sources) was formally set up in 1970.[90] Weng Min Chyuan and Bong Kee Chok were two of the more notable communist leaders involved in the insurgency. As the political scene changed, it grew progressively more difficult for the communists to operate. This led to Bong opening talks with chief minister Abdul Rahman Ya'kub in 1973 and eventually signing an agreement with the government. Weng, who had moved to China in the mid-1960s but nonetheless retained control of the CCO, pushed for a continued armed insurrection against the government in spite of this agreement. The conflict continued mostly in the Rajang Delta region but eventually ended when, on 17 October 1990, the NKCP signed a peace agreement with the Government of Sarawak.[91][92]"

        "content": "The head of the Sarawak state is the Yang di-Pertua Negeri (also known as TYT or Governor), a largely symbolic position appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (King of Malaysia) on the advice of the Malaysian federal government.[94] The position has been held by Wan Junaidi Tuanku Jaafar since 2024.[95] The TYT appoints the Premier, currently held by Abang Johari Openg (GPS),[96] as the head of government. Generally, the leader of the party that commands the majority of the state Legislative Assembly is appointed as the chief minister; democratically elected representatives are known as state assemblymen. The state assembly passes laws on subjects that are not under the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Malaysia such as land administration, employment, forests, immigration, merchant shipping and fisheries. The state government is constituted by the premier, the cabinet ministers and their deputy ministers.[97] To protect the interests of the Sarawakians in the Malaysian federation, special safeguards have been included in the Constitution of Malaysia. These include: control over immigration in and out of the state as well as the residence status of non-Sarawakians and Sabahans, limitations on the practice of law to resident lawyers, independence of the Sarawak High Court from the High Court Peninsular Malaysia, a requirement that the Sarawak Chief Minister be consulted prior to the appointment of the chief judge of the Sarawak High Court, the existence of Native Courts in Sarawak and the power to levy sales tax. Natives in Sarawak enjoy special privileges such as quotas and employment in public service, scholarships, university placements, and business permits.[98] Local governments in Sarawak are exempt from local council laws enacted by the Malaysian parliament.[99] This level of autonomy means Sarawak is sometimes referred to as a \"region\", to differentiate it from less autonomous states.[100] Major political parties in Sarawak can be divided into three categories: native Sarawak Bumiputera (PBB and PBM), native Sarawak Dayak (PRS, PDP, PBDSB, etc.), and non-Bumiputera (SUPP, PSB, PBK, etc.); Parties, however, may also include members from more than one group.[101] The first political party, the Sarawak United Peoples' Party (SUPP), was established in 1959, followed by the Parti Negara Sarawak (PANAS) in 1960 and the Sarawak National Party (SNAP) in 1961. Other major political parties such as Parti Pesaka Sarawak (PESAKA) appeared by 1962.[49][note 5] These parties later joined the national coalition of the Alliance Party. The Alliance Party (later regrouped into Barisan Nasional) has ruled Sarawak since the formation of Malaysia. The opposition in Sarawak has consistently alleged that the ruling coalition uses various types of vote-buying tactics in order to win elections.[102][note 6][103] Stephen Kalong Ningkan was the first Chief Minister of Sarawak from 1963 to 1966 following his landslide victory in local council elections. However, he was ousted in 1966 by Tawi Sli with the help of the Malaysian federal government, causing the 1966 Sarawak constitutional crisis.[49] In 1969, the first Sarawak state election was held, with members of the Council Negri being directly elected by the voters. This election marked the beginning of ethnic Melanau domination in Sarawak politics by Abdul Rahman Ya'kub and Abdul Taib Mahmud. In the same year, the North Kalimantan Communist Party (NKCP) which subsequently waged a guerrilla war against the newly elected Sarawak state government, was formed. The party was dissolved after the signing of a peace agreement in 1990.[92] 1973 saw the birth of Parti Pesaka Bumiputera Bersatu (PBB) following a merger of several parties.[104] This party would later become the backbone of the Sarawak BN coalition. In 1978, the Democratic Action Party (DAP) was the first West Malaysia-based party to open its branches in Sarawak.[104] Sarawak originally held state elections together with national parliamentary elections. However, the then chief minister Abdul Rahman Ya'kub delayed the dissolution of the state assembly by a year to prepare for the challenges posed by opposition parties.[102] This made Sarawak the only state in Malaysia to hold state elections separate from the national parliamentary elections since 1979.[105] In 1983, SNAP started to fragment into several splinter parties due to recurrent leadership crises.[106][107] The political climate in the state was stable until the 1987 Ming Court Affair, a political coup initiated by Abdul Taib Mahmud's uncle to topple the Taib-led BN coalition. However, the coup was unsuccessful and Taib retained his position as chief minister.[108] Since the 2006 state election, the Democratic Action Party (DAP) has derived the majority of its support from urban centres and became the largest opposition party in Sarawak.[109] In 2010, it formed the Pakatan Rakyat coalition with Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR) and Parti Islam Se-Malaysia (PAS); the latter two parties had become active in Sarawak between 1996 and 2001.[110] Sarawak is the only state in Malaysia where West Malaysia-based component parties in the BN coalition, especially the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), have not been active in state politics.[111] On 12 June 2018, the Sarawak Parties Alliance was formed by the BN parties in the state in the aftermath of an historic meeting of party leaders in Kuching, where they decided that in light of the BN defeat in the 2018 Malaysian general election and the changing national situation and a new government, the parties will leave the BN altogether.[112] In conjunction with the celebration of Malaysia Day in 2018 under the new government, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has promised to restore the status of Sarawak (together with Sabah) as an equal partner to Malaya, where all three parties (and then, Singapore) formed Malaysia in accordance to the Malaysia Agreement.[113][114] However, through the process of the proposed amendment to the Constitution of Malaysia in 2019, the bill for the amendment failed to pass following the failure to reach two-thirds majority support (148 votes) in the Parliament with only 138 agreed with the move while 59 abstained from the voting.[115][116] On 14 December 2021, the proposed amendment was passed in the Parliament unanimously with 199 votes in favour, and 21 MPs absent from the 6-hour long debate.[117]"

There is also one development officer for each division and district to implement development projects.

Following the formation of Malaysia, the regiment was absorbed into the Malaysian military forces and is now known as the Royal Ranger Regiment.[125] In 1888, Sarawak, together with neighbouring North Borneo, and Brunei, became British protectorates, and the responsibility for foreign policy was handed over to the British in exchange for military protection.[61] Since the formation of Malaysia, the Malaysian federal government has been solely responsible for foreign policy and military forces in the country.[126][127]"

        "content": "The total land area of Sarawak is nearly 124,450\u00a0km2 (48,050\u00a0sq\u00a0mi),[7] making up 37.5 per cent of the total area of Malaysia, and lies between the northern latitudes 0\u00b0 50\u2032 and 5\u00b0 and eastern longitudes 109\u00b0 36\u2032 and 115\u00b0 40\u2032 E.[136] Its 750\u00a0km (470\u00a0mi) of coastline is interrupted in the north by about 150\u00a0km (93\u00a0mi) of Bruneian coast.[137] A total of its 45.5\u00a0km (28.3\u00a0mi) coastline have been eroding.[138] In 1961, Sarawak including neighbouring Sabah, which had been included in the International Maritime Organization (IMO) through the participation of the United Kingdom, became joint associate members of the IMO.[139] Sarawak is separated from Kalimantan Borneo by ranges of high hills and mountains that are part of the central mountain range of Borneo. These become loftier to the north, and are highest near the source of the Baram River at the steep Mount Batu Lawi and Mount Mulu. Mount Murud is the highest point in Sarawak.[137] Sarawak has a tropical geography with an equatorial climate and experiences two monsoon seasons: a northeast monsoon and a southwest monsoon. The northeast monsoon occurs between November and February, bringing heavy rainfall while the southwest monsoon, which occurs between March and October, brings somewhat less rainfall. The climate is stable throughout the year except for the two monsoons, with average daily temperature varying between 23\u00a0\u00b0C (73\u00a0\u00b0F) in the morning to 32\u00a0\u00b0C (90\u00a0\u00b0F) in the afternoon at coastal areas. Miri has the lowest average temperatures in comparison to other major towns in Sarawak and has the longest daylight hours (more than six hours a day), while other areas receive sunshine for five to six hours a day. Humidity is usually high, exceeding 68 per cent, with annual rainfall varying between 330\u00a0cm (130\u00a0in) and 460\u00a0cm (180\u00a0in) for up to 220 days a year.[136] At highland areas, the temperature can vary from 16\u00a0\u00b0C (61\u00a0\u00b0F) to 25\u00a0\u00b0C (77\u00a0\u00b0F) during the day and as low as 11\u00a0\u00b0C (52\u00a0\u00b0F) during the night.[140] Sarawak is divided into three ecoregions. The coastal region is rather low-lying and flat with large areas of swamp and other wet environments. Beaches in Sarawak include Pasir Panjang[141] and Damai beaches in Kuching,[142] Tanjung Batu beach in Bintulu,[143] and Tanjung Lobang[144] and Hawaii beaches in Miri.[145] Hilly terrain accounts for much of the inhabited land and is where most of the cities and towns are found. The ports of Kuching and Sibu are built some distance from the coast on rivers while Bintulu and Miri are close to the coastline where the hills stretch right to the South China Sea. The third region is the mountainous region along the Sarawak\u2013Kalimantan border, where a number of villages such as Bario, Ba'kelalan, and Usun Apau Plieran are located.[137] A number of rivers flow through Sarawak, with the Sarawak River being the main river flowing through Kuching. The Rajang River is the longest river in Malaysia, measuring 563\u00a0km (350\u00a0mi) including its tributary, Balleh River. To the north, the Baram, Limbang and Trusan Rivers drain into the Brunei Bay.[137] Sarawak can be divided into two geological zones: the Sunda Shield, which extends southwest from the Batang Lupar River (near Sri Aman) and forms the southern tip of Sarawak, and the geosyncline region, which extends northeast to the Batang Lupar River, forming the central and northern regions of Sarawak. The oldest rock type in southern Sarawak is schist formed during the Carboniferous and Lower Permian times, while the youngest igneous rock in this region, andesite, can be found at Sematan. Geological formation of the central and northern regions started during the late Cretaceous period. Other types of stone that can be found in central and northern Sarawak are shale, sandstone, and chert.[136] The Miri Division in eastern Sarawak is the region of Neogene strata containing organic rich rock formations which are the prolific oil and gas reserves. The rocks enriched in organic components are mudstones in Lambir, Miri and Tukau Formations of Middle Miocene-Lower Pliocene age.[146] Significant quantities of Sarawak soil are lithosols, up to 60 per cent, and podsols, around 12 per cent, while abundant alluvial soil is found in coastal and riverine regions. 12 per cent of Sarawak is covered with peat swamp forest.[136] Limestone with well-developed karst topography and cave systems is found scattered from west to east Sarawak, but concentrated in certain regions such as in the Bau district in the west and southwards near the Kalimantan border.[147] There are thirty national parks,[148] among which are Niah with its eponymous caves,[149] the highly developed ecosystem around Lambir Hills,[150] and the World Heritage Site of Gunung Mulu.[151][152] The last contains Sarawak Chamber, one of the world's largest underground chambers,[153] Deer Cave, the largest cave passage in the world,[154] and Clearwater Cave, the longest cave system in Southeast Asia.[155][156]"

The major trees found in estuary forests include bako and nibong, while those in the peat swamp forests include ramin (Gonystylus bancanus), meranti (Shorea), and medang jongkong (Dactylocladus stenostachys).[136] Animal species are also highly varied, with 185 species of mammals, 530 species of birds, 166 species of snakes, 104 species of lizards, and 113 species of amphibians, of which 19 per cent of the mammals, 6 per cent of the birds, 20 per cent of the snakes and 32 per cent of the lizards are endemic. These species are largely found in Totally Protected Areas. There are over 2,000 tree species in Sarawak. Other plants includes 1,000 species of orchids, 757 species of ferns, and 260 species of palm.[159] The state is the habitat of endangered animals, including the borneo pygmy elephant, proboscis monkey, orangutans and Sumatran rhinoceroses.[160] Matang Wildlife Centre, Semenggoh Nature Reserve, and Lanjak Entimau Wildlife Sanctuary[161] are noted for their orangutan protection programmes.[162][163] Talang\u2013Satang National Park is notable for its turtle conservation initiatives.[164] Birdwatching is a common activity in various national parks such as Gunung Mulu National Park, Lambir Hills National Park,[165] and Similajau National Park.[166] Miri\u2013Sibuti National Park is known for its coral reefs[167] and Gunung Gading National Park for its Rafflesia flowers.[168] Bako National Park, the oldest national park in Sarawak, is known for its 275 proboscis monkeys,[169] and Padawan Pitcher Garden for its various carnivorous pitcher plants.[170] In 1854, Alfred Russel Wallace visited Sarawak. A year later, he formulated the \"Sarawak Law\" which foreshadowed the formulation of his (and Darwin's) theory of evolution by natural selection three years later.[171] The Sarawak state government has enacted several laws to protect its forests and endangered wildlife species. Some of the protected species are the orangutan, green sea turtle, flying lemur, and piping hornbill. Under the Wild Life Protection Ordinance 1998, Sarawak natives are given permissions to hunt for a restricted range of wild animals in the jungles but should not possess more than 5\u00a0kg (11\u00a0lb) of meat.[172] The Sarawak Forest Department was established in 1919 to conserve forest resources in the state.[173] Following international criticism of the logging industry in Sarawak, the state government decided to downsize the Sarawak Forest Department and created the Sarawak Forestry Corporation in 1995.[174][175] The Sarawak Biodiversity Centre was set up in 1997 for the conservation, protection, and sustainable development of biodiversity in the state.[176]"

This led to several blockades by indigenous tribes during the 1980s and 1990s against logging companies encroaching on their lands.[179] Indeed, illegal logging in particular has decimated the forest regions indigenous populations depend on for their livelihoods, depleting fish, wildlife, but also traditional medicinal herbs and construction staples like Palm.[180] There have also been cases where Native Customary Rights (NCR) lands have been given to timber and plantation companies without the permission of the locals.[181] The indigenous people have resorted to legal means to reinstate their NCR. In 2001 the High Court of Sarawak fully reinstated the NCR land claimed by the Rumah Nor people, but this was overturned partially in 2005. However, this case has served as a precedent, leading to more NCR being upheld by the high court in the following years.[182][183] Sarawak's mega-dam policies, such as the Bakun Dam and Murum Dam projects, have submerged thousands of hectares of forest and displaced thousands of indigenous people.[184][185] Since 2013, the proposed Baram Dam project has been delayed due to ongoing protests from local indigenous tribes.[186] Since 2014, the Sarawak government under chief minister Adenan Satem started to take action against illegal logging in the state and to diversify the economy of the state.[187] Through the course of 2016 over 2 million acres of forest, much of it in orangutan habitats, were declared protected areas.[188] Sources vary as to Sarawak's remaining forest cover: former chief minister Abdul Taib Mahmud declared that it fell from 70% to 48% between 2011 and 2012, the Sarawak Forest Department and the Ministry of Resource Planning and Environment both held that it remained at 80% in 2012,[189][190] and Wetlands International reported that it fell by 10% between 2005 and 2010, 3.5 times faster than the rest of Asia combined.[191]"

After the formation of Malaysia, Sarawak GDP growth rate has risen due to increase in petroleum output and the rise in global petroleum prices. However, the state economy is less diversified and still heavily dependent upon the export of primary commodities when compared to Malaysia overall. The per capita GDP in Sarawak was lower than the national average from 1970 to 1990.[193] As of 2021, GDP per capita for Sarawak stands at RM 65,971 (US$15,173),[9] which is the third highest in Malaysia. However, the urban-rural income gap remained a major problem in Sarawak.[194] Sarawak is abundant in natural resources, and primary industries such as mining, agriculture, and forestry accounted for 32.8% of its economy in 2013.[195] It also specialises in the manufacture of food and beverages, wood-based and rattan products, basic metal products, and petrochemicals,[123] as well as cargo and air services and tourism.[195] \nThe state's gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 40.5% per year on average from 2010 to 2021,[196] but became very more volatile later on, ranging from \u22123.0% in 2009 to 35.0% in 2021. Sarawak contributed 9.5% of Malaysia's GDP in the nine years leading up to 2020, making it the third largest contributor after Selangor and Kuala Lumpur.[195] From 2015 to 2021, the oil and gas industry accounted for 55.2% of the Sarawak government's revenue. It attracted RM\u00a080 billion (US$17.85\u00a0billion) in foreign investments, with 95% going to the Sarawak Corridor of Renewable Energy (SCORE), the second largest economic corridor in Malaysia.[195] As of 2021, Sarawak is producing 2,800,000 barrel of oil equivalent every day in 150 oil and gas producing fields.[197][failed verification] However, the export-oriented economy is dominated by liquefied natural gas (LNG), which accounts for more than half of total exports. Crude petroleum accounts for 45.1%, while palm oil, sawlogs, and sawn timber account for 12.0% collectively.[195] The state receives a 5% royalty from Petronas over oil explorations in its territorial waters.[198] Most of the oil and gas deposits are located offshore next to Bintulu and Miri at Balingian basin, Baram basin, and around Luconia Shoals.[199] Sarawak is one of the world's largest exporters of tropical hardwood timber, constituting 65% of the total Malaysian log exports in 2000. The last United Nations statistics in 2001 estimated Sarawak's sawlog exports at an average of 14,109,000\u00a0m3 (498,300,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft) per year between 1996 and 2000.[200] In 1955, OCBC became the first foreign bank to operate in Sarawak, with other overseas banks following suit.[201] Other notable Sarawak-based companies include Cahya Mata Sarawak Berhad, Naim Holdings, and Rimbunan Hijau.[202]"

The primary route in Sarawak is the Pan Borneo Highway, which runs from Sematan, Sarawak, through Brunei to Tawau, Sabah.[239] Despite being a major highway, the condition of the road is poor leading to numerous accidents and fatalities.[240] 16 billion ringgit worth of contracts were awarded to a number of local companies in December 2016 to add new vehicle and pedestrian bridges, interchanges and bus shelters to the highway as part of a multi-phase project.[241] A railway line existed before the war, but the last remnants of the line were dismantled in 1959.[242] A rail project was announced in 2008 to be in line with the transport needs of SCORE, but as yet no construction work has begun despite an anticipated completion date in 2015.[243] In 2017, the Sarawak government proposed a light rail system (Kuching Line) connecting Kuching, Samarahan and Serian divisions with anticipated completion in 2020.[244] Currently, buses are the primary mode of public transportation in Sarawak with interstate services connecting the state to Sabah, Brunei, and Pontianak (Indonesia).[234] Sarawak is served by a number of airports with Kuching International Airport, located south west of Kuching, being the largest. Flights from Kuching are mainly to Kuala Lumpur but also to Johor Bahru, Penang, Sabah, Kelantan, Singapore and Pontianak, Indonesia. A second airport at Miri serves flights primarily to other Malaysian states as well as services to Singapore. Other smaller airports such as Sibu Airport, Bintulu Airport, Mukah Airport, Marudi Airport, Mulu Airport, and Limbang Airport provide domestic services within Malaysia. There are also a number of remote airstrips serving rural communities in the state.[239] Three airlines serve flights in Sarawak, Malaysia Airlines, Air Asia, and MASwings all of which use Kuching Airport as their main hub.[245] The state owned Hornbill Skyways is an aviation company that largely provides private chartered flights and flight services for public servants.[246] Sarawak has four primary ports located at Kuching, Sibu, Bintulu, and Miri.[234] The busiest seaport at Bintulu is under the jurisdiction of the Malaysian federal government and mainly handles LNG products and regular cargo. The remaining ports are under the respective state port authorities. The combined throughput of the four primary ports was 61.04\u00a0million freight weight tonnes (FWT) in 2013.[239] Sarawak has 55 navigable river networks with a combined length of 3,300\u00a0km (2,100\u00a0mi). For centuries, the rivers of Sarawak have been a primary means of transport as well as a route for timber and other agricultural goods moving downriver for export at the country's major ports. Sibu port, located 113\u00a0km (70\u00a0mi) from the river's mouth, is the main hub along the Rajang River mainly handling timber products. However, the throughput of Sibu port has declined over the years after Tanjung Manis Industrial Port (TIMP) began operating further downriver.[239]"

Hospitals in Sarawak typically provide the full gamut of health care options, from triage to palliative care for the terminally ill. In 1994, Sarawak General Hospital Department of Radiotherapy, Oncology & Palliative Care instituted an at-home care, or hospice care, program for cancer patients. The non profit Sarawak Hospice Society was established in 1998 to promote this program.[253] \nIn comparison to the number of other medical facilities, mental health is only serviced by a single facility, Hospital Sentosa.[254] This abundance of medical services has made Sarawak a medical tourism destination for visitors from neighbouring Brunei and Indonesia.[255] In comparison to the prevalence of health services in urban regions, much of rural Sarawak is only accessible by river transport, which limits access.[256] Remote rural areas that are beyond the operating areas of health clinics, about 12\u00a0km (7.5\u00a0mi),[257] and inaccessible by land or river are serviced by a monthly flying doctor service, which was established in 1973.[258]\nA village health promoter program, where volunteers are provided with basic medical training, was established in 1981 but difficulty in providing medical supplies to remote villages, as well as a lack of incentive, resulted in a decline of the program.[259] A variety of traditional medicine practices are still being used by the various communities in Sarawak to supplement modern medical practices but this practice is also declining.[260] However, since 2004, there has been a resurgence in traditional medicine in Malaysia resulting in the establishment of a traditional medicine division within the Ministry of Health.

However, the ministry does oversee the licensing of private kindergartens, the main form of early childhood education, in accordance with the National Pre-School Quality Standard, which was launched in 2013.[264] Around the time of Federation, overall literacy in Sarawak was quite low. In 1960, the overall literacy rate was 25%, with a heavy slant in the literacy rate towards the Chinese population, 53%, compared with that of indigenous peoples which was substantially lower, only 17%.[265] By 2007, overall literacy in adults aged 15 and over had significantly increased to 92.3% and in 2012, this had climbed to 96%.[266] There were 1480 schools in Sarawak in 2014, of which 1271 were primary, 202 were secondary and 7 were vocational/technical secondary schools.[267] Among these are a number of schools that date from the Brooke era, including St. Thomas's School Kuching (1848), St Mary's School Kuching (1848), and St Joseph's School Kuching (1882).[268] As well as government schools, there are four international schools: Tunku Putra School, a primary and secondary school offering national and Cambridge curricula, Lodge International School, which is also open to local students and uses both the British National and Cambridge systems, Kidurong International School, which is owned by Shell and offers primary education mainly to children of employees but local children may enter depending on space availability, and Tenby International School, which opened in 2014 and is open to both local and expatriate children.[269] There are also 14 Chinese independent secondary schools in Sarawak that teach in Chinese rather than English or Malay.[270] Previously, only Chinese students were enrolled in these schools, but mobility of the workforce has led to increasing turnover of students as parents move to other areas for employment.[271][272] This has led to an increasing number of Bumiputera students being enrolled in Chinese primary and preschools.[273] Sarawak is home to three public universities \u2013 Universiti Malaysia Sarawak, Universiti Teknologi Mara at Kota Samarahan, and Universiti Putra Malaysia \u2013 as well as the private Curtin University, Malaysia and Swinburne University of Technology Sarawak Campus. The latter two are satellite campuses of Curtin University in Perth and Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne, Australia.[262] With the establishment of SCORE and the associated potential of 1.6 million more jobs by 2030,[269] the state government allocated RM1 billion from 2016 to 2020 to a Skills Development Fund for vocational education.[274] In 2015, Petronas provided vocational scholarships to 150 underprivileged Sarawak students as part of its Vocational Institution Sponsorship and Training Assistance program,[275] although it had been criticised for under-representing local students in its previous allocations;[276] the company also provided support to other Sarawak vocational education centres.[277]"

The average population growth rate of 1.8%, from 2000 to 2010, is very close to the national average of 2.0%.[123] In 2014, 58% of the population resided in urban areas with the remainder in rural areas, but over the next 10 years it is predicted that the urban population would rise to 65%.[279] As of 2011[update], the crude birth rate in Sarawak was 16.3 per 1000 individuals, the crude death rate was 4.3 per 1000 population, and the infant mortality rate was 6.5 per 1000 live births.[280] Urban populations consist predominantly of Malays, Melanaus, Chinese, and a small population of urban Ibans and Bidayuhs who migrated from their home villages seeking employment.[281] The latter two are among the more than 40 sub-ethnic groups of Sarawak, many of whom still inhabit remote areas and are referred to as Orang Asal.[282] The Orang Asal, and Malays, of Peninsular Malaysia, Sarawak and Sabah are referred to collectively as Bumiputera (son of the soil). This classification grants them special privileges in education, jobs, finance, and political positions.[283] The registration for, and issuing of, national identity cards, a legally required document for accessing various services, to these remote tribes has been problematic for many years,[284] and in the past had even resulted in a large number of people from the Penan ethnic group being rendered effectively stateless.[285] In recent years, this issue has seen progressive improvement with the implementation of systems such as mobile registration units.[286] Sarawak has a large immigrant work force with as many as 150,000 registered foreign migrant workers working as domestic workers or in plantation, manufacturing, construction, services and agriculture.[287] However, this population of legally registered workers is overshadowed by a large population of between 320,000 and 350,000 illegal workers.[288]"

Specific terms were used to refer to those who belonged to particular social strata, such as the raja berani (rich and the brave), orang mayuh (ordinary people), and ulun (slaves).[292] Despite modern influences, Iban still observe many of their traditional rituals such as Gawai Antu (festival of the dead) and Gawai Dayak (Harvest Festival).[293] Although the presence of Chinese in Sarawak dates back to the 6th century AD when traders first came to the state, the Chinese population today largely consists of communities originating from immigrants during the Brooke era.[137] This migration was driven by the employment opportunities at gold mines in Bau. \nSarawak Chinese are primarily Buddhist and Christian,[294] and speak a multitude of southern Chinese languages: Cantonese, Fuzhou, Hakka, Hokkien, Teochew, and Henghua (Putian people), in addition to Mandarin. They celebrate major cultural festivals such as Hungry Ghost Festival and the Chinese New Year much as their ancestors did.[295] Chinese settlers in Sarawak were not limited to any one area. Those who settled in Kuching did so near the Sarawak River in an area that is now referred to as Chinatown.[296] Fuzhounese immigrants from Fuzhou, Fujian, led by Wong Nai Siong in 1901, settled along the Rajang River in what is now Sibu, as due to Boxer Rebellion,[297] while those who arrived in Miri sought work in the coal mines and oilfields.[296] During the Brooke era, Sarawak Malays were predominantly fishermen,[295] leading to their villages being concentrated along river banks. However, with the advent of urban development, many Malays have migrated to seek employment in public and private sectors. Traditionally, they are known for their silver and brass crafts, wood carvings, and textiles.[137][298] The Melanau are a native people of Sarawak that lived in areas primarily around the modern city of Mukah, where they worked as fishermen and craftsmen as well renowned boatbuilders. Historically the Melanau practised Animism, a belief that spirits inhabited objects in their environment, and while this is still practised today, most Melanau have since been converted to Christianity and Islam.[137][89][note 7][299] The Bidayuh are a southern Sarawak people,[300] that were referred to by early European settlers as Land Dayaks because they traditionally live on steep limestone mountains. They account for 7.3 per cent of the population of Sarawak and are the second most numerous of the indigenous Dayak people, after the Iban. The Bidayuh are indigenous to the areas that comprise the modern day divisions of Kuching and Serian. Although considered one people, their language is regionally distinct resulting in dialects that are unintelligible to Bidayuh from outside the immediate locale,[301][failed verification] resulting in English and Malay being the lingua franca. Like many other indigenous peoples, the majority of the Bidayuh have been converted to Christianity,[137]\nbut still live in villages consisting of longhouses, with the addition of the distinctive round baruk where communal gatherings were held.[137] The numerous tribes who reside in Sarawak's interior such as the Kenyah, Kayan, Lun Bawang, Kelabit, Penan, Bisaya, and Berawan are collectively referred to as Orang Ulu. In the Iban language, this name means \"Upriver People,\" reflecting the location these tribes settled in;[137] most of them reside near the drainage basin of the Baram River.[302] Both woodworking and artistry are highly visible aspects of Orang Ulu culture exemplified by mural covered longhouses, carved wooden boats, and tattooing.[137] Well-known musical instruments from the Orang Ulu are the Kayans' sapeh and Kenyah's sampe' and Lun Bawang's bamboo band.[302] The Kelabit and Lun Bawang people are known for their production of fragrant rice.[303][302] As with the many other indigenous peoples of Sarawak, the majority of Orang Ulu are Christians.[137] The Indians, predominantly the Tamils were brought by the British Government to work in estates as labourers and clerks. Besides, the Malayalee community too exist in the cities in Sarawak. Today, many among the Indians are known to be employed as professionals (mainly doctors) in Sarawak."

        "content": "English was the official language of Sarawak from 1963 to 1974 due to opposition from First Chief Minister of Sarawak Stephen Kalong Ningkan to the use of the Malaysian language in Sarawak.[304] In 1974, the new Chief Minister Abdul Rahman Ya'kub recognised Malay alongside English as an official language of Sarawak.[102][note 8] This new status given to the Malay language was further reinforced by new education standards transitioning curriculum to Malay.[305] In 1985 English lost the status of an official language, leaving only Malay.[304][note 9] Despite official policy, Sarawak opposition members argue that English remained the de facto official language of Sarawak.[306] English is still spoken in the legal courts, and state legislative assembly.[307][308] In 2015, Chief Minister Adenan Satem reinstated English as an official language.[309][310][311] Sarawak's language autonomy does not extend to the educational system, with the language syllabus controlled by the federal government.[312] Although the official form of Malay, Bahasa Malaysia, is spoken by the government administration, it is used infrequently in colloquial conversation. The local dialect of Bahasa Sarawak (Sarawak Malay) dominates the vernacular. Bahasa Sarawak is the most common language of Sarawak Malays and other indigenous tribes. The Iban language, which has minor regional variations, is the most widely spoken native language, with 60 per cent of the Sarawak population speaking it as a first language. The Bidayuh language, with six major dialects, is spoken by 10 per cent of the population. The Orang Ulu have about 30 different language dialects. While the ethnic Chinese originate from a variety of backgrounds and speak many different Southern Chinese languages such as Cantonese, Hokkien, Hakka, Fuzhou, and Teochew, they also converse in Malaysian Mandarin.[313] Tamil language is spoken by the Indians in Sarawak."

        "content": "Christianity is the largest religion in Sarawak, representing 50.1% of the total population according to the 2020 census.[8] This makes Sarawak the only Malaysian state with a Christian majority. The earliest Christian missionaries in Sarawak were Church of England (Anglicans) in 1848, followed by Roman Catholics a few years later, and Methodists in 1903. Evangelization first took place among the Chinese immigrants before spreading to indigenous animists.[314] Other Christian denominations in Sarawak are Borneo Evangelical Mission (or Sidang Injil Borneo),[315] and Baptists.[316] Indigenous people such as the Iban, Bidayuh, and Orang Ulu have adopted Christianity, although they do retain some of their traditional religious rites. Many Muslims come from the Malay and Melanau. Buddhism, Taoism, and Chinese folk religion are predominantly practised by Chinese Malaysians.[317] Other minor religions in Sarawak are the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith,[318] Hinduism,[319] Sikhism,[320] and animism.[321] Although Islam is the official religion of Malaysia, Sarawak has no official state religion.[322] However, during the chieftainship of Abdul Rahman Ya'kub, the Constitution of Sarawak was amended to make the Yang di-Pertuan Agong as the head of Islam in Sarawak and empower the state assembly to pass laws regarding Islamic affairs. With such provisions, Islamic policies can be formulated in Sarawak and the establishment of Islamic state agencies is possible. The 1978 Majlis Islam Bill enabled the setting up of Syariah Courts in Sarawak with jurisdictions over matrimonial, child custody, betrothal, inheritance, and criminal cases in the state. An appeals court and Courts of Kadi were also formed.[102][note 10]"

        "header": "Culture",
        "content": "The location and history of Sarawak has resulted in a broad diversity of ethnicity, culture and languages. Among the indigenous peoples of Sarawak, outside influences have led to many changes over time. The Iban tribal culture in Sarawak centred on the concept of the warrior and the ability to take heads from other tribes in battle. This practice, central as it was to the Iban people, was made illegal under James Brooke's rule and ultimately faded away although reminders of the practice are still seen in some long houses.[323] Two other tribal peoples of the Sarawak Highlands, the Kelabit and Lun Bawang, have seen fundamental changes to their ethnic identities as a direct result of their conversion to Christianity. One major change was the shift in the focal point of their social interactions from the traditional long house to the local church. Their religious devotion has also helped shape their worldview outside of their village, particularly in response to change.[324] For the Penan people, one of the last tribes to still be practising a nomadic lifestyle within the jungle, outside influence, particularly education, has resulted in a significant decline in the population that practice the nomadic lifestyle.[325] Others settle down after intermixing with members of different tribes, such as the Orang Ulu.[326] One direct result of this diversity in cultures, engendered by a policy of tolerance to all races, is the increasing numbers of tribal peoples marrying not only other Sarawakian tribes, but also to Chinese, Malays as well as citizens of European or American descent.[327] The indigenous tribes of Sarawak traditionally used oratory to pass on their culture from one generation to the next;[328][note 11] examples of these traditional practices include the Iban's Ngajat dances,[329] Renong (Iban vocal repertory),[330] Ensera (Iban oral narratives),[304][note 12] and epic storytelling by the Kayan and Kenyah.[331][332] In the years before federation, the colonial government recognised that British education and indigenous culture was influencing a new generation of Iban teachers. Thus, on 15 September 1958, the Borneo Literature Bureau was inaugurated with a charter to nurture and encourage local literature while also supporting the government in its release of documentation, particularly in technical and instructional manuscripts that were to be distributed to the indigenous peoples of Sarawak and Sabah. As well as indigenous languages, documents would also be published in English, Chinese and Malay. In 1977, the bureau came under the authority of the federal government language planning and development agency, the Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka (DBP), which advocated publication only in Malay ultimately causing the demise of fledgling indigenous literature.[304][note 13] It was a number of decades before print media began to appear in Sarawak. The Sarawak Gazette, published by the Brooke government, recorded a variety of news relating to economics, agriculture, anthropology, archaeology, began circulation in 1870 and continues in modern times.[333]\nHowever, in the decades following federation, restrictive laws and connections to businesses have meant that the media is a largely state-owned enterprise.[304][note 14] One of the earliest known text publications in Borneo, Hikayat Panglima Nikosa (Story of Nikosa the Warrior), was first printed in Kuching, 1876.[334] There are a number of museums in Sarawak that preserve and maintain artefacts of Sarawak's culture. At the foot of Mount Santubong, Kuching, is Sarawak Cultural Village, a \"living museum\" that showcases the various ethnic groups carrying out traditional activities in their respective traditional houses.[335][336] The Sarawak State Museum houses a collection of artefacts such as pottery, textiles, and woodcarving tools from various ethnic tribes in Sarawak, as well as ethnographic materials of local cultures.[337] Orang Ulu's Sapeh (a dug-out guitar) is the best known traditional musical instrument in Sarawak and was played for Queen Elizabeth II during her official visit to Sarawak in 1972.[338]"

The streets were covered in water, buildings collapsed, and cars were swept away.[6] It also caused the death of National Guardsman Sgt.

These flash floods occurred because the historic district was an urban area, and the land could not contain the falling precipitation. Therefore, the streets of Ellicott City had to deal with runoff from the fallen water. A large portion of the southbound US 29 flooded several feet. Heavy rains and rapidly rising water washed away portions of several roads.[4][6][11][12][13][14] Howard County officials reported that at least 30 water rescues and one missing person search were performed as a result of the storm.[15] The National Weather Service reported rainfall totals in excess of 10 inches (25\u00a0cm) in several areas, with Catonsville receiving the highest at 10.38 inches (26.4\u00a0cm) and Ellicott City receiving 8.40 inches (21.3\u00a0cm).[16] According to meteorologists, the storm was \"likely worse\" than the 2016 Maryland flood because Ellicott City received only five inches (130\u00a0mm) of rain during the 2016 flood, [14][17] which was almost half as much of rain received in the 2018 flood. The 39-year-old National Guardsman and U.S. Air Force veteran Sgt. Eddison \"Eddie\" Hermond was reported missing after helping a local business owner who was trapped by rising water. Hermond was swept away by the current. Active recovery efforts were underway on May 28, 2018, and suspended the next day after his body was recovered in the Patapsco River. \"We're deeply saddened to learn that the body of Sgt. Eddison Hermond has been found.\" Governor Hogan mourned Hermond's loss. \"There are no words to adequately describe our sense of loss,\" he said in a statement. \"He bravely risked his life to assist a fellow citizen during the flooding in Ellicott City. Our heartfelt prayers go out to Sgt. Hermond's family and loved ones.\" To honor Hermond, all Maryland flags were ordered to fly at half-staff.[1][18]"

There was a recovery website dedicated to the flood set up by the Howard County government.[20] Former Howard County executive Allan H. Kittleman signed a bill which would demolish and remove 13 historic buildings from the city. The plan was funded at $50 million and is expected to be completed by 2023.[21] The plan to demolish the historic buildings had several obstacles due to the necessary permits: The Historic Preservation Commission required grant authorization for Howard County to raze the structures, The Maryland Department of the Environment required permits for waterways and non-tidal wetlands, and The United States Army Corps of Engineers also required a permit. The approval timeline for the Army Corps of Engineers's permit was extended because demolishing buildings in a historic district could alter Ellicott City's historic characteristics and nature, therefore influencing their place on the National Register of Historic Places.[21] Howard County executive Calvin Ball III did not support the plan of demolishing the historic buildings, stating that demolition should be a last resort.

The thirteenth named storm, seventh hurricane and third major hurricane of the extremely active 1995 Atlantic hurricane season, Marilyn formed on September 12 as a tropical depression from a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa on September 7. After formation, the storm quickly became a tropical storm, and steadily intensified into a hurricane by the time it struck the Lesser Antilles on September 14 at Category\u00a01 strength. Entering the northeastern Caribbean Sea, rapid intensification ensued and it peaked on September 16 north of Puerto Rico as a Category\u00a03 hurricane shortly after it had impacted the U.S. Virgin Islands. A Hurricane Hunter reconnaissance flight reported hail, which is unusual for tropical cyclones. After heading north past Bermuda, Marilyn weakened and became extratropical on September 22. The remnant circulation wandered the Atlantic Ocean from September 23 \u2013 October 1, just south of Nova Scotia. Marilyn is responsible for a total of thirteen deaths,[1] most due to drowning on boats or offshore.\nEleven thousand people were left homeless on the island of St. Thomas, and estimated damages were set at $2\u00a0billion (1995\u00a0USD)[1] in the USVI. The same area would be struck by Hurricane Bertha the next year, while still repairing from Hurricanes Luis and Marilyn,[2] then successively hit by Hortense, Erika, Georges, Jose, Lenny and Debby."

        "content": "Marilyn's origins were from a tropical wave that formed off the African coast on September 7. Large, low-level winds were included in the wave's circulation, but little convection existed.[3] The system continued west for a few days at about 19\u00a0mph (31\u00a0km/h) next to an anticyclonic aloft. On September 12, satellite pictures viewed the disorganized wave and declared it Tropical Depression Fifteen, after convection had increased. Tropical Depression Fifteen strengthened rapidly, becoming Tropical Storm Marilyn six hours later. One day after being named, Marilyn was upgraded to hurricane status, while turning on a more northwesterly track.[3][4] For the next few days, Marilyn's track took it towards the west-northwest and to the northwest, due to a weakness in the subtropical ridge. Marilyn was a Category 1 hurricane; it passed 52\u00a0mi (84\u00a0km) north of Barbados and Martinique.[3] Marilyn passed over Dominica, and just \u00celes des Saintes and southwest of Guadeloupe on September 14, bringing heavy rains and strong winds with it. Marilyn continued on its northwesterly track, making landfall in the U.S. Virgin Islands on September 15, packing winds of 110\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h), a strong Category\u00a02 strength hurricane. The eyewall, east-southeast of the center of Marilyn, passed over Saint Thomas later that day. After passing over Puerto Rico, Marilyn entered back into the Atlantic Ocean on September 16.[3] A low had formed near Marilyn, which may have enhanced outflow from the system. An eye formed in the center of Marilyn, and the storm reached a peak intensity of 949 millibars and winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h), a lower-end Category\u00a03 hurricane. At this time, Marilyn was predicted to peak in wind speeds of 120\u2013125\u00a0mph (193\u2013201\u00a0km/h).[5][6][7][8] Reconnaissance data found a concentric pair of eyewall wind maxima. Marilyn started weakening rapidly, falling from peak-level winds of 141\u00a0mph (227\u00a0km/h) down to 102\u00a0mph (164\u00a0km/h).[3] The central pressure also rose up 20 mbars in only 10\u00a0hours. This rapid weakening was caused by westerly shear and dry air entrained in the system, a decaying eyewall, and especially cool waters upwelled from the previous powerful storm, Hurricane Luis. As Marilyn weakened to Category 1 hurricane status and moved north-northwest, it passed about 174\u00a0mi (280\u00a0km) west of Bermuda on September 19. As Marilyn encountered more westerly shear, it weakened to below hurricane status and made its extratropical transition on September 20, centered in the northeastern Atlantic.[3] The remnant circulation continued to erratically move through the central Atlantic Ocean for another 10\u00a0days before being absorbed by a frontal low on September 30. A Hurricane Hunter reconnaissance flight reported hail, which is unusual for tropical cyclones.[3]"

A tropical storm warning was issued for St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Grenadines, Grenada and Tobago at 900 UTC September 13.[9][10] At 2100 UTC, a Hurricane Warning was issued for Barbados, St. Vincent, Grenadines, St. Lucia and a hurricane watch for Dominica.[3][11] A hurricane watch as released for Martinique on September 14.

Four hours later, Puerto Rico, U.S. and British Virgin Islands, and Guadeloupe were put under a hurricane warning.[3] Throughout the night, several watches and warnings were discontinued. At 1500 UTC September 15, Dominican Republic from Cabrera to Cabo Engano were put under a hurricane watch as Marilyn approached. During the night of September 16, all currently active watches and warnings were discontinued. At around the same time, a new Hurricane watch was released for Turks and Caicos and Mayaguana, Acklins, and the Crooked Islands of the southeastern Bahamas.[8][13][14][15] This warning was discontinued within 48\u00a0hours.

The exact figure for damages in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico is not available, although the American Insurance Services Group set the combined damage at $875\u00a0million. Aside from high winds and seas, one possible explanation for the storm's heavy damage may have been complacency on the part of local island populations. Marilyn struck a mere 10\u2011days after Luis, a more powerful Category 4 hurricane initially predicted to pass very close to St. Thomas. This prediction prompted locals to be particularly thorough in their pre-storm preparations; however, Luis passed further away from the island and caused relatively moderate damage. Virgin Islanders questioned the accuracy of the National Hurricane Center wind advisories, as Hurricane Marilyn caused significant damage for a mere \"category 2\" storm. Damage on St. Thomas was remiscent of the damage seen on St. Croix in 1989, when Hurricane Hugo, a category 4 storm, caused catastrophic damage. Because St. Thomas is a very hilly island, it is possible that sustained winds on exposed hills (some of which have elevations that are thousands of feet above sea level) were significantly stronger than the sea-level wind speed estimates given by the hurricane center in its main advisory. Residents also reported tornado vortices in certain neighborhoods.[3]"

According to an Indo-Asian News Service release issued in September, these \"rainfall extremes have increased threefold over the last few years and now extend over all of central India \u2013 from Gujarat to Odisha.\"[30][31] In total, there were 1,076 deaths caused by flooding in India.

Indianapolis is situated in the state's central till plain region along the west fork of the White River. The city's official slogan, \"Crossroads of America\", reflects its historic importance as a transportation hub and its relative proximity to other major North American markets.[12][13] At the 2020 census, the balance population was 887,642.[14] Indianapolis is the 16th-most populous city in the U.S., the third-most populous city in the Midwest after Chicago and Columbus, Ohio, and the fourth-most populous state capital in the nation after Phoenix, Austin, and Columbus. The Indianapolis metropolitan area is the 34th-most populous metropolitan statistical area in the U.S., home to 2.1 million residents.[15] With a population of more than 2.6 million, the combined statistical area ranks 27th.[16] Indianapolis proper covers 368 square miles (950\u00a0km2), making it the 19th-most extensive city by land area in the country. Indigenous peoples inhabited the area dating to as early as 10,000 BC.[17] In 1818, the Lenape relinquished their tribal lands in the Treaty of St. Mary's.[18] In 1821, Indianapolis was established as a planned city for the new seat of Indiana's state government. The city was platted by Alexander Ralston and Elias Pym Fordham on a 1-square-mile (2.6\u00a0km2) grid. Completion of the National and Michigan roads and later arrival of rail solidified the city's position as a major manufacturing and commercial center.[19] Since the 1970 city-county consolidation, known as Unigov, local government administration operates under the direction of an elected 25-member city-county council headed by the mayor. Indianapolis anchors the 29th largest metropolitan economy in the U.S.[20] Prominent industries include trade, transportation, and utilities; education and health services; professional and business services; government; leisure and hospitality; and manufacturing.[21] The city has notable niche markets in amateur sports and auto racing.[22][23] Contemporary Indianapolis is home to two major league sports teams, three Fortune 500 companies, eight university campuses, and numerous cultural institutions, including the world's largest children's museum.[24][25] The city is perhaps best known for hosting the world's largest single-day sporting event, the Indianapolis 500.[26][27] Among the city's historic sites and districts, Indianapolis is home to the largest collection of monuments dedicated to veterans and war casualties in the U.S. outside of Washington, D.C.[28][29]"

        "content": "In 1816, the year Indiana gained statehood, the U.S. Congress donated four sections of federal land to establish a permanent seat of state government.[33] Two years later, under the Treaty of St. Mary's (1818), the Delaware relinquished title to their tribal lands in central Indiana, agreeing to leave the area by 1821.[18] This tract of land, which was called the New Purchase, included the site selected for the new state capital in 1820.[34] The indigenous people of the land prior to systematic removal are the Miami Nation of Indiana (Miami Nation of Oklahoma) and Indianapolis makes up part of Cession 99; the primary treaty between the indigenous population and the United States was the Treaty of St. Mary's (1818).[35] The availability of new federal lands for purchase in central Indiana attracted settlers, many of them descendants of families from northwestern Europe. Although many of these first European and American settlers were Protestants, a large proportion of the early Irish and German immigrants were Catholics. Few African Americans lived in central Indiana before 1840.[36] The first European Americans to permanently settle in the area that became Indianapolis were either the McCormick or Pogue families. The McCormicks are generally considered to be the first permanent settlers; however, some historians believe George Pogue and family may have arrived first, on March 2, 1819, and settled in a log cabin along the creek that was later called Pogue's Run. Other historians have argued as early as 1822 that John Wesley McCormick and his family and employees became the area's first European American settlers, settling near the White River in February 1820.[37] On January 11, 1820, the Indiana General Assembly authorized a committee to select a site in central Indiana for the new state capital.[38] The state legislature approved the site, adopting the name Indianapolis on January 6, 1821.[1] In April, Alexander Ralston and Elias Pym Fordham were appointed to survey and design a town plan for the new settlement.[39] Indianapolis became a seat of county government on December 31, 1821, when Marion County, was established. A combined county and town government continued until 1832 when Indianapolis was incorporated as a town. Indianapolis became an incorporated city effective March 30, 1847. Samuel Henderson, the city's first mayor, led the new city government, which included a seven-member city council. In 1853, voters approved a new city charter that provided for an elected mayor and a fourteen-member city council. The city charter continued to be revised as Indianapolis expanded.[40] Effective January 1, 1825, the seat of state government moved to Indianapolis from Corydon, Indiana. In addition to state government offices, a U.S. district court was established at Indianapolis in 1825.[41] Growth occurred with the opening of the National Road through the town in 1827, the first major federally funded highway in the United States.[42] A small segment of the ultimately failed Indiana Central Canal was opened in 1839.[43] The first railroad to serve Indianapolis, the Jeffersonville, Madison and Indianapolis Railroad, began operation in 1847, and subsequent railroad connections fostered growth.[44] Indianapolis Union Station was the first of its kind in the world when it opened in 1853.[45]"

On February 11, 1861, President-elect Lincoln arrived in the city, en route to Washington, D.C. for his presidential inauguration, marking the first visit from a president-elect in the city's history.[46] On April 16, 1861, the first orders were issued to form Indiana's first regiments and establish Indianapolis as a headquarters for the state's volunteer soldiers.[47][48] Within a week, more than 12,000 recruits signed up to fight for the Union.[49] Indianapolis became a major logistics hub during the war, establishing the city as a crucial military base.[50][51] Between 1860 and 1870, the city's population more than doubled.[44] An estimated 4,000 men from Indianapolis served in 39 regiments, and an estimated 700 died during the war.[52] On May 20, 1863, Union soldiers attempted to disrupt a statewide Democratic convention at Indianapolis, forcing an adjournment of the proceedings, sarcastically referred to as the Battle of Pogue's Run.[53] Fear turned to panic in July 1863, during Morgan's Raid into southern Indiana, but Confederate forces turned east toward Ohio, never reaching Indianapolis.[54] On April 30, 1865, Lincoln's funeral train made a stop at Indianapolis, where an estimated crowd of more than 100,000 people passed the assassinated president's bier at the Indiana Statehouse.[51][55] Following the Civil War and in the wake of the Second Industrial Revolution, Indianapolis experienced tremendous growth and prosperity. In 1880, Indianapolis was the world's third-largest pork packing city, after Chicago and Cincinnati, and the second-largest railroad center in the U.S. by 1888.[56][57] By 1890, the city's population surpassed 100,000.[44] Some of the city's most notable businesses were founded during this period of growth and innovation, including L. S. Ayres (1872), Eli Lilly and Company (1876), Madam C. J. Walker Manufacturing Company (1910), and Allison Transmission (1915)."

The Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument, dedicated on May 15, 1902, would later become the city's unofficial symbol.[58] Ray Harroun won the inaugural running of the Indianapolis 500, held May 30, 1911, at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Indianapolis was one of the hardest hit cities in the Great Flood of 1913, resulting in five known deaths[59][60][61] and the displacement of 7,000 families.[62] Once home to 60 automakers, Indianapolis rivaled Detroit as a center of automobile manufacturing.[63] The city was an early focus of labor organization.[44] The Indianapolis streetcar strike of 1913 and subsequent police mutiny and riots led to the creation of the state's earliest labor-protection laws, including a minimum wage, regular work weeks, and improved working conditions.[64] The International Typographical Union and United Mine Workers of America were among several influential labor unions based in the city.[44] As a stop on the Underground Railroad, Indianapolis had one of the largest black populations in the Northern States, until the Great Migration.[65] Led by D. C. Stephenson, the Indiana Klan became the most powerful political and social organization in Indianapolis from 1921 through 1928, controlling the City Council and the Board of School Commissioners, among others. At its height, more than 40% of native-born white males in Indianapolis claimed membership in the Klan. While campaigning in the city in 1968, Robert F. Kennedy delivered one of the most lauded speeches in 20th century American history, following the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.[66][67][68] As in most U.S. cities during the Civil Rights Movement, the city experienced strained race relations. A 1971 federal court decision forcing Indianapolis Public Schools to implement desegregation busing proved controversial.[69] During the mayoral administration of Richard Lugar (1968\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1976), the city and county governments consolidated. Known as Unigov (a portmanteau of \"unified\" and \"government\"), the city-county consolidation removed bureaucratic redundancies, captured increasingly suburbanizing tax revenue, and created a Republican political machine that dominated local politics until the early 2000s.[70][71] Effective January 1, 1970, Unigov expanded the city's land area by more than 300 square miles (780\u00a0km2) and increased its population by some 250,000 people.[72] It was the first major city-county consolidation to occur in the U.S. without a referendum since the creation of the City of Greater New York in 1898.[73] Lugar is credited with initiating downtown revitalization efforts, overseeing the building of Market Square Arena, renovations to Indianapolis City Market, and the formation of Indiana University\u201a\u00c4\u00ecPurdue University Indianapolis.[74] Amid the changes in government and growth, the city pursued an aggressive economic development strategy to raise the city's stature as a sports tourism destination, known as the Indianapolis Project.[75] During the administration of the city's longest-serving mayor, William Hudnut (1976\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1992), millions of dollars were invested into sports venues and public relations campaigns. The strategy was successful in landing the U.S. Olympic Festival in 1982, securing the relocation of the Baltimore Colts in 1984, and hosting the 1987 Pan American Games.[23] Beginning in 1992, the mayoral administration of Stephen Goldsmith introduced a number of austerity measures to address budget shortfalls through privatization and greater reliance on public\u201a\u00c4\u00ecprivate partnerships. Major downtown revitalization projects continued through the 1990s, including the openings of Circle Centre Mall, Victory Field, and Gainbridge Fieldhouse, as well as ongoing redevelopment of the Indiana Central Canal and White River State Park areas.[76]"

Barton's 1963 election.[77] The Peterson administration focused on education reform and promoting the arts. In 2001, the mayor's office became the first in the U.S. to authorize charter schools. Indianapolis Cultural Districts were designated in 2003, followed by the groundbreaking of the Indianapolis Cultural Trail in 2007. Further consolidation of city and county units of government resulted in the establishment of the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department in 2007. Later that year, Greg Ballard succeeded Peterson in a political upset.[78] The Ballard administration oversaw the lease of the city's parking meters and the sale of the city's water and wastewater utilities with proceeds financing street repairs. Ballard pursued several environmental sustainability efforts, including establishing an office of sustainability, installing 200 miles (320\u00a0km) of bike lanes and trails, and spearheading a controversial deal to start an electric carsharing program.[79][80] Two of the city's largest capital projects, the Indianapolis International Airport's new terminal and Lucas Oil Stadium, were completed in 2008.[81][82] In 2012, construction began on a $2\u00a0billion tunnel system designed to reduce sewage overflows into the city's waterways.[83] Since 2016, the administration of Joe Hogsett has focused on addressing a rise in gun violence and the city's racial disparities. In recent years, significant capital and operational investments have been made in public safety, criminal justice, and public transit. The city also established rental assistance and food security programs. In 2020, the George Floyd protests in Indiana prompted a series of local police reforms and renewed efforts to bolster social services for mental health treatment and homelessness.[84][85] In 2021, a mass shooting occurred at a FedEx facility on the city's southwest side, killing nine (including the gunman) and injuring seven others.[86][87]"

The erosive advance and retreat of glacial ice produced a flat or gently sloping landscape, known as a till plain. Elevations across Indianapolis vary from about 650 feet (198\u00a0m) to 900 feet (274\u00a0m) above mean sea level.[93] Indianapolis is located in the West Fork White River drainage basin, part of the larger Mississippi River watershed via the Wabash and Ohio rivers.[94] The White River flows 31 miles (50\u00a0km) north-to-south through the city and is fed by some 35 streams, including Eagle Creek, Fall Creek, Pleasant Run, and Pogue's Run.[95] The city's largest waterbodies are artificial quarry lakes and reservoirs."

On January 11, 1820, the Indiana General Assembly authorized a committee to select a site in central Indiana for the new state capital, appointing Alexander Ralston and Elias Pym Fordham to survey and design a town plan for Indianapolis. Ralston had been a surveyor for the French architect Pierre L'Enfant, assisting him with the plan for Washington, D.C. Ralston's original plan for Indianapolis called for a town of 1 square mile (2.6\u00a0km2), near the confluence of the White River and Fall Creek.[96] Known as the Mile Square, the plan followed a grid pattern centered on a traffic circle called Monument Circle, from which Indianapolis's \"Circle City\" nickname originates.[97] Four diagonal avenues\u201a\u00c4\u00eeIndiana (northwest), Kentucky (southwest), Massachusetts (northeast), and Virginia (southwest)\u201a\u00c4\u00eeradiated a block from Monument Circle.[98] The city's address numbering system originates at the intersection of Washington (running east\u201a\u00c4\u00ecwest) and Meridian streets (running north\u201a\u00c4\u00ecsouth).[99] Beginning construction in 1836, the 8-mile (13\u00a0km)-long Indiana Central Canal is the oldest extant artificial facility in the city. Between 1985 and 2001, nearly 1.5 miles (2.4\u00a0km) of the former canal in downtown Indianapolis was redeveloped into the Canal Walk, a cultural and recreational amenity. North of 18th Street, the canal retains much of its original appearance, flowing through the northside neighborhoods of Riverside, Butler\u201a\u00c4\u00ecTarkington, Rocky Ripple, and Broad Ripple. This segment has been recognized as an American Water Landmark since 1971.[100][101] Compared to American cities of similar populations, Indianapolis is unique in that it contains some 200 farms covering thousands of acres of agricultural land within its municipal boundaries.[102] Equestrian farms and corn and soybean fields interspersed with suburban development are commonplace on the city's periphery, especially in Franklin Township.[103]"

The district is also home to several sculptures and memorials, Depew Memorial Fountain, and open space, hosting many annual civic events.[105] After completion of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument, an ordinance was passed in 1905 restricting building heights on the traffic circle to 86\u00a0ft (26\u00a0m) to protect views of the 284\u00a0ft (87\u00a0m) monument.[106] The ordinance was revised in 1922, permitting buildings to rise to 108\u00a0ft (33\u00a0m), with an additional 42\u00a0ft (13\u00a0m) allowable with a series of setbacks.[106] A citywide height restriction ordinance was instituted in 1912, barring structures over 200\u00a0ft (61\u00a0m).[107] Completed in 1962, the City-County Building was the first high-rise in the city to surpass the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument in height.[108] A building boom, lasting from 1982 to 1990, saw the construction of six of the city's ten tallest buildings.[109][110] The tallest is Salesforce Tower, completed in 1990 at 811\u00a0ft (247\u00a0m).[111] Indiana limestone is the signature building material in Indianapolis, widely included in the city's many monuments, churches, academic, government, and civic buildings.[109]"

From 1950 to 1970, nearly 100,000 housing units were built in Marion County, most outside Center Township in suburban neighborhoods such as Castleton, Eagledale, and Nora.[115] Since the 2000s, downtown Indianapolis and surrounding neighborhoods have seen increased reinvestment mirroring nationwide market trends, driven by empty nesters and millennials.[116][117] Renewed interest in urban living has been met with some dispute regarding gentrification and affordable housing.[118][119][120] According to a Center for Community Progress report, neighborhoods like Cottage Home and Fall Creek Place have experienced measurable gentrification since 2000.[121] The North Meridian Street Historic District is among the most affluent urban neighborhoods in the U.S., with a mean household income of $102,599 in 2017.[122]"

Most state departments and agencies are based in the neighboring Indiana Government Center complex.[375] The Indiana Governor's Residence is on Meridian Street in the Butler\u201a\u00c4\u00ecTarkington neighborhood, about 5 miles (8.0\u00a0km) north of downtown. In the Indiana House of Representatives, Indianapolis is split between 16 districts.[376] In the Indiana Senate, the city is split between nine districts.[377] The Birch Bayh Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse houses the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana. Most federal field offices are located in the Minton-Capehart Federal Building. From 1906 to 1991, the U.S. Army operated Fort Benjamin Harrison in neighboring Lawrence. About 5,000 federal employees work for the Defense Finance and Accounting Service, headquartered at the former base.[378] Indianapolis is split between two of Indiana's nine congressional districts: Indiana's 7th congressional district, represented by Andr\u221a\u00a9 Carson, and Indiana's 6th congressional district, represented by Greg Pence."

        "content": "Until fairly recently, Indianapolis was considered one of the most conservative major cities in the U.S.[379][70] According to 2014 research published in the American Political Science Review, the city's policy preferences are less conservative than the national mean when compared with other large U.S. cities.[380] While Indianapolis as a whole leans Democratic, the southern third of the city, consisting of Decatur, Perry, and Franklin townships, trends Republican.[381] Republicans held the mayor's office for 32 years (1967\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1999), and controlled the City-County Council from its inception in 1970 to 2003.[70] In the 2000 United States presidential election, Marion County voters narrowly selected George W. Bush over Al Gore by a margin of 1.3%, but voted in favor of John Kerry by a margin of 1.9% in the 2004 United States presidential election. Presidential election results have increasingly favored Democrats, with Marion County voters selecting Joe Biden over Donald Trump in the 2020 United States presidential election, 63.3\u201a\u00c4\u00ec34.3%.[382] Incumbent mayor Democrat Joe Hogsett faced Republican State Senator Jim Merritt and Libertarian Doug McNaughton in the 2019 Indianapolis mayoral election. Hogsett was elected to a second term, with 72% of the vote.[383] The 2019 City-County Council elections expanded Democratic control of the council, flipping six seats to hold a 20\u201a\u00c4\u00ec5 supermajority over Republicans.[384]"

IFD directs operations for Indiana Task Force 1 (IN-TF1), one of 28 FEMA Urban Search and Rescue Task Force teams in the U.S.[386] The Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department (IMPD) is the city's primary law enforcement agency. IMPD's jurisdiction covers Marion County, excluding the municipalities of Beech Grove, Lawrence, Southport, and Speedway (all of which operate separate forces). In 2020, IMPD had 1,700 sworn police personnel and 250 civilian employees across six districts.[387] In 2022, the Community Justice Campus opened, housing the Marion County Sheriff's Office, a new courthouse, jail, and mental health and substance abuse clinic.[388] The Indiana National Guard's major command units and joint headquarters staff are based at the former Stout Army Air Field on the city's southwest side.[389] Unlike other major Midwest cities like Detroit and Chicago, the homicide rate for Indianapolis remained below the national average throughout the 1990s.[390] Homicides hit a spike in 1998 when the city reached 162 murders. Murders drastically decreased in the following years but spiked again in 2006 with 153 murders.[391] Until 2019, annual criminal homicide numbers had grown each year since 2011, reaching record highs from 2015 to 2018.[392] With 144 criminal homicides, 2015 surpassed 1998 as the year with the most murder investigations in the city. With 159 criminal homicides, 2018 stands as the most violent year on record in the city.[392] FBI data showed a 7% increase in violent crimes committed in Indianapolis, outpacing the rest of the state and country.[393] Law enforcement has blamed increased violence on a combination of root causes, including poverty, substance abuse, and mental illness.[394]"

About 1.5% used all other forms of transportation, including taxicab, motorcycle, and bicycle. About 3.1% of working city residents worked at home.[458] In 2015, 10.5 percent of Indianapolis households lacked a car, which decreased to 8.7 percent in 2016, the same as the national average in that year. Indianapolis averaged 1.63 cars per household in 2016, compared to a national average of 1.8.[459] Four primary Interstate Highways intersect the city: Interstate 65, Interstate 69, Interstate 70, and Interstate 74. The metropolitan area also has two auxiliary Interstate Highways: a beltway (Interstate 465) and connector (Interstate 865). The Indiana Department of Transportation manages all Interstates, U.S. Highways, and Indiana State Roads within the city. The city's Department of Public Works maintains more than 3,400 miles (5,500\u00a0km) of streets and 510 bridges,[460] in addition to alleys, sidewalks, and curbs. Sidewalks are absent from nearly 2,000 miles (3,200\u00a0km) of the city's roadways,[460] contributing to Indianapolis's low walkability among peer U.S. cities.[461] However, city officials have increased investments in bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure in recent years.[457] About 110 miles (180\u00a0km) of trails and greenways form the core of the city's active transportation network, connecting into 115 miles (185\u00a0km) of on-street bike lanes.[462][299] Popular routes include the Fall Creek Greenway, Monon Trail, and Pleasant Run Greenway.[454] The privately managed Indianapolis Cultural Trail operates Indiana Pacers Bikeshare, the city's bicycle-sharing system, which consists of 525 bicycles at 50 stations.[463] IndyGo operates and manages the city's public bus system, including bus rapid transit, microtransit, and paratransit services. The Julia M. Carson Transit Center serves as the downtown hub for 27 of its 31 fixed routes.[464][454] In 2020, IndyGo's fleet of 212 buses provided about 4.8\u00a0million passenger trips (compared with pre-COVID-19 pandemic ridership of 9.2\u00a0million in 2019).[465] The Central Indiana Regional Transportation Authority is a quasi-governmental agency that organizes regional car and vanpools and operates three public shuttle buses connecting Indianapolis to employment centers in suburban Plainfield and Whitestown.[466] Indianapolis International Airport's Colonel H. Weir Cook Terminal contains two concourses and 40 gates.[467] In 2023, the airport served 9.7 million passengers with connections to about 50 nonstop domestic and international destinations.[468] As home to the second largest FedEx Express hub in the world, IND ranks among the ten busiest U.S. airports in terms of air cargo throughput.[469] The Indianapolis Airport Authority oversees operations at five additional aviation facilities in the region, two of which are located in the city: Eagle Creek Airpark and the Indianapolis Downtown Heliport.[470] Indianapolis Union Station is the state's primary intercity bus transfer hub, served by seven carriers operating 12 routes.[471] Amtrak's Cardinal passenger rail service operates three weekly roundtrips between New York City and Chicago. Located in the enclave of Beech Grove, the Beech Grove Shops serve as Amtrak's primary heavy maintenance and overhaul facility.[472] About 282 miles (454\u00a0km)[454] of freight rail lines traverse the city, including one Class I railroad (CSX Transportation), one Class II railroad (Indiana Rail Road), and two shortline railroads (Indiana Southern Railroad and Louisville and Indiana Railroad)."

The second named storm of the 2000 Atlantic hurricane season, Beryl originated from a tropical wave near the African coastline. Tracking westward, the wave failed to organize substantially until entering the Bay of Campeche, at which time it developed into a tropical storm. Beryl rapidly deepened while in the Gulf of Mexico, and it initially was forecast to strengthen to a hurricane under favorable conditions for development. Instead, Beryl remained at moderate tropical storm intensity and failed to intensify any further. It made landfall in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas as a weak tropical storm with winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) on August\u00a015, 2000 and dissipated over mountainous terrain shortly thereafter. One death was reported in Mexico due to drowning. Otherwise, no significant damage was reported associated with Beryl, as it affected a sparsely populated area of Mexico."

        "content": "A tropical wave emerged from the African coast with a closed circulation on August 3. It tracked westward across the tropical waters of the Atlantic Ocean and broke into two distinct parts, the northern portion eventually became Hurricane Alberto. The southern portion continued to track westward into the Caribbean Sea, while producing little or no deep convection. The wave reached Mexico's Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula on August 12, and only then did deep convection redevelop, mostly due to diurnal heating. The wave emerged over the Bay of Campeche early on August 13 as a large area of low pressure. The wave was upgraded to Tropical Depression Five later that day, based on satellite intensity estimates and an observation from an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft.[1] Six hours after developing, the depression was forecast to strengthen into a hurricane early on August 16 due to the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico and little wind shear to inhibit development.[2] The tropical depression traveled to the northwest across the southwest Gulf of Mexico.[1] It strengthened rapidly, and there was evidence of deep convection as it passed over warm waters.[3] It was upgraded to Tropical Storm Beryl late on August 14 with surface winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h), based on reconnaissance aircraft observation.[1] Six hours later, the storm accelerated to near 9\u00a0mph (14\u00a0km/h), meaning that landfall would happen sooner than expected, preventing the time for Beryl to strengthen to a hurricane.[4] However, Beryl failed to undergo significant intensification as was forecast, as it maintained an intensity of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h). The lack of intensification could be due to moderate wind shear and entrainment over the Gulf of Mexico. Tropical Storm Beryl continued to track to the northwest toward the Rio Grande Valley area in the southern portion of the U.S. state of Texas. The storm made landfall early on August 15 along the Mexican coast about 105\u00a0mi (169\u00a0km) south of Brownsville, Texas, 35\u00a0mi (56\u00a0km) north La Pesca, Tamaulipas[1] and about 115\u00a0mi (185\u00a0km) north of Tampico. Beryl was downgraded to a tropical depression about five hours after landfall.[1] The Brownsville radar showed that the circulation center of the storm became elongated parallel to the mountain ranges of northeastern Mexico, so the system was no longer declared a tropical depression late on August 15,[5] while located near Monterrey.[1]"

        "content": "The National Hurricane Center began issuing hurricane warnings early on August 14, anticipating that Beryl would reach hurricane strength. The warnings were issued along the Texas coast from Baffin Bay to the United States\u2013Mexico border. The Government of Mexico issued hurricane warnings from the borderline south to La Pesca. The hurricane warnings issued stretched for 230 miles (370\u00a0km) along the coast. Mexico also issued a tropical storm warning south of La Pesca to Tampico. A storm surge of 2 to 5 feet (0.61 to 1.52\u00a0m) was expected along the coast near and to the north of Beryl's center. Rainfall between 5 and 10 inches (127 and 254 millimetres) were also expected.[6] Thousands of residents in coastal areas of southern Texas and northern Mexico were asked to pay attention to the hurricane warnings and to move towards higher ground. The National Weather Service warned the cities of Cameron and Kenedy, and Willacy County in southern Texas that severe flooding is the deadliest threat associated with the storm. In low-lying rural areas near the mouth of the Rio Grande, an estimated 20,000 residents were urged to seek shelter, as the inadequate drainage in these areas make them in danger to severe flooding. The National Weather Service also warned of possible tornadoes forming when associated with thunderstorms and tropical storm generated winds. Authorities in southern Texas filled 20,000 sandbags along the shores, and closed government offices. Residents nailed plywood on windows, parks were temporarily closed, and documents were transferred to waterproof storage areas.[7] The warnings remained in effect for twelve hours, then they were discontinued north of Port Mansfield in Texas. The hurricane warning was downgraded to a tropical storm warning in all areas between Port Mansfield southwards to Tampico. It was predicted the rains from Beryl could produce dangerous flash floods and mudslides over the mountainous areas of Mexico.[8] When Beryl made landfall early on August 15, all warnings were discontinued in Texas.[9] All warnings issued in the Government of Mexico were discontinued six hours later when Beryl was downgraded to a tropical depression.[10]"

The eleventh tropical depression and the seventh tropical storm of the season, Grace was also the weakest storm of the season. On August 30 the storm developed from a long-track tropical wave in the western Gulf of Mexico. Grace remained disorganized throughout its lifetime due to an upper-level low to its west. The weak storm moved northwestward and made landfall on southeastern Texas. Grace quickly weakened over land, and dissipated on September 2 as it merged into a cold front. In Texas, the storm dropped heavy rainfall, causing minor flash flooding. The cold front, combined with the remnants of the storm, dropped moderate to heavy rainfall from Texas through the Mid-Atlantic. The worst of the flooding occurred in Indianapolis, where record rainfall affected over 700 homes. Despite the rainfall, damage was minimal along its path."

        "content": "A strong tropical wave accompanied with a low pressure system moved off the coast of Africa on August 19. It moved quickly westward and organized, developing banding features and cirrus outflow near the blossoming convection. The wave nearly developed into a tropical cyclone on August 21, though its fast forward motion dislocated the low level circulation from the deep convection. The wave entered an area of dry air in the central Atlantic Ocean, and by late on August 22 most of the convection dissipated from the system. On August 24, convection increased as the wave passed through the Lesser Antilles, though strong southwesterly upper level wind shear prevented further development. The tropical wave moved through the Caribbean Sea, and developed deep convection due to more favorable conditions over the Gulf of Honduras on August 28. The wave crossed the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, and developed a surface low pressure area on the 29th in the Gulf of Mexico. Convection continued to organize, and the tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Eleven on August 30 while located 335 miles (539\u00a0km) east-southeast of Corpus Christi, Texas.[1] The depression moved to the northwest, and intensified into Tropical Storm Grace six hours after forming. Despite the increase in winds the center of circulation remained very broad, with Reconnaissance Aircraft having difficulty pinpointing the center. In addition, an upper-level low located over Brownsville, Texas produced shear over the western portion of the system, which limited outflow to the east side. Forecasters predicted the upper-level low to weaken, allowing for the possibility of Grace to intensify to a 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) tropical storm over warm waters.[2] However, the upper-level low remained in place and continued to produce shear across the system. A new center of circulation reformed 115 miles (185\u00a0km) north of the original center, and made landfall near San Luis Pass on the southwestern portion of Galveston Island on August 31 as a minimal tropical storm. Grace quickly weakened to a tropical depression over land, and after turning northeastward into Oklahoma the depression was absorbed by a cold front.[1]"

The waterspout dissipated before moving onshore. The storm also caused light beach erosion, though little occurred beyond the erosion caused by Hurricane Claudette one month prior.[3] Near the coast, high tides from the storm flooded piers, bulkheads, and low-lying areas.[4] Further inland, heavy rainfall lead to flash flooding, covering roads and entering a few houses. Overall, damage was minor, and totaled to $113,000 (2003\u00a0USD, $147,100 2016\u00a0USD).[7][8] In Oklahoma, moisture from the storm, combined with a slow-moving cold front, produced heavy rainfall across the state, peaking at 8.98 inches (228\u00a0mm) in Courtney. Due to below normal precipitation by as much as 5 to 10 inches (127 to 254 millimetres), flooding was localized and overall minimal. Near Medford, the rainfall led to 2 feet (0.61\u00a0m) deep flooding on U.S. Highway 81, forcing its closure. The rainfall was welcome in the state, and lessened the rainfall deficit.[9] Tropical Storm Grace, combined with the slow-moving cold front, produced light to moderate rainfall totals across the southern United States, including isolated locations in Louisiana and Mississippi reporting over 3 inches (76\u00a0mm) and over 5 inches (130\u00a0mm) in northeastern Arkansas.[6]"

Residents prepared sand bags to prevent overflowing rivers and creeks, though rising waters entered streets and over 700 homes. The rapid rainfall in Indianapolis backed up the sewage system, sending hundreds of millions of gallons of sewage into the streets. Following the deluge in the state, the governor declared a state of emergency for the state. Eight local American Red Cross chapters arrived to provide meals and aid to the affected people.[12] The remnants of Grace dropped moderate to heavy rainfall eastward through the Mid-Atlantic States and New England. Locations in extreme western Maryland and southeastern Virginia received over 5 inches (130\u00a0mm) of rain.[6] In Maryland, Hagerstown recorded 3.94 inches (100\u00a0mm), resulting in flash flooding.

It rises on the eastern slopes of the Great Dividing Range, in the Border Ranges west of Bonalbo, near Rivertree at the junction of Koreelah Creek and Maryland River, on the watershed that marks the border between New South Wales and Queensland. It flows generally south, south east and north east, and is joined by twenty-four tributaries including Tooloom Creek and the Mann, Nymboida, Cataract, Orara, Coldstream, Timbarra, and Esk rivers. It descends 256 metres (840\u00a0ft) over the course of its 394-kilometre (245\u00a0mi) length and empties into the Coral Sea in the South Pacific Ocean, between Iluka and Yamba.[4] On its journey it passes through the towns of Tabulam and Copmanhurst, the city of Grafton, and the towns of Ulmarra, and Maclean. The river features many large river islands, including Woodford, Chatsworth, Ashby, Warregah and Harwood islands; and Susan Island Nature Reserve. The river supports a large prawn trawling and fishing industry. The Clarence River system is an extensive east coast drainage with many tributaries of differing size. The 195km Clarence Canoe and Kayak Trail is the longest mapped whitewater trail in Australia.[citation needed] Its basin is, together with the very similarly-sized Hawkesbury, Australia's largest Pacific watershed south of Bundaberg.[citation needed] The extremely intense rainfalls that typify the North Coast mean, however, that major floods can temporarily raise the flow of the Clarence to 24 feet, as happened in 1890.[5]"

At higher altitudes, rainfall may reach 2,000 millimetres (79\u00a0in) on exposed slopes but data are very poor. Most of the high areas actually receive no more rain than Grafton though variability from year to year is less. Temperatures are generally very warm, with maxima in lower area ranging from 27\u00a0\u00b0C (81\u00a0\u00b0F) in January to 19\u00a0\u00b0C (66\u00a0\u00b0F) in July. In the highlands, however, temperatures are much cooler and in July range from lows of around 2\u00a0\u00b0C (36\u00a0\u00b0F) to maxima around 13\u00a0\u00b0C (55\u00a0\u00b0F) - though in January days remain very warm at around 25\u00a0\u00b0C (77\u00a0\u00b0F). Rainfall per month on the coast typically ranges from around 220 millimetres (8.7\u00a0in) in February and March to around 70 millimetres (2.8\u00a0in) in September; it can average as low as 40 millimetres (1.6\u00a0in) between May and September inland, where exposed areas sometimes suffer bushfires after droughts, as occurred in 1915 and 2000."

Of particular interest is the small island town of Harwood, where a Sperry New Holland factory and a quaint Bush Pub overlook the Clarence delta. Harwood is also the location of the local sugar mill, the Harwood Sugar Mill built in 1873 and is the oldest Australian mill still operational. The sugar mill is situated on the river due to its importance in transporting sugar cane from farms in the surrounding area in previous times. Harwood is just after the Harwood Bridge on part of Australia's National Highway from Sydney, Port Macquarie, Coffs Harbour to Brisbane.

It was initially called the Big River, but this caused confusion as the Gwydir River in northern New South Wales was also colloquially known by this name.[9] In November 1839 the Governor of New South Wales, George Gipps, officially changed the name to the Clarence River[10] in honour of the previous King of the British Empire, William IV, 1st Duke of Clarence and St Andrews.[1] The local government area of the Clarence Valley Council draws its name from the river and covers the lower half of the river valley."

The deforestation of the area causes the water runoff and is one of the main reasons they have flash floods.[4] One of the effects of the clearing of land for agriculture use is the heavy soil erosion that occurs in the Cameron Highlands.[5] This is a contributing factor to the floods because as the people illegally clear the land, the runoff can carry more silt with it. This places large amounts of silt into the rivers making them shallower and easier to fill which causes floods.[6] On top of this, the rivers are narrow due to the structures built on the banks and even illegal extensions into the river.[6] Another issue contributing to the water runoff is the use of plastic roofing over plots of vegetation. These areas would normally offer some buffer to flooding by absorbing water. Instead, the plastic used by many people in the area speeds up the rainwater running off into the rivers which can lead to the floods.[6]"

Yap is one of the four administrative divisions of the FSM. The entire island, only 17\u00a0km (11\u00a0mi) in length, experienced typhoon force winds, and 90% of the structures were damaged or destroyed. Damage was most severe in southeastern Yap, where the eyewall struck and winds exceeded 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph), but the center of the typhoon passed south of the island. Typhoon Sudal originally formed on April\u00a02, 2004, out of a persistent area of convection east of the FSM. It moved mostly westward for the first week of its duration, with brief northerly and southwesterly turns. Sudal attained tropical storm status on April\u00a05, and it gradually intensified into a typhoon, which is a tropical cyclone with winds of at least 119\u00a0km/h (74\u00a0mph) and is the equivalent of a hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean. On April\u00a09, it passed just south of Yap, and shortly thereafter its peak winds were estimated at 240\u00a0km/h (150\u00a0mph). Later, Sudal moved to the northwest and eventually to the northeast, becoming an extratropical cyclone on April\u00a016 and dissipating two days later. In addition to the damage on Yap, the typhoon dropped heavy rainfall in Chuuk in the Federated States of Micronesia, where some minor crop damage occurred. Sudal also brushed the United States islands of Guam and Rota with high waves and light rainfall, and later moved very close to the uninhabited Japanese island of Iwo Jima. Overall damage was $14\u00a0million (2004\u00a0USD, $16.1\u00a0million 2010\u00a0USD), most of which was on Yap, although no fatalities or serious injuries were reported.

Initially, it was in an area of high wind shear, which is the change in wind direction with height and is unfavorable for tropical cyclogenesis. The unfavorable conditions gradually abated, which allowed convection to increase over a broad, developing circulation center.[1] On April\u00a02, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a weak tropical depression near Chuuk in the FSM. It was later classified with the international designation of 0401, meaning it was the first tropical cyclone of 2004.[2] Slow development continued as the system moved slowly westward, and two days later it was classified as Tropical Depression 03W by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC); this was the third tropical cyclone tracked by the agency. Shortly thereafter, the JTWC upgraded the depression to tropical storm status, after convection increased over the circulation.[1] While steadily intensifying, the system turned toward the north. On April\u00a05, the JMA named the system Sudal, after assessing its maximum 10-minute sustained winds at 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph).[2] Concurrently, the JTWC estimated 1-minute sustained winds of 100\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph).[1] After crossing over the island of Poluwat,[3] a building ridge to the north caused Sudal to turn west-southwestward. On April\u00a06, an eye feature began forming, and the JTWC upgraded Sudal to typhoon strength about 540\u00a0km (340\u00a0mi) southeast of Guam, a small island under possession of the United States.[1] The JMA did not follow suit until late the following day,[2] by which time the eye had become more distinct.[1] Around that time, the typhoon turned toward the northwest, and initially it was thought that Sudal would pass safely north of Yap in the FSM.[3] Instead, it turned to the west-southwest toward the island as the ridge intensified. On April\u00a08, the typhoon intensified rapidly; the JTWC reported 1-minute winds of 215\u00a0km/h (130\u00a0mph), or the equivalent of a Category\u00a04 on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale. Weakening slightly as its forward motion slowed, Typhoon Sudal passed about 45\u00a0km (28\u00a0mi) south of Yap at 0000\u00a0UTC on April\u00a09, which was its closest approach to the island.[1] Intensification continued throughout the day on April\u00a09, with the appearance of concentric eyewalls on satellite imagery; such a feature is indicative of an intense tropical cyclone. Early on April\u00a010, the JTWC estimated that Sudal attained peak 1-minute sustained winds of 240\u00a0km/h (150\u00a0mph), making the cyclone a super typhoon.[1] At the same time, the JMA estimated peak 10-minute winds of 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph), as well as a barometric pressure of 940\u00a0mbar (27.76\u00a0inHg).[2] Also on that day, Sudal entered the area of warning responsibility of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), which provided the name \"Cosme\" for local advisories. For several days, the typhoon continued to the northwest, fluctuating in intensity but remaining powerful. On April\u00a012, Sudal turned toward the north and northeast through a weakness in the ridge, and its eye increased to a diameter of about 85\u00a0km (53\u00a0mi). The next day, the typhoon attained a secondary peak intensity with 1-minute sustained winds reaching 230\u00a0km/h (145\u00a0mph), although it gradually weakened subsequently due to a combination of increasing upper-level wind shear and cooler water temperatures.[1] Early on April\u00a015, Sudal passed very near the uninhabited Japanese island of Iwo Jima as a rapidly weakening typhoon; at the time, its circulation center was exposed from the deepest convection.[1] Shortly thereafter, both the JTWC and JMA downgraded Sudal to tropical storm status.[1][2] Late on April\u00a015, the JTWC assessed the storm as becoming extratropical, although the JMA maintained advisories until the following day. As an extratropical storm, Sudal continued northeastward until losing its identity early on April\u00a018, well east of Japan and far south of the Aleutian Islands.[1]"

        "content": "Early in its duration as a weak tropical storm, Sudal passed near Chuuk state in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM). One station reported 170\u00a0mm (6.5\u00a0in) of rainfall in a 24\u2011hour period. The passage of the storm left minor roof damage and some crop damage, due to storm surge contaminating groundwater. No deaths or injuries were reported in the state.[3] The storm briefly threatened Guam,[1] and as it passed south of the island, Sudal produced 5.5\u00a0m (18\u00a0ft) waves and a 0.9\u00a0m (3.0\u00a0ft) storm surge. A station at Apra Harbor recorded a 69\u00a0km/h (43\u00a0mph) wind gust, and light rainfall of around 50\u00a0mm (2.0\u00a0in) was reported, although no damage was reported on the island. High waves also occurred on Rota in the Northern Mariana Islands.[4] The FSM is an independent nation in Compact of Free Association with the United States, and the latter nation is responsible for aid and protection.[5] Further west, Typhoon Sudal intensified quickly as it moved through the Caroline Islands and later Yap state. On Ulithi, a wind gust of 132\u00a0km/h (82\u00a0mph) was reported, and 6.34 inches (161\u00a0mm) of rainfall occurred in a 24\u2011hour period. High waves of over 5\u00a0m (16\u00a0ft) struck the island, causing severe beach erosion and damaging subsistence crops. The winds downed a few trees and wrecked some poorly built homes. On nearby Faraulep and Fais islands, similar meteorological conditions and damages were reported. The small Ngulu Atoll received gale-force winds and heavy rainfall, which destroyed half of the island's water storage tanks.[3] Later in its duration, Sudal passed near Iwo Jima, producing wind gusts of 141\u00a0km/h (88\u00a0mph).[1]"

        "content": "The worst of the damage occurred on the island of Yap. Initially, the typhoon was expected to pass north of the island without affecting it significantly, but instead the island experienced the brunt of the storm.[3] Typhoon Lupit affected the island in the previous year, from which the islanders were still recovering. With the last minute change in direction, government officials rushed to complete preparations on the island. On the day before the typhoon struck, storm shelters were opened in schools and government buildings that could withstand the winds of Sudal. In anticipation of significant damage, Yap officials sent a request to the FSM government for emergency aid to clean up after the storm.[6] On April\u00a09, the eye of Sudal briefly passed over the southern portion of the island, and winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph) struck the island for about four hours.[3] The entire island, only 17\u00a0km (11\u00a0mi) in length, experienced typhoon force winds.[7] Yap International Airport recorded a peak wind gust of 181\u00a0km/h (112\u00a0mph); a subsequent survey estimated wind gusts on the island reached 226\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph). Heavy rainfall occurred during Sudal's passage, including 200\u00a0mm (7.9\u00a0in) in a 48\u2011hour period at the airport. The lowest pressure on the island was 958.5\u00a0mbar (28.30\u00a0inHg). Along the coast, the typhoon produced waves of 6.7\u00a0m (22\u00a0ft) in height, along with a 3.7\u00a0m (12\u00a0ft) storm surge;[3] the combination sunk several ships and heavily damaged the island's coral reefs, the latter which is one of Yap's primary tourism attractions.[3][8] When Typhoon Sudal struck the island, there were about 8,000\u00a0people living on Yap, with about 1,700\u00a0houses. The typhoon destroyed 700\u00a0homes, and left another 900\u00a0damaged; many of the destroyed homes were wooden. Damage was heaviest in the southeastern portion of the island,[3] including in and around Colonia, the capital city.[9] The strong winds downed trees across the island.[10] Over 90% of the structures on the island were damaged or destroyed, including the hospital, airport, most government facilities, and the water, power and communications systems.[3] One of the five hotels on the island was also destroyed.[11] About 80% of the residents lost power or water after the storm. In the southeastern portion of the island, high waves wrecked most of the coastal homes, and also severely damaged the seawall. The intrusion of salt water destroyed almost all of the food crops on the island. Following the typhoon's passage, about 1,000\u00a0people were left homeless, and another 500 were forced to stay in shelters.[3] Overall damage from Typhoon Sudal totaled about $14\u00a0million (2004\u00a0USD, $16.1\u00a0million 2010\u00a0USD), most of which on Yap from property damage. Despite the heavy damage, there were no deaths,[3] although there were initial reports of one fatality.[1] Only 8\u00a0people required hospital treatment due to injuries,[11] none of them serious.[1] Typhoon Sudal was the strongest typhoon to strike Yap in about 50\u00a0years.[7]"

        "header": "Aftermath",
        "content": "Following the passage of Sudal, officials in Yap declared a state of emergency,[12] and a day after the typhoon struck, United States President George W. Bush ordered federal disaster aid for the FSM. The latter declaration provided funding for 75% of the debris removal cost and emergency services.[13] Less than a week after the storm, the Pacific Islands Forum provided $11,500 to Yap for relief efforts.[14] Over the subsequent weeks, the FSM government established a typhoon relief fund of about $250,000. Additionally, the United States government allocated $7,443,000 for relief efforts.[11] Within a few days, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) identified primary concerns for the small island, including fixing the water supply, distributing water, clearing roads, and fixing damaged shelters. On the island, the water supply was rapidly diminishing;[12] more than 80% of the islanders were without clean water, and the water from the treatment plant needed to be boiled for extended periods of time.[15] Health issues included dehydration, sickness, and gastrointestinal problems.[12] Without running water, several people bathed in the oil-contaminated harbor where many boats sunk, which caused skin irritations.[8] Initially, telephone service onto the island was disrupted, and the only method of outside contact was by radio to the University of Guam. The Guam Memorial Hospital dropped a package of medical supplies to Yap, although planes containing aid flying onto the island were disrupted by the damaged runway.[16] About a day after Sudal's passage, the runway was cleared and repaired, which allowed a United States Coast Guard plane to provide relief supplies, including building materials.[9] By April\u00a012, or three days after the typhoon, communication links to the island began to be restored.[10] By four days later, the water treatment plant was repaired. One power station on the island was repaired, but since the strong winds damaged most of the power lines, about 85% of the population remained without electricity. Primary roadways were largely cleared, and all bridges were reopened.[8] About two weeks after the typhoon's passage, there were still 500\u00a0people in 18\u00a0shelters in Colonia, the capital city, as well as about 400\u00a0people in shelters elsewhere.[17] Many others were either residing with relatives or staying at their damaged properties.[18] The United States Army Corps of Engineers arrived on Yap to coordinate debris removal and installing generators. Officials sent 23\u00a0flights of aid to the island, as well as one each to the outlying islands of Ulithi and Fais. About 76,000\u00a0litres (20,000\u00a0gallons) of water were sent to the island, and five large water tanks were installed. Members of the United States Forest Service arrived to coordinate the receiving and distribution of relief supplies.[17] The Yap hospital was poorly suited to handle the typhoon, due to the lack of medications or emergency medical equipment. About 60\u00a0FEMA personnel worked at the hospital, who required additional items, such as their own supply of water and food, to prevent them from acquiring local diseases. During their stay on the island, the group assisted 163\u00a0people, mostly for minor issues.[5] Overall, there were about 100\u00a0FEMA workers involved on the island, although only 20 stayed there due to lack of hotels and rental cars.[18] By 26\u00a0days after the storm, more than half of the island had power restored, and the cell phone system was fixed.[11] In the weeks and months after the passage of Sudal, water temperatures around Yap decreased from 30 to 24\u00a0\u00b0C (86 to 75\u00a0\u00b0F), due to significant upwelling. The drastic decrease caused unusual amounts of fog over the island, as well as significantly lower tides.[7] By September 2004, rebuilding was still underway, and half of the schools, which had previously been used as shelters, reopened to students. Power and water lines were completely restored. The hospital remained damaged with a temporary roof, and although private businesses quickly re-opened, government buildings took longer to be rebuilt; this was due to the lengthy process of receiving aid from FEMA.[19] Additionally, officials required a land survey to determine where structures were safe to be rebuilt.[5] Due to the heavy damage on Yap, the name Sudal was retired during the 38th session of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific and World Meteorological Organization typhoon committee in November 2005; it was replaced with the name Mirinae.[20]"

Emilia later turned to the north, passing near Baja California as a strong tropical storm. Subsequently, the storm moved further away from the coast, and on July 27 it dissipated. The storm brought tropical storm force winds and precipitation to the southwestern Mexican coastline. Later, Emilia produced similar conditions in the southern portion of the Baja California peninsula, where its passage caused minor damage and flooding.

The system moved westward,[1] developing a well-defined low-pressure area about 525 miles (845\u00a0km) southwest of Acapulco by July 19.[2] The next day, its forward motion had shifted to a slow north-northwest track, and with its convection continuing to organize around the low, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) remarked on the potential for tropical cyclogenesis.[3] Early on July 21, its thunderstorm activity organized enough for the NHC to classify it as Tropical Depression Six-E, located to the southwest of Acapulco.[1] Upon becoming a tropical cyclone, the depression existed in an area of weak steering currents,[4] though a general motion to the north-northwest was influenced by a large subtropical ridge over the southwest United States.[1] The circulation was initially located east of the main convection, due to the presence of wind shear.[4] Convection increased near the center despite the shear, and on July 22 the depression attained tropical storm status about 400\u00a0mi (640\u00a0km) south of Manzanillo, Colima; it was named Emilia by the NHC.[5] Around the same time, the storm was developing better-defined rainbands,[1] and with favorable conditions expected, Emilia was forecast to attain hurricane status; the NHC noted the potential for rapid deepening as the storm passed near southwestern Mexico.[6] Early on July 23, the storm briefly became disorganized, with the low-level circulation becoming ill-defined.[7] Around the same time, Emilia passed about 175\u00a0mi (282\u00a0km) southwest of Manzanillo, which was its closest approach to southwestern Mexico; it is believed to have caused tropical storm force wind gusts along the coastline.[1] Later that day, after turning west-northwestward, the convection increased markedly as an eyewall began to form.[8] Operationally, it was estimated to have reached winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h), and it was forecast to continue strengthening to attain Category\u00a02 status on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale.[9] However, the NHC later re-assessed Emilia as reaching peak winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h), since the eye feature was temporary and not well-defined.[1] Shortly after reaching peak intensity, a sharp increase in wind shear caused Emilia to weaken quickly to winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h).[1] Operationally, the NHC initially continued to assess the storm as with winds of 70\u00a0mph (115\u00a0m/h), with hurricane status predicted.[10] However, the decrease in strength became evident on July 24, when dry air became entrained in the circulation; at the same time, the convection became limited to the southern semicircle of the storm.[11] On July 25, the wind shear decreased as the storm turned toward the Baja California Peninsula,[1] despite that tropical cyclones affecting the Baja California Peninsula in the month of July are rare.[12] Convection increased in coverage,[11] and an eye feature re-appeared early on July 26 as it again attained peak winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h).[1] Emilia maintained peak winds for about 18\u00a0hours, during which it passed about 60\u00a0mi (97\u00a0km) southwest of Cabo San L\u00e1zaro, which is a cape located southwest of Ciudad Constituci\u00f3n on the southwestern coast of the Baja California peninsula. After brushing the peninsula with its outer rainbands, Emilia turned away from the coast into cooler waters, and subsequently began to weaken rapidly. On July 27 it deteriorated into a tropical depression, and the next day Emilia degenerated into a convective-less remnant low. The low continued westward until turning northward on July 30, and on July 31 the remnants of Emilia dissipated about 495\u00a0mi (797\u00a0km) west-southwest of San Diego, California.[1]"

        "content": "As Emilia first approached the southwest coast of Mexico, officials issued a tropical storm watch from Manzanillo to Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco; the watch was discontinued 30\u00a0hours after it was issued. The storm passed the region on July 22, and is believed to have produced tropical storm force wind gusts along the coastline. A ship recorded 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h) winds while Emilia was just off the coast.[1] Further up the coast, in Mazatl\u00e1n, strong waves from the storm caused beaches to close, while the outer fringes of the storm dropped 4.68 inches (119\u00a0mm) of precipitation.[13] Inland, the interaction between Emilia and a tropical wave brought increased moisture and precipitation to southeastern and central Mexico.[14] When Emilia began turning toward the Baja California Peninsula, the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm watch from Buena Vista along the Gulf of California to Bah\u00eda Magdalena along the Pacific coast. The watch was replaced with a tropical storm warning about 12\u00a0hours prior to the closest approach of the storm, and additional warnings were issued along the Pacific coastline as the storm passed. All watches and warnings were discontinued by July 27.[1] Officials prepared two schools as emergency shelters in Cabo San Lucas,[15] where 100\u00a0people stayed during the storm.[16] In the area, the threat of the storm resulted in the closure of several bars and restaurants.[15] Across the southern portion of the Baja California peninsula, the storm dropped moderate rainfall, with a total of about 5 inches (130\u00a0mm) reported in Cabo San Lucas; the NHC remarked that higher amounts likely occurred in higher elevations. The rainfall caused minor flooding in and around Cabo San Lucas. Along the southern coast of the peninsula, Emilia produced tropical storm force winds; two stations reported sustained winds of 43\u00a0mph (69\u00a0km/h), with one of those reporting wind gusts to 55\u00a0mph (89\u00a0km/h). The storm caused minor damage to buildings and utility lines. Waves from the storm left minor damage at several marinas in the region, with several being closed for two days.[1] The effects of Emilia reached the southwestern United States. In southern Arizona, a surge of moisture from the storm produced scattered thunderstorms, including one severe thunderstorm in Santa Cruz County. The cell dropped heavy rainfall and large hailstones in a short amount of time; one location reported hail of 1.75 inches (44\u00a0mm) in diameter. The rainfall, which totaled several inches in some areas, caused flash flooding, with 8 inches (200\u00a0mm) of floodwater reported at one location along Interstate 19. Thunderstorms in Graham County produced a wind gust of 64\u00a0mph (103\u00a0km/h) at the airport in Safford. Unsettled conditions persisted across Arizona for about a week.[17] In southern California, the storm dropped light rainfall, which assisted firefighters in containing a wildfire.[18]"

Jerry, the tenth tropical storm of the season, formed from a tropical wave that moved off the African coast in early August, which organized into a tropical depression and tropical storm between the Bahamas and Florida later in the month, before striking Florida in the latter part of the month. Its remnant circulation persisted until five days after landfall. The rainfall it produced, amounting to over 12 inches (300\u00a0mm) in several locations across Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina, was responsible for $40\u00a0million (2005\u00a0USD) in damage and 6 deaths. At the time, Jerry was the earliest tenth storm to form in a season on record, until Jose in the 2005 season overtook it.[1] Tropical Storm Jerry was also the first tropical cyclone to make landfall in South Florida since Hurricane Andrew in 1992."

While passing through the islands, convection greatly increased, causing wind gusts of up to 45 miles per hour (72\u00a0km/h), though it remained disorganized. On August 22, convection organized while the system was over the western Bahamas, and it developed into Tropical Depression Eleven later that day. Conditions were only marginally favorable due to lack of outflow to its west, but the depression strengthened to reach tropical storm status on August 23.[2] Jerry, having reached tropical storm strength 33 miles (53\u00a0km) east of the coast of Florida, moved to the northwest and hit Jupiter later on August 23. It continued to the northwest across the state, and remained a tropical storm until late on August 24 when it entered the Gulf of Mexico over Citrus County. It remained over waters briefly until moving inland in Dixie County on August 25. It continued slowly northward, entering Georgia on August 26. The weak depression turned to the east, and dissipated into a trough of low pressure on August 28 near the Georgia/South Carolina border. The trough developed two circulation centers, one of which moved eastward while the other moved southward. The latter drifted southwestward across Florida until dissipating in early September. It is unknown if either of the circulations are directly related to the original center of Jerry.[2]"

During the first storm tide, on 22 February, the East Frisian island of Juist was split in two. During the second disaster, on 4\u20135 March, the city of Amsterdam was flooded.[citation needed] In the past, the two storm tides were thought to have been a single event. The two disasters were confused with each other because two different calendars were in use at the time. The Julian calendar was still in use in Northern Germany and some parts of the Netherlands, while the Gregorian calendar had already been adopted in Holland, Zeeland and other parts of the Netherlands.[citation needed] The year 1651 was something of an annus horribilis for flooding, with many disastrous floods in Europe. In the Netherlands, for instance, another storm tide that struck during the night of 25\u201326 February broke through a number of dikes and flooded large parts of the eastern Netherlands.[citation needed]"

Only in 1932 would the two halves of Juist be reunited.[2] The western half of the island of Buise disappeared, leaving only the eastern half, now known as Norderney. According to some sources, however, the western half of Buise did not disappear until 1690. The foundations of Juist's church were undermined by the floodwaters, causing the church to collapse in 1662.[3] The coastal towns of Dornumersiel, Accumersiel, and Altensiel were devastated by the storm tide. The floodwaters reached the church mound (terp) of Fulkum; many corpses were buried on the mound.[4] The flood even reached the Altes Land, south of the city of Hamburg, leaving the lake of Gutsbrack.[5]"

In the Netherlands, it was considered the heaviest storm tide to hit the shores in 80 years.[citation needed] The dikes protecting the east of Amsterdam broke in a number of places, flooding the Watergraafsmeer polder and much of the city of Amsterdam. Two gaps struck in the Zeeburgerdijk\u00a0[nl] left two ponds in what is now the Indische Buurt neighbourhood of eastern Amsterdam. The Groote Braak (\"Great Break\") or St. Jorisbraak (\"St. George's Break\") was filled in 1723 and the smaller Braak was filled in 1714.[6] The storm tide also left a small lake, the Nieuwe Diep (Amsterdam)\u00a0[nl], which was never filled in and is still in existence.[citation needed] In the Watergraafsmeer polder, five people were killed. After the disaster, the dikes were restored and the floodwater was pumped out again and on 15 July 1652, the inhabitants of the Watergraafsmeer paraded through their polder to celebrate that it was dry once again.[citation needed] The storm tide also struck elsewhere in Holland. In Scheveningen, Katwijk and Den Helder, houses were carried away by the waves. The newly constructed dike between the cities of Amsterdam and Haarlem was breached, flooding the area around Haarlem. A dike was also breached at Edam.[citation needed] The northern provinces of Friesland and Groningen were affected as well. In Friesland, the storm tide broke through the dikes surrounding the Dokkumer Grootdiep\u00a0[nl] (a canal connecting Dokkum to the sea), leaving a small, round pond, the Mallegraafsgat\u00a0[nl] or Sint Pitersgat, which is still in existence. The disaster spurred plans to close off the Dokkumer Grootdiep from the sea with sluice gates. In Groningen, the Dollart bay was struck by the storm tide.[citation needed]"

        "content": "Tropical Storm Beryl was an unusual Atlantic tropical cyclone that formed over southeastern Louisiana in August 1988. The second tropical storm of the 1988 Atlantic hurricane season, Beryl developed from a slow-moving trough of low pressure on August 8. It tracked southeastward into the coastal waters of eastern Louisiana, and Beryl reached peak winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) while located about 75 miles (121\u00a0km) southeast of New Orleans. The storm turned to the northwest over Louisiana and Texas, and slowly dissipated. The remnants of Beryl continued northward into the central United States, dropping some rainfall and providing relief to a severe heat wave. Due to its slow motion, Beryl dropped heavy amounts of rainfall, peaking at 16.09 inches (409\u00a0mm) on Dauphin Island in Alabama. The rainfall caused some reports of flooding, while prolonged durations of rough waves resulted in severe beach erosion. The waves capsized a boat in Mobile Bay, killing one of its passengers. Overall damage was minor, totaling about $3\u00a0million (1988\u00a0USD, $5.46\u00a0million 2009\u00a0USD)."

        "content": "A weak surface trough of low pressure emerged into the northeast Gulf of Mexico on August 1. Under weak steering currents, the trough drifted westward, and slowly became better defined with the formation of a circulation in the mid- through upper-levels of the atmosphere. An upper-level low developed over Texas, providing unfavorable amounts of vertical wind shear. A surface circulation was first evident on satellite imagery on August 4 just off the coast of Mississippi, and for several days it remained nearly stationary over the Mississippi Sound. As the upper-level low over Texas drifted southwestward, an anticyclone developed over the system, with the circulation becoming better defined and more vertically aligned. On August 7, the system drifted into southeastern Louisiana. It continued to become better organized, and on August 8 it developed into Tropical Depression Three while located near the northern coast of Lake Pontchartrain.[1] This is unusual in that tropical cyclones rarely form over land.[2] Upon becoming a tropical cyclone, the depression drifted southeastward, and within hours of its formation it emerged into the Gulf of Mexico. Based on ship reports and observations from oil rigs, it is estimated the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Beryl at 1000\u00a0UTC on August 8 while located just offshore coastal Louisiana.[1] Conditions remained favorable for further intensification, with the circulation located over warm waters and maintaining well-defined outflow; early on August 9 Beryl attained its peak intensity of 50\u00a0mph while located about 75 miles (121\u00a0km) southeast of New Orleans. Shortly thereafter, a trough from the northwest dissipated the anticyclone and resulted in a steady northwest motion very near where the cyclone originally moved offshore. Beryl maintained tropical storm status for about 18\u00a0hours before weakening to a tropical depression over central Louisiana. It turned to the northwest, and the surface circulation dissipated on August 10 while located a short distance south of Shreveport, Louisiana.[3] The surface low pressure area crossed into north Texas before dissipating early on August 12, while its upper-level circulation turned northward into Oklahoma before being merged by an approaching trough.[4]"

A 15-year-old boy on the boat drowned, the only direct fatality from the storm. The boy's father, also on the boat, spent 24\u00a0hours in the water before being rescued by the United States Coast Guard. The waves caused severe beach erosion along the coastline, with Dauphin Island losing 60 to 70 feet (18 to 21\u00a0m) of beach.[6] In Mississippi, coastal areas reported heavy amounts of precipitation, reaching over 10 inches (250\u00a0mm) in Jackson County. Sustained winds reached 47\u00a0mph (76\u00a0km/h) at Gulfport, the strongest wind on a land station.[9] Similar to Alabama, strong waves caused considerable beach erosion along portions of the coastline.[6] Beryl dropped rainfall across much of Louisiana, peaking at over 10 inches (250\u00a0mm) near Morgan City.[4] The rainfall caused significant river flooding along the Biloxi River.[10] Wind gusts were fairly light across the state, reaching 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h) in New Orleans.[9] The winds caused light tree damage, which resulted in some power outages. A storm surge of about 5 feet (1.5\u00a0m) caused some coastal flooding.[6] The remnants of Beryl produced locally heavy precipitation peaking at about 12 inches (300\u00a0mm) in east-central Texas,[9] resulting in some reports of flash flooding.[6] The rainfall flooded some roads and also causes severe river flooding on the Angelina River.[11] Remnant moisture dropped about 5 inches (130\u00a0mm) of rain in southeast Oklahoma and 3 inches (76\u00a0mm) in southwestern Arkansas.[4] Further inland, the remnants of Beryl cooled temperatures and provided relief to the severe heat wave in the central United States.[12] Throughout its path, Beryl caused about $3\u00a0million in damage (1988\u00a0USD, $5.46\u00a0million 2009\u00a0USD), primarily along the immediate coastline from erosion or flood damage.[6]"

The village and other parts of the valley were flooded in 1965 to create Llyn Celyn reservoir, in order to supply Liverpool and Wirral with water for industry.[1] The Tryweryn flooding was opposed by 125 local authorities and 27 of 36 Welsh MPs voted against the second reading of the bill with none voting for it. At the time, Wales had no Welsh office (introduced in 1964) or any devolution.[2]"

        "header": "History",
        "content": "The villagers first knew about the proposal a few days before Christmas 1955, from reading about it in the Welsh edition of the Liverpool Daily Post.[3] The villagers created the Capel Celyn Defence Committee, which debated and denounced the scheme all over Wales through newspapers, radio and television. The villagers marched twice to Liverpool in 1956 to make their objections known. However, Liverpool councillors voted overwhelmingly to proceed.[3] In 1957, a private bill sponsored by Liverpool City Council was brought before Parliament to develop a water reservoir in the Tryweryn Valley. The development would include the flooding of Capel Celyn. By obtaining authority via an Act of Parliament, Liverpool City Council would not require planning consent from the relevant Welsh local authorities and would also avoid a planning inquiry at Welsh level at which arguments against the proposal could be expressed. This, together with the fact that the village was one of the last Welsh-only speaking communities in the area,[4] ensured that the proposals became deeply controversial; 35 out of 36 Welsh Members of Parliament (MPs) opposed the bill (the other did not vote), but in 1962 it was passed. The members of the community waged an eight-year effort, ultimately unsuccessful, to prevent the destruction of their homes. The Tryweryn flooding was opposed locally by the Capel Celyn Defense Committee led by Dafydd Roberts and Elizabeth May Watkin Jones.[5] Altogether, 125 local authorities opposed the plan, and 27 of 36 Welsh MPs voted against the second reading of the bill with none voting for it.[2] When the valley was flooded in 1965, the village and its buildings, including the post office, the school, and a chapel with cemetery, were all lost. Twelve houses and farms were submerged, and 48 people of the 67 who lived in the valley lost their homes.[6] In all, some 800 acres (3.2\u00a0km2; 320 ha) of land were submerged. A new reservoir, Llyn Celyn, was formed. The water in the reservoir is used to maintain the flow of the River Dee (Afon Dyfrdwy) so that water may be abstracted downstream,[7] and additionally to improve the quality of white-water sports on Afon Tryweryn. A full list of the submerged properties (broadly from west to east) is as follows:  Stones from the chapel (built in 1820 and rebuilt in 1892) and other buildings in the village were used in the construction of Capel Celyn Memorial Chapel, designed by the Welsh sculptor R. L. Gapper with the Liverpool City architect Ronald Bradbury, which was completed in 1967 and overlooks the reservoir at the north-west end. It is a Grade II* listed building.[8][9] Families who had relatives buried in the cemetery were given the option of moving them to another cemetery. Eight bodies were disinterred and the remainder left. All headstones were supposed to be removed, and the cemetery was to be covered in layers of gravel, then concrete, but this was not done.[6] When the reservoir dried due to a drought in the 1980s and early 1990s the village became visible. The whole of the walled cemetery next to where the chapel stood was completely covered in concrete.[citation needed] There were no gravestones left standing. The removed headstones are in a memorial garden at the memorial chapel."

On the hillside above the house was a space encircled by a low stone wall where larger meetings were held, and beyond the house was a small burial ground. From this valley came many of the early Quakers who emigrated to Pennsylvania, driven from their homes by persecution to seek freedom of worship in the New World."

        "header": "Political effects",
        "content": "Almost unanimous Welsh political opposition had failed to stop approval of the scheme, a fact that seemed to underline Plaid Cymru's argument that the Welsh national community was powerless.[10] At the subsequent general election, the party's support increased from 3.1% to 5.2%. Of perhaps greater significance, however, was the impetus the episode gave to Welsh devolution. The Council for Wales recommended the creation of a Welsh Office and Secretary of State for Wales early in 1957, a time when the governance of Wales on a national level was so demonstrably lacking in many people's eyes.[11] By 1964 the Wilson government gave effect to these proposals. The flooding of Capel Celyn also sharpened debate within Plaid Cymru about the use of direct action. While the party emphasised its constitutional approach to stopping the development, it also sympathised with the actions of two party members who (of their own accord) attempted to sabotage the power supply at the site of the Tryweryn dam in 1962.[11] A more militant response was the formation of Mudiad Amddiffyn Cymru (\"Wales Defence Movement\") or MAC, which blew up a transformer on the dam construction site in February 1963. MAC went on to carry out a number of other bombings in the next six years. In October 1965, the Llyn Celyn reservoir opened, and there was a sizeable Plaid Cymru-organised demonstration. A year later, Gwynfor Evans won Plaid Cymru's first parliamentary seat in Carmarthen. But according to some commentators, Capel Celyn did not play a major part in Gwynfor Evans's victory: in addition to Carmarthen's long distance from Tryweryn, they claim that Plaid Cymru's victory owed as much to an anti-Labour backlash in the constituency's mining communities as it did to Plaid's successful depiction of Labour's policies as a threat to the viability of small Welsh communities.[12][13] On 19 October 2005, Liverpool City Council issued a formal apology for the flooding.[14][15] Some in the town of Bala welcomed the move, though others said the apology was a \"useless political gesture\" and came far too late.[16]"

The 2015 United Kingdom election took place during the flooding's 50 year anniversary, and saw the UK Conservative Party campaign on the St David's Day Agreement which would give further powers to the Welsh government.[17] The agreement's proposals effectively meant that any Welsh laws on water could be overruled by UK ministers if they judged it would have a serious adverse effect on the water supply in England. As such, the proposals were heavily criticised in Wales; both the Welsh Government and Plaid Cymru stated that a new agreement was needed to address the issues around devolved, reserved and excepted matters, especially on the emotive subject of water.[18][19] In backing the UK government's proposals, Secretary of State for Wales Alun Cairns directly referenced the Tryweryn flooding, stating that the UK proposals were \"about righting a wrong from 50 years ago\", adding that UK Government proposed settlement \"sends a strong message\" on how the UK and Welsh governments relate to each other.[20] The discussions would eventually lead the UK government losing the power to intervene in any laws relating to water (and many other areas) enacted by the Welsh Government, with supporters of the new Wales Act 2017 describing it as \"preventing another Tryweryn\". Alun Cairns again backed the amended act, stating that the new arrangement showed \"how far we have come from the events of 52 years ago, which resulted in the flooding of the Tryweryn Valley\".[21]"

Guest-starring Matthew Rhys, a native Welshman, the episode was the result of a story told by Rhys on a night out with the show's creators (earning Rhys a writing credit).[28] Capel Celyn and the reservoir also play a part in the 2016 Welsh film Yr Ymadawiad (The Passing, in English). The flooding of the valley seems to provide inspiration for the film's plot, and the movie is better understood and takes on a deeper level of poignancy when the history of the flooding is known.

It urges Welsh speakers to remember the destruction of a Welsh-speaking community and to safeguard the language. One instance of this motto is a graffito on the wall of a ruined stone cottage by the A487 at Llanrhystud, outside Aberystwyth[30] which has come to be regarded as a \"national landmark\".[31] Meic Stephens claimed to have been the first to paint the wall in the 1960s,[30] with the slogan Cofiwch Tryweryn (sic, without the initial soft mutation and therefore grammatically incorrect). Since then, a number of people have repainted the wall, and the word Tryweryn has been corrected to Dryweryn. In 2010, a fundraising campaign was launched to preserve the wall by Llanrhystud Community Council. \u00a380,000 was needed, with Cadw declaring that it would contribute \u00a330,000 to the fund.[32] The wall has been vandalised over on a number of occasions. In May 2008, the words were altered to \"Angofiwch Dryweryn\" ('forget Tryweryn').[33] The monument was defaced in April 2010, and a spokesperson for the Welsh Government said they were \"disappointed\" by the incident.[31] Incidents of vandalism also occurred throughout the years, e.g. in 2013 and 2014.[30] In 2017, the words Cofiwch Aberfan 1966 (\"Remember Aberfan\") were added underneath the original message. This message was referring to the Aberfan disaster of 1966, when the collapse of a colliery spoil tip above the village of Aberfan led to the deaths of 144 people, 116 of them children. The original message was repainted in August 2018 but was again defaced in February 2019, when it was painted over with the name Elvis, a reference to the American rock-and-roll singer Elvis Presley.[34][35] After the memorial was repainted, vandals knocked over parts of the wall.[36] In response to the vandalism a wave of Cofiwch Dryweryn memorials were painted throughout Wales and further afield also.[37] The monument is featured in the music video for the Manic Street Preachers' single \"Distant Colours\".[38]"

The first named storm, hurricane, and major hurricane of the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season, Alex developed from the interaction between an upper-level low and a weak surface trough on July 31 to the east of Jacksonville, Florida. It moved northeastward, and strengthened to attain winds of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) before passing within 10 miles (16\u00a0km) of the Outer Banks coast. Alex strengthened further and reached a peak of 120\u00a0mph (190\u00a0km/h) winds while off the coast of New England, one of only six hurricanes to reach Category 3 status north of 38\u00b0\u00a0N.[1] Alex caused a scare of a hurricane-force direct hit in the Outer Banks of North Carolina, which had been devastated by Hurricane Isabel less than a year earlier. The hurricane produced light damage in the Outer Banks, primarily from flooding and high winds. Over 100\u00a0houses were damaged, while numerous cars were disabled from the flooding. Damage totaled about $7.5\u00a0million (2004\u00a0USD). Alex produced strong waves and rip tides along the East Coast of the United States, causing one death and several injuries."

Although conditions were not favorable for tropical cyclone formation, it sped to the northwest and steadily organized, developing a surface area of low pressure on the 30th. On July\u00a031, the system continued to organize, and developed into Tropical Depression One while located 200 miles (320\u00a0km) to the east of Jacksonville, Florida.[3] As the depression drifted erratically, the system remained weak due to its large circulation and lack of deep convection near the center.[4] The center relocated to the south,[5] closer to the center. An approaching upper-level trough lessened the shear over the system, allowing the depression to intensify into Tropical Storm Alex on August\u00a01. The trough also caused Alex to increase its forward motion to the northeast. Deep convection continued to build over the center due to low shear and warm waters from the Gulf Stream, and Alex intensified into a hurricane on August\u00a03 while located 75 miles (121\u00a0km) southeast of Cape Fear, North Carolina. The cyclone continued to strengthen, and attained Category 2 status just hours after becoming a hurricane. The hurricane approached the Outer Banks of North Carolina, coming within 11 miles (18\u00a0km) of Cape Hatteras later on the 3rd. The western portion of the eyewall passed over the Outer Banks, though the center remained offshore.[3] Alex turned to the east-northeast after passing the Outer Banks in response to becoming embedded within the west-southwesterly flow. The hurricane briefly weakened to a Category\u00a01,[3] but restrengthened due to warm waters of the Gulf Stream.[6] Water temperatures remained 3.6\u00a0\u00b0F (2.0\u00a0\u00b0C) above normal, resulting in Alex intensifying into a 120\u00a0mph (190\u00a0km/h) major hurricane on August\u00a05 while located 450 miles (720\u00a0km) south of Halifax, Nova Scotia.[7] Due to low vertical shear and favorable conditions, Alex remained a Category\u00a03 hurricane until passing over cooler waters late on the 5th while 290 miles (470\u00a0km) south of Newfoundland. Alex rapidly weakened, degrading into tropical storm status on August\u00a06. Later on the 6th, Alex became extratropical while 950 miles (1,530\u00a0km) east of Cape Race, Newfoundland, and lost its identity shortly thereafter.[3]"

In addition, a tropical storm warning existed for much of the North Carolina coastline as Alex paralleled the state.[3] Despite Tropical Storm Warnings, 3,500\u00a0tourists remained on the Outer Banks, though many planned to leave if Alex were to track closer or become stronger. No evacuations were ordered.[9][10] Officials recommended residents to take precautions for the approaching hurricane.[11] The National Weather Service in Morehead City issued a flash flood watch a day before the hurricane moved past the Outer Banks. The service also issued flash flooding warnings for Craven and Carteret Counties on the day of the hurricane's closest approach.[12] In preparation for the hurricane, the Cape Lookout National Seashore was closed and evacuated.[13] The National Park Service also closed Cape Point Campground.[14]"

        "content": "While drifting off the coast of Florida, Alex produced rip currents and strong waves along the North Carolina coast resulting in nine lifeguard rescues from the surf.[9] Upon moving by the Outer Banks, a storm surge of up to 6 feet (1.8\u00a0m) occurred on the Pamlico Sound side of Buxton and Ocracoke Village. The flooding on Ocracoke Island was the worst since Hurricane Gloria nineteen years earlier. Elsewhere on the Outer Banks, waters rose 2\u20134 feet (0.61\u20131.22\u00a0m) above normal. Rainfall directly along the coast amounted to over 5 inches (130\u00a0mm), while Ocracoke experienced 7.55 inches (192\u00a0mm). Maximum sustained winds peaked at 88\u00a0mph (142\u00a0km/h), and gusts peaked at 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h) in Morehead City.[3] Beach erosion was minor along much of North Carolina's coastline, with the exception of Ocracoke Island where erosion was significant.[12] Cape Fear experienced minor beach erosion. The erosion, combined with high waves, washed out a portion of a roadway.[15] The heavy rainfall in the Outer Banks disabled over 200\u00a0cars[16] and flooded nearly 500.[17] Strong wind gusts left around 10,000\u00a0buildings without power.[18] Many places were not restored for two to three days after the storm.[12] Wind and storm surge damaged over 100\u00a0houses and buildings. Damage amounted to about $7.5\u00a0million (2004\u00a0USD).[17] Two days after the storm passed, a man drowned off of Nags Head from strong rip currents and waves. This was the only direct casualty from the storm.[3] Alex's outer rainbands produced heavy rainfall across Virginia, peaking at over 7 inches (180\u00a0mm) in the center of the state.[19] The rainfall caused localized flooding, but there was no reported damage in the state.[20] In Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, rip currents produced by the storm injured three people. A few young children had to be rescued when they were trapped by a jetty.[21] In New Jersey, the strong surf and rip currents hospitalized at least five swimmers.[22] Alex's extratropical remnants sank the Pink Lady, a rowboat carrying four British rowers attempting to break the record for fastest crossing from St. John's, Newfoundland to Falmouth, Cornwall. They were rescued by a Danish cargo ship, and injuries were limited to a mild concussion and a case of hypothermia. The rowers were roughly two weeks and 370 miles (600\u00a0km) from their destination. The group had been on track to break the 1896 record of 54\u00a0days by 10\u00a0days.[23]"

Tourists were also evacuated by ferry to Swan Quarter, in Hyde County, where they boarded school buses and were taken to nearby Washington NC to rent available cars or find accommodations. The island was re-opened to visitors on August\u00a06, three days after the storm passed through. Evacuation was ordered again on Friday of the following week when another storm threatened to hit the Outer Banks, but did not do so.[16] Dare County officials requested aid from the National Guard for the cleanup process. The North Carolina Department of Transportation was ready to clear the roads once the storm exited the area.[25] Alex marked the fifth-latest start to a hurricane season since 1952.[26] The latest start to a hurricane season since 1952 was Hurricane Anita of the 1977 season, forming on August\u00a029.[1] Alex is only the second hurricane on record to have reached Category\u00a03 strength north of 38\u00b0N latitude. The other storm was Hurricane Ellen in the 1973 Atlantic hurricane season; Alex was the stronger of the two.[7] It is also one of only five hurricanes to be at major hurricane (Category 3 or higher) status within Canadian waters since 1950.[27]"

It dumped 292\u00a0mm (11.5\u00a0in) of rain on Darwin, then known as Palmerston.[2] It uplifted roofs, uprooted trees and telegraph poles destroying almost all of the buildings.[3] The only remaining structures include the historic Victoria Hotel, doctors residence, BAT House, the Commercial and E. S. & A. Banks and the Court House. These remaining structures housed scores of homeless residents after the cyclone.[4] There were 28 fatalities, mostly Chinese and Aboriginal people.[5][6] One family was reported to have run from three different houses as they were destroyed around them, surviving without injury. Illness spread throughout the predominantly homeless population after the cyclone.[4] While little is known about the Aboriginal loss of life, the deaths of a couple of women who sought refuge in the Roman Catholic Church before its collapse were documented.[7] The other major loss of life occurred on Darwin Harbour, with the deaths of many \"coloured persons\" working in the pearling industry. Of 29 vessels in the harbour at the time, 18 were wrecked, mostly pearling luggers such as the Flowerdale, Maggie, Roebuck, Cleopatra, Olive, Florence, Revenge, Jack, Black Jack, Brisbane and Galatea. The government steam launch and three sampans were also damaged. Many crews donated to the rebuilding efforts. The pearling fleet was quickly restored and expanded and by 1898, 55 vessels were operational.[7] The damage is estimated to have cost over \u00a3150,000 in 1897 values.[2]"

This contributed to the heavy flooding. The storm brought an estimated 28 billion gallons of water.[14] Rainfall at McCarran International Airport, near the Las Vegas Strip, measured 1.29 inches. However, other parts of the valley received more rain, with up to 3 inches in some areas. The average rainfall for the year is only 4 inches.[10][8][7] Flood waters subsided by 4:30 p.m.[10] It was the worst flood since 1984,[2] and it remains the most destructive flood in Las Vegas history.[15] Although initially reported as a 100-year storm, geologists subsequently determined it to be a 15- or 20-year event based on measurements.[4] At the time, the flood control network was 20-percent finished, with $400 million already spent on the project.[16] Detention basins helped mitigate the severity of the storm.[17][18][19] Las Vegas mayor Oscar Goodman said the 1999 flood would have been \"a disaster to end all disasters\" if not for the existing flood network facilities.[16]"

At the time, only around 12,300 homeowners had flood insurance in the entire state.[22] The Flamingo Wash travels west to east across the Las Vegas Valley, serving as a major route for flood water.[23] However, the wash was backed up by debris in the eastern Las Vegas Valley. As a result, water flooded onto nearby Boulder Highway, causing extensive road damage.[24] A particularly hard-hit area was the Miracle Mile Mobile Home Park, located along Boulder Highway. Walls in the Flamingo Wash were eroded by the flood waters; several mobile homes fell over the weakened ledge and into the wash, while others suffered water damage. Of 540 trailers in the park, two dozen were declared uninhabitable.[25] Firefighters, ambulance workers, and 911 operators were overwhelmed by storm-related emergencies. This included motorists who were left stranded after flood waters stalled their vehicles.[10][14] Police and firefighters carried out 163 rescues, some by helicopter.[6][2][16] Several roof collapses also occurred due to the heavy rainfall.[10][14][13] The flood resulted in two deaths, including a 91-year-old woman who died in a three-car accident attributed to the waters; a Mercedes-Benz, driven by poker player Shawn Sheikhan, hydroplaned into the woman's vehicle. The other victim, believed to have been a homeless man, died of drowning and was found in the Flamingo Wash.[26][27][22] Most casinos suffered only minor leaks. The Caesars Palace resort on the Strip saw the worst of the flooding, which forced the day-long closure of a casino pit and the resort's shopping mall, the Forum Shops.[28][29] Across the street, the parking garage at the Imperial Palace resort saw flood waters rising three feet and was closed for several hours.[10][14] Both Caesars Palace and the Imperial Palace (now The Linq) are located along the Flamingo Wash, and are frequent sites for flooding.[6][16][30] The Resort at Summerlin delayed its opening by several days due to minor flood damage.[31][32] Approximately 20 departing flights were delayed at McCarran International Airport, and four incoming flights were diverted to other airports outside of the state.[29] The North Las Vegas Airport closed its radio tower for the day after losing power.[10] Sunrise Hospital & Medical Center lost 95 percent of its phone service after a lightning strike. MountainView Hospital closed its birthing and surgical unit due to leaks.[10] Some shows on the Strip were canceled due to the flood, as entertainers had difficulty reaching their venues.[33] Roughly half of retailers at the Meadows Mall and Boulevard Mall were closed; many store employees were either unable or unwilling to arrive for work because of the flooding, and some stores closed early, allowing workers to return home safely before the weather worsened.[29]"

County workers had nearly 180 repair jobs; some were expected to take a year to carry out.[46] One bridge did not reopen until three years after the flood.[48] In 2000, the county announced plans to improve the Flamingo Wash near the Miracle Mile Mobile Home Park, easing resident concerns about future flooding.[49] Some residents living near the Duck Creek Wash sued the county, alleging that inadequate maintenance of the wash led to residential flooding in the area. In 2003, the county agreed to pay residents $1.1 million.[50][51][52] In the 10 years following the flood, the regional flood control network was more than doubled in size. The $700 million project increased the number of detention basins, flood channels, and storm drains.[2] As of 2019, the flood district's master plan was 75-percent finished.[53] At the time, it included 100 detention basins and 648 miles of channels, with $1.9 billion spent up to that point.[6][13]"

Its effects centered on Metro Manila, the surrounding provinces of the Calabarzon region (Quezon, Cavite, Laguna and Rizal) and the provinces of Central Luzon (Bulacan, Pampanga and Bataan). Not a typhoon in its own right, the storm was a strong movement of the southwest monsoon (Tagalog: Habagat) caused by the pull of Typhoon Saola (Gener) from August 1\u20133, strengthened by Typhoon Haikui. It caused typhoon-like damage: the most damage caused by rain since September 2009, when Typhoon Ketsana (Ondoy) struck Metro Manila. The heavy rain caused the Marikina River to overflow, destroying areas also affected by Ketsana, triggering a landslide in the Commonwealth area and collapsing the northbound Marcos Highway. Its damage was nearly as severe as Ketsana's, although the storm did not reach typhoon intensity when the rain reached its peak on August 7. The floods and rain left 95 people dead,  8,428 homes destroyed and 6,706 damaged. Nationwide losses totaled at least \u20b1604.63\u00a0million (US$14.31\u00a0million).[1][2]"

Typhoon Gener did not make landfall in the Philippines, and occupied a small portion of the northern Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR). It pulled southwest-monsoon winds from the South China Sea and damaged the City of Manila, causing a storm surge and striking the fish ports of Navotas and Malabon. It broke a large part of the sea wall on Roxas Boulevard, and caused tons of refuse be washed onto the Baywalk. Portions of Metro Manila damaged by Typhoon Nesat (Pedring) in 2011 were under repair when the storm hit."

If temperature is below freezing, 0\u00a0\u00b0C (32\u00a0\u00b0F), near the ground and up in the clouds, precipitation will fall as snow, ice, rain and snow mixed (sleet), ice pellets or even graupel (soft hail).[1][2] Since cold air can not hold as much moisture as warm air, the total precipitation will be less than at higher temperature.[3] Winter storm warnings will be issued if: Snowstorms with wind speed of more than 35\u00a0mph (16\u00a0m/s) and reduced visibility of less than 0.25 miles (400\u00a0m) for 3 hours or longer are called blizzards.[5][4]"

        "header": "Snowstorm",
        "content": "Snowstorms are storms where large quantities of snow fall. 2\u00a0in (5.1\u00a0cm) of snow is enough to create serious disruptions to traffic and school transport (because of the difficulty to drive and manoeuvre the school buses on slick roads). This is particularly true in places where snowfall is not typical but heavy accumulating snowfalls can occur. In places where snowfall is typical, such small snowfalls are rarely disruptive, because of effective snow and ice removal by municipalities, increased use of four-wheel drive and snow tires, and drivers being more used to winter conditions. Snowfalls in excess of 6\u00a0in (15\u00a0cm) are usually universally disruptive. A large number of severe snowstorms, some of which were blizzards, occurred in the United States during 1888 and 1947 as well as the early and mid-1990s. The snowfall of 1947 exceeded 2\u00a0ft (61\u00a0cm) with drifts and snow piles from plowing that reached 12\u00a0ft (3.7\u00a0m) and for months as temperatures did not rise high enough to melt the snow. The 1993 \"Superstorm\" manifested as a blizzard in most of the affected areas. Severe snowstorms could be quite dangerous: a 6\u00a0in (15\u00a0cm) snow depth will make some unplowed roads impassable, and it is possible for cars to get stuck in the snow. Snow depth exceeding 12\u00a0in (30\u00a0cm) especially in southern or generally warm climates will cave the roofs of some homes and cause loss of electricity. Standing dead trees can also be brought down by the weight of the snow, especially if it is wet. Even a few inches of dry snow can form drifts many feet high under windy conditions."

        "header": "Hazards from snowfall",
        "content": "Accumulated snow can make driving motor vehicles very hazardous. Snow on roadways reduces friction between tires and the road surface, which in turn lowers the maneuverability of a vehicle considerably. As a result, average driving speeds on public roads and highways are reduced by up to 40% while heavy snow is falling.[8] Visibility is reduced by falling snow, and this is further exacerbated by strong winds which are commonly associated with winter storms producing heavy snowfall. In extreme cases, this may lead to prolonged whiteout conditions in which visibility is reduced to only a few feet due to falling or blowing snow. These hazards can manifest even after snowfall has ended when strong winds are present, as these winds will pick up and transport fallen snow back onto roadways and reduce visibility in the process. This can even result in blizzard conditions if winds are strong enough.[9] Heavy snowfall can immobilize a vehicle entirely, which may be deadly depending on how long it takes rescue crews to arrive. The clogging of a vehicle's tailpipe by snow may lead to carbon monoxide buildup inside the cabin.[10] Depending on the temperature profile in the atmosphere, snow can be either wet or dry. Dry snow, being lighter, is transported by wind more easily and accumulates more efficiently. Wet snow is heavier due to the increased water content. Significant accumulations of heavy wet snow can cause roof damage. It also requires considerably more energy to move and this can create health problems while shoveling when combined with the harsh weather conditions. Numerous deaths as a result of heart attacks can be attributed to snow removal.[11] Accretion of wet snow to elevated surfaces occurs when snow is \"sticky\" enough which can cause extensive tree and power line damage in a manner similar to ice accretion during ice storms. Power can be lost for days during a major winter storm, and this usually means the loss of heating inside buildings. Other than the obvious risk of hypothermia due to cold exposure, another deadly element associated with snowstorms is carbon monoxide poisoning which can happen anytime combustion products from generators or heating appliances are not properly vented. Partially or fully melted snow on roadways can refreeze when temperatures fall, creating black ice."

While a 10\u00a0cm (3.9\u00a0in) snowfall is somewhat manageable by the standards of the northern United States and Canada, a comparable 10\u00a0mm (0.39\u00a0in) precipitation of an ice storm can paralyze a region; driving becomes extremely hazardous, telephone and power lines are damaged, and crops may be ruined.[12]"

After skirting western Cuba on November\u00a030, the storm reached peak winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) before striking central Florida on December\u00a01. Within hours, the system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean. The system moved onshore once more on December\u00a02 in North Carolina before turning east, away from the United States. On December\u00a05, the system is presumed to have dissipated offshore.[2] Throughout the system's existence, it was responsible for 73 fatalities, most of which resulted from offshore incidents. The worst loss of life took place off East Coast, where the 30 crewmen of the American SS Cotopaxi drowned. Property damage amounted to $3\u00a0million, $1\u00a0million of which was in Jacksonville."

        "content": "The 1925 Florida tropical storm was first identified on November\u00a027, 1925 as a tropical depression situated to the southeast of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, nearly a month after the official end of the hurricane season.[3][4] Situated over 80\u00a0\u00b0F (27\u00a0\u00b0C) waters,[5] the system slowly intensified, attaining tropical storm status roughly 12\u00a0hours after forming, as it drifted towards the southeast before abruptly turning north-northwestward. Throughout November\u00a030, the storm quickly strengthened as it brushed the western tip of Cuba with winds of 50\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h).[3] Once in the Gulf of Mexico, the storm turned northeastward and intensified to peak winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h).[2] The lowest known barometric pressure attained by the storm was 995\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.38\u00a0inHg) as it moved inland.[2] Within hours of reaching this strength, the storm made landfall just south of Fort Myers, Florida early on December\u00a01 as it began to transition into an extratropical cyclone.[2][6] The storm was originally thought to have moved ashore as a minimal hurricane, thus becoming the latest-landfalling hurricane in United States history. However, a reanalysis in 2011 lowered the peak winds.[2] While crossing the Florida peninsula, the storm briefly weakened as it completed its transition; however, once back over water, it re-intensified.[2] Off the coast of The Carolinas, the former tropical storm became a large and powerful extratropical cyclone, attaining peak winds of 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) along with a pressure of 979\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.91\u00a0inHg), measured by the USS Patoka.[3][6] Gale-force winds extended to at least New Jersey, where winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) were recorded.[2] Throughout December\u00a02, the storm gradually slowed as it tracked roughly parallel to the East Coast. Later that day, the system moved onshore again, this time between Wilmington and Cape Hatteras,[6] with winds equivalent to a minimal hurricane.[3] A strong area of high pressure located over the Canadian Maritimes caused the system to turn towards the east-southeast.[6] Over the following few days, the storm gradually weakened as it moved away from North Carolina. By December\u00a05, the storm was no longer identifiable and is presumed to have dissipated offshore.[2] However, a monthly weather review published in 1925 that documented the system indicated that the cyclone continued towards the east, eventually impacting Bermuda and the Azores.[6] Later analysis in 2009 concluded that a separate extratropical low, which formed near the remnants of the storm, was responsible for inclement weather in both areas.[2]"

Trees, power lines, and telegraph wires were knocked down by high winds along the Suwannee River.[6] Communication throughout southern Florida was severed as miles of telegraph wires were downed during the evening of November\u00a030.[7] Structures previously considered safe from storms due to their location over 100\u00a0ft (30.4\u00a0m) inland sustained significant damage, probably from storm surge. Beaches along the Atlantic coast also sustained considerable damages from the storm.[6] Four people were killed near Tampa in two separate incidents . The first occurred when a house collapsed on three men, pinning them to the ground. The second incident occurred after a woman ran outside her home and was struck by a tree limb.[8] At least 12 workmen were killed and 38 others injured after the bunkhouse they were sleeping in collapsed due to high winds.[9] The facility in which they were working in also sustained $200,000 in damage from a fire ignited by the cyclone.[10] Throughout Florida, property loses were estimated at $3\u00a0million,[11] with $1\u00a0million in Jacksonville alone. Damages to the citrus industry  were also significant, with total losses exceeding $600,000.[6] Losses in Miami amounted to $250,000 as up to 2\u00a0ft (0.61\u00a0m) inundated the city for more than two days.[12] Shipping incidents resulting from the storm caused several deaths. A schooner carrying seven people sunk, killing all its occupants. A tug boat sank off the coast of Mobile, Alabama while towing a lumber barge; the fate of the crew is unknown. A ship named the SS Cotopaxi sank between Charleston, South Carolina and the northern coast of Cuba, with all 30 crew members lost. Near Daytona Beach, a vessel carrying 2,000 cases of liquor sank along with all six crewmen. The last incident, involving a yacht, occurred off the coast of Georgia. The ship sank near Savannah, Georgia with the 12 crew members drowning. The total loss of life at sea was at least 55.[6] Shipping throughout the East Coast was crippled by the storm as vessels were forced to seek shelter at port.[13] Due to the large size of the storm as an extratropical cyclone, gale and storm warnings in force from Beaufort, North Carolina to Eastport, Maine.[14] In North Carolina, heavy rains and strong winds were reported along the coast. Near record high water rises were recorded around Wilmington.[15] Cape Hatteras was temporarily isolated from the surrounding areas as the high winds from the storm knocked down power lines throughout the area. Several buildings along the coast and numerous boats sustained considerable damage.[16] As far north as New Jersey, gale-force winds produced by the powerful extratropical storm caused significant damage and killed at least two people.[2] Large swells and high winds throughout New Jersey, southern New York and Connecticut resulted in significant damage. Along the coast of Long Island, large waves resulted in severe beach erosion which threatened to undermine homes.[17] Parts of Coney Island were inundated by the increased surf, damaging homes and businesses. Several barges in nearby marinas were torn from their moorings and swept out to sea.[18] In Sandy Hook, several workmen were nearly killed after a building collapsed amidst high winds.[17] Minor precipitation was recorded throughout Rhode Island, peaking at 0.62\u00a0in (16\u00a0mm).[19]"

As part of the Lake Erie squadron, General Hunter was present at the Battle of Lake Erie where the United States Navy defeated the British and gained control of the lake. General Hunter was captured at the battle and taken into American service. With the ship's name shortened to Hunter, she was used as a transport for the rest of the war. Following the war, the ship was sold into mercantile service. In 1816, the ship ran aground in a storm on Lake Huron and wrecked. The ship's contents were salvaged, but the wreck was left to be buried under the sand.

General Hunter was launched in 1807.[1] The ship had a displacement of 93 tons burthen and was 54 feet (16\u00a0m) long at the keel, with a beam of 18 feet (5\u00a0m) and a draught of 8\u00a0feet 6\u00a0inches (3\u00a0m).

        "content": "After launching, General Hunter lacked armament. Eight carronades were allocated to be used to arm General Hunter and fellow Provincial Marine vessel Earl of Camden. During her first six years she served on the Upper Great Lakes as a Provincial Marine patrol and transport vessel. In 1810, General Hunter and Earl of Camden were sent to Pelee Island to transport cedar timber for the construction of Queen Charlotte at Amherstburg. With the launch of Queen Charlotte in 1810, Earl of Camden was discarded and General Hunter became the only Provincial Marine vessel capable of operating on Lake Huron. However, by December 1811, the Provincial Marine had left the vessel's condition deteriorate enough that General Hunter was identified as a candidate for replacement should war break out.[4] After the War of 1812 began, General Hunter was under the command of Lieutenant Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rick Rolette when it captured the schooner Cuyahoga Packet with part of General Hull's baggage aboard, including the disposition of American forces. General Hunter approached Cuyahoga Packet on 3 July 1812, which was transporting 40 soldiers. Rolette, with six to seven of his crew, entered a longboat, rowed to the American vessel which had not heard of the declaration of war, and seized the ship at gunpoint by surprise. This was the first significant act of the war. General Hunter, alongside Queen Charlotte supported the attack and capture of Detroit on 16 August, firing on the American defensive installations.[5] In 1813, General Hunter was converted to a brig, and received two 6-pounder, four 4-pounder and two 2-pounder long guns and two 12-pounder carronades, for a total 10 guns. Commander Robert Heriot Barclay arrived at Amherstburg to take command of the squadron on Lake Erie in June 1813 and reviewed his group of vessels. He stated that General Hunter was a \"miserably small thing\". At the time, the vessel's company of 30 was mostly made up of soldiers from the army.[6]"

        "content": "At the time of Barclay's arrival, the Americans were constructing larger, more powerful ships at Erie in a bid to wrest control of the lake. Barclay intended to raid Erie and burn the new construction before the vessels could enter service, but was prevented from enacting the plan by the Army, which refused to give him the troops he needed. Barclay instead set up a blockade of Erie, intending to interdict the ships if they launched. Barclay put this plan in motion three days after arriving at Amherstburg. On 30 July 1813, Barclay's squadron lifted the blockade in order to resupply at Amherstburg. During his absence, the American commander Oliver Hazard Perry launched the ships. Upon his return, Barclay saw the powerful American ships on the lake and the squadron retreated to Amherstburg to await the launch of Detroit.[7] At the end of July, Perry began his own blockade, preventing the water transport of supplies between Long Point and Amherstburg. This caused shortages in basic provisions among the British, and also prevented the armament of Detroit from arriving. After Detroit was completed, Barclay was forced to shift guns from among his active vessels in order to arm the ship. On 9 September 1813, with Detroit added to the squadron, Barclay sailed from his anchorage in the Detroit River to break the blockade.[8] With a crew of 45, General Hunter was situated third in Barclay's line of battle, behind Detroit and in front of Queen Charlotte.[9] The vessel, now under Royal Navy command and captained by Lieutenant George Bignell, took part in the Battle of Lake Erie on 10 September. During the battle, USS\u00a0Caledonia pounded General Hunter with more powerful armament, to which the British vessel was inadequately unable to reply to. After USS\u00a0Lawrence was disabled and Perry shifted his command to USS\u00a0Niagara, the four trailing American schooners closed with General Hunter and Queen Charlotte and engaged them. Once both Detroit and Queen Charlotte struck their colours, General Hunter and the other smaller ships of the squadron surrendered.[10] After the war, General Hunter was sold to a private owner in the United States, then was soon purchased by the United States Army to become a supply vessel serving on the upper Great Lakes and the ship's name shortened to Hunter. In August 1816, while sailing from Michilimakinac at the northern end of Lake Huron to Detroit, Hunter was caught in a violent gale, and the crew were forced to beach the ship on the Canadian side of the lake at what is now Southampton, Ontario. The ship master, seven crew members and two young passengers were all able to get safely ashore.[11][12]"

A full interior excavation of the hull in 2004 provided hundreds of artifacts. The artifacts and a 3\u20444-size ship deck replica of General Hunter are on display at the Bruce County Museum and Cultural Centre in Southampton, Ontario.[12]"

She was hit by the storm, and though she struggled on for a short time, by the time she had reached Two Harbors, Minnesota, at 4:00 p.m. the next day, it was clear to her master, Captain R. F. Humble,[8] that she could not make the run. He gave the order to turn about, and she turned her prow toward Duluth. As she approached the port, it became clear that it was useless to try to bring both steamer and barge through the narrow Duluth Ship Canal into the harbor, so the Captain Humble gave the order to cut James Nasmyth loose. Then Mataafa attempted to make it into safe harbor alone. She made it about half-way between the twin concrete piers when a backwater surged out. Heavy water struck her stern, driving her prow down to the muddy bottom, and then slammed her stern against the north pier. Her rudder tore off and the water pulled her prow out toward the open lake, then smashed her stern against the south pier. She grounded in the shallow water outside the north pier,[9] where she broke in two, her stern settling slowly into the water.[10] When the ship broke in two, twelve men were in the aft portion; three of them struggled to the forward portion. The remaining nine remained aboard the after portion and died of exposure during the night; one of the bodies in the after half had to be chopped out of solid ice.[11] The fifteen men in the fore half fared better; although rescue attempts were futile during the stormy night, the next day a small boat made it out, and all fifteen were taken off in two boatloads.[12]"

For the rest of the day, Butler steamed north across Lake Huron. On the morning of Monday, November 27, the steamer 'Joseph G. Butler, Jr. passed Detour Reef Light and entered the Saint Marys River. Monday afternoon, Butler cleared the Soo Locks, just behind the steamer Bransford. That afternoon, the temperature was 28 degrees F (-2 degrees C). As the two steamers headed across Whitefish Bay, the barometer started downward, then plummeted, and the snow thickened. By dusk, the lookouts could barely make out the light at Whitefish Point as they cleared the bay into the body of Lake Superior. Here Bransford turned northward to follow the Canadian shore to stay north of the storm. Butler turned southwestward to take the shorter distance and pressed through the storm.[13] As Butler sighted the Caribou Island Light, the shuddering of the ship changed.  The continuous pounding of the waves on the side of the ship became interspersed with a violent shaking. Down in the engine room, the chief engineer knew that the vibration was from the propellers rising out of the water as a trough between waves running up to 10 and 20 feet (3 and 6.5 meters). First the propeller would rise out of the water, and then the spinning blades would crash back into the water. This kind of pounding could open every seam in the vessel.  It became his job to stop the blades every time they rose out of the water and get them going again once they were below the surface. If the ship were to lose headway, it would be at the mercy of the storm, but if the vibrations weren\u2019t stopped, the ship would come apart on its own. The next obstacle was Keweenaw Point jutting out into the open lake. The steward reported that the windows were out in the mess and there was 2 feet (61 cm) of water rushing back and forth.[13] All day Tuesday the 28th, Butler fought the boiling seas. At one point, with land not seen and fear of approaching a point of land, Butler turned to run with the storm, hoping to clear any unseen shoreline. Late that day, the storm began to abate, and when the captain could once again see across the lake, the light at Outer Island in the Apostles was spotted. Now a new course was set to make for Duluth. The seas were still high, but the wind had let up and the snow had stopped. Some fifty hours out of Lorain, Butler was once again on a steady course for Duluth. As she came abreast of Two Harbors, Minnesota, she spotted Bransford making for Duluth. Further ahead she sighted another steamer, which turned out to be Perry G. Walker, which had sailed from Duluth just two days earlier.[13] Approaching Duluth, Butler sighted more freighters. James Nasmyth was anchored out from Minnesota Point, sitting low in the water with a load of iron ore and a thick coating of ice. Then Butler sighted Mataafa, sitting in the shallows of Minnesota Point and split into several parts. It was noon as Butler steamed through the canal into St. Louis Bay, sighting R. W. England lying beached on the backside of Minnesota Point, a victim of the high winds the day before."

Lightfoot drew inspiration from news reports he gathered in the immediate aftermath, particularly \"The Cruelest Month\", published in Newsweek magazine's November 24, 1975, issue.[3] Lightfoot's passion for recreational sailing on the Great Lakes[4] informs his ballad's verses throughout. Recorded before the ship's wreckage could be examined, the song contains some artistic conjectures, omissions and paraphrases. In later interviews, Lightfoot recounted how he had agonized over possible inaccuracies while trying to pen the lyrics until his lead guitarist Terry Clements convinced him to do what Clements' favourite author Mark Twain would have advised: just tell a story.[5] In March 2010, Lightfoot changed a line during live performances to reflect new findings that there had been no crew error involved in the sinking. The line originally read, \"At 7 p.m. a main hatchway caved in; he said...\"; Lightfoot began singing it as \"At 7 p.m. it grew dark, it was then he said...\" Lightfoot learned about the new research when contacted for permission to use his song for a History Channel documentary that aired on March 31, 2010.

        "content": "The 2001 Gujarat cyclone was the third strongest tropical cyclone, in terms of barometric pressure, to form in the Arabian Sea on record; only Cyclones Gonu in 2007 and Kyarr in 2019 were stronger. The storm originated from a tropical disturbance that formed east of Somalia on May\u00a018. Over the following few days, the system gradually organized into a tropical depression. Tracking eastward, towards the coastline of southwestern India, the storm slowly intensified. Shortly before reaching shore, the system turned north and later west, away from land. After taking this turn, the storm intensified into a very severe cyclonic storm, attaining its peak intensity on May\u00a024 with winds of 215\u00a0km/h (130\u00a0mph 3-minute winds) and a barometric pressure of 932\u00a0mbar (hPa). At the time, this ranked the cyclone as the strongest known storm in the Arabian Sea. After stalling several hundred kilometres offshore, the storm weakened over cooler waters that it had upwelled. By May\u00a027, the system weakened to a cyclonic storm and by this time was approaching the northwestern coastline of India, near Gujarat. The following day, the storm made landfall in the Saurashtra region as a deep depression with winds of 55\u00a0km/h (35\u00a0mph 3-minute winds). The depression quickly weakened after moving inland and dissipated early on May\u00a029. Although a powerful cyclone over water, the storm had relatively little impact over land. In the Valsad district, two coastal communities lost a combined 200 homes due to large swells produced by the storm. However, the losses were more extensive offshore. Between 120 and 900 fishermen were listed as missing after contact was lost with their vessels during the storm."

        "content": "The origins of the 2001 Gujarat cyclone can be traced to a tropical disturbance over the Arabian Sea on May\u00a018. The following day, the system was determined to be relatively stationary near the island of Socotra. Although deep convection was associated with the disturbance, there was no evidence of a low-level circulation. By May\u00a020, the disturbance slowly moved towards the southeast in response to an upper-level trough over India. The overall structure gradually improved as good outflow developed. A mid-level circulation finally developed late on May\u00a021, prompting the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert.[1] Several hours later, they began monitoring the system as a tropical depression with the identifier 01A;[2] however, operational advisories were not issued until the cyclone was estimated to have attained tropical storm intensity.[1][2] By the morning of May\u00a022, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) also took notice of the system.[1] Situated in a region favoring tropical cyclone development about 650\u00a0km (400\u00a0mi) southwest of Mumbai, India, the storm rapidly developed.[1] By the afternoon of May\u00a022, the JTWC estimated that 01A attained winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph), equivalent to a Category\u00a01 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale.[2] Additionally, a 22\u00a0km (14\u00a0mi)-wide eye developed within the center of circulation during this intensification phase. Throughout most of May\u00a022, the strengthening slowed considerably as it paralleled the southwestern coast of India. Initially, it was feared that the storm would move inland as a powerful cyclone; however, a ridge over the northern Arabian Sea caused the storm to turn westward, back over open water. Once further away from land, the cyclone resumed intensification, becoming a rare, Category\u00a03 equivalent storm by the morning of May\u00a024.[1] Later that morning, 01A attained its peak intensity with winds of 205\u00a0km/h (125\u00a0mph), according to the JTWC.[2] However, the IMD considered the storm to be slightly stronger, estimating that it attained winds of 215\u00a0km/h (135\u00a0mph) by three-minute sustained winds along with a barometric pressure of 932 mbar (hPa; 27.52\u00a0inHg).[3] At the time of peak intensity, the cyclone displayed a well-defined eye and excellent outflow. Although a powerful storm, it quickly weakened as conditions became hostile for tropical cyclone development. Strong wind shear tore convection away from the cyclone and caused it to become disorganized. Within 48\u00a0hours, the system had degraded to a tropical storm and was situated roughly 555\u00a0km (345\u00a0mi) west-southwest of Mumbai. The weakening trend lessened shortly thereafter but still continued. Operationally, the JTWC issued their final advisory on the cyclone on May\u00a028 as it weakened to a tropical depression over open waters. The once powerful cyclone, now devoid of all convection, tracked towards the northwestern coast of India.[1] During the afternoon of May\u00a029, the cyclone rapidly regenerated as it made landfall in Gujarat. The JTWC estimated that it crossed the coastline with winds of 100\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph). Not long after moving overland, the system rapidly weakened and dissipated over India within several hours.[2]"

Fourteen districts of Gujarat were placed on red alert, the highest level of preparedness. Seven emergency control centers were set up across the country and officials alerted hospitals and fire crews about the approaching storm.[7] Several relief agencies were already positioned in the region in response to a magnitude 7.7 earthquake in January of that year that killed over 20,000 people.[8][9] Additional disaster relief teams were deployed to the region to further prepare residents for the cyclone. Food, water and other necessities were stored and ready to be provided to victims of the storm.[10] Large swells produced by the storm affected a large portion of the western Indian coastline, especially in the city of Bombay.[11] In the Valsad district, two coastal communities lost a combined 200 homes due to large swells produced by the storm.[1] Offshore, between 1,500 and 2,000 fishing vessels had lost contact with the mainland.[5] Later reports indicated that between 120 and 900 fishermen had gone missing as a result of the cyclone.[1]"

The cyclone was ranked as the strongest in the Arabian Sea for six years until it was surpassed by Gonu in 2007, which attained a minimum pressure of 920\u00a0mbar (hPa).[3] In 2010, Cyclone Phet surpassed the 2001 cyclone as the second-strongest storm in the region, attaining winds of 230\u00a0km/h (145\u00a0mph), according to the JTWC. Again it was surpassed to sixth place as Cyclone Kyarr, Cyclone Chapala, Cyclone Tauktae and Cyclone Nilofar surpassed its windspeed intensity as they become category 4 tropical cyclones in later years. Now this cyclone is tied with Cyclone Megh for sixth strongest cyclone in Arabian Sea based on windspeed of one minute mean.[16]"

        "content": " Hurricane Teddy was a large and powerful Cape Verde hurricane that was the fifth-largest Atlantic hurricane by diameter of gale-force winds recorded. Teddy produced large swells along the coast of the Eastern United States and Atlantic Canada in September 2020. The twentieth tropical depression, nineteenth named storm, eighth hurricane, and second major hurricane of the record-breaking 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, Teddy initially formed from a tropical depression that developed from a tropical wave on September\u00a012. Initially, the depression's large size and moderate wind shear kept it from organizing, but it eventually intensified into Tropical Storm Teddy on September\u00a014. After steadily intensifying for about a day, the storm rapidly became a Category\u00a02 hurricane on September\u00a016 before westerly wind shear caused a temporary pause in the intensification trend. It then rapidly intensified again on September\u00a017 and became a Category\u00a04 hurricane. Internal fluctuations and eyewall replacement cycles then caused the storm to fluctuate in intensity before it weakened some as it approached Bermuda. After passing east of the island as a Category\u00a01 hurricane on September\u00a021, Teddy restrengthened back to Category\u00a02 strength due to baroclinic forcing. It weakened again to Category\u00a01 strength the next day before becoming post-tropical as it approached Atlantic Canada early on September\u00a023. It then weakened to a gale-force low and made landfall in Nova Scotia with sustained winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h). The system weakened further as it moved northward across eastern Nova Scotia and then the Gulf of St. Lawrence, before being absorbed by a larger non-tropical low early on September\u00a024, near eastern Labrador. Tropical storm watches and warnings were issued for both Bermuda and Atlantic Canada in preparation for Teddy. Its large size and strength caused high waves and rip currents to impact areas hundreds of miles from its path, ranging from the Lesser and Greater Antilles to the East Coast of the United States and Atlantic Canada. Two people in Puerto Rico drowned from the strong waves while another drowned in New Jersey. Total damage is estimated to be at least $35\u00a0million."

        "content": "The National Hurricane Center (NHC) began to monitor a tropical wave over West Africa early on September\u00a07.[1] The wave moved over the Atlantic Ocean on September\u00a010, accompanied by a large area of deep convection, and began to steadily organize, forming a broad low-pressure area over the following day.[2][3] Though the wave was experiencing moderate northeasterly shear, convection increased early on September\u00a012, which led to the development of a well-defined surface center and the formation of Tropical Depression Twenty around 06:00 UTC while the system was located about 575\u00a0mi (925\u00a0km) southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands.[4] Initially, the depression struggled to organize, due to its large size and moderate wind shear.[5] After the shear decreased, the depression became better organized and became Tropical Storm Teddy near 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a014.[4] It was the earliest-forming 19th tropical or subtropical storm on record in an Atlantic hurricane season, surpassing the old mark of October 4, set by the unnamed \"Azores\" subtropical storm in 2005.[6][7] Teddy continued to intensify as it became better organized, with an eye beginning to form late on September\u00a015.[8] By 00:00\u00a0UTC, September\u00a016, Teddy strengthened to become a category\u00a01 hurricane while located about 805\u00a0mi (1,295\u00a0km) east-northeast of Barbados.[4] The storm continued to intensify, becoming a category\u00a02 hurricane later that day.[9] Some slight westerly wind shear briefly halted further intensification, but when it subsided, the storm began another period of rapid intensification early on September\u00a017. Teddy strengthened into a major category\u00a03 hurricane near 12:00\u00a0UTC while centered about 575\u00a0mi (925\u00a0km) east-northeast of Guadeloupe, and to category\u00a04 strength three hours later.[4] Late that day, Teddy reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 140\u00a0mph (225\u00a0km/h) a minimum barometric pressure of 945\u00a0mbar (27.9\u00a0inHg).[10] On September\u00a018, an eyewall replacement cycle caused the storm to weaken slightly to category\u00a03; and the following day, an increase in southwesterly shear caused it to drop below major hurricane strength around 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a020.[4] Teddy then moved over slightly cooler waters caused by upwelling from Hurricane Paulette, contributing to its weakening trend.[11] Teddy passed about 230\u00a0mi (370\u00a0km) east of Bermuda on September\u00a021 as it turned northward and north-northeastward while interacting with a negatively tilted trough. This interaction caused an increase in both the storm's maximum wind speed and size. Teddy reached a secondary peak intensity of 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h) between 06:00\u00a0UTC and 12:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a022. Interaction with the trough also triggered the extratropical transition process; Teddy's wind field became more asymmetric, and the associated convection become less centralized. At about 18:00\u00a0UTC that same day, the hurricane weakened to Category\u00a01 intensity, before becoming an extratropical low at around 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a023, while located about 190\u00a0mi (310\u00a0km) south of Halifax, Nova Scotia.[4] Just before this transition, the diameter of gale-force winds measured up to 850\u00a0mi (1,370\u00a0km) across from northeast to southwest, making Teddy the 4th largest Atlantic hurricane on record.[12] At 12:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a023, the storm made landfall near Ecum Secum, Nova Scotia, with sustained winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h).[13] The storm weakened as it moved northward across eastern Nova Scotia and then the Gulf of St. Lawrence, where it was absorbed by a larger non-tropical low early on September\u00a024, near eastern Labrador.[4] This low, fueled by Teddy's remnant energy, accelerated northward, before proceeding to make a counterclockwise loop over the Labrador Sea for the next couple of days, briefly strengthening back into a hurricane-force low, before weakening again.[14][15][16][17] Afterward, it slowly drifted eastward, before being absorbed into another larger storm near Iceland on September\u00a029.[18]"

This was the first time such an event had been documented for three days in a row in records dating to at least 1934. The city reported some flooding in its historical downtown district, along with some other areas near the coast.[27] In North Carolina, coastal communities experienced beach erosion and coastal flooding. NC 12 was closed from September\u00a020\u201322 due to persistent storm surge and sand being carried onto the road. In addition, more than 80\u00a0dunes were washed away at Cape Hatteras National Seashore.[24] Rip currents along the eastern seaboard also led to a drowning near Point Pleasant Beach, New Jersey.[28] No rain was reported in Massachusetts, however wind gusts over 30\u00a0mph (50\u00a0km/h) were reported near Cape Cod.[23] In Maine, very large waves pounded the coast, drawing onlookers and surfers. A fence was taken out by storm surge in Scarborough. Emergency officials were on standby across southern Maine in case flooding became a hazard. In Camp Ellis, the storm threatened to erode the shoreline. Some people in the town decided to put up storm shutters during the storm in case houses were flooded.[29]"

There, she continued her solo singing stints, performing with other overseas Filipino artists like Tillie Moreno, Eddie Mercado, Lerma dela Cruz, and the duo Reycards. Life in America was difficult for Ramsey and her mother as they moved around different cities in California. She attended John Marshall High School in Los Angeles, which at the time already had a large Filipino-American student population. She ran away from home in 1988 after finishing high school, moving to New York with a friend and landing a job as a backup vocalist for Stevie B's group of musicians.[8]"

In 1989, she was re-christened \"Jaya\" and signed a record deal with Stevie B's label LeFrak-Moelis Records and her eponymous first album, produced by Stevie B, was released in the US. The album consisted largely of freestyle dance tracks written or co-written by Stevie B, who also provided backup vocals. The album's first single, \"If You Leave Me Now\", was a hit in discos and debuted on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart in October 1989. After 18 weeks on the Hot 100, the song was still gaining in both sales and airplay[9]\u2014it ended up peaking at number 44 in February 1990[10]\u2014 and remained in the Hot 100 for a total of for 26 weeks, an unusually long chart run for a single peaking outside the top 40.  The song did well in many markets but at different times, thus diluting its Hot 100 rank.[9]  It hit top 10 in several markets[9] and made it to number one at the crossover powerhouse KMEL.  The song hit number 14 on Billboard's Top 40/Dance crossover chart and number 25 on the 12-inch Singles Sales chart.[10] Jaya's follow-up single, \"One Kiss Per Minute\", was a minor dance hit, but failed to make the pop chart and the third single from the album failed to chart as did another non-album single in 1993."

        "content": "1995 was a turning point in Jaya's musical career. Pilita Corrales, dubbed \"Asia's Queen of Songs\", noticed her voice after Jaya did an opening act for Corrales, Carmen Soriano, the late Bert \"Tawa\" Marcelo, and Elizabeth in the United States. Corrales then asked Jaya if she would like to return to Manila and record an album, to which she agreed. Jaya returned to the Philippines and signed a record deal with Viva Records in March 1995 and completed her first local album. Five songs were recorded in the US while the rest were done in the Philippines. Jaya is noted for being the Philippine music industry's female record holder of a seven-times platinum album.[11] She was a big hit when Pinoys first heard her belt out soul ditties in 1996. Her winning the 1996 Metropop Song Festival via Danny Tan's \"Sometimes You Just Know\" made her the biggest star on the rise at the close of the last century. Her first album under Viva Records hit an all-time high of 9 times platinum.[12] In 1997, she released her third album In the Raw, (second in the Philippines) the follow-up to her massive-selling 1996 Philippine debut album, Jaya, which sold nine times platinum, (360,000 units; platinum is 40,000 units sold).[13] She also won as Best Interpreter at the Asia Song Festival held in Hong Kong in February 1997 for her rendition of the song \"You Lift Me Up\", composed by Danny Tan with lyrics by Dodjie Simon. This composition also received the grand prize, the Best Song award. She adorns Magpakailan pa Man (Up to the End), with soulful, Toni Braxton-styled flourishes, and renders the upbeat, \"Together\" with panache and verve. Her assured handling of the delicately nuanced, \"Sana'y Maulit Muli\" (May it Recur Again), is a tour de force. The album sold quintuple-platinum (200,000 units sold).[14] She released a Christmas album, entitled Kung Kailan Pasko which contained traditional carols alongside original compositions, including a jazz version of The Christmas Song.[15] In 1999, PolyMax Records, a label of then-PolyGram Records Philippines (now an affiliate of Universal Records) released Jaya's A Love Album, first released in 1992 in Japan under the same title. The album consists of songs taken from an earlier Jaya album, also called A Love Album, released in the United States in 1989, as well as songs recorded specifically for the 1992 Japanese release. In 1992, while touring Japan as a backup singer and keyboardist for American R&B artist Stevie B., Jaya was approached by the Japanese label Toshiba/EMI to make an album for Japanese release. A Love Album was released in Japan in conjunction with Jaya's American label, LMR Records, which still owns master rights, and from whom PolyMax obtained permission to release the album in the Philippines (according to Kazu Watanabe, managing director of PolyMax Records). A Love Album is exquisitely produced, and Jaya acquits herself well on the album's upbeat R&B/dance-styled tunes and soulful ballads.[16] In 1999, Jaya released, her fifth album released in her native country since 1996, entitled Honesty originally done by Billy Joel, was also her career single. Honesty differs greatly from Jaya's two previous major albums released in the Philippines, 1996's Jaya and 1997's In the Raw. Though, as before, Honesty contains mostly passionate, easy-listening love songs, this time out her approach is more intimate. She doesn't add many soulful flourishes as before, nor does she allow herself to soar passionately to the heavens, which she often did on her previous albums. Another major difference is the inclusion of three modern, rhythm and blues styled songs, including, \"We Thang,\" \"Tear to Fall\" and \"In My Dreams.\" These songs are far more contemporary and have much more international appeal than the easy-listening love songs which dominate Jaya's music.[17] After five years in the recording scene, she released her first greatest hits album, entitled Five featuring a duet of Habang May Buhay (While There's Life) with Regine Velasquez and Kung Wala Na (If It Is Gone) from the Abandonada soundtrack. In 1999, Jaya faced a big challenge when she did her first musical, the Ramayana-based Rama at Sita that starred Lani Misalucha. Her performance as the demon king Ravana's sister, Soorphanaka, was memorable for her skillful treatment of risque songs and sultry dancing.[18] Also in 1999, Jaya was given the offer to become a main host in a GMA Network variety show called SOP."

        "content": "In 2001, Jaya released her sixth Unleashed album where she sang the songs in a relaxed, confident manner, and performed middle-of-the-road songs that mostly have depth and quality. She forwent the soulful embellishments that were plentiful in her first two albums,  although every so often she added a few unwritten notes in a passionate, soulful manner. She approached her last album, 1999's Honesty, in the refined manner that she furthered on Unleashed. Jaya covers Roy Orbison's \"Love Hurts\" and John Lennon's \"Love\" in an understated, yet enjoyable manner. Johnny Nash's \"I Can See Clearly\" features an imaginative, bass-heavy arrangement.[19] Also in that same year, she released her first live album, entitled, Jaya Live at the Araneta. The album is dominated by performances of American hits. For example, the album starts with a performance of Aretha Franklin's 1960s hit \"Respect\", and also includes Labelle's \"Lady Marmalade\", Nirvana's \"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" and Roy Orbison's \"Love Hurts.\" She performs several of these ballads here, including her first hit in the Philippines, \"Dahil Tanging Ikaw\" (Because It's Only You). Several guest artists also have spots, including Regine Velasquez, who performs Abba's \"Dancing Queen\"; boy band Jeremiah, who accompanies Jaya on remakes of songs by American boy bands, including Westlife's \"Swear It Again\"; and male singers Wency Cornejo, KC Montero, and Rivermaya's vocalist and songwriter, Rico Blanco.[20] After four years of hiatus in the music scene, Jaya returned with her seventh studio album entitled, Fall in Love Again. Friends, old and new helped Jaya put the album together. One of these is Ogie Alcasid, who composed and produced \"Ako'y Sa'yo\" later revived by Regine Velasquez, \"Maging Akin Ka Lamang\" and their duet of \"Bakit Di Mo Sabihin\". Another one is Vehnee Saturno, who wrote and produced most of Jaya's early hits. His contributions are \"Pagkukunwari\" and \"Di Na Ba Kita Mapipigilan\", which is the album's first single release.[21]"

The first single was \"Is It Over?\" originally sung by Ronnie Milsap which received a Platinum award in 2009.[22] After her Platinum Record solo album, \"Cool Change, \" Ramsey released her ninth studio album entitled, Real.Love.Stories. It contains 14 love songs carefully picked and beautifully revived by the Philippine's Queen of Soul, such as \"Breathe Again\" originally sung by Toni Braxton; \"Old Friend\" by Phyllis Hyman and \"Save the Best For Last\" by Vanessa Williams. The concept album was released initially on a limited edition micro secure digital format and after two weeks, it will be available on physical CDs and digital downloading.[23] Jaya also took part in the all-star charity single Kaya Natin Ito! along with some of her colleagues (with the exception of Jennylyn Mercado and Yasmien Kurdi).

        "content": "Hurricane Kate was the latest hurricane to form in the Atlantic basin since Epsilon in 2005, as well as one of the northernmost November hurricanes on record. The eleventh and final named storm and fourth hurricane of the 2015 Atlantic hurricane season, Kate formed out of a disorganized tropical wave that had moved off the coast of Africa on October 30. Unfavorable conditions prevented it from significantly organizing as it traversed the Atlantic. Once it neared the northern coast of Hispaniola on November 7, it began to become somewhat better organized. The next day it developed into a tropical depression; shortly afterwards it developed into Tropical Storm Kate. Kate moved northwest around an area of high pressure, gradually strengthening. On November 11, it intensified into a hurricane while simultaneously peaking in intensity. Shortly afterwards, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. Kate caused minor impacts in the Bahamas, other than gusty winds and some rain showers as it passed just to the east on November 9. It also caused minor surf along the East Coast of the United States."

        "content": "On October 30, a poorly-defined tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa with little thunderstorm activity. At this point in the season, tropical waves are uncommon due to increasingly unfavourable conditions, making the origins of Kate \"rare, but not unprecedented\" as described by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) in its post-season report on the storm.[1] Passing through the eastern Atlantic in unfavourable conditions, the disorganized disturbance failed to organize any further. By November 5, however, as the wave approached the Lesser Antilles, a low-level vorticity split from the wave and traveled to the west-northwest, while the tropical wave headed towards Central America. The new disturbance then turned towards Hispaniola and Puerto Rico, at which point the National Hurricane Center began to monitor the disturbance for possible tropical cyclogenesis.[2][1] On November 7, convection increased as it passed to the northeast of Hispaniola; however, surface pressures were still relatively high. By early on November 8, showers and convection became more concentrated around the area of low pressure, and there was indications that the disturbance was producing gale-force winds in squally bands that were short-lived.[3] It is estimated that Tropical Depression Twelve formed at around 18:00\u00a0UTC, after further organization occurred, while located north of the Turks and Caicos Islands. The depression moved to the west in response to an area of high pressure that was situated to its north. Banding features began to develop along with a defined outflow pattern, and after an Air Force reconnaissance aircraft investigated the system on November 9, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Kate at 15:00\u00a0UTC that day.[1] The overall size of Kate was initially relatively small, with a compact central dense overcast (CDO) extending only 40 miles (64\u00a0km) from the center of the storm. Kate continued to move to the west-northwest while steadily strengthening, and later made its closest approach to The Bahamas on November 9 \u2013 passing about 15 miles (24\u00a0km) from Cat Island.[4] However, observations reported that the circulation of Kate was very small and did not register in some of the operating stations.[1] By the early morning hours of November 10, Kate began to turn to the north in response to a trough that was coming off the East Coast of the United States.[5] Shortly thereafter, Kate strengthened to just below hurricane intensity with winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h), and was initially predicted to become a hurricane shortly thereafter before passing over cooler sea surface temperatures,[6] however intensification briefly halted. By 00:00\u00a0UTC on November 11, Kate had intensified into a hurricane as it began to accelerate northeast into and become embedded into the mid-latitude westerlies, after a microwave pass revealed banding features had become more defined near the center.[7][1] This made it the latest-forming hurricane in the Atlantic basin since Hurricane Epsilon in 2005.[8] Shortly afterwards, Kate reached its peak intensity with winds of 85\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) and a pressure of a 980 millibars (29\u00a0inHg) based on continued improvement of its satellite presentation.[1] Afterwards, colder waters and increasing wind shear caused Kate to weaken, and it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone by 00:00\u00a0UTC on November 12. The remnants of Kate continued to accelerate over the North Atlantic Ocean for another day before slowing down dramatically and turning eastwards before being absorbed by a larger cyclone on November 13.[1]"

New shelters were opened for the expected areas to be impacted by the then-precursor to Kate.[9]  Ahead of the storm, on November 9, a tropical storm warning was issued for the northern portions of the Bahamas as Kate was expected to pass fairly close to the island chain.[1] However, effects were not as bad as expected, due to the storm's circulation being very small. Because of this, some islands did not even report tropical storm-force winds as Kate passed to the east.[1] The warnings were later discontinued as the storm moved away from the area. On November 9, the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) announced that they would closely monitor the progress of the tropical storm, after a Level II Activation code was put into effect.[10] NEMA Captain Stephen Russell advised residents that local administrators had been informed of the impending storm, to enforce that local disaster committees were prepared, and to have shelters opened, in case an evacuation needed to be ordered for low-lying areas, partially those near the outskirts of the island. In northern Eleuthera, the Glass Window Bridge was shut down in advance of tropical storm conditions.[10] One of the airline services in the Bahamas, Bahamasair, later stated that a flight from Nassau to San Salvador would be delayed by day to early on November 10 due to the weather conditions. Further changes regarding flights to other areas in the Bahamas were stated as being issued in the case that conditions worsened.[10] That same day, public schools in Cat Island and San Salvador were closed due to the passing of Kate just to the north, advising students and staff to remain safe.[11] In addition, schools in Eleuthera also closed at noon in advance.[citation needed]"

County Donegal reported that a bridge had vanished due to the rising tides.[15] Some people even woke to find their cars destroyed in the flood. Multiple road closures had to be put in place due to the heavy rainfall and floods.

It was named for the deep blue appearance of its waters. Similar to the Gulf Stream in the North Atlantic, the Kuroshio is a powerful western boundary current that transports warm equatorial water poleward and forms the western limb of the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. Off the East Coast of Japan, it merges with the Oyashio Current to form the North Pacific Current. The Kuroshio Current has significant effects on both physical and biological processes of the North Pacific Ocean, including nutrient and sediment transport, major pacific storm tracks and regional climate, and Pacific mode water formation.[1][2][3] Additionally, the current's significant nutrient transport results in a biologically rich ecoregion supporting an important fishing industry as well as diverse marine food webs. The South China Sea for example has relatively low nutrient concentrations in its upper waters, but experiences enhanced biological productivity due to the input from the Kuroshio Current Intrusion.[4] Ongoing research centered around the Kuroshio Current's response to climate change predicts a strengthening in surface flows of this western boundary current which contrasts the predicted changes in the Atlantic Ocean's Gulf Stream.[5]"

        "content": "The Kuroshio is a relatively warm ocean current with an annual average sea-surface temperature of about 24\u00a0\u00b0C (75\u00a0\u00b0F), is approximately 100 kilometres (62\u00a0mi) wide, and produces frequent small to meso-scale eddies. The Kuroshio originates from the Pacific North Equatorial Current, which splits in two at the east coast of Luzon, Philippines, to form the southward-flowing Mindanao Current and the more significant northward-flowing Kuroshio Current.[6] East of Taiwan, the Kuroshio enters the Sea of Japan through a deep break in the Ryukyu island chain known as the Yonaguni Depression. The Kuroshio then continues northwards and parallel to the Ryukyu islands, steered by the deepest part of the Sea of Japan, the Okinawa Trough, before leaving the Sea of Japan and re-entering the Pacific through the Tokara Strait.[7] It then flows along the southern margin of Japan but meanders significantly.[8] At the B\u014ds\u014d Peninsula, the Kuroshio finally separates from the Japanese coast and travels eastward as the Kuroshio Extension.[9] The Kuroshio Current is the Pacific analogue of the Gulf Stream in the Atlantic Ocean,[10] transporting warm, tropical water northward toward the polar region. The Kuroshio's counterparts associated with the North Pacific Gyre are the: east flowing North Pacific Current to the north, the south flowing California Current to the east, and the west flowing North Equatorial Current to the south. The warm waters of the Kuroshio Current sustain the coral reefs of Japan, the northernmost coral reefs in the world. The part of the Kuroshio that branches into the Sea of Japan is called Tsushima Current (\u5bfe\u99ac\u6d77\u6d41, Tsushima Kairy\u016b). Similar to the Atlantic Ocean's Gulf Stream, the Kuroshio Current creates warm ocean surface temperatures, and significant moisture in the atmosphere along the western Pacific basin, and thus produces and sustains tropical cyclones. Tropical cyclones, also known as typhoons, are formed when atmospheric instability, warm ocean surface temperatures, and moist air are combined to fuel an atmospheric low-pressure system. The Western North Pacific Ocean experiences an average of 25 typhoons annually.[11] The majority of typhoons occur from July through October during northern hemisphere summer,[11] and typically form where the Kuroshio Current is the warmest near the equator. Typhoons tend to track along the current's warm water poleward until they dissipate in colder waters.[12] The strength (transport) of the Kuroshio varies along its path and seasonally. Within the Sea of Japan, observations suggest that the Kuroshio transport is relatively steady at about 25Sv[13][14] (25 million cubic metres per second). The Kuroshio strengthens significantly when it rejoins the Pacific Ocean, reaching 65Sv (65 million cubic metres per second) southeast of Japan,[7] although this transport has significant seasonal variability.[15] The Kuroshio Current splits into Kuroshio Current extension and the Tsushima Current, as the currents wrap around Japanese Island and reconnects, changes in flow will impact the flows of the other currents. The path of the Kuroshio may have been different in the geologic past based on historical sea level and bathymetry, however there is currently[when?] conflicting scientific evidence. It has been proposed that lower sea-level and tectonics may have prevented the Kuroshio from entering the Sea of Japan during the last glacial period, approximately c.\u2009115,000 \u2013 c.\u200911,700 years ago, and remained entirely within the Pacific basin.[16] However, other proxies and ocean models have alternatively suggested that the Kuroshio path was relatively unaltered,[17][18] possibly as far back as 700,000 years ago.[19]"

Offshore of Southern Taiwan on the Kenting Plateau erosion is likely caused by the strong bottom currents which increase in velocity along the rise on this plateau.[20] The bottom water accelerates as it travels from a depth of 3500\u00a0m to a depth around 400\u2013700\u00a0m. The increase in current velocity exacerbates erosion revealing the Kuroshio Knoll, a 3\u00a0km \u00d7 7\u00a0km bean-shaped elevated flat area 60\u201370\u00a0m below surface levels in comparison to the rest of the Plateau which located at around 400\u2013700\u00a0m.[2] The Plateau is being uplifted and is balanced with erosion.[2] The granulometry of the Kenting Plateau and surrounding area demonstrates the eroding qualities of the Kuroshio Current.[20] The sediment grain size of the sand varies along the edge of the Plateau. The deeper down the edge, the larger the grains as smaller grains are swept away by the current. Some of these fine sand particles have settled into a dune field while the remaining sediment is transported and deposited throughout the region by the Kuroshio Current.[2] The Kuroshio Current also transports Yangtze River sediment. The amount of sediment transport is highly dependent on the relationship between the Kuroshio Current intrusion, the China Coastal Current, and the Taiwan Warm Current. The Yangtze River sediment is being deposited on the East China Sea inner shelf rather than the deep sea due to the interaction of the three currents.[21] Distinct elemental characteristics of sediments from differing sources permits tracking sources of sediments within the Kuroshio. Taiwanese sediment notably contains illite and chlorite. These traceable compounds have been found all the way through the Kuroshio Current up into its branch through the Kuroshio Current Intrusion in the South China Sea.[22] The South China Sea branch of the Kuroshio and the cyclonic eddy west of Luzon Island impact Luzon and Pearl River sediments. The Luzon sediment containing high levels of smectite is unable to travel northwestward. The Pearl River sediments contains high levels of kaolinite and titanium (Ti) and is trapped above the abyssal basin between Hainan Island and the Pearl River mouth.[21] These compounds allow scientists to track sediment transport throughout the Kuroshio Current."

Warm-core rings are not known for having high productivity. However, there is evidence of equal distribution of biological productivity throughout the warm-core rings from the Kuroshio Current, supported by the upwelling at the periphery and the convective mixing caused by the cooling of surface water as the rings move north of the current. The thermostad is the deep mixed layer that has discrete boundaries and uniform temperature. Within this layer, nutrient-rich water is brought to the surface, which generates a burst of primary production. Given that the water in the core of a ring has a different temperature regime than the shelf waters, there are times when a warm-core ring is undergoing its spring bloom while the surrounding shelf waters are not.[24] There are many complex interactions within warm-core rings and thus, lifetime productivity is not very different from the surrounding shelf water. A study from 1998[24] found that the primary productivity within a warm-core ring was almost the same as in the cold jet outside it, with evidence of upwelling of nutrients within the ring. In addition, there was discovery of dense populations of phytoplankton at the nutricline within a ring, presumably supported by the upward mixing of nutrients.[24] Furthermore, there have been acoustic studies in the warm-core ring, which showed intense sound scattering from zooplankton and fish populations in the ring and very sparse acoustic signals outside of it."

These winds induce the warmer surface layer of the ocean to mix with the deeper cooler layer of water that is situated below the pycnocline. This mixing introduces nutrients from deeper cooler water to the warmer surface layer of the ocean.[25] Organisms such as phytoplankton and algae use these newly introduced nutrients to grow.  In 2003, two typhoons induced significant surface layer mixing as they passed through the region. This mixing directly produced two algal bloom events in the North Western Pacific Ocean that negatively affected Japan.[26]"

        "content": "The Kuroshio Current is considered a nutrient stream because of high nutrient flux from surrounding oligotrophic waters with primary production of 150 to 300 grams of carbon per square meter per year based on SeaWiFS global primary productivity estimates. The current transports significant amounts of nutrients to support this primary production from the East China Sea continental shelf to the subarctic Pacific Ocean. The maximum chlorophyll value is found around 100 metres (330\u00a0ft) depth.[3] Its importance in nutrient transport is demonstrated by the nutrient rich water in the Kuroshio Current is surrounded by ambient water of the same density with lower relative nutrient levels. The downstream of the Kuroshio Current receives large amounts of nutrients at rates of 100\u2013280 kmol N*s-1.[27] Nutrients are brought to the surface water from deeper layers where the Kuroshio Current flows over shallow areas and seamounts. This process occurs over the Okinawa Trough and the Tokara Strait.[28] The Tokara Strait also has high cyclonic activity where the Kuroshio Current passes through. This in combination with the Coriolis effect causes intense upwelling along the continental shelf.[28] This upwelling and nutrient transport into surface layers is essential for primary production because these vital nutrients would otherwise be inaccessible to phytoplankton which need to remain in upper layers where sunlight is available for them to perform photosynthesis. The constant transport of nutrient rich waters to regions with high levels of light therefore supports increased photosynthesis supporting the rest of the biologically diverse ecosystem associated with the Kuroshio current."

These particular characteristics, along with lower nutrient availability within the current, correspond well with the requirements of two specific cyanobacteria: Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus.[30] Prochlorococcus is the dominant species of picophytoplankton within the Kuroshio Current and these two species may be responsible for as much as half of the fixation of CO2 in the entire Kuroshio Current photic zone.[30] Further, there are substantial dust deposition events in this region due to Asian Dust Storms from the Gobi desert.[30][31] During these events, dust clouds transport and deposit phosphate and trace metals which subsequently stimulate growth in both Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus as well as diatoms.[30] Diatoms and Trichodesmium are speculated to play an important role in the redistribution of nitrogen and carbon in and out of the euphotic zone. Trichodesmium is an abundant diazotroph that directly correlates with overall nitrogen fixation within the current.[32] This nitrogen fixation supplies a limiting nutrient (nitrate), to other photoautotrophs for growth and reproduction. Meanwhile, in areas influenced by upwelling with higher nutrient and carbon concentrations, diatoms are important contributors to carbon and nitrogen out of the euphotic zone due to the weight of their \"glass houses\" made of silica and their tendencies to sink.[33]"

Thaliaceans (salps and doliolids) are known to feed a minimum of 202 marine species, however, these animal's blooms have been found to cause harmful feeding conditions for pelagic fishes in the region.[39] Many species of fish larvae are also found in zooplankton communities transported by the current. Fish larvae are important contributor to the Kuroshio Current system food chain. Baleen whales for instance, make use of the current's transport of Japanese sardine and jack mackerel larvae to their feeding grounds in the north pacific. Climate change is reported to alter endemic fish larvae distribution. A fish species composition change analysis by Lu and Lee (2014) showed changes in fish larvae distribution have occurred during the region and suggest this altered clustering is associated with changes in the intensities and flow rates of the Kuroshio Current.[40] These changes impacts the food chain below and above this trophic level. This can influence fish migration, fish population's at large and major fisheries. The Kuroshio Current has an influence of several species of foraminifera, including species G. ruber and P. obliquiloculate.  G. ruber is normally a surface dweller and was found at depths of 1000 meters along the Kuroshio Current. P. obliquiloculate normally resides between 25 and 100 m, yet was found deep in the abyssal basin (>1000\u00a0m).[41] The distribution of these species in comparison to their standard dwelling depths observed by Gallagher (2015) demonstrates the ability of this intrusion and the overall Kuroshio Current's to redistribute nutrients vertically[41] making nutrients available many different species with differing requirements for prosperity."

When conditions are favorable, the population of this native starfish can explode, resulting in significant damage on entire coral communities, as well as the ecosystems these coral reefs support. A Crown-of-thorns starfish outbreak in conjunction with anthropogenic stressors can cause irreversible reef-system damage.[45][46] The Kuroshio Current controls patterns of connectivity between coral reefs (as well as other marine organisms with a larval phase), transporting larvae from southerly coral reefs to downstream reefs along the Ryukyu Arc.[47]"

The Japanese flying squid (Todarodes pacificus), for example, has three populations that breed in winter, summer, and autumn. The winter spawning group is associated with the Kuroshio Current, because following spawning events in January to April in the East China Sea the larvae and juveniles travel north with the Kuroshio Current. They are turned inshore and are caught between the islands of Honshu and Hokkaido during the summer. The summer spawning is in another part of the East China Sea, from which the larvae are entrained into the Tsushima current that flows north between the islands of Japan and the mainland. Afterward, the current meets a southward flowing cold coastal current, the Liman Current. The group of squid spawned in the summer are traditionally found around the boundary between the two currents, sustaining rich fisheries. In fact, studies have reported that annual catches in Japan have gradually increased since the late 1980s and it has been proposed that changing environmental conditions have caused the autumn and winter spawning areas in the Tsushima Strait and near the Goto Islands to overlap. In addition, winter spawning sites over the continental shelf and slope in the East China Sea are expanding."

To the north, the Oyashio Current contains subarctic water that is much colder and fresher than the resident water east of Honshu, and the intersection of these two currents is called the Kuroshio-Oyashio region. Here, local oceanographic conditions vary through the year and determine the species assemblage and thus the success of fisheries. For example, when the Oyashio current is well developed and protrudes southward, the cold waters are favorable for capturing sardines. Additionally, when larger meandering flow develops in the Kuroshio Current, sardine availability elevates due to the proximity of the Kuroshio to the southern spawning grounds of sardine. Thus, intrusion and flow paths of these currents affect presence, biomass, and catch of species such as pollock, sardine, and anchovy."

In the less productive northern current transition, the Kuroshio remains an important CO2 sink, through high CO2 solubility. The Kuroshio Extension region is classified as the strongest sink for atmospheric CO2 in the North Pacific. This is especially true in the winter when higher amounts of human-produced CO2 are taken up in the Kuroshio Extension region when compared with the summer. This is likely explained by cooler temperatures facilitating the solubility of CO2 in ocean water.

The Kuroshio Current plays an important role in influencing regional climate and weather patterns mainly through the input of warm waters from lower latitudes northward into the western edge of the Pacific basin.[1][54] Along with the other western boundary currents in the world, the Kuroshio Current is subject to seasonal changes that manifest in different flow rates, bifurcation latitudes, and water salinity. Circulation within the Pacific Ocean is largely influenced by this northerly transport of warm salty water north along the Western boundary, concurrently providing structure to the western edge of the North Pacific Gyre.[54] The resulting heat fluxes in this area represent some of the largest heat exchanges from ocean to atmosphere within the entire Pacific Basin, being more pronounced during the winter season. Heat transfer from the surface ocean to the atmosphere creates unstable atmospheric conditions, which is to say that air parcels and clouds derived or influenced by this process are warmer than the surrounding air, ultimately rising and enhancing chances of precipitation or shifting weather. In this way, monsoonal rain events and common through the summertime and typhoon storms are enhanced as they pass over the current.[1] The climate of many Asian countries has been affected by the distribution of heat by these processes for millions of years, changing wind patterns, precipitation, and mixing warm tropical waters into the Sea of Japan.[54][55]"

        "content": "As the Kuroshio Current separates from the equatorial current and flows northward, warm water from the Western Pacific Warm Pool segues into the northwest Pacific Ocean Basin. Principal heat flux in the Kuroshio occurs via the Kuroshio Extension between 132\u00b0E and 160\u00b0E and 30\u00b0N to 35\u00b0N, depending on the latitude where the extension splits off from the Kuroshio Current along the coast of Japan.[56][57] The process of warm water injection into the open ocean plays an important role in the formation of North Pacific Subtropical Mode waters and the regulation of sea surface temperatures, affecting moisture transport across the western Pacific Basin.[58] North Pacific subtropical mode waters are created when Kuroshio Extension waters lose large amounts of heat and moisture to the cold and dry northerly winds during boreal wintertime months, creating dense salty surface waters prone to sink and cause convection. The temperature range of the sinking North Pacific Subtropical Mode Waters characteristically falls between 16\u00a0\u00b0C and 19\u00a0\u00b0C, however exact temperatures and depths to which these waters sink varies annually depending on the efficiency of water transportation by the extension, which is a function of atmospheric and mesoscale eddy conditions.[56] The resulting homogeneous water mass typically separates the seasonal pycnocline from the surface waters in the mid to late summer months, remaining stratified below the warmer surface waters until shoaling back towards the surface with the mixed layer due to storm perturbation in the fall and winter. The contrast between the temperatures of these stratified vertical layers can be discernable such that the lateral advection of mode water can be traced for thousands of kilometers.[57] Mode water formation is variable and largely dependent on the flow intensity of the Kuroshio Extension and atmospheric heat flux efficiencies.[58] Heat flux processes sometimes experience feedbacks that enhance water temperature contrasts and can cause sea surface temperature features to last well past the end of the boreal winter. For example, with residually cooled surface waters in the late spring and early summer months, warm moist air from the south can cause low cloud formation and reflection of solar radiation, extending temporal sea surface cooling.[1] The Kuroshio Extension is a dynamic but relatively unstable system, with variability in the associated bifurcation latitude occurring on interannual time scales. The cause of these variations and their effects on the surface flow and total transport of waters has been studied extensively, with recent advances in sea surface height satellite altimetry methods allowing for observational studies on larger timescales.[59][58] Studies suggest that more northerly bifurcation latitudes have been historically correlated with greater surface water transport and mode water formation, associated with less meandering and more direct flow paths closer to the coasts of Japan and Taiwan during the wintertime months.[60]"

These changes are thought to come as a product of wind stress and surface warming resulting from the increased stratification of the surface layers of future oceans.[5] Specifically, predicted poleward shifting of westerly winds within the Hadley Cell is thought to create conditions in which the subtropical gyre wind stress curl would increase. This could cause an increased total geostrophic circulation and subsequently an intensification of the northern leg of the Kuroshio Current, in some predictions increasing flow velocities by almost double.[54] The entire flow of the current is predicted to be strengthened however, from its point of bifurcation near the equator to the Kuroshio Extension. In addition, the general observed southward migration of both the NEC and SEC subcurrent bifurcation latitudes over the past thirty years has been consistent with a strengthening of western boundary currents. With shifting winds and increased gyre circulation in conjunction with a \"business as usual\" anthropogenic carbon input scenario, bifurcation latitudes are predicted to continue on poleward migrations into the future, contributing to the intensifying Kuroshio Current.[1] Predictions are made using methods that combine historical data with oceanic modelling output, and one such study used the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) to show the Kuroshio Current interacting with the northern extremity of the subtropical gyre, contrasting older predictions of simple gyre \"spin up\" forced acceleration.[5] Modelling studies have also suggested that increasing stratification will occur with the strengthening of the surface layer current, creating conditions in which the opposite effect could occur in the deeper layer of the Kuroshio Current, which has been proposed to slow. The exact mechanisms causing this change are not well elucidated, however it is expected to be the result of wind stress changes within the gyre in addition to the increased stratification near the surface that may enhance surface and deep ocean layer separation and maintain different responses to warming oceans.[61]"

However, ships that travel against the current will spend more time and fuel to compensate for the water flowing against the shipping vessel.[62] The Kuroshio supports many important fisheries. Jack Mackerel populations are one of the most important fishery resources in Japan, Korea and Taiwan. As the Kuroshio flows northeastward from northeast of Taiwan along the shelf slope of the Eastern China Sea, it carries Jack Mackerel eggs and larvae to southern Japan and Honshu Island.[63] These larvae are caught and then raised in aquaculture through adulthood and harvested.[64] Other important fisheries include pollock, sardine, and anchovy.[65] There are also many developing port cities along the Kuroshio Current. While the Kuroshio Current is historically known to support many fisheries where it meets with the Oyashio current, this region is still recovering from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident. In 2011, a magnitude 9.0 earthquake triggered a devastating tsunami in 2011.[66] This tsunami inundated more than 200 miles of Japan's coastline and drastically altered the sea level in some coastal areas by meters. It killed more than 18,500 people and set off a nuclear disaster at the Fukushima nuclear plant, releasing radiocesium into the surrounding waters. While local water bodies were the most severely affected, this radiocesium was transported as far as the entire North Pacific Ocean by the North Pacific Current which is formed by the collision of the Kuroshio and the Oyashio current.[67] Local fisheries lost over 90% of their fleets and were unable to resume operations for up to a year after the accident. The local economy has been working to return to pre-tsunami levels but, even now, fishery yields have not reached nearly the levels they were before the accident. No catches are made within a 10\u00a0km radius to the accident site and even catches outside of that zone are subject to inspection for radioactive materials, costing fisheries both time and money.[68] Minamisanriku had most of the town's port and aquaculture facilities restored by 2014, and as of 2018, reconstruction of key infrastructure in the prefectures of Iwate and Miyagi was near completion.[69]  Local Japanese fishing fleets hauled 5,928 tons of seafood product valued at over 2.21 billion yen (19.342 million U.S. dollars) in 2021.[69] Changes in the Kuroshio Current and its warming conditions have impacted pilot whale migration. These animals are considered a delicacy but hunting is strictly regulated and transitions in migration timing is impacting those who depend on these animals as a source of income.[70] Management practices must consider protecting these animals and recognizing the potential economic impacts on local hunters."

The network is headquartered in the GMA Network Center in Quezon City and its transmitter facilities, Tower of Power, are located at Tandang Sora Avenue, Barangay Culiat also in Quezon City with regional stations and offices strategically located in over 12 major cities across the country including Dagupan, Naga, Bacolod, Iloilo, Cebu and Davao. GMA Network (formerly known as Republic Broadcasting System, GMA Radio-Television Arts and GMA Rainbow Satellite Network) is commonly referred to as the Kapuso Network in reference to the outline of the company's logo; the branding was originally introduced in 1992 and was officially introduced on October 27, 2002 during an episode of its now-defunct noontime variety show SOP. GMA Network is one of the largest television and radio network in the Philippines, along with TV5 and ABS-CBN/A2Z.[1] The original meaning of the GMA acronym was Greater Manila Area, referring to the initial coverage area of the station. As the network expanded, it changed into Global Media Arts. GMA Network is the largest television network in the Philippines and one of the largest media network in the country. GMA's first broadcast on television was on October 29, 1961, as Republic Broadcasting System (RBS) on DZBB Channel 7, almost a decade after the success of its radio station DZBB. It is the first television network in the Philippines to formally launch in anamorphic widescreen format.

Originally, RBS's programming was composed of foreign programs from the United States and it later produced local programs to cater to Filipino audiences. It produced shows like Uncle Bob's Lucky Seven Club, a child-oriented show aired every Saturdays; Dance Time with Chito; and various news programs like News at Seven. In 1963, RBS launched its first provincial television station in Cebu, DYSS Channel 7 (now GMA Cebu)."

In December 1972, RBS was given the green light by the government to return on the air, however with limited three-month permits. Programming during that time was supplied mostly via a blocktime agreement with Philippine Production Center Inc. (PPCI), a company led by former ABS-CBN executive Romeo Jalosjos. But due to limited licenses, difficulty in financial obligations, and disallowing foreign citizens and entities from owning and operating media companies in the Philippines, Stewart and the American Broadcasting Company, which owned 25% of the company, were forced to cede majority control to a triumvirate composed of Gilberto Duavit Sr., a Malaca\u00f1ang official; Menardo Jimenez, an accountant; and Felipe Gozon, an attorney of the Stewarts in 1974. The station changed its name to GMA Radio-Television Arts (GMA stood for Greater Manila Area, the station's initial coverage area) and also renamed its corporate name as Republic Broadcasting System, Inc. on May 28, 1974 until 1996.[5] Stewart's wife Loreto was the president when the takeover ensued.[6][7][8] The relaunched GMA, aside from sporting a light blue square logo with the network name in white, also (until 1980) had a circle 7 logo in use, in its final years the blue circle 7 logo used was similar to those used by the ABC in some United States cities. After that, Rod Reyes, then-general manager of RBS, recruited old-timers from ABS-CBN, including those from its news and entertainment divisions. After the Duavit-Jimenez-Gozon takeover, the station began to broadcast in color with an \u20b18 million credit line thru buying telecine machines and acquired foreign programs. Ratings were up from #5 to #3 that time.[8]"

Stewart left the country for good as a result. The network played an instrumental role during the years preceding the People Power Revolution. They were the first to air an interview with Corazon Aquino in 1984, as well as when she announced her intention to run for presidency once she receives one million signatures.[3] During the People Power Revolution, the network was also the first to report that Fidel Ramos and Juan Ponce Enrile broke away from the Marcos administration. GMA's rival ABS-CBN reopened in September 1986 and convinced key people to transfer networks including Freddie M. Garcia along with key people from the network's Marketing and Engineering departments.[3] The People Power Revolution enabled previously closed down television stations to air again. However, the political instability during Aquino's term added burden to the network, most notably when it was stormed by rebel soldiers for two days as a part of an attempted coup against the Aquino administration. In 1987, the network broadcast its programs for the first time in full stereo, the first VHF television network to do so in the country. Additionally, Broadway Centrum opened, and in 1988, they also inaugurated the 777 feet (237\u00a0m), 120\u00a0kW Tower of Power in Quezon City, the tallest man-made structure in the country.[9]"

Through its relay stations, GMA programs were seen across the country as well as Southeast Asia. GMA programming started airing in 60 American cities and parts of South America through the International Channel Network.[citation needed] GMA was selected to be the official broadcaster for the 1995 World Youth Day, when Pope John Paul II visited the country again. During the same year, popular TV shows Eat Bulaga! and Okay Ka, Fairy Ko! began broadcasting on GMA after TAPE Inc., the programs' production company, refused an ABS-CBN proposal to buy the airing rights of the two shows. Around the same time, the network launched a UHF channel subsidiary, Citynet 27, several new shows (including weekly late-night show Bubble Gang), as well as the late night news program Saksi. The network also adapted the 700 Club series as The 700 Club Asia. In 1994, GMA founded its own film production company, Cinemax Studios (renamed to GMA Films in 1998, then GMA Pictures in 2019) for the film Run Barbi Run, marking the second film production studio owned by another network after Star Cinema (founded in 1993 by ABS-CBN). In 1998, the company produced the biopic film Jos\u00e9 Rizal, then the most expensive Filipino film produced, and had a successful run, garnering many accolades and nominations from award-giving bodies. GMA formally changed its corporate name in 1996 to GMA Network Inc., with the acronym 'GMA' now standing for Global Media Arts. In 1999, GMA aired the Filipino language television news program GMA Network News, originally an English language newscast, then a rarity in Philippine television. GMA was the first Philippine broadcaster to receive a Peabody Award for Investigative Reporting in 1999.[10] Later, Citynet 27 became EMC, the first local music video-oriented TV channel, which became part of the short-lived Channel V franchise called Channel V Philippines. GMA broadcast the international millennium television special 2000 Today. The network then began airing 24-hour broadcasting until the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) released and implemented a new set of rules and regulations with its affiliated free-to-air TV networks in 2001."

In 1992, GMA Network redefines itself as the Rainbow Network, succeeding the ensigns of the rainbow. Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, the network used the rainbow symbol before having it replaced by its current logo in 2002 and as the Kapuso Network.[1] After a huge marketing campaign, and improved television ratings, the new insignia (the rainbow-colored stylized heart-shape logo known as \"Kapuso\") is now one of the most recognizable in the Philippines."

In 2020, a variation of the slogan \"Buong Puso para sa Pilipino\" (\"Wholehearted for the Filipino\") was unveiled on its 70th anniversary (currently used as a secondary slogan for its original 2018 slogan). It is currently shown on programming promo plugs of the network on TV and its Social Media channels, and \"Buong Puso para sa Pinoy Abroad\" (\"Wholehearted for the Filipino Abroad\") for celebrating GMA Pinoy TV's 15th anniversary.[68] In 2024, ahead to its 75th anniversary, GMA Network unveil a new slogan, \"Isa sa Puso ng Pilipino\" (\"One with the Heart of Filipino\") along with a new station ID.[51]"

Reality show Extra Challenge started to lead the ratings and with launch of \"telefantasya\" Mulawin. On September 23, 2004, GMA Network gained leadership in Mega Manila against its closest competitor. In 2005, GMA Network began producing Mars Ravelo's Darna, a classic Filipino comic book character which became a hit, with an overnight rating of 47.7 percent, the highest rating for a pilot episode and the first \"telefantasya\" to reach 52.1 percent ratings; followed by Encantadia at 47.2 percent and other prime-time \"telefantasyas\", Mulawin (2004) and Sugo (2005) contributed to GMA Network lead in Mega Manila. In 2006, GMA Network maintained its prime time supremacy by reformatting its reality-based program Extra Challenge and another \"telefantasya\" Encantadia (which was succeeded by Etheria and Encantadia: Pag-ibig Hanggang Wakas), and the localized subtitled versions of Korean television series Stairway to Heaven, Full House, Jewel in the Palace and My Lovely Sam Soon.[69] In 2007, GMA Network started producing the local version of a Mexican television series MariMar. For its pilot episode, it got 52.6 percent overnight rating, making it the only soap opera to achieve the highest ratings in GMA Network's history. In a 2006 survey conducted by Pulse Asia, seven out of 10 Metro Manila-based viewers find GMA Network a more credible network than its competitor. GMA Network managed to lead in Mega Manila and Southern Luzon demographic, which has the highest concentration of television ownership and 79 percent of advertisement placement.[70] The National Urban Television Audience Measurement was officially launched on October 16, 2006, to determine the television ratings and the audience share of local TV programs from urban areas in the Philippines. This changes the broadcast industry landscape and the manner in which the advertisers allocate their TV investments to achieve cost efficiency and maximization. In August 2007 audience rating data shows GMA Network maintained its lead in Mega Manila, which resulted to a 23 percent growth in its consolidated net income to \u20b11.13 billion in the first half of the year from \u20b1915 million in the same period last year.[71] GMA Network income grew by 23 percent year-on-year to \u20b11.126 billion in the first six months of the year. Mega Manila accounts 49 percent of total TV households. The Mega Manila and Luzon markets combined accounts for 76 percent of the total TV households.[72] It earned \u20b12.3 billion in 2007.[73] In 2011, GMA Network maintained the lead in the national television ratings mentioning figures from Nielsen TV Audience Measurement for January 1 to February 13, 2011. It had 33.2 percent audience shared based on overnight data, higher than ABS-CBN's 31.8 percent and TV5's 14.9 percent. It also leads in Urban Luzon, which makes up 77 percent of total television households in the Philippines. GMA Network posted 9.8 point lead with 36.5 points compared with the closest competitor, ABS-CBN's 26.7 points and imposing a 19.6 point lead from TV5's 16.9. GMA Network also sustained to beat ABS-CBN in Mega Manila, which accounts for 58 percent of television household. It got 37.7 percent share over ABS-CBN 25.2 percent and TV5's 17.7 percent, 20 points higher.[74]"

GMA Network used audio-video coverage through the facilities of Reuters, which GMA Network subscribed to.[75] During the said broadcast, a live feed from Reuters was simultaneously aired with its own live broadcast. During the first five-second of the live feed, GMA Network did notice that the live feed from Reuters was also airing at another local station, its main competitor ABS-CBN. The live video was restricted only to ABS-CBN and Reuters did not inform GMA Network that the video coverage was only intended for ABS-CBN. The local Court of Appeals junked the case filed by ABS-CBN Corporation against GMA Network Inc. for what was claimed to be illegal copying of its live video footage. In a ruling, the local fourth division of the appellate court set aside the resolution of the local Justice Department, which approved the filing of the violation of Republic Act 8293 (or the Intellectual Property Code) against GMA Network. It ruled out that the act of GMA Network in airing the live video coverage was focused by good faith since there was no meaning to instigate damage to ABS-CBN Corporation.[76] The local court also said GMA Network acted in good faith when it decided to instantaneously stop using the live video feed from Reuters upon learning ABS-CBN was also covering the said news event and its following exertion to authenticate the ABS-CBN Corporation restriction arrangement with the news service, Reuters. The local court also stressed that apart from lack of intent of GMA Network to affect the video from ABS-CBN, the action also cannot be reflected intrusion of Sections 212.4 and 185.1 of Republic Act 8293 since it was just a short excerpt compared with the totality of the matter.[77]"

The news story is based on an interview of AGB Nielsen general manager Maya Reforma regarding the purported cheating.[81][82][83] In response, GMA Network Inc. aired a television plug reproving the purported unfair journalism and disagreed the accusations of ABS-CBN Corporation. GMA Network Inc. later filed a \u20b115 million civil libel suit against ABS-CBN Corporation on January 3, 2008. The respondents included Hidalgo, Fermin, Sucaldito, the station and news manager of DZMM, writers and executive producers of television programs Bandila, Entertainment Live and The Buzz after the same story was aired locally.[84] On January 7, 2008, the Quezon City Regional Trial Court junked ABS-CBN Corporation's suit against AGB Nielsen, saying the case was \"prematurely filed\" before the local court.[85] Judge Gonzales' basis is the principle of mutuality of contracts, citing Article 1308 and 1196, New Civil Code of the Philippines. Also, Judge Samuel Gaerlan, Quezon City Regional Trial Court Branch 92 issued court summons against ABS-CBN Corporation and 15 of its personnel on January 3, 2008.[86] On January 17, 2008, Judge Gaerlan recused himself from the case, considering that he has a cousin working in the legal department of ABS-CBN Corporation.[87] The case was later re-raffled on January 28, 2008,[88] and the case was eventually assigned to Judge Henri Inting of Branch 95 of the Quezon City Regional Trial Court.

This season had a slightly below average number of tropical storms, with fourteen. The number of hurricanes was average, with eight. The season had an above-average number of major hurricanes, with five reaching Category\u00a03 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Four of tropical depressions dissipated before they could reach tropical storm strength. There were five landfalls, including three by consecutive storms.

Levels of the rivers which have their sources in the Tatras and the Gorce Mountains rose immediately, and on 19 July the flood wave, swollen by excessive waters of the tributaries, appeared on the Vistula near Sandomierz.

The storm formed when two low pressure areas merged off the coast of Virginia and travelled up the coast; at its peak, it produced a storm surge of about ten feet in Cohasset harbor and hurricane-force winds in Nantucket. The storm killed more than 400 people and sank more than 150 boats and ships. It also changed the course of the North River, separating the Humarock portion of Scituate, Massachusetts, from the rest of Scituate."

        "content": "On November 26, 1898, the steamship SS Portland left India Wharf in Boston, Massachusetts, for Portland, Maine, on a regularly scheduled run. She never made it to port. None of the 192 passengers and crew survived the massive storm that wreaked havoc on New England's coast \u2014 a storm that was later dubbed \"the Portland Gale\" after the tragic loss of the ship.[1] For years, controversy reigned as to the location of the ill-fated ship. In the summer of 2002, Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary, joined by the National Undersea Research Center at the University of Connecticut (UConn), solved the mystery surrounding the Portland's location. Using data from American Underwater Search and Survey, they brought back images from the sea floor that conclusively identified the remains of the steamship Portland.[2] Researchers from NOAA's Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary, along with the NOAA-UConn team and filmmakers from [The Science Channel], returned to the wreck of the famed 19th-century steamship from September 13\u201318, 2003. Kicking off the expedition to peer into the vessel's past and plan for its future, the team conducted the first surveys of the Portland since its location was confirmed in August 2002 within NOAA's Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary off the Massachusetts coast.[2] In addition to documenting the Portland, the expedition team investigated the wrecks of the Louise B. Crary and Frank A. Palmer, a pair of Boston-bound coal schooners that collided and sank in 1902 as a result of a navigational error. Like the Portland, the Crary and Palmer lie within the boundaries of Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary. Side-scan sonar images obtained in 2002 during a joint mission between NOAA and NURC-UConn revealed that the two large vessels plunged to the sea floor simultaneously, their bows locked together in a deadly embrace. Schooners Columbia and Delaware also sank in the gale.[2]"

        "content": "The southern coast of Scituate, Massachusetts, is marked by four distinct flaws, running from First Cliff on the northern end of the town's coast down to Fourth Cliff in the southern end. The area surrounding and including Fourth Cliff is called Humarock. Prior to the Portland Gale, the North River flowed south between Fourth Cliff and Marshfield, Massachusetts, joining the South River and entering the ocean two kilometers to the south of the current opening. A thin strip of beach, which connected Third Cliff to Fourth Cliff, was breached by the storm, leaving Fourth Cliff an island. Eventually the old inlet has silted in, forcing the South River to flow north between Marshfield and Fourth Cliff, where it now joins the North River to enter the ocean between Third and Fourth Cliffs. Although Fourth Cliff is now connected by land to Marshfield, north of Rexhame Beach, there are no roads across the old inlet. As a result, Fourth Cliff and the rest of the Humarock part of Scituate are only accessible via the Marshfield Avenue and Julian Street bridges from Marshfield. The change to the course of the North River also increased the salinity of the large marsh area surrounding the current outlet, resulting in the loss of the valuable salt haying business.[2]"

On the morning of 7 August it became 853,679 cfs.[5] By that time the reservoir was already 90% full, leaving very little empty space left to accommodate the floodwater coming from upstream. The inflow was still increasing. The peak inflow during the flood was about 1,200,000 cfs, but it lasted only for two hours.[2] Operating the gates of the dams increased the outflow rapidly. The outflow increased from 124,920 on 6\u00a0August, 8 am cfs, to 409,004 cfs on 7\u00a0August 8.00 am. Maintaining the same pace of increase the outflow was increased to a peak of 907,316 cfs at 8 pm on 8 August. The heavy outflow of about 900,000 cfs for a prolonged period of time caused the flood in Surat and other downstream villages. The high tide of the sea during the flood further reduced the drainage capacity of the river and worsened the damage due to flooding.[5] The Government of Gujarat described the flood as a natural disaster, while reports from the People's Committee on Gujarat Floods of August 2006 and the Surat Citizens' Council Trust's Committee, described the flood as being the result of mismanagement.[8][7][3][1]"

On 1\u00a0May, the storm intensified into a subtropical cyclone of tropical storm intensity, and looped westward.[4] During this time, the system encountered sea surface temperatures about 1\u00a0\u00b0C (1.8\u00a0\u00b0F) above average and low wind shear, due to an extremely strong El Ni\u00f1o event, allowing the storm to organize further.[1] On 2\u00a0May, the storm reached its peak intensity, with maximum sustained winds of 72\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph; 39\u00a0kn),[4][nb 1] and a minimum low pressure of 993\u00a0hPa (29.32\u00a0inHg).[3] Around this time, the storm was identified by researchers and unofficially named Katie.[1] During the next day, Katie slowly tracked westward while gradually weakening. On 4\u00a0May, Katie weakened into a subtropical depression and began accelerating to the northwest, passing to the east of Easter Island, before weakening further into a remnant low.[4] With this degeneration, the Chilean Navy Weather Service ceased issuing warnings on the storm.[3] On 6\u00a0May, Katie's remnant low dissipated.[3] During Katie's entire existence, the storm remained east of 120\u00b0W, outside of the South Pacific basin's official boundary.[4][3]"

As such, Cyclone Yaku in March 2023 is the only recorded instance of a tropical cyclone impacting western South America.[7][8][9][10] Tropical cyclone formation in this extreme part of the Southeast Pacific is so rare that no warning agencies have yet been assigned to the region east of 120\u00b0W.[1] Katie formed during an extremely strong El Ni\u00f1o event; the abnormally-warm waters 1\u00a0\u00b0C (1.8\u00a0\u00b0F) above average and low wind shear across the region may have contributed to the system's rare formation.[1] Although Katie's observed characteristics were consistent with that of a subtropical cyclone, detailed analysis revealed that the storm may have briefly transitioned into a tropical cyclone, around the time of its peak intensity.[3]"

The Truckee River flows through Washoe County, including the Reno-Sparks area.[1][5] The floods were caused by unseasonably warm rain which partially melted excessive snowpack in the three rivers.[6][7] A trio of heavy snowstorms from the Gulf of Alaska had hit the Sierra Nevada region during the last three weeks of 1996, followed by three subtropical storms originating in the Pacific Ocean, the third of which was a Pineapple Express.[1][7][5] Aside from Nevada, the same storm system also caused flooding in several other states, including California,[8] Idaho, Oregon and Washington.[9] In Nevada, the floods began on January 1, 1997,[10] and continued over the next two days as water made its way through several counties.[11] In Sparks, the Truckee River reached flood stage at 2:00\u00a0a.m. on January 1, followed by Reno at 10:30\u00a0a.m.[1] The river's flood stage was 12 feet, and it crested at 14.7 feet on January 2, breaking the last record of 13.8 in 1950.[12][13] The river experienced widespread flooding throughout its 90-mile course between Lake Tahoe and Pyramid Lake.[12][14] The river level rose 7 feet,[13] eventually receding from flood stage on January 3.[15] The Truckee River had an early warning system \u2013 consisting of gauges \u2013 that performed inadequately in predicting the flood severity.[16] The United States Geological Survey (USGS) had approximately 100 gauging stations covering the three rivers, and 35 of these stations were damaged by the floodwaters, with 6 being completely destroyed.[5] The floods covered approximately 63,800 acres (25,800\u00a0ha).[1] Although initially considered a 100-year flood event, a study by the USGS found it to be less than a 50-year event.

        "content": " The 1960 North Indian Ocean cyclone season featured two deadly tropical cyclones that collectively killed approximately 20,000\u00a0people collectively in East Pakistan (present-day Bangladesh). The Indian subcontinent divides the North Indian Ocean into two areas: the Bay of Bengal to the east and the Arabian Sea to the west. The official Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre for this basin is the India Meteorological Department (IMD), while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center releases unofficial advisories. On average, five storms form in the North Indian Ocean every season with dual peaks in activity during May and November.[1] Cyclones that occurred between 45\u00b0E and 100\u00b0E were included in seasonal records by the IMD.[2] Fifteen depressions developed during the 1960 season, with five becoming cyclonic storms. The majority of the activity took place in the Bay of Bengal, where eleven systems formed; however, the season's first storm formed over the Arabian Sea on May\u00a010. The storm produced hurricane-force winds and attained a barometric air pressure of 974 mbar (hPa; 28.76\u00a0inHg). The deadliest and most intense cyclone of the season was Severe Cyclonic Storm Ten, which killed 14,174 in East Pakistan in early November. With peak winds estimated at 150\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph) and a pressure of 966.7 mbar (hPa; 28.55\u00a0inHg), it struck just three weeks after the previous system devastated the same area. The storm produced a 6.1\u00a0m (20\u00a0ft) storm tide that swept 16\u00a0km (10\u00a0mi) inland, submerging several small islands. The two storms left a combined 200,000\u2013300,000\u00a0people homeless. These systems marked the start of an unusually active period of cyclones impacting East Pakistan, culminating ten years later with the 1970 Bhola cyclone, which killed between 300,000 and 500,000\u00a0people.[3] During the 1960 season, several depressions impacted India with heavy rainfall. Collectively, these systems killed 167\u00a0people."

On May\u00a014, the S.S. Kampala sailed into the system, encountering 55\u00a0km/h (35\u00a0mph) winds and rough seas. Over the following two days, the depression intensified into a cyclonic storm, with gale-force winds extending 150\u00a0km (90\u00a0mi) from the center. During the overnight hours of May\u00a016 through 17, the SS Mohammedi sailed almost directly into the center of the cyclone, reporting a barometric pressure of 974 mbar (hPa; 28.76\u00a0inHg) and 9.1\u00a0m (30\u00a0ft) waves. Several other vessels, such as the S.S. Saudi and S.S. Exchequer, encountered the storm. Both ships reported hurricane-force winds, and the latter endured seas as high as 15.2\u00a0m (50\u00a0ft) early on May\u00a018. Later that day, the storm weakened so rapidly the crew of the S.S. Exchequer were able to watch the pressure on their barometer actively rise.[5] The storm continued westward, moving ashore Al Mahrah Governorate in eastern South Yemen as a severe cyclonic storm on May\u00a018, before dissipating. The next Yemeni landfall would not occur again until 2015 with Cyclone Chapala.[6][5] As a developing cyclone, the system brought monsoon-like moisture to much of the Maldives, Ceylon (present-day Sri Lanka), and southern India between May\u00a014 and 17. The heaviest rains fell on May\u00a017, with 190\u00a0mm (7.5\u00a0in) recorded at Cochin, India, that day.[5]"

Though it was classified a deep depression, stronger winds of up to 75\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph) were reported from Sagar Island. Based on measurements from nearby stations, it is estimated that the system attained a minimum pressure of 988\u00a0mb (hPa; 29.18\u00a0inHg) just as it moved ashore. Once inland, the system quickly weakened and accelerated northeastward. It later dissipated over Assam on May\u00a030.[7] The system produced torrential rains across eastern India and East Pakistan. In Cherrapunji, 540\u00a0mm (21\u00a0in) of rain fell during a two-day span, while many other areas recorded over 100\u00a0mm (3.9\u00a0in).

Winds in the area were measured up to 45\u00a0km/h (30\u00a0mph); however, as the system moved offshore, winds quickly increased to 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph). Low pressures were recorded across the area, with a minimum of 990.8 mbar (hPa; 29.26\u00a0inHg) measured in Dwarka. Becoming nearly stationary off the coast of Gujarat, the depression began to interact with an approaching monsoon. This interaction caused winds to increase, with two vessels reporting 75\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph) winds during the late morning hours of July\u00a04. Later that day, the system began moving to the northwest and quickly weakened.

Winds up to 45\u00a0km/h (30\u00a0mph) were reported in Sandheads. Once onshore, it turned westward and slowed while maintaining its intensity.[15][16] The system finally weakened on August\u00a018 as it resumed moving northwestward again, and two days later it dissipated over southeastern Rajasthan.[15] Large portions of India were affected by rains from the depression, with Orissa and Madhya receiving the heaviest rains.[15] According to Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, up to 1,000\u00a0mm (40\u00a0in) of rain fell across portions of Orissa. The tremendous precipitation triggered disastrous floods that killed at least 65\u00a0people.[17] Continued rains over the next two weeks exacerbated the situation and by August\u00a030, an estimated 2.5\u00a0million people were homeless.[18] Most affected were areas around the Mahanadi River and its tributaries where flood waters reached 3.7\u00a0m (12\u00a0ft) in depth.

Glenpark on October\u00a08, the system was classified as a depression.[25] Moving slowly northwestwards,[24] the system further deepened into a cyclonic storm on October\u00a09. Several ships in the path of the storm recorded gale-force winds, depicting its strengthening. Early on October\u00a010, it became a severe cyclonic storm and soon reached its peak intensity with winds of 110\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph). Its central pressure at this time was estimated to be 986 mbar (hPa; 29.12\u00a0inHg).[25] The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) estimated that the storm attained one-minute sustained winds of 155\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph).[26] Turning northeastward, the system made landfall between Barisal and Noakhali in East Pakistan,[25] with the eye passing directly over the islands of Bhola, Hatia, and Ramgati.[26] Once onshore, the system quickly weakened and ultimately dissipated over Assam early on October\u00a012.[25] Across coastal areas of East Pakistan, the storm wrought catastrophic damage. A 5.8\u00a0m (19\u00a0ft) tidal surge washed over the islands of Hatia, Sandwip, Kutubdia.[25] Communications across the region were crippled, and it took six days for word of the scale of damage to reach officials. Entire villages were reportedly wiped out by the storm.[27] Approximately 35,000\u00a0homes were destroyed, most of which were thatched huts made of bamboo and mud. About 300 schools were also damaged.[28] The worst damage took place on Ramgati Island where 3,500\u00a0people were killed.[29][30] Roughly 95\u00a0percent of the island's structure were destroyed, forcing residents to cling to trees for survival. Only two police officers survived and were able to inform government officials of the disaster.[30] An estimated 6,000\u00a0people perished while another 100,000\u00a0were left homeless. Heavy rain accompanied the storm, with Cox's Bazar reporting 180\u00a0mm (7.1\u00a0in).[25] Relief efforts in the wake of the storm were hampered by the nation's poor infrastructure and debris left behind.[31] On October\u00a018, members of the East Pakistani military were deployed to the hardest hit areas to provide stable communication and clean drinking water.[28]"

Within four hours of landfall, little rainfall was reported near the storm's eye.[26] The cyclone rapidly weakened and dissipated the following day over the Lushai Hills.[32] Striking East Pakistan as a powerful storm, the system produced a storm tide of 6.1\u00a0m (20\u00a0ft) that moved 16\u00a0km (10\u00a0mi) inland, devastating many communities.[32] A storm surge of 6.7\u00a0m (22\u00a0ft) was measured in Halishahar. In addition to the surge, there was a series of tidal waves that followed the storm, causing additional damage. Offshore, these waves were estimated at 12.2\u00a0m (40\u00a0ft); though they significantly decreased before impacting land.[26] Chittagong and surrounding communities were regarded as the hardest hit, with most being submerged in 3\u00a0m (10\u00a0ft) of water. The city's port was largely destroyed, with almost every vessel washed ashore. Some were found 16\u00a0km (10\u00a0mi) away and one even at another port.[32] The storm's intense winds, estimated as high as 240\u00a0km/h (150\u00a0mph) on Sandwip Island,[26] leveled buildings and scattered debris over large distances. Crops were flattened by the storm and in some instances had been \"burnt\" by the sheer force of the wind. A total of 14,174\u00a0people perished in the storm while another 200,000\u00a0were left homeless.[32][33] Following the mass casualties from the two storms, the Government of Pakistan requested the assistance of former National Hurricane Center director, Gordon E.

        "content": " The 1998 Pacific typhoon season was the least active Pacific typhoon season on record, until it was surpassed 12 years later. It would produce 16 tropical storms, 8 strengthening into typhoons.[1] The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean, north of the equator and west of the International Date Line. Storms that form east of the date line and north of the equator are called hurricanes; see 1998 Pacific hurricane season. Tropical Storms formed in the entire west Pacific basin were assigned a name by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. Tropical depressions in this basin have the \"W\" suffix added to their number. Tropical depressions that enter or form in the Philippine area of responsibility are assigned a name by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration or PAGASA. This can often result in the same storm having two names. The 1998 season was very weak compared to the 1997 season; this was due to the strong El Ni\u00f1o in the previous season. During the 1998 season, a total of 28 tropical depressions developed across the western Pacific basin. Of those 28 depressions, a total of 18 strengthened into tropical storms of which 9 further intensified into typhoons. The first tropical cyclone developed on May\u00a028, marking the fourth latest start to any Pacific typhoon season on record, and the last one dissipated on December\u00a022. The Philippine region also set a record: with only eleven storms forming or moving into its area of responsibility, PAGASA had its quietest season on record, later tying with the 2010 season. Overall inactivity was caused by an unusually strong La Ni\u00f1a, which also fueled a hyperactive Atlantic hurricane season that year."

The disturbance gradually became better organized and was classified as Tropical Depression 01W at 1500\u00a0UTC on July\u00a07. Upon becoming a depression, it marked the latest start for a Pacific typhoon season since reliable records began in 1959.[2] The next day, 01W entered the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) area of responsibility and received the local name Akang.[3] Slowly moving towards the northwest, the depression neared Taiwan. However, increasing vertical wind shear caused the convection associated with the depression to become displaced from the center of circulation. With the center exposed, 01W weakened. At 2100\u00a0UTC on July\u00a010, the depression made landfall in northern Taiwan and dissipated shortly after. No known damage was caused by the depression.[2]"

Tropical Depression 02W slowly strengthened as northerly outflow was constricted. By late on July\u00a08, the depression was upgraded to a tropical storm and given the name Nichole. The storm reached its peak intensity while just offshore southern Taiwan with winds of 95\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph 1-minute winds) according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)[2] and 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph 10-minute winds) with a minimum pressure of 998\u00a0hPa (mbar) according to the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA).[4] The combination of dry air, strong wind shear, and the storm's proximity to land caused Nichole to quickly weaken to a tropical depression twelve hours after reaching its peak intensity. The exposed remnants of Nichole executed a clockwise-loop offshore Taiwan before traveling north into mainland China and dissipating.[2] Rough seas produced by the storm caused four container ships to run aground in Taiwans' Kaohsiung Harbor, none of the crew members were injured. Heavy rains in Taiwan flooded an estimated 2,500 acres (10\u00a0km2) of crops.[5]"

The depression briefly intensified into a tropical storm, with a peak intensity of 85\u00a0km/h (50\u00a0mph  1-minute winds) as convection wrapped around the entire center of circulation.

        "content": " The 2011 Atlantic hurricane season was the second in a group of three very active Atlantic hurricane seasons, each with 19 named storms, tied with 1887, 1995, 2010, and 2012. The above-average activity was mostly due to a La Ni\u00f1a that persisted during the previous year. Of the season's 19 tropical storms, only seven strengthened into hurricanes, and four of those became major hurricanes: Irene, Katia, Ophelia, and Rina. The season officially began on June 1 and ended on November 30, dates which conventionally delimit the period during each year in which most tropical cyclones develop in the Atlantic Ocean. However, the first tropical storm of the season, Arlene, did not develop until nearly a month later. The final system, Tropical Storm Sean, dissipated over the open Atlantic on November 11. Due to the presence of a La Ni\u00f1a in the Pacific Ocean, many pre-season forecasts called for an above-average hurricane season. In Colorado State University (CSU)'s spring outlook, the organization called for 16 named storms and 9 hurricanes, of which 4 would intensify further into major hurricanes. On May 19, 2011, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) issued their pre-season forecast, predicting 12\u201318 named storms, 6\u201310 hurricanes, and 3\u20136 major hurricanes. Following a quick start to the season, NOAA subsequently increased their outlook to 14\u201319 named storms, 7\u201310 hurricanes, and 3\u20135 major hurricanes on August 4; CSU made no changes to the number of cyclones forecast throughout the year. Many tropical cyclones affected land during the 2011 season; most impacts, however, did not result in a significant loss of life or property. On June\u00a029, Arlene made landfall in Mexico near Cabo Rojo, Veracruz, causing over $223\u00a0million (2011\u00a0USD) damage and killing 22\u00a0people.[nb 1] Tropical Storm Harvey moved into the coastline of Central America in mid-August, and three deaths were reported as a result. During the month of September, Tropical Storm Lee and Hurricane Nate moved into the central United States Gulf Coast and central Mexico, respectively; the former led to 18\u00a0deaths, and the latter caused 5\u00a0fatalities. As an extratropical cyclone, Lee caused significant damage in the form of flooding across the Northeast United States, especially in New York and Pennsylvania. The deadliest and most destructive cyclone of the season developed east of the Lesser Antilles on August 21. Hurricane Irene caused significant impact across some of the Caribbean Islands and United States Eastern Seaboard, leaving about $14.2\u00a0billion in damage and resulting in the name's retirement. Overall, the season resulted in 112\u00a0deaths and nearly $17.4\u00a0billion in damage."

        "content": "In advance of, and during, each hurricane season, several forecasts of hurricane activity are issued by national meteorological services, scientific agencies, and noted hurricane experts. These include forecasters from the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s National Hurricane and Climate Prediction Center's, Philip J. Klotzbach, William M. Gray and their associates at Colorado State University (CSU), Tropical Storm Risk, and the United Kingdom's Met Office. The forecasts include weekly and monthly changes in significant factors that help determine the number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a particular year. As stated by NOAA and CSU, an average Atlantic hurricane season between 1981 and 2010 contains roughly 12 tropical storms, 6 hurricanes, 3 major hurricanes, and an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) Index of 66-103 units.[1][19] ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time or that are particularly strong hurricanes have high ACEs. It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h), the threshold for tropical storm strength.[20] NOAA typically categorizes a season as either above-average, average, of below-average based on the cumulative ACE Index; however, the number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a hurricane season is considered occasionally as well.[1]"

In its report, the organization predicted an above-average hurricane season with 17 named storms, 9 hurricanes, and 5 major hurricanes. In addition, the team expected an ACE value of approximately 165, citing that El Ni\u00f1o conditions had little chance to develop by the start of the season. The team also predicted that there was a higher chance of a tropical cyclone hitting the United States coastline when compared to 2010.[4] TSR released an updated forecast on April\u00a04, lowering the number of predicted cyclones by one.[5] On April 4, 2011, CSU revised their December forecast slightly, predicting 16 named storms, 9 hurricanes, and 5 major hurricanes.[6] On May\u00a019, 2011, NOAA released their first forecast for the 2011 Atlantic hurricane season. The organization expected 12\u201318 named storms, 6\u201310 hurricanes, and 3\u20136\u00a0major hurricanes would form in the Atlantic during 2011, citing above-normal sea surface temperatures, a weakening La Ni\u00f1a, and the effect of the warm regime of the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation. NOAA also stated that, when looking at climate models, \"activity comparable to some of the active seasons since 1995\" could occur.[7] On May\u00a026, the UK Met Office (UKMO) issued a forecast of a slightly above-average season. They predicted 13\u00a0tropical storms with a 70% chance that the number would fall between 10 and 17. However, they did not \u2013 and do not \u2013 issue forecasts on the number of hurricanes and major hurricanes. The team also predicted an ACE Index of 151 with a 70% chance that the index would be in the range 89 to 212.[9]"

Nineteen of the twenty depressions attained tropical storm status, tied with 1887, 1995, 2010, and later the 2012 season for the fourth-highest number of named storms since record-keeping began in 1851.[22][23][24] Seven of these tropical storms became hurricanes, while four of those hurricanes further intensified into major hurricanes.[20] The season was more active than usual due to lower than average wind shear, warmer than average sea surface temperatures, and the presence of a La Ni\u00f1a.[25] Collectively, the tropical cyclones of this season resulted in nearly $18.5\u00a0billion in damage and there were 114\u00a0deaths; a majority of it was caused by Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee.[26] The season officially ended on November\u00a030, 2011.[21] Tropical cyclogenesis began in the month of June, with Tropical Storm Arlene forming on June\u00a028. After Arlene dissipated on July\u00a01, there was about a two-week lull in activity, before Bret, Cindy, and Don developed in the latter half of July. August was the most active month of the season, featuring eight tropical cyclones \u2013 Emily, Franklin, Gert, Harvey, Irene, Tropical Depression Ten, Jose, and Katia. The number of named storms in August was well above the 1944\u20132010 average of four,[27] and just one short of the record of eight set in 2004 and later in 2012,[28] but the number of hurricanes was below the mean.[27] September was slightly above average,[29] with 5\u00a0named storms, 2\u00a0hurricanes, and 1\u00a0major hurricane and featuring the unnamed tropical storm, Lee, Maria, Nate, Ophelia, and Philippe. Ophelia was the most intense tropical cyclone of the season, peaking as a Category\u00a04 hurricane with winds of 140\u00a0mph (225\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 940\u00a0mbar (28\u00a0inHg). The next two months featured one system each, with Rina developing in October and Sean forming in November. Sean was the final storm of the season and became extratropical on November\u00a011.[30] The season's activity was reflected with an average cumulative ACE rating of 125.[20]"

Cyclonic rotation became increasingly evident on satellite imagery, though organization was halted by the disturbance's passage over the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula on June\u00a026. After emerging into the Bay of Campeche, favorable environmental conditions allowed for the development of Tropical Storm Arlene by 18:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a028. Moving generally westward due to the influence of high pressure to the cyclone's north, Arlene gradually intensified, reaching its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 993\u00a0mbar (29.3\u00a0inHg) at 12:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a030; the strong tropical storm moved ashore in Mexico near Cabo Rojo, Veracruz, about an hour later. Once inland, the center of circulation became increasingly diffuse, and the storm dissipated over the Sierra Madre Mountains early on July\u00a01.[31] Numerous tropical cyclone watches and warnings were issued for the coastline of Mexico shortly after the formation of Arlene; once inland, all were discontinued.[31] Despite its relatively weak strength, Arlene produced isolated rainfall totals in excess of 9\u00a0in (230\u00a0mm).[32] High amounts of precipitation led to numerous mudslides and flooding, causing an estimated $223.4\u00a0million in damage.[33][34][35] A total of 22\u00a0deaths were reported in association with Tropical Storm Arlene.[31] Although the center of circulation remained over Mexico, the storm's far-reaching effects brought minimal relief to drought-stricken portions of southern Texas and Florida.[36]"

Tracking south-southeast, the low-pressure center was initially baroclinic in nature, but quickly transitioned into a warm-core low over the warm waters of the western Atlantic. Decreasing vertical wind shear allowed for the development of convection \u2013 shower and thunderstorm activity \u2013 atop the low-level circulation, and Dvorak satellite classifications were initiated early on July\u00a017 given the organization on satellite imagery. Following an aircraft reconnaissance flight into the disturbance that afternoon, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) subsequently classified the system as Tropical Depression Two at 18:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a017 about 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km) northwest of Great Abaco Island in the Bahamas. After about six hours, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Bret.[37] As the system turned northeastward, the formation of an anticyclone atop Bret's center provided favorable conditions for intensification; accordingly, an eye-like feature and an eyewall \u2013 a ring of thunderstorms around the eye where typically the most intense convection associated with a tropical cyclone is located \u2013 were noted on microwave satellite imagery during the afternoon hours of July 18. At 18:00\u00a0UTC, the system attained its peak intensity with winds of 70\u00a0mph (115\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 995\u00a0mbar (29.4\u00a0inHg). After moving over increasingly cool sea surface temperatures, the cyclone began to gradually weaken. Bret weakened to a tropical depression at around 00:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a022 and no longer met the criteria of a tropical cyclone by 12:00\u00a0UTC, while positioned approximately 375\u00a0mi (605\u00a0km) north of Bermuda.[37] Bret left minimal impact in the Bahamas, with rainfall alleviating drought conditions.[38] Precipitation was also generally beneficial on Bermuda, though minor flooding affected some local businesses in poor-drainage areas.[39]"

Tracking east-northeastward, the system gradually organized and became better defined. The disturbance produced moderate rains while passing south of the territory, peaking at 1.16\u00a0in (29\u00a0mm); gusty winds were also observed. At 06:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a020, the low developed into a tropical depression east of Bermuda. Embedded within the mid-latitude westerlies, the depression moved northeast and maintained this general direction for the remainder of its existence.[40] Six hours after formation, the system strengthened into Tropical Storm Cindy. Convection steadily increased over the storm, and a ragged eye-like feature appeared on both visible and microwave satellite imagery. Corresponding with this, Cindy attained its peak intensity late on July 21, with winds of 70\u00a0mph (115\u00a0km/h) and a barometric pressure of 994\u00a0mbar (29.4\u00a0inHg).

Tracking westward, the disturbance produced sporadic convection, but remained disorganized through its passage into the Caribbean on July\u00a023. Once there, showers and thunderstorms began to develop within an environment marginally conducive for tropical cyclogenesis. A broad area of low pressure formed and consolidated over the northwestern Caribbean Sea, and the NHC subsequently designated Tropical Depression Four on July\u00a027 about 60\u00a0mi (95\u00a0km) northeast of Canc\u00fan, Mexico. The depression quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Don as it moved into the Gulf of Mexico. Steered west-northwestward by a subtropical ridge across over the southeastern United States, Don strengthened initially under low wind shear, attaining a peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 997 mbar (hPa; 29.44\u00a0inHg). Despite low shear, Don was met with a significantly more stable environment as it emerged into the Gulf of Mexico.[41] As Don approached the Texas coast early on July\u00a030, the thunderstorms rapidly diminished due to the combination of wind shear, drier air, and cooler sea surface temperatures just offshore.[42][43] The winds decreased as the convection dissipated, and Don made landfall on Padre Island National Seashore as a tropical depression at 0230\u00a0UTC on July\u00a030. About three and a half hours later, Don degenerated into a remnant low, and the circulation dissipated six hours after that.[41] As a tropical cyclone, Don prompted tropical cyclone advisories for the southern Texas coastline. Due to its abrupt weakening prior to landfall, rainfall totals and wind observations along the warned areas were scarce; a maximum precipitation total of 2.56\u00a0in (65\u00a0mm) was documented near Bay City, Texas, and a peak wind gust of 41\u00a0mph (66\u00a0km/h) was recorded at Waldron Field.[41] Cotton farmers benefited from what rains that did fall as they harvested their crop.[44] The storm produced storm surge values lower than 2\u00a0ft (0.61\u00a0m) as well.[41]"

Turning west-northwestward along the southwest edge of a large subtropical ridge to its northeast, Emily remained relatively disorganized on satellite imagery due to strong westerly wind shear. Despite a large burst of convection south of Hispaniola on August\u00a03, the center of circulation accelerated west-northwestward, with a mid-level center moving inland over the island.

It intensified into a tropical storm the following day and further developed into a hurricane by September\u00a01, although unfavorable atmospheric conditions hindered strengthening thereafter. As the storm began to recurve over the western Atlantic, favorable conditions allowed Katia to become a major hurricane by September\u00a05 and peak as a Category\u00a04 hurricane with winds of 140\u00a0mph (225\u00a0km/h). However, internal core processes, increased wind shear, an impinging cold front, and increasingly cool ocean temperatures caused the cyclone to weaken almost immediately. Katia ultimately transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September\u00a010 about 290\u00a0mi (465\u00a0km) south-southeast of Newfoundland. At 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a013, Katia's remnant merged with a larger extratropical system, over the North Sea.[80] Although Katia passed well north of the Lesser Antilles, a yellow alert was hoisted for Guadeloupe to notify residents of dangerous seas.[81] Strong rip currents along the East Coast of the United States led to the deaths of two swimmers.[82][83] After losing its tropical characteristics, Katia prompted the issuance of numerous warnings across Europe. Hurricane-force winds impacted numerous locations,[84] downing trees and power poles, leaving thousands of people without electricity.[85] The storm was responsible for two deaths in the United Kingdom, with one from when a tree fell on a vehicle in County Durham and another during a multi-car accident on the M54 motorway resulting from adverse weather conditions. The post-tropical cyclone caused approximately \u00a3100m ($157\u00a0million) in damage in the United Kingdom alone.[80]"

        "content": "As part of their routine post-season analysis, the NHC identified an additional tropical storm. In late August, an area of convection that formed to the southwest of Bermuda organized into a distinct low-pressure area. At around 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a01, a tropical depression formed about 335\u00a0mi (540\u00a0km) north of Bermuda. It initially drifted erratically northeastward due to its position within a stationary front. Despite moderate southwesterly wind shear, the depression intensified into a tropical storm after about 12\u00a0hours, based on an increase of convection over the center. At that time, the storm attained maximum sustained winds of 45\u00a0mph (70\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1,002\u00a0mbar (29.6\u00a0inHg).[86] The thunderstorms continued to pulsate, resulting in the winds fluctuating slightly. Additionally, the intermittent nature of the convection, as well as uncertainty on whether it was associated with a cold front, prevented the storm from being classified as a tropical cyclone in real time. On September\u00a02, a Tropical Weather Outlook (TWO) by the NHC stated that \"only a slight increase in organization [would] result in the formation of a tropical storm.\"[87] That day, an approaching trough caused the storm to accelerate northeastward. Cooler waters and increased wind shear stripped away the convection, resulting in the storm becoming extratropical early on September\u00a03. The remnants continued northeastward, with the circulation dissipating by September\u00a04.[86]"

About 12\u00a0hours later, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Lee. The cyclone moved slowly north-northwestward and continued to strengthen. However, Lee transitioned into a subtropical storm at 12:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a03 due to a significantly expanded wind field, further interaction with an upper-level low pressure, and weak convection near the center. Around that time, the cyclone peaked with maximum sustained winds of 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 986\u00a0mbar (29.1\u00a0inHg). Lee weakened slightly before making landfall near Intracoastal City, Louisiana, at 10:30\u00a0UTC on September\u00a04. After moving inland, the storm moved northeastward and merged with a cold front over eastern Louisiana early on September\u00a05. The remnant low dissipated over Georgia by late on the following day.[88] In Louisiana, storm surge from Lake Pontchartrain flooded more than 150\u00a0homes in Jefferson and St. Tammany parishes. Freshwater flooding also occurred in low-lying areas of southeastern Louisiana and southern and central Mississippi due to 10\u201315\u00a0in (250\u2013380\u00a0mm) of rainfall across the area. Several roads were inundated, while 35\u00a0roads were damaged, 5\u00a0of which were washed out, in Neshoba County, Mississippi. The storm spawned 46\u00a0tornadoes, one of which damaged about 400\u00a0homes in Cherokee County, Georgia. In the Mid-Atlantic, the remnants of Lee produced over 10\u00a0in (250\u00a0mm) of rainfall in a wide area, causing worse flooding than in June and July 2006 and Hurricane Agnes in 1972. About 100,000\u00a0people in Pennsylvania evacuated, including the governor's residence. In Dauphin and Lebanon counties alone, nearly 5,000\u00a0dwellings were damaged or demolished. Extensive flooding also occurred in western New York, particularly in Binghamton, Endicott, Johnson City, Owego, Vestal, and Waverly.[88] Overall, Lee resulted in 21\u00a0deaths and about $1.6\u00a0billion in damage.[88][89][90][91]"

Early the following day, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Maria. The system reached winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) on September\u00a08, before encountering stronger wind shear and cooler water temperatures near the Leeward Islands, degenerating into a low-pressure area on September\u00a09. It slowly curved toward the north and northeast around the western periphery of the subtropical ridge, and regained tropical storm status on September\u00a010. Maria further strengthened to attain hurricane status while making its closest approach to Bermuda. The cyclone peaked with winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) on September\u00a016, but soon weakened due to an increase in wind shear and cooler ocean temperatures. Maria made landfall near Cape St. Mary's, Newfoundland, on September\u00a016, before being absorbed by a frontal system later that day.[92] Despite its poor organization, Maria brought heavy rainfall to portions of the eastern Caribbean, especially Puerto Rico. Numerous roadways and homes were flooded, with 150\u00a0dwellings in the Yabucoa area receiving water damage. Many people were forced to evacuate after water and mud began entering their homes. Nearly 16,000\u00a0people were without electricity in Puerto Rico.[92] Maria left approximately $1.36\u00a0million in damage on the island.[93] In addition, tropical storm-force winds were observed on many of the U. S. Virgin Islands. As the system passed west of Bermuda, brief tropical storm-force sustained winds were recorded, along with higher gusts; rainfall on the island, however, was minimal. In Newfoundland, fairly strong winds were recorded, but rainfall totals were generally minimal.[92]"

Moving in an erratic motion at a very slow pace, Nate continued to strengthen. Late on September\u00a08, the cyclone intensified into a Category\u00a01 hurricane, peaking with maximum sustained winds of 75\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 994\u00a0mbar (29.4\u00a0inHg). Due to the storm's slow movement, Nate began to upwell cooler waters in its wake, while very dry air began entering into the storm, resulting in weakening. Around 16:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a011, Nate made landfall in Mexico near Tecolutla, Veracruz, with winds of 45\u00a0mph (70\u00a0km/h). Shortly after making landfall, much of Nate's showers and thunderstorms diminished, with the system generating into a remnant low by 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a012, which dissipated about six hours later.[94] In the Bay of Campeche, 10\u00a0oil rig workers evacuated the Trinity II rig, but were forced to abandon their lifeboat. Seven of the ten were rescued, though the other four perished.[94] The storm brought up to 9.84\u00a0in (250\u00a0mm) of precipitation to southern Veracruz, causing flooding that damaged 839\u00a0homes.[95] One person died in the state after being struck by lightning.[94]"

Moving west-northwestward, the depression became Tropical Storm Ophelia on September\u00a021, and strengthened further to reach an initial peak wind speed of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) on September\u00a022. As the storm entered a region of higher wind shear it began to weaken, and was subsequently downgraded to a remnant low on September\u00a025. The following day, however, the remnants of the system began to reorganize as wind shear lessened, and on September\u00a027, the system became a tropical depression again. Moving northward, Ophelia regained tropical storm status early on September 28, and significantly deepened to attain its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 140\u00a0mph (225\u00a0km/h) on October\u00a02. This peak was short-lived however as the system passed over cooler water temperatures and into an area of high wind shear, causing it to quickly weaken and undergo transition to an extratropical cyclone. Ophelia weakened to a tropical storm early on October\u00a03, and became fully extratropical shortly after. The extratropical low was absorbed by a larger weather system on the following day.[96] As the system made its closest approach to the Leeward Islands, Ophelia produced over 10\u00a0in (250\u00a0mm) of rainfall on some islands,[96] leading to mudslides and several road rescues.[97] Light precipitation totals and gusty winds below tropical storm force were observed on Bermuda, while storm surge and dangerous rip currents along the coast caused minimal damage.[96] In Newfoundland, heavy rainfall contributed to floods that destroyed roads and exposed the inadequacy of some repair work in the aftermath of Hurricane Igor, which struck the previous year.[98] Following Ophelia's transition into an extratropical cyclone, residents in the British Isles were urged to prepare for strong winds in excess of 75\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h) and precipitation accumulations up to 4\u00a0in (100\u00a0mm).[99] In the northern regions of Ireland, a combination of moisture and significantly cooler weather produced several inches of snow, leaving hundreds without electricity.[100]"

Moving westward and embedded within a favorable environment for development, the wave quickly became organized. On September 24, a tropical depression developed about 290\u00a0mi (465\u00a0km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands. Later that day, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Philippe. Strong wind shear from upper-level winds and later on from Ophelia's outflow, as well as periodic entrainment of dry air, kept the cyclone both small and disorganized. Additionally, the low-level circulation was often exposed. Because of this hostile environment, Philippe remained near the minimum for a tropical storm and briefly weakened to a tropical depression on September\u00a028.[101] The storm began to strengthen significantly by October\u00a01, with an Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) pass on the following day confirming that Philippe was a strong tropical storm, contrary to satellite estimates. Despite high wind shear, it briefly strengthened to a hurricane on October\u00a04 when it developed an eye feature, before weakening back to a tropical storm several hours later. Philippe re-acquired hurricane intensity on October\u00a06 and peaked with maximum sustained winds of 90\u00a0mph (145\u00a0km/h) later that day. However, Philippe weakened to a tropical storm on October\u00a08, before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone later that day.

After reaching the southwestern Caribbean, convection intensified near the center and organized into a broad low on October\u00a021, possibly due to a cold front that moved into the region. After a marked increase in convection near and west of the center, a tropical depression developed early on October\u00a023 about 60\u00a0mi (97\u00a0km) north of Isla de Providencia. The depression moved northward into a weakness in a ridge near Florida, caused by a broad mid-level trough over the Southeastern United States. Initially, the depression intensified gradually, becoming Tropical Storm Rina early on October\u00a024. After a decrease in easterly wind shear, however, Rina rapidly deepened while crossing warm waters, reaching hurricane status at 18:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a024 and becoming a major hurricane about 24\u00a0hours later. Early on October\u00a026, the storm peaked with winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h).[102] After the storm reaching peak intensity, upper-level winds and wind shear quickly became unfavorable, weakening Rina to a Category\u00a02 later on October\u00a026. While moving west-northwest and northward along the western periphery of the ridge, the cyclone weakened to a tropical storm on October\u00a027. Later that day, Rina curved northward. Around 02:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a028, Rina struck Quintana Roo about 12\u00a0mi (19\u00a0km) southwest of Playa del Carmen with winds of 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h). The storm left little impact in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula due to its weakened state. Rina degenerated into a remnant low late on October\u00a028, upon emerging into the Yucat\u00e1n Channel. The remnant low dissipated near the western tip of Cuba on October\u00a029.[102] A cold front, combined with moisture from Rina, resulted in 5\u20137\u00a0in (130\u2013180\u00a0mm) of rainfall across parts of South Florida in less than six hours, causing street flooding and leaving water damage in at least 160\u00a0homes and buildings in Broward County alone.[103] Farther north, two tornadoes touched down in the vicinity of Hobe Sound, one of which damaged 42\u00a0mobile homes, 2\u00a0vehicles, and a number of trees.[104]"

While convection and the wind field had become more symmetric, the system remained a subtropical cyclone due to the associated upper-level low. Within 12\u00a0hours, Sean separated from the low and transitioned into a tropical cyclone,[105] after developing a warm core.[106] It developed outflow and intensified due to light wind shear, combined with sufficiently warm water temperatures of at least 78.8\u00a0\u00b0F (26.0\u00a0\u00b0C). With a ridge to the northeast, the storm moved slowly to the west.[105] On November 9, an eye feature developed in association with Sean,[107] which later morphed into a ring of convection. The storm peaked with winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) on November\u00a010 as reported by the hurricane hunters.[105] An approaching cold front subsequently induced higher wind shear on the cyclone as it tracked northeastward into cooler waters; this led to weakening. Sean transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on November\u00a011. Early on the next day, it was absorbed by the cold front.[105] Sean and its precursor produced light rainfall for several days in Bermuda.[108] Shortly after development, the Bermuda Weather Service issued a tropical storm watch, which was later upgraded to a tropical storm warning. When Sean passed near the island on November 11, it produced sustained winds of 43\u00a0mph (69\u00a0km/h), with gusts to 62\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h).[105] The storm produced rough seas to the east coast of Florida, which drowned one swimmer in Jensen Beach.[109] Rip currents were also observed in North Carolina.[110]"

A rain gauge operated by the Tennessee Valley Authority in McEwen recorded 17.02 inches (432\u00a0mm) of rain, setting a provisional daily rainfall record in Tennessee.[11] This broke the previous record of 13.6 inches (350\u00a0mm) recorded in Milan in 1982. The previous highest daily record rainfall in Middle Tennessee was 9.45 inches (240\u00a0mm) in Franklin in May 2010, and the two-day total for Nashville in 2010 was 13.57 inches (345\u00a0mm). Months later, in December, another rain gauge in McEwen, located at the McEwen Wastewater Treatment Plant, was officially verified as the state record, having recorded 20.73 inches (527\u00a0mm) of rain, breaking the previous record by slightly over 7 inches (180\u00a0mm).[9] Eastern Humphreys County, around the McEwen area, received substantially more rainfall than Waverly. However, the headwaters of Trace Creek originate in eastern parts of the county, with all the water draining westward through Waverly. Areas of Houston, central Humphreys, and northern Hickman counties still received upwards of 8 to 10 inches (200 to 250\u00a0mm) of rain during the event.[12] The historic rainfall totals in McEwen and resulting flooding event in Waverly were compounded by a 300-foot (91\u00a0m) drop in elevation along Trace Creek as it flows westward into Waverly,[10] along with a CSX Bruceton Subdivision railroad bridge adjacent to U.S. Route 70\u2013roughly one mile (1.6\u00a0km) east of town\u2013that became blocked by debris, resulting in a temporary dam and lake forming. The land under the railroad eventually gave way, sending a large tsunami-like wave into Waverly, with much of the town becoming inundated within the following five to twenty minutes.[13][14]"

Much of the floodwater exited the area westward along Trace Creek, causing large swells which inundated much of Waverly, just to the west. Waverly had received comparatively less rainfall than McEwen but was flooded by runoff from upstream. In Waverly, many homes and businesses became flooded after 6:00\u00a0a.m. CDT, prompting evacuations and water rescues. Waverly Elementary School and Waverly Junior High School were both inundated with several feet of water, and the Humphreys County 911 center was rendered inoperable by the flooding. Officials in Waverly commented that had the flood occurred during a weekday, the schools would have been full of students and would have been impossible to evacuate in time. Roads into Waverly became impassable, with crews trying to perform rescue operations unable to reach some areas. Cell phone service in the area was disrupted as well, complicating initial response and recovery efforts.[3][17] The county water system was reported down by the Humphreys County Sheriff,[2] and a boil water advisory was issued by the Waverly Department of Public Safety.[18] Just west of town, Waverly Central High School was impacted, with the football field, stadium, weight room, and locker room all being destroyed by the flood.[19] Roads in Waverly such as U.S. 70, Tennessee State Route 13, and Main Street were rendered impassable into Saturday evening due to residual flooding and debris. Flooding, debris, and traffic left U.S. 70 mostly closed from west of Waverly eastward into Dickson County, in addition to CSX railroad traffic. Numerous washed out and flooded roads prevented search and rescue and various news crews from arriving in Waverly until hours later.[11][18] South of Waverly, Hurricane Creek greatly flooded the community of Hurricane Mills and Loretta Lynn's Ranch. The ranch lost buildings and structures, in addition to a roadway being washed away and many fences being taken down. After trying to retrieve a tractor from rising floodwaters, a ranch foreman was swept away and found deceased a short time later. East of the ranch, after flooding from Hurricane Creek and Tumbling Creek, Tennessee State Route 230 remained closed for several days as officials cleared debris and assessed damage to the roadway.[20][21][22] In Humphreys County, at least 509 homes were impacted by flooding, 271 of which were completely destroyed. Eight public facilities and 44 commercial properties sustained damage, many of which were in downtown Waverly. The Humphreys County sheriff commented: \"We have well over 125 homes that are just gone \u2013 off the foundation, twisted, turned, or just gone.\"[7] Ten bridges in the county remained closed well after the event as a result of flood damage, including the westbound U.S. 70 bridge over Trace Creek, the TN 230 bridges over Hurricane Creek, and seven county-owned bridges across Trace Creek, Blue Creek, Hurricane Creek, Little Hurricane Creek, and Bateman Branch.[21][22]"

The Ranch, a rehabilitation center along the Piney River in Pinewood, was heavily damaged in the flooding, along with Pinewood Camp and Canoe. According to a local business owner, damage from this event was much worse than May 2010.

        "content": " The 1961 Atlantic hurricane season was a very active Atlantic hurricane season, with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) total of 189, the highest since 1950. The season, however, was an average one in terms of named storms. The season featured eight hurricanes and a well above average number of five major hurricanes. It was previously thought that the season had a record-tying seven major hurricanes, before the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project downgraded two storms in 2019. Two Category 5 hurricanes were seen in 1961, making it one of only seven Atlantic hurricane seasons to feature multiple Category 5 hurricanes in one season. The season started on June 15, and ended on November 15. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. The first system, an operationally unclassified tropical depression, formed offshore east Central Florida on June\u00a010, but dissipated a few days later. Next, Hurricane Anna developed in the eastern Caribbean Sea near the Windward Islands on July\u00a020. It brought minor damage to the islands, as well as wind and flood impacts to Central America after striking Belize as a hurricane.[nb 1] Anna caused one death and about $300,000 (1961\u00a0USD)[nb 2] in damage. Activity went dormant for nearly a month and a half, until Hurricane Betsy developed on September\u00a02. Betsy peaked as a Category\u00a04 hurricane, but remained at sea and caused no impact. One of the most significant storms of the season was Hurricane Carla, which peaked as a Category\u00a04 hurricane, before striking Texas. Carla caused 43\u00a0deaths and approximately $325.74\u00a0million in damage. Hurricane Debbie was a Category\u00a01 storm that existed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean. Early in its duration, unsettled weather from Debbie in Cape Verde resulted in a plane crash that killed 60\u00a0people. The extratropical remnants of Debbie then brushed Ireland, causing severe damage over the British Isles. The next storm, Hurricane Esther, threatened to strike New England as a major hurricane, but rapidly weakened and made landfall in Massachusetts as only a tropical storm. Impact was generally minor, with about $6\u00a0million in damage and seven deaths, all of which from a United States Navy plane crash. An unnamed tropical storm and Hurricane Frances caused minimal impact on land. In mid-October, Tropical Storm Gerda brought flooding to Jamaica and eastern Cuba, resulting in twelve deaths. Another significant storm was Hurricane Hattie, a late-season Category\u00a05 hurricane that struck Belize. Hattie caused 319\u00a0confirmed fatalities and about $60.3\u00a0million in damage. Destruction was so severe in Belize that the government had to relocate inland to a new city, Belmopan. In early November, the depression that would later strengthen into Hurricane Jenny brought light rainfall to Puerto Rico. The final storm, Tropical Storm Inga, dissipated on November\u00a08, after causing no impact on land. On September\u00a011, three hurricanes existed simultaneously \u2013 Betsy, Carla, and Debbie \u2013 the most on a single day in the Atlantic basin since 1893 and until 1998. Collectively, the storms of the 1961\u00a0Atlantic hurricane season caused about $392.34\u00a0million in damage and at least 437\u00a0fatalities."

        "header": "Season summary",
        "content": "The Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June\u00a015.[1] It was an above average season in which twelve tropical storms formed; this was above the 1950\u20132000\u00a0average of 9.6\u00a0named storms.[2] Eight of these reached hurricane status, also above of the 1950\u20132000\u00a0average of 5.9.[3][2] Furthermore, five storms reached major hurricane status. It was originally believed that the season had seven major hurricanes, though later analysis resulted in a downgrade of two storms.[4] Of the five major hurricanes, two became Category\u00a05 hurricanes. Four hurricanes and two tropical storms made landfall during the season,[3] causing 348\u00a0deaths and $391.6\u00a0million in damage.[5] Hurricane Debbie also caused damage and deaths, despite remaining offshore and then after becoming extratropical. Tropical cyclogenesis began with an initially unclassified tropical depression, which developed on June\u00a010.[6] More than a month later, Hurricane Anna formed on July\u00a017 and dissipated on July\u00a024. Thereafter, no other systems developed in July or the month of August.[3] A lack of cyclonic activity in the Atlantic basin in August is rare, with such phenomenon not occurring again until the 1997 and 2022 seasons.[7] The Atlantic basin remained dormant until Hurricane Betsy developed on September\u00a02. During the next four days, two other tropical cyclones formed \u2013 Carla and Debbie. On September\u00a011, the three storms \u2013 Betsy, Carla, and Debbie \u2013 existed simultaneously as hurricanes,[3] the most in a single day since 1893 and until 1998.[8] Esther, which developed on September\u00a010, did not reach hurricane status until September\u00a012. Later that day, a tropical storm that went unnamed formed over the Bahamas and moved across the East Coast of the United States for its brief duration.[3][9] After Debbie became extratropical on September\u00a014, another tropical cyclone developed over two weeks later, Hurricane Frances. Thereafter, tropical cyclogenesis slowed in October, which featured only three systems, a second previously unclassified tropical depression, Gerda, and Hattie. The latter was the strongest tropical cyclone of the season, peaking with maximum sustained winds of 165\u00a0mph (266\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 914\u00a0mbar (27.0\u00a0inHg). After weakening slightly, Hattie struck Belize on October\u00a031, before dissipating on November\u00a01. Later that day, Hurricane Jenny developed northeast of Antigua. Jenny remained weak for much of its duration and became extratropical on November\u00a08. The final system, Tropical Storm Inga, formed in the Gulf of Mexico on November\u00a04. Four days later, Inga dissipated,[3] one week before the season officially ended.[1] The season's activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 189, one of the highest values recorded. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h), which is the threshold for tropical storm strength.[4]"

After passing just south of Grenada early on July\u00a020, Anna entered the Caribbean Sea. Favorable environmental conditions allowed Anna to reach hurricane intensity late on July\u00a020. The cyclone continued to slowly intensifying, reaching Category\u00a02 intensity on July\u00a022 and peaking with maximum sustained winds of 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h). However, the storm weakened slightly before making landfall as a Category\u00a01 hurricane in Honduras near Barra Patuca, Gracias a Dios Department, with winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h). After re-emerging into the Caribbean, Anna weakened slightly further, striking Utila around 01:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a024 with winds of 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h). About nine hours later, the hurricane made landfall in Belize near Monkey River Town at the same intensity. Anna rapidly weakened over land and dissipated late on July\u00a024.[3] As a developing tropical cyclone over the Windward Islands, Anna produced strong winds on Grenada, though damage was limited to some crops, trees, and telephone poles.[10] Other islands experienced gusty winds, but no damage. Passing just north of Venezuela, the hurricane produced strong winds over the country, peaking as high as 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h).[11] Strong winds caused widespread damage in northern Honduras. Throughout the country, at least 36\u00a0homes were destroyed and 228\u00a0were damaged.[12] Severe damage in the Gracias a Dios Department left hundreds of people homeless.[13] Additionally, high winds toppled approximately 10,000\u00a0coconut trees.[12] Overall, Anna caused one fatality and $300,000\u00a0in damage, primarily in Central America.[14][13]"

        "header": "Hurricane Betsy",
        "content": "In early September, a tropical wave was noted in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ).[14][15] On September\u00a02, the disturbance was analyzed to have attained tropical storm strength, after nearby ship reports indicated strong winds associated with anomalously low barometric pressures.[14] Moving steadily northwestward, favorable conditions allowed Betsy to quickly intensify later that day.[3] Shortly after, a trough situated along 50\u00b0W steered Betsy to a more northerly course. Another low-pressure area later formed in the trough, perturbing the ridge to the north of Betsy for much of its initial stages, causing the hurricane's central pressure to rise,[14] despite an increase in sustained winds.[3] However, on September\u00a05, a shortwave forced the low northeastward, allowing for Betsy to strengthen further.[14] Early on September\u00a06, Betsy attained Category 4 hurricane strength, peaking with maximum sustained winds of 130\u00a0mph (210\u00a0km/h) and a central pressure of 945\u00a0mbar (945\u00a0hPa; 27.9\u00a0inHg),[3] based on reconnaissance flights into the system.[6]:\u200a15\u201316\u200a However, as a result of missing the short wave itself, the hurricane later weakened and fell to Category\u00a03 intensity while located about 440 miles (710\u00a0km) east-northeast of Bermuda. Betsy weakened further to Category\u00a02 hurricane before becoming nearly stationary beginning on September\u00a06.[14] Moving into higher latitudes, Betsy began to weaken, degenerating back to Category\u00a01\u00a0hurricane intensity on late on September\u00a08.[3] A separate, minor trough was later able to move the system northeastwards by the following day.[14] Betsy re-intensified into a Category\u00a02 hurricane early on September\u00a010, but transitioned into extratropical cyclone several hours later. The extratropical remnants continued northeastward and weakened, before executing a large loop over the far north Atlantic. The remnants dissipated well north of the Azores on September\u00a016.[3]"

        "header": "Hurricane Carla",
        "content": "A tropical depression developed from an area of squally weather embedded within the ITCZ in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on September\u00a03.[16] Initially a tropical depression, it strengthened slowly while heading northwestward, and by September\u00a04, the system was upgraded to Tropical Storm Carla.[3] About 24\u00a0hours later, Carla was upgraded to a hurricane.[3][17] Shortly thereafter, the storm curved northward while approaching the Yucat\u00e1n Channel. Late on September\u00a07, Carla entered the Gulf of Mexico while passing just northeast of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. The cyclone reached major hurricane intensity around 12:00\u00a0UTC on the next day. Resuming its northwestward course, Carla continued intensification and on September\u00a011, it peaked as a Category\u00a04 hurricane. Carla made landfall near Port O'Connor, Texas, with winds of 145\u00a0mph (233\u00a0km/h). It weakened quickly inland and was reduced to a tropical storm on September\u00a012. Heading generally northward, Carla transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September\u00a013, while centered over southern Oklahoma. However, the remnants continued generally northeastward and entered Canada on September\u00a014, before dissipating near Cape Chidley early on September\u00a016.[3] While crossing the Yucat\u00e1n Channel, the outer bands of Carla brought gusty winds and severe local flooding in western Cuba and the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.[14][18] Although initially considered a significant threat to Florida,[19] the storm brought only light winds and small amounts of precipitation, reaching no more than 3.15\u00a0in (80\u00a0mm).[18] In Texas, wind gusts as high as 170\u00a0mph (270\u00a0km/h) were observed in Port Lavaca. Additionally, several tornadoes spawned in the state caused notable impacts, with the most destructive tornado striking Galveston, Texas at F4 intensity, resulting in 200\u00a0buildings being severely damaged, of which 60-75\u00a0were destroyed, eight deaths and 200\u00a0injuries.[20] Throughout the state, Carla destroyed 1,915\u00a0homes, 568\u00a0farm buildings, and 415\u00a0other buildings. Additionally, 50,723\u00a0homes, 5,620\u00a0farm buildings, and 10,487\u00a0other buildings suffered damage. There were 34\u00a0fatalities and at least $300\u00a0million in losses in Texas alone. Several tornadoes also touched down in Louisiana, causing the destruction of 140\u00a0homes and 11\u00a0farms and other buildings, and major damage to 231\u00a0additional homes and 11\u00a0farm and other buildings. Minor to moderate damage was also reported to 748\u00a0homes and 75\u00a0farm and other buildings.[21] Six deaths and $25\u00a0million in losses in Louisiana were attributed to Carla.[22] Heavy rainfall occurred in several other states, especially in Kansas,[23] where flash flooding severely damaged crops and drowned five people.[24] Overall, Carla resulted in $325.74\u00a0million in losses and 46\u00a0fatalities.[22][24][25] In Canada, the remnants of Carla brought strong winds to Ontario and New Brunswick, though impact was primarily limited to power outages and falling trees and branches.[26]"

It was estimated to have intensified into Tropical Storm Debbie early the next day. Several hours later, Debbie passed through the southern Cape Verde Islands as a strong tropical storm or minimal hurricane,[3] resulting in a plane crash that killed 60\u00a0people.[28] Once clear of the islands, data on the storm became sparse, and the status of Debbie was uncertain over the following several days as it tracked west-northwestward and later northward. It was not until a commercial airliner intercepted the storm on September\u00a010 that its location was certain.[29] The following day, Debbie intensified and reached its peak intensity as a strong Category\u00a01 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h). The hurricane gradually slowed its forward motion and weakened.[3] By September\u00a013, Debbie's motion became influenced by the westerlies, causing the system to accelerate east-northeastward.[29] The storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone late on September\u00a014 about 140\u00a0mi (225\u00a0km) west-southwest of Horta, Azores.[3] The remnants of Debbie soon passed east-northeastward throughout the Azores and then curved northeastward. The system deepened slightly as it neared the British Isles, skirting the coast of Western Ireland on September\u00a016.[3] In Ireland, Debbie brought record winds to much of the island, with a peak gust of 114\u00a0mph (183\u00a0km/h) measured just offshore.[30] Widespread wind damage and disruption occurred, downing tens of thousands of trees and power lines.[31][32] Countless structures sustained varying degrees of damage, with many smaller buildings destroyed.[33] Agriculture experienced extensive losses to barley, corn and wheat crops.[34] Throughout Ireland, Debbie killed 18\u00a0people, with 12 in the Republic of Ireland and six in Northern Ireland.[35]  The storm also battered parts of Great Britain with winds in excess of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h).[14]"

Moving northwestward, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Esther on September\u00a011, before reaching hurricane intensity on the following day. Early on September\u00a013, Esther curved westward and deepened into a major hurricane. The storm remained a Category\u00a03 hurricane for about four days and gradually moved in west-northwestward direction. Esther strengthened into a Category\u00a04 hurricane on September\u00a016 and peaked as a Category\u00a05 hurricane on the following day with sustained winds of 160\u00a0mph (260\u00a0km/h).[3] The storm curved north-northeastward on September\u00a019, while offshore North Carolina. Esther began to weaken while approaching New England and fell to Category\u00a02 intensity early on September\u00a021. The storm turned eastward on the following day and gradually weakened to a tropical storm. It then executed a large cyclonic loop, until curving northward on September\u00a025. Early on the following day, Esther made two landfalls in Massachusetts, first on Muskeget Island and then near South Yarmouth with winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h). The storm then emerged over the Gulf of Maine and made landfall in Brunswick, Maine, around 11:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a026 with winds of 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h). Esther weakened to a tropical depression late on September\u00a026 before weakening to a tropical depression and becoming extratropical over southeastern Quebec.[3] The remnants persisted for about 12\u00a0hours, before dissipating early on September\u00a027.[3] Between North Carolina and New Jersey effects were primarily limited to strong winds and minor beach erosion and coastal flooding due to storm surge.[36] In New York, strong winds led to severe crop losses and over 300,000\u00a0power outages. High tides caused coastal flooding and damage a number of pleasure boats. Similar impact was reported in Massachusetts. Additionally, some areas observed more than 8 inches (200\u00a0mm) of rainfall, flooding basements, low-lying roads, and underpasses.[24] Overall, damage was minor, totaling about $6\u00a0million.[14] There were also seven deaths reported when United States Navy P5M aircraft crashed about 120 miles (190\u00a0km) north of Bermuda.[37]"

The cyclone became extratropical over southern Maine around 12:00\u00a0UTC and quickly dissipated.[3] Impact from the storm was generally minor. In Savannah, Georgia, the storm produced an F2 tornado that blew the roof off of a lumber company building. In North Carolina, 3.12 inches (79\u00a0mm) of precipitation fell at Williamston.[38] Strong winds lashed Rhode Island, with winds as high as 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) in Point Judith. About 29,000\u00a0homes were left without electricity, while 1,200\u00a0lost telephone service. Hundreds of small crafts and a few ferries and barges were swamped or sank. Hurricane-force wind gusts in Massachusetts felled trees, electrical wires, and TV antennas. Some roads in the southeastern portion of the state were blocked by fallen trees. Similar impact was reported in Maine, where an F2 tornado/waterspout tracked 19.1 miles (30.7\u00a0km) from Beals through Roque Bluffs before dissipating in Dog Town just east of East Machias. Power lines were considerably damaged and numerous trees were knocked down, including two incidents where trees fell on and damaged homes.

However, due to swift evacuations of residents by the Civil Defense and American Red Cross, no fatalities were reported.[39] Tracking to the northwest, Frances made landfall near Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, early on October\u00a03 with winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h). No impact was reported on the island. Later on October\u00a03, Frances emerged into the Atlantic Ocean just southeast of the Turks and Caicos Islands. Thereafter, the storm accelerated somewhat and resumed intensification, reaching hurricane status on October\u00a04. Around that time, it curved northeastward and deepened further.

Approximately 12\u00a0hours later, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Hattie. Moving towards the north and north-northeast, the storm quickly gained hurricane status early on October\u00a028 and reached major hurricane intensity that same day. Hattie turned towards the west to the east of Jamaica and strengthened into a Category 5 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 165\u00a0mph (266\u00a0km/h) on October\u00a031. The storm then weakened to a Category 4 hurricane prior to landfall south of Belize City, British Honduras, with winds of 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h). Continuing southwest, the storm rapidly weakened over the mountainous terrain of Central America, dissipating on November\u00a01.[3] It was originally thought that the remnants may have contributed to the development of Tropical Storm Simone in the eastern Pacific Ocean, but a 2019 reanalysis concluded that the remnants of Hattie instead became a Central American gyre.[6] Hattie first affected regions in the southwestern Caribbean, producing hurricane-force winds and causing one death on San Andres Island.[14] It was initially forecast to continue north and strike Cuba, which prompted evacuations.[42] Little effects were reported as Hattie turned to the west, although rainfall reached 11.5\u00a0in (290\u00a0mm) on Grand Cayman.[41] The worst damage was in the country of Belize. The former capital, Belize City, was flooded by a powerful storm surge and high waves and affected by strong winds. The territory governor estimated 70% of the buildings in the city were damaged, which left over 10,000\u00a0people homeless.[43] The damage was severe enough that it prompted the government to relocate inland to a new city, Belmopan.[44] In the territory, Hattie left about $60\u00a0million in damage and caused 307\u00a0deaths.[14][45] The government estimated that Hattie was more damaging than a hurricane in 1931 that killed 2,000\u00a0people; the lower toll for Hattie was due to advance warning.

Six people died during this flood, and the hospital had to retain its dead until 17 November, because they couldn't bury them in Saint Roch Cemetery . Casualty figures stayed low because the river rose relatively gently in the actual city of Grenoble.[3] From an economic point of view, stocks of goods were destroyed. Stocks that had been set up by traders in order to prepare for big markets in November, like the market of Saint Andre, and military stocks, were washed away.[3] There was at that time a wall around Grenoble, dating from Roman times. Parts of these remains are still visible. The objective was to prevent flood water from entering into the city.

Eleven ruptures were noticed after the flood of 1859. These ruptures occurred at weak spots including boucle du bois Francais,[7] boucle de la Taillat (although the dam here is being reinforced), boucle de Gi\u00e8res,[7] courbe du campus. In 2001, the Is\u00e8re attained a volume of 1000\u00a0m\u00b3/s, which caused local flooding almost everywhere there were modern weak spots. Some dams in the Grenoble catchment area are very weak, in bad condition and not large enough to contain flooding.[citation needed] It was only in 2011 that the government took action, and decided to invest in 112 projects, called SYMBHI[4] that will take seven years and will help reinforce the dam system. These were financed on the basis that it is cheaper to prevent that to repair. This project is 42% financed by the General Council of Isere,[8] 30% by the government, the \u2018'intercomunalite \u2018\u2019 finances 20% and the \"Eau Rh\u00f4ne-M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e et Corse\" 8%. Projects will start in pont de Charat and will end in Grenoble centre. In case of a major crisis, the losses could be evaluated at 400 or 500 million euros if the a disaster similar to that of 1859 were to happen again. Modern technology can predict a flood in the Is\u00e8re 6 to 10 hours before it occurs.[9] An estimated 300,000 Grenoble citizens are directly exposed to floods.

The tenth tropical cyclone and eighth named storm of the season, Harvey developed from a tropical wave in the Gulf of Mexico on September\u00a019. After forming, the system gradually intensified and became a tropical storm early on September 20. Throughout the rest of its duration, Harvey slowly intensified as it headed eastward. Late on September\u00a021, Harvey made landfall in Southwest Florida with winds of 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h). Harvey emerged into the Atlantic early on September 22, but was absorbed by an extratropical cyclone. The remnants of Harvey reached Atlantic Canada before dissipating. Harvey caused minor flooding in south Florida because of light to relatively heavy rainfall in that portion of the state and at least 34\u00a0houses and businesses in southern Florida were flooded. There were sporadic reports of tropical storm-force winds throughout the state, as well as two tornadoes. Damage estimates in Florida reached about $15\u00a0million (1999\u00a0USD). Throughout the rest of the United States, impact was limited, confined to light rainfall in Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. Heavy rainfall was reported in Atlantic Canada and Harvey became the wettest tropical cyclone on record in that country. Significant flooding, especially to roads and houses, was reported due to the heavy rainfall and damage throughout Atlantic Canada totalled several million dollars."

Thunderstorm activity continued to increase in association with the weather system and a buoy in the eastern Gulf of Mexico recorded sustained winds of 35\u00a0mph (56\u00a0km/h). At 0600\u00a0UTC on September\u00a019, the system finally developed into Tropical Depression Ten, while located approximately 400 miles (640\u00a0km) west-southwest of St. Petersburg, Florida.[1] The National Hurricane Center initiated advisories on the depression approximately four hours later.[2] Upon its designation the depression was still relatively weak and disorganized and, due to a number of factors, further strengthening was expected to be gradual.[2] Outflow over the cyclone improved throughout the day on September\u00a019, however, as it drifted northward. At 0000\u00a0UTC on September\u00a020 the depression was upgraded to the eighth named storm of the season, Tropical Storm Harvey, based on surface observations and reports from the Hurricane Hunters.[1] Shortly thereafter the storm became nearly stationary[3] while slowly beginning to turn eastward.[1] Harvey remained disorganized due to persistent wind shear.[4] Despite the strong wind shear, the cyclone managed to reach its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 994 mbar (hPa; 29.35 inHg) late on September\u00a020.[1] By the early on September\u00a021 Harvey accelerated slightly and turned southeastward.[5] Although the center of the storm was poorly defined at the time and located to the northwest of the main area of thunderstorm activity, convection was strong in nature.[6] Later that day the storm curved towards the east while approaching Florida. At around 1700\u00a0UTC on September\u00a021 Harvey made landfall near Everglades City, Florida with sustained winds of 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h).

Tropical storm watches were posted for the state's Atlantic coast north of Jupiter Inlet to near Flagler Beach. A tropical storm watch, and later a warning, was issued for the northwestern Bahamas. The advisories were amended several times before being discontinued on September\u00a020 through September\u00a021.[1] In advance of the storm, public schools and many private schools closed, Although no mandatory evacuations were ordered, multiple shelters were opened in schools and churches and government offices shut down in anticipation of Harvey's onslaught. Several counties issued a state of emergency.[8] Residents prepared individually by, for example, securing boats and lawn furniture. Free sand and sandbags were made available to the general public and inmates filled bags for those physically unable to do so themselves. Officials at Lake Manatee began lowering the water level to help avoid flooding.[9] In Hillsborough County the threat of the storm forced the cancellation of local football programs.[10]"

Precipitation peaked at 10.24 inches (260\u00a0mm) in Naples.[11] The 4 to 7 inches (100 to 180\u00a0mm) of rain in southern Lee County caused minor flooding in homes and businesses in lowly-lying areas, mostly along U.S. Route 41 between Estero and Bonita Springs.[12] Storm surge was light, with tides ranging from 1 to 2 feet (0.30 to 0.61\u00a0m) above normal in Levy, Citrus, Hernando, Pasco, Pinellas, Hillsborough, Manatee, and Sarasota counties; the highest tide recorded was 2.41 feet (0.73\u00a0m) above normal in Fort Myers.[1] Some tidal flooding occurred at Everglades City, where a runway at the county airport was inundated.[1] Throughout Collier County, coastal flooding caused major street flooding and water entered 34\u00a0homes and buildings, as well as six cars.[13] No locations on the East Coast of Florida reported abnormally high tides, although a storm surge of 0.8 feet (0.24\u00a0m) and 1 foot (0.30\u00a0m) was reported in Key West and Vaca Key, respectively. Minor coastal flooding was reported elsewhere, including along the Florida Keys; part of State Road A1A was closed as a result.[12] The surge combined with increased wave action to produce light beach erosion along the coast and in Everglades National Park.[1] The storm also spawned two tornadoes, in Collier and Miami-Dade counties, one of which tore the roof off a house.[1] The highest sustained wind speed was 53\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h), which was recorded at the Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Station, while the strongest wind gust was 68\u00a0mph (109\u00a0km/h) off the coast of Key Largo. Strong winds in the Florida Keys downed a few trees, but minimal damage occurred otherwise.[12] Overall, damage in Florida totaled to approximately $15\u00a0million (1999 USD; $27.4\u00a0million 2024\u00a0USD).[1]"

As a result, the system is, as of 2018, ranked as the wettest known tropical cyclone (or remnants) in Canada.[24] Several other locations reported heavy, but lesser, amounts of precipitation, including 5.9 inches (150\u00a0mm) in Cumberland County and Annapolis Valley, 3.5 inches (89\u00a0mm) in Greenwood, and between 1.2 inches (30\u00a0mm) and 1.7 inches (43\u00a0mm) in South Shore and Halifax. Throughout the province there was widespread flooding, countless road closures, and numerous flooded basements. Most notably, a portion of Trans-Canada Highway and Highway 103 was inundated by water. Another major road was closed in Wolfville after Gaspereau River overflowed. A street in Amherst was closed due to sewer backups and, nearby, a culvert washed away, leaving a 49.2 feet (15.0\u00a0m) by 65.6 feet (20.0\u00a0m) hole in the road. Additionally, a bridge collapsed near Collingwood. In Oxford alone, damage to roads cost at least $3 million (1999\u00a0CAD) to repair.[7] Flooding damage was also reported to infrastructure other than roads. After two rivers overflowed, at least 70% of Oxford was flooded, which included a hardware store and dozens of homes, while a senior citizens living complex were evacuated. The SOS Children's Village in Margaretsville sustained approximately $25,000 (1999\u00a0CAD) in flood damage. Schools in Amherst and the University of Windsor canceled afternoon classes on September\u00a024. In the Canning area, 1,500\u00a0people were left without power, while electricity was also lost in Annapolis Valley, Yarmouth, Truro, Westville, Amherst, and Stellarton. A woman required rescue by firemen after her van plunged into the swollen River Philip. In Maccan, a tractor trailer loaded with lumber went off the road.

As a result, three roads were flooded in Saint John, three other streets were closed in Moncton, and one street each was inundated by water in Fox Creek and Riverview. In addition, the causeway connecting Moncton and Riverview was closed due to flood waters. In Dieppe a local state of emergency was declared because of the numerous washed out roads. Along Route 16 travelers rescued four senior citizens from their car, which soon sank into a ditch. Train service by Via Rail was temporarily suspended after the tracks were washed out near Memramcook.

At another location, Charlottetown, precipitation totals only reached 2.1 inches (53\u00a0mm). Although potato fields were inundated by water, minimal damage occurred to that crop. In Summerside at least five roads were closed due to flooding and water entered the mechanical room via the telephone and electrical conduit at the local intermediate school. Road infrastructure was also affected, such as in Howlan, where a bridge slightly longer than 180 feet (55\u00a0m) washed away. Restrictions were imposed on the use of the Confederation Bridge during the height of the storm. Adverse conditions also prevented the Northumberland Ferry from docking in Prince Edward Island, causing it to return to Nova Scotia.[7] As rainfall in Newfoundland peaked at only 1.6 inches (41\u00a0mm), damage in the province was mostly from strong winds. At Channel-Port aux Basques, a sustained wind speed of almost 66\u00a0mph (106\u00a0km/h) and gust to nearly 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) were reported. Strong winds left 4,500\u00a0people without electricity in St. John's and the Burin Peninsula, knocked down traffic lights in St. John's, and snapped and uprooted trees throughout the province.

Following interaction with a tropical wave, it began to develop and became a depression by December\u00a018. Increasingly rapid intensification ensued over the following days with the cyclone attaining hurricane-force winds around 5\u00b0N the next day. Early on December\u00a023, the storm struck Ceylon near Trincomalee with winds estimated at 240\u00a0km/h (150\u00a0mph), ranking it as a modern-day super cyclonic storm. Weakening somewhat, the storm soon struck Tamil Nadu.

        "content": "On December\u00a015, 1964, an area of low pressure was identified over the southern Andaman Sea. Remaining nearly stationary,[2] a tropical wave soon interacted with the low and allowed the system to consolidate into a depression two days later.[3] A large area of showers and thunderstorms covered much of the southern Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea. On December\u00a018, a ship with the callsign JMAG reported 45\u00a0km/h (30\u00a0mph) winds and a barometric pressure of 1005.5 mbar (hPa; 29.69\u00a0inHg). Based on this report, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) classified the system as a deep depression. Over the following days, the system quickly intensified as it began moving slowly westward. By December\u00a019, it became a severe cyclonic storm and soon acquired hurricane-force winds early on December\u00a020 while near 5\u00b0N.[2] The cyclone became one of only a handful of system to attain such an intensity close to the equator.[3] Moving more west-northwesterly, the cyclone continued to deepen as it approached southern India.[2] On December\u00a021, satellite imagery showed clouds from the storm covering an area roughly 965\u00a0km (600\u00a0mi) wide. Several prominent banding features were present, with one such feature, extending over 240\u00a0km (150\u00a0mi) crossing the equator while maintaining a cyclonic arc. Clouds associated with the cyclone extended as far as 485\u00a0km (301\u00a0mi) into the Southern Hemisphere.[3] Several vessels encountered the storm, with one reporting 110\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph) winds early on December\u00a022. That day winds along the coast of Ceylon increased; the storm accelerated during this time as well. Early on December\u00a023, the cyclone struck the northern tip of Ceylon and turned back toward the west-northwest. According to an officer on Pamban Island, located between Ceylon and Southern India, the storm's eye was no more than 16\u00a0km (9.9\u00a0mi) wide.[2] Based on satellite imagery, it was estimated that the storm had peak winds of 240\u00a0km/h (150\u00a0mph), with gusts as high as 280\u00a0km/h (175\u00a0mph).[3] This ranked the system as a modern-day super cyclonic storm.[4] Additionally, the IMD estimated its central pressure to have been, at most, 970 mbar (hPa; 28.64\u00a0inHg).[2] The lowest observed pressure was 978\u00a0mbar (978\u00a0hPa; 28.9\u00a0inHg) in Mannar on the west coast of Ceylon.[3] Weakening somewhat, the storm soon struck Tamil Nadu, south of Tondi. Once onshore, the cyclone rapidly weakened, becoming a depression before emerging over the Arabian Sea on December\u00a024. The system degenerated into a remnant low later that day and dissipated over open waters on December\u00a026.[2]"

According to survivors, a storm surge of 4.5\u00a0m (15\u00a0ft) swept across the area. Initial reports stated that 250\u00a0people lost their lives with thousands missing.[8] About 5000 houses and 700 fishing boats were destroyed in the Jaffna district of Ceylon.[9] The district's paddy crop was also destroyed.[9] Other badly hit areas include Mannar and Trincomallee.[9] The Trincomallee port suffered severe damage rendering it inoperable.[9] The economic damage caused in Ceylon was estimated at Rs. 200 million. About 350 Ceylonese fishermen were missing at sea.[9] At least 1,000\u00a0people were killed on the island and many more were left unaccounted for.[10] An unofficial estimate stated that the death toll would likely exceed 2,000.[8] The government regarded it as, \"the greatest tragedy to ever hit Ceylon.\"[10] The effects of the cyclone were felt mostly in Pamban Island, which lies between the Indian mainland and Ceylon.[9] More than 3000 people, many of them tourists and pilgrims, were stranded on the island. The total damage to property was estimated at $150 million.[9] On December\u00a023, an estimated 7.6\u00a0m (25\u00a0ft) storm surge struck the town of Dhanuskodi on the south-eastern edge of the island,[11] submerging the town and overturning the Pamban-Dhanuskodi passenger train killing all 200 passengers on board.[12] The town, an important transit point between India and Ceylon, was completely destroyed and has not been rebuilt since.[13] Prior to the cyclone, the town had been an important commercial centre with a railway station, a customs office, post and telegraphs office, two medical institutions, one railway hospital, a panchayat union dispensary, a higher elementary school and port offices.[14] A port had been functioning since 1 March 1914.[14] At least 800\u00a0people were killed in Dhanushkodi alone.[10] Four radio operators remained in Dhanuskodi and risked their lives to continue broadcasting during the storm. Two railway employees patrolling the Pamban Bridge survived by clinging to the bridge frame for 12\u00a0hours. The Indian Government later honored and rewarded them for their dedication.[15]"

By December\u00a026, relief supplies were delivered to 14\u00a0villages by the Ceylonese Air Force. Britain, Cuba, West Germany, and the United States offered aid to Ceylon.[8] Reconstruction of the Pamban Bridge was deemed a priority and initially expected to take six\u00a0months to complete. However, E. Sreedharan, an engineer tasked on the project, managed to have the railway bridge finished in 45\u00a0days. A stable road connection was built in the following years.[15] In Mandapam, the cyclone's surge created five tidal pools over a 2\u00a0km (1.2\u00a0mi) stretch of coastline. Three of the pools had higher than normal salinity coupled with below-average silicate content and were colonized by Peridinium. The other two featured opposite levels of salinity and silicate and were inhabited by Pyrocystis fusiformis. All five featured bioluminescence as a result. A study of these pools in 1965 showed a, \"clear succession of organisms\", with species of Penaeidae (Prawn), one species of amphipoda, one species of crab, and Acetes inhabiting the pools. Researchers also found a few Sepioteuthis and tintinnid. Lastly, 46\u00a0species of coastal fish were documented.[11] Offshore, catastrophic damage occurred to coral reefs, with Echinopora lamellosa, Montipora foliosa, and alcyonarians being killed in large numbers. At Manacadu Point, near Mandapam, an elevated coral colony of Faviids and Porites was completely wiped out. In the eight years following the storm, colonies showed substantial growth across the Palk Strait, with Acropora corymbosa covering 25\u201330% of the reefs. Colonies of alcyonarians showed little sign of rejuvenation, however. Along the immediate coastline, the large-scale stirring of sand made areas unsuitable for coral and were not expected to ever regrow.[16]"

        "content": "Hurricane Roxanne was a rare and erratic tropical cyclone that caused extensive flooding in Mexico due to its unusual movement. The seventeenth storm, tenth hurricane, and the fifth and final major hurricane of the very active 1995 Atlantic hurricane season, Roxanne developed in the southwestern Caribbean Sea from an area of low pressure on October 7. The depression curved northward, causing it to avoid landfall in Central America. By October 9, the depression intensified enough to be upgraded to Tropical Storm Roxanne. On the following day, Roxanne turned west-northward, where it promptly intensified into a hurricane. As Roxanne headed generally westward, it began to rapidly deepen and reached Category 3 intensity less than 24 hours after becoming a hurricane. Shortly thereafter, Roxanne made landfall near Cozumel, Mexico at its peak intensity, which caused severe damage. Roxanne rapidly weakened while traversing the Yucatan Peninsula, and when it emerged into the Bay of Campeche on October 12, the storm was a Category 1 hurricane. Further weakening occurred, and Roxanne was downgraded to a tropical storm later that day. Roxanne tracked northwestward and eventually re-intensified into a hurricane on October 14. Thereafter, Roxanne began to meander erratically in the Gulf of Mexico; the storm turned abruptly southeastward and remained nearly stationary offshore of the Yucatan Peninsula. The following day, Roxanne curved back northwestward and weakened back to a tropical storm on October 17. Roxanne completed a cyclonic loop across the Gulf of Mexico on October 18. Further weakening occurred, and Roxanne was downgraded to a tropical depression on October 19. A cold front in the Gulf of Mexico turned Roxanne abruptly southward, and the storm dissipated just offshore of Veracruz on October 21. Roxanne was the first October hurricane that formed and reached Category 3 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale (SSHS) in the western Caribbean Sea since Hurricane Hattie in October 1961.[1] Due to its slow and erratic movement, Roxanne dropped heavy rainfall in many areas of southern Mexico, and some areas reported over 25 inches (640\u00a0mm) of precipitation. Heavy rainfall, in turn, led to extensive flooding, which destroyed crop, washed out roads, and damaged at least 40,000 homes. In addition, significant coastal flooding also occurred, as storm surge for nearly a week caused water to travel inland for hundreds of yards. High winds also occurred over the Yucatan Peninsula, with one station reporting hurricane-force winds on October 11. Overall, it is estimated that Roxanne caused $1.5 billion (1995 USD) in damage, although not all damage could be distinguished from Hurricane Opal. In addition, 29 fatalities were reported."

        "content": "A tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa on September\u00a026. It moved westward, producing an area of convection, or thunderstorms, over the central Caribbean Sea by October\u00a04. By two days later, the system had a broad circulation located between the coast of Honduras and the Cayman Islands. An upper-level trough, left behind after Hurricane Opal exited the region, interacted with the tropical wave and the circulation, which gradually became better organized; the origins were complex, but common for disturbances over the western Caribbean. By October\u00a07, banding features developed within the convection. Late that day, the system organized enough for the National Hurricane Center (NHC) to designate it Tropical Depression Nineteen, located off the northeast tip of Nicaragua. A day later, the Hurricane Hunters confirmed the development of the circulation.[1] While in its formative stages, the depression moved northward, steered by a nearby upper-level low, amid weak steering currents caused by a subtropical ridge over the southwestern Atlantic Ocean.[2] Early on October\u00a09, the NHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Roxanne.[1] Roxanne was the first ever \u201cR\u201d named storm in the Atlantic basin. Roxanne was initially affected by winds from the north, which dislocated the circulation from the convection. As the nearby upper-level low moved into Central America, Roxanne was able to intensify, developing outflow all around the storm. Initially, the storm threatened western Cuba and the Cayman Islands, steered by a weak trough over Florida, which moved eastward and was replaced by a ridge in the area. This turned Roxanne westward toward the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. At the same time it was turning, Roxanne developed a well-defined eye in the center of its convection. At 06:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a010, the storm intensified to hurricane status. Roxanne intensified further, based on reports from the Hurricane Hunters. Early on October\u00a011, the NHC estimated peak winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h); this made Roxanne the first hurricane since Hurricane Hattie in 1961 to develop in the western Caribbean and intensify to a major hurricane. Shortly after Roxanne reached peak intensity, the hurricane made landfall just north of Tulum, a small town near Cozumel, Mexico.[1] Moving westward across the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, Roxanne weakened but maintained hurricane status as it emerged into the Bay of Campeche on October\u00a012.[1] Although the storm remained well-organized, it lost most of its deep convection and intensity. The storm drifted in the body of water, steered by a ridge to the north.[3][4] On October\u00a012, Roxanne weakened to tropical storm status.[1] The storm continued northwestward and turned more to the north, steered by a cold front. Roxanne redeveloped an eye feature, and it re-intensified into a hurricane on October\u00a014.[5][6] The hurricane turned to the southeast, after the cold front bypassed the system and the ridge rebuilt.[7] Over the next day, Roxanne stalled off the northwest coast of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. Drier air, wind shear, and upwelling caused the hurricane to weaken back to a tropical storm. By late on October\u00a017, the circulation had little convection associated with it.[8][9] The storm moved northwestward for a few days, until an approaching cold front steered Roxanne to the south on October\u00a019; by that time, Roxanne had weakened to tropical depression status. On October\u00a021, the circulation of Roxanne was dissipating as it moved onshore Veracruz.[1]"

        "content": "Early in Roxanne's existence, its northward movement presented a threat to the western Caribbean. As a result, the government of the Cayman Islands declared a tropical storm warning for all of the islands on October\u00a09; On the same day, the government of Cuba issued a hurricane watch and tropical storm warning for Pinar del R\u00edo and the Isle of Youth. The advisories were canceled after the storm turned away from the area.[1] Parts of Mexico were under tropical cyclone warnings and watches for ten days. On October\u00a09, the government of Mexico raised hurricane watches for coastal areas between Chetumal, Quintana Roo and Cabo Catoche. Early on October\u00a010, a hurricane warning was declared for areas west of Cabo Catoche to Progreso, Yucat\u00e1n. By the afternoon, the hurricane watch was extended past Progreso to Ciudad del Carmen, which was upgraded to a hurricane warning the next day. A new tropical storm warning was issued by the government of Belize that evening for areas north of Belize City; however, this warning was discontinued early on October\u00a011 as the center of Roxanne was not expected to pass near the area. With Roxanne maintaining its intensity over the Yucat\u00e1n, the Mexican government issued a hurricane warning from Coatzacoalcos to Tuxpan, as the storm was initially projected to go more westward. When Roxanne was looping off the northwest Yucat\u00e1n peninsula, a hurricane warning was issued from Progreso to Tampico. The last warnings were downgraded on October\u00a019, when Roxanne weakened to a tropical depression.[1] In the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, thousands of residents and tourists were urged to evacuate from coastal areas. In the city of Canc\u00fan, roughly 12,000 tourists and 3,900 residents relocated to safer areas; however, some refused to leave and decided to wait out the storm in hotels. On Cozumel, most hotel guests decided to ride out the storm instead of evacuate. There, most homeowners and businesses stored all loose items indoors and boarded up windows.[10] An emergency alert was issued to hundreds of fishermen off the Yucat\u00e1n coastline to move to port immediately.[11] In the state of Campeche, 150 shelters were opened and able to accommodate roughly 15,000 people.[12] However, more than 20,000 people sought refuge from the storm throughout the state.[13]"

        "content": "Roxanne affected the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula less than two weeks after Hurricane Opal formed in the area.[1][14] The combined damage between the two hurricanes was estimated at US$1.5\u00a0billion.[1] At least two locations in Mexico reported sustained hurricane-force winds from Roxanne \u2013 M\u00e9rida, Yucat\u00e1n and Para\u00edso, Tabasco. At the former location, an automatic weather station recorded a wind gust of 202\u00a0km/h (126\u00a0mph) on October\u00a011. Roxanne dropped heavy rainfall along its path.[1] Near Champot\u00f3n, Campeche, a pluviometer recorded 676\u00a0mm (26.61\u00a0in) of precipitation, the highest total in the country related to Roxanne. Locations in Veracruz and Tabasco also recorded over 510\u00a0mm (20\u00a0in) of rainfall.[15] While Roxanne was moving ashore eastern Mexico, it produced an estimated storm surge of 3.0\u00a0m (10\u00a0ft). Waves washed into hotel lobbies in Canc\u00fan and Cozumel. In the Gulf of Mexico, 15 to 20\u00a0ft (4.6 to 6.1\u00a0m) waves struck the Mexican coast while Roxanne drifted offshore for a few days, pushing water hundreds of yards inland.[1] Waves eroded the eastern portion of Ciudad del Carmen, while the western portion of the island gained sand.[16] Roxanne caused 29 deaths, with six of them coming from the sinking of the pipelay derrick barge DLB 269 with 245 people on board.[17] Roxanne caused widespread flooding and agriculture damage in eastern Mexico, notably in Campeche, Tabasco, Veracruz.[18] Along the coast, high waves wrecked docks, fishing stalls, and nets while damaging dozens of boats.[18] Across eastern Mexico, Roxanne damaged more than 40,000\u00a0homes.[1] Crops were destroyed, cattle drowned, and roads were either washed out or blocked by mudslides.[1] The road between the City of Carmen and Campeche was completely destroyed.[1] Rainfall and storm surge combined with overflowing rivers caused the worst flooding in Campeche since 1927.[1] Floodwaters damaged the aqueduct for Ciudad del Carmen.[18] Throughout the state of Tabasco, nearly half of the highways sustained significant damage. Governor Roberto Madrazo Pintado estimated that it would cost roughly $60\u00a0million to repair them.[19] Roxanne caused the state owned Pemex to shut down 90% of its drilling in the Gulf of Mexico during its pass as well as halt all shipments from three oil terminals in the southeastern region of the gulf.[20]  As a result, Mexico lost millions of dollars.[20]  Oil production dropped from 2.838 million barrels a day in September to 1.976 million barrels a day in October or 30.4%.[21]  (A rough guess using a price of the Maya Crude averaging about $13.77/b,[22] 30 days in September, and 862,000 barrels a day of lost output yields $356 million, which in 2011 dollars equals about $530 million.)  Oil production didn't completely recover in November, so there were some additional losses, but did completely return in December. The Mexican government allocated 16\u00a0million pesos to people affected by Roxanne, as well as 55 million pesos to fishermen.[18]"

The storm steadily organized as it moved generally southeast, becoming a tropical cyclone on February\u00a08. Turning to the south, intensification began in earnest and the system acquired hurricane-force winds within 48\u00a0hours of being named. The 445\u00a0km (275\u00a0mi) wide system displayed annular characteristics and a 19\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi) wide eye. Pat reached its peak strength early on February\u00a010 as a severe tropical cyclone with winds of 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph) and a barometric pressure of 960 mbar (hPa; 28.35\u00a0inHg).[nb 3] Hours later it struck Aitutaki, producing gusts in excess of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph) on the island. Hostile wind shear then prompted rapid weakening of the cyclone. The system degraded below gale-intensity on February\u00a011, just 24\u00a0hours after it peaked, and was last noted early on February\u00a012. Battering Aitutaki with wind gusts in excess of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph), Cyclone Pat devastated the island. Approximately 78\u00a0percent of homes were damaged, with 72\u00a0structures destroyed. The electrical grid was left completely offline and supply of water was largely lost. Agriculture also experienced tremendous impact, with most crops completely lost. Damage on Aitutaki amounted to US$13.7\u00a0million;[nb 4] however, casualties were minimal with only eight minor injuries reported. Recovery efforts began immediately after the storm, with the Red Cross and the Government of New Zealand aiding the local government. A reconstruction plan was enacted by the Cook Islands within a month and subsequently funded by New Zealand. Owing to its destructive effects, the name Pat was later retired and replaced with Pili.[4]"

        "content": "Between January and March 2010, the Australian monsoon trough extended unusually far east over the southern Pacific Ocean. With above-average sea surface temperatures, stemming from a moderate-strength El Ni\u00f1o, multiple low-pressure systems were able to develop across the region. An unusual spree of tropical cyclogenesis in rapid succession ensued, including four hurricane-strength storms: Oli, Pat, Rene, and Tomas.[5] On February\u00a06, the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) began monitoring a tropical depression, dubbed 09F, well to the northeast of the Samoan Islands.[6][nb 5] Embedded within a well-developed trough, the system displayed curved convective banding features. Environmental conditions in the area, including low wind shear, high ocean heat content, and upper-level outflow, favored cyclogenesis. Additionally, an active Madden\u2013Julian oscillation phase moving into the region was expected to bolster development.[8] Steady improvement of the system's convective structure ensued and early on February\u00a07, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert.[9][nb 6] The low trekked generally east-southeast in response to a near-equatorial ridge anchored to the north. The storm's appearance continued to improve and Dvorak classifications rose to T2.5, indicating gale-force winds were likely present. Accordingly, the JTWC began issuing advisories on the system at 18:00\u00a0UTC and dubbed it Tropical Cyclone 14P. Forecasters noted, however, that the small size of the cyclone could lead to erroneously low Dvorak estimates.[11] The FMS followed suit six hours later and assigned the name Pat to the cyclone, assessing it as a Category\u00a01 on the Australian cyclone scale.[12] Convection became increasingly symmetric on February\u00a08, and a small eye feature appeared on microwave satellite imagery.[13] Spanning no more than 445\u00a0km (275\u00a0mi), the developing storm began a gradual turn to the south as steering currents shifted from the equatorial ridge to a subtropical ridge. Based on increasing Dvorak numbers,[14] the JTWC assessed Pat to have reached hurricane-intensity by 06:00\u00a0UTC on February\u00a09.[15] The eye feature became more pronounced throughout the day, with convection consolidating inward and becoming more symmetric.[16] Accordingly, the FMS accordingly upgraded Pat to a Category\u00a03 severe tropical cyclone by 18:00\u00a0UTC.[12] The system became annular in nature on February\u00a010, characterized by a lack of prominent banding features and uniform convection which surrounded its 19\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi) wide eye.[17] Pat reached its peak intensity at 06:00\u00a0UTC that day as it began turning to the southwest. Maximum winds were estimated at 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph) alongside a barometric pressure of 960 mbar (hPa; 28.35\u00a0inHg).[12] At the same time, the JTWC assessed Pat to have been a Category\u00a02-equivalent on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale with one-minute sustained winds of 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph).[15] Weakening began shortly thereafter as wind shear over the system increased.[18] Pat passed directly over the island of Aitutaki between 12:00 and 18:00\u00a0UTC.[12][15] The low-level center of Pat began decoupling from convection late on February\u00a010 once it cleared Aitutaki.[12][18] The storm rapidly weakened amid strong shear, with the center being left completely exposed early on February\u00a011. A solitary band remained along the south side of the storm by that time,[19] and the FMS no longer considered it a tropical cyclone after 06:00\u00a0UTC.[12] The lone band of convection dissipated later that day and with no residual thunderstorm activity, the skeletal low turned westward in response to westerly flow.[20] The JTWC maintained Pat as a tropical storm until 18:00\u00a0UTC and as a tropical depression until its dissipation early on February\u00a012.[15]"

        "content": "Starting on February\u00a07, tropical cyclone alerts and later gale warnings were issued for the Northern Cook Islands under the anticipation of gale-force winds impacting populated islands. The first of these islands were Manihiki, Rakahanga, and Suwarrow.[21][22] As the storm moved southward, the advisories shifted accordingly. Strong wind warnings were raised for Pukapuka, Nassau, and Penrhyn on February\u00a08; however, they were dropped later that day as Cyclone Pat moved away.[23][24] Alerts on potential gales in the southern Cook Islands also began on February\u00a08, including the islands of Atiu, Aitutaki, Manuae, Mitiaro, and Takutea.[25] Gale warnings for Aitutaki, Palmerston, and Rarotonga began on February\u00a09 and extended to Mauke the next day.[26][27][28] Early on February\u00a010, a hurricane warning was issued for Aitutaki.[29] With the core of Pat's destructive winds forecast to pass close to or over the island, sustained winds of 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph) and gusts of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph) were anticipated.[30] The aforementioned warnings were allowed to expire once Pat cleared the Cook Islands on February\u00a011 and was no longer a threat.[31] Emergency centers were prepped across the northern Cook Islands on February\u00a08.[32] The Cook Islands Chapter of the Red Cross took early action with Cyclone Pat and began stockpiling relief supplies on February\u00a09. Volunteers from the organization assisted elderly residents with preparation and evacuation on Aitutaki.[3] Anticipating high winds, residents tied down homes with rope and wire and boarded up windows with shutters.[33] Similar preparations took place on Rarotonga, though the main concern there was storm surge.[34] Government offices and schools there were closed on February\u00a011.[35][36] Most residents and all tourists along the coast in Aitutaki evacuated inland to designated shelters.[37] Authorities later announced that they were under-prepared for Cyclone Pat.

Of the 277\u00a0affected homes, 59\u00a0sustained minor damage, 51\u00a0moderate, 95\u00a0major, and 72\u00a0were destroyed.[39] Severity of damage correlated with the age of each home, with buildings over 25\u00a0years old suffering the greatest impact.[43] Collateral damage took place when debris from damaged or destroyed structures became airborne and struck other buildings.[41] Hardest hit were the villages of Nikaupara and Tautu.[44] Costs to homes amounted to NZ$15\u00a0million (US$10.6\u00a0million).[39] One building at the Seventh Day Adventist church primary school collapsed while another sustained severe damage. Although damage occurred at Vaitau School, it was utilized as an evacuation shelter.[45] The primary school and college in Araura also suffered damage. The island's electrically run water supply was substantially effected. A total of 568\u00a0homes lost access to clean water, with many waters tanks damaged or destroyed.[46] Aitutaki's only hospital fared well through the storm, with some roof damage and flooded rooms.[47] Infrastructural losses totaled to NZ$2.3\u00a0million (US$1.6\u00a0million), mainly stemming from the power grid. The agricultural sector sustained extensive damage, amounting to US$1.5\u00a0million, with some crops experiencing a total loss. The severity of damage raised concerns about food security in the months after the storm.[39] Particularly hard-hit was the mango crop, which was to be harvested two weeks after Pat struck.[48] Approximately 60\u201375\u00a0percent of the coconut trees and 75\u00a0percent of java plum, mango, and kapok trees sustained damage. Most trees had at least one branch torn off and in most cases, multiple branches. Additionally, the blue lorikeet (Vini peruviana), a bird native to French Polynesia and the Cook Islands, population suffered dramatic losses due to the storm, with the population on Aitutaki dropping by more than 50\u00a0percent.[49] All told, losses from Pat amounted to US$13.7\u00a0million.[39] However, Dr. Russell Howorth from the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) stated that damage reached US$8.2\u00a0million. In comparison, the collective damage from cyclones in the Cook Islands since 1955 was US$47\u00a0million according to the SPC.[50] In contrast to the severity of damage, no fatalities and only eight minor injuries took place.[51] Fearing similar damage to Aitutaki, a pre-emptive state of emergency was issued for Rarotonga. This was soon lifted as Pat ultimately spared Rarotonga and little damage took place there.[52][53] Gale-force winds and heavy rains impacted Rarotonga and Palmerston islands.[3] Large swells affected the uninhabited Penrhyn atoll, interfering with a study of marine turtles.[54]"

        "content": "Immediately following Pat's passage, the Government of the Cook Islands declared Aitutaki a disaster zone.[3] In accordance with the FRANZ agreement,[55] the Government of New Zealand made an initial donation of NZ$350,000 for recovery efforts prior to the formal request for assistance on February\u00a013. Following said request, New Zealand prepped a C-130 Hercules aircraft with emergency supplies and New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) personnel which arrived in Aitutaki on February\u00a015. The aircraft made four trips in all which provided several tonnes of aid to the island. The NZDF priority was repair of schools and hospitals, though they assisted the Red Cross with clearing debris, restoring power, and setting up temporary shelters for affected residents.[39] The lack of access to clean water prompted significant concern, and a water and sanitation expert from the Australian Red Cross flew in on February\u00a012 to assist with restoration efforts.[46] Immediate provisions of 600\u00a0water bottles were sent to the island on February\u00a016.[56] The Red Cross subsequently began pumping and filtering water, using a truck to distribute it to the island's villages.[57] Through September\u00a024, they provided over 100,000\u00a0litres of clean water. Distribution of 2,050\u00a0collapsible containers and 200\u00a0hygiene kits lessened dependency on the Red Cross's water pump.[56] An extensive repair and recovery plan was enacted by the Government of the Cook Islands within a month of Cyclone Pat, which covered agricultural, infrastructural, and societal sectors. Financial restraints hindered the expected progress of this operation, with more than two-thirds of it not being funded by the final plan report on March\u00a04. Of the NZ$15\u00a0million (US$10.6\u00a0million) in home damage, NZ$7.2\u00a0million (US$5.1\u00a0million) was covered.[39] New Zealand later provided a NZ$5.5\u00a0million (US$3.9\u00a0million) grant to assist in this effort.[58] Priority was placed on repairing damaged homes, with lesser emphasis on destroyed ones. Labor costs would ultimately reach NZ$6\u00a0million (US$4.2\u00a0million) for this project.[39] Finalization of the funding for reconstruction was delayed and had not started by early June, with some residents still living in tents.[59] Farmers were provided with NZ$195,000 (US$138,000) worth of seeds, seedlings, and various supplies to jump-start agricultural recovery. Since the majority of the island's electrical grid was destroyed, an earlier plan to convert the network to underground cables was accelerated due to a convenience factor.[39] By February\u00a017, 80\u00a0percent of the grid was restored; however, only 10\u00a0percent homes were actually connected.[44] The presence of dead vegetation left behind by the storm created fire hazards across the island, prompting the government to issue a ban on burning.[60] The Seventh Day Adventist church primary school resumed classes on February\u00a015 despite losing a building.[45] All other schools suspended activities until February\u00a022; however, the approach of Tropical Depression 11F delayed this until the following day.[57] On February\u00a023, the European Union provided US$110,000 in emergency funds to the Cook Islands.[61] Habitat for Humanity later sought to assist in the rebuilding process in April, with a funding goal of NZ$300,000 (US$210,000).[62] Depression set in among members throughout the storm-battered community once the rebuilding process began.[63] Fears of possible emigration stemming soon arose.[64] Mayor Tai Herman feared that survivors would consider selling their homes and leave the Cook Islands altogether. Even Prime Minister Jim Marurai was reported to be left in shock by the scale of damage.[63] The government enacted a three-month psychological support plan accordingly to help residents cope with the disaster and maintain social integrity among victims.[39] Through September, 265\u00a0people took advantage of this program.[56]"

        "content": "The 1945 Outer Banks hurricane was a moderate hurricane that struck Florida and affected the East Coast of the United States in late June, 1945. The first tropical storm and the first hurricane of the Atlantic season, it developed on June 20 in the western Caribbean Sea off Honduras. For the next two days, it moved generally northward into the Gulf of Mexico. Reaching hurricane intensity on June 23, it then turned northeast toward the Florida peninsula. It made landfall in the Big Bend on June 24, then weakened to a tropical storm over land. Minor damage was reported in Florida, but the storm produced heavy, though beneficial, rains that eased one of the state's worst recorded droughts. Upon entering the Atlantic Ocean, it re-intensified into a hurricane and paralleled the East Coast. On June 26, it struck the Outer Banks of North Carolina as a minimal hurricane, producing minor damage but heavy rainfall. Continuing northeast, the cyclone delivered gale-force winds to New York and southern New England, causing traffic accidents and minor wind damage. Heavy rains drenched the area, and high waves offshore caused ships to need rescue. One man died in a traffic accident; some people were rescued on Long Island Sound. Peak winds on land were 66 miles per hour (106\u00a0km/h) at Nantucket, forcing ships to remain in port. The U.S. Coast Guard sought to escort ships at sea into safe harbor. Overall, the impact of the storm was minor, though temperatures fell almost 20\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22127\u00a0\u00b0C) the day after the storm."

        "content": "On June 19, a tropical disturbance was detected between Swan Island and the Honduran coast. However, surface data in the vicinity did not indicate a closed circulation until 12 UTC on June 20.[1] At 14 UTC that day, an Air Force reconnaissance plane located near 24\u00b0N 84\u00b0W reported gale-force winds of 35 knots (18\u00a0m/s) (40 miles per hour (64\u00a0km/h)).[1] At the time, this was taken to indicate that a tropical storm had formed about 100 miles (160\u00a0km) northwest of Swan Island.[2] Reanalysis by the Hurricane Research Division in 2013, however, determined that a tropical storm formed farther northwest, near 19\u00b0N 86\u00b0W.[3] Squally weather, and winds of moderate tropical storm force, was reported in connection with the tropical storm as it moved generally northward, toward the Yucat\u00e1n Channel.[2] Little strengthening occurred over the next two days, until after 12 UTC on June 22.[3] At that time, a period of rapid deepening commenced: within 24 hours, the cyclone increased its winds from 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) to 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h). At the same time, its track made a sharp bend toward the northeast, threatening the Florida peninsula. While no central pressure was recorded, Hurricane Hunter aircraft flew into the storm on June 23 and reported winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h) at 2015 UTC.[1] As with most early reconnaissance data, such readings are suspect; however, based upon the reconnaissance measurement, the storm was originally listed in the Atlantic hurricane database as a Category 3 hurricane. Later, reanalysis lowered this estimate to 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h), equal to Category 2 on the modern Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, due primarily to the absence of corroboration.[1] After peaking late on June 23, the storm quickly lost intensity.[2] The hurricane continued northeast and made landfall at 08 UTC on June 24, north of the Tampa Bay Area.[4] Although observations were sparse near the eye, the system was estimated to have had winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h), though only minor impacts were reported as few people lived in the landfall area.[1] After making landfall, the center tracked inland between Brooksville and Dunnellon, near the Hernando\u2013Citrus county line.[5] About an hour before 18 UTC, the cyclone returned to water off the Atlantic coast of Florida, passing between St. Augustine and Daytona Beach. Due to interaction with land, maximum sustained winds by then had decreased to 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h).[3] After moving offshore, however, the cyclone quickly regained force. Within seven hours, it re-intensified into a minimal hurricane and paralleled the Southeastern United States, following the warm Gulf Stream. Early on June 26, the northeast-moving hurricane approached the North Carolina coast, and made a second landfall at 01 UTC near Beaufort, North Carolina. Passing very near to Cape Hatteras,[2] the eye of the storm moved offshore at Oregon Inlet, near Wanchese. The storm maintained hurricane intensity as it moved over and northeast of the Outer Banks.[5] At 06 UTC on June 27, the cyclone finally lost tropical characteristics, but still retained winds of hurricane force for another 12 hours.[3] Continuing to the northeast, the extratropical low passed south of Nova Scotia and hit Miquelon, Miquelon-Langlade, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, with winds of 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h). The system survived another four days, only to lose its identity near Iceland at 12 UTC on July 4."

        "content": "As early as June 19, the U.S. Weather Bureau began sending reconnaissance missions to monitor the developing storm in the Caribbean. The regular reports sent by the airplanes provided valuable data about the intensity of the small cyclone.[6]  At 16 UTC (10:00\u00a0a.m. local time) on June 23, the U.S. Weather Bureau in New Orleans advised residents from Mobile, Alabama, to Cedar Key, Florida, to prepare for gale-force winds. Areas from Tampa to Grand Isle, Louisiana, were placed under a storm warning. The center of the storm was expected to strike land early on June 24 between Mobile and Panama City, Florida.[7]  As the storm intensified into a hurricane, forecasters shifted their predicted landfall point eastward; early on June 24 the Weather Bureau expected the storm to strike between Tampa and Cross City, Florida. Hurricane warnings were issued for the coastline between Tampa and Carrabelle, Florida; meanwhile, storm warnings were issued from Punta Gorda to Titusville. The city of Tallahassee prepared to receive evacuees, and evacuations were ordered for coastal communities in the Big Bend. The Florida Highway Patrol warned local residents to leave the area, and soldiers were transported out of Carrabelle.[8] As the hurricane moved closer to the Big Bend, storm warnings were extended up the Eastern Seaboard to Savannah, Georgia. Between 300 and 400 military aircraft were flown out of Florida to Birmingham, Alabama.[6] Once the storm left Florida, additional evacuations commenced between Georgetown, South Carolina, and Cape Hatteras,[9] including the North Carolina communities of Wilmington, Morehead City, and nearby resort towns.[10] Large-scale evacuations from the Wilmington area alone involved 5,000 people and were credited with reducing loss of life.[5] Meanwhile, storm warnings were extended northward to Norfolk, Virginia;[9] however, only minor impacts occurred in Carolinas[10] and Virginia.[11]  Nevertheless, the cyclone continued to parallel the East Coast, so storm warnings were eventually extended to Atlantic City, New Jersey; small watercraft in the Northeastern United States were advised to stay in port.[10] Winds in the Tampa Bay Area reached tropical storm force, 39\u201346\u00a0mph (63\u201374\u00a0km/h), at 05 UTC on June 24. At that time, the \"center\" of the storm was estimated to be 25\u00a0mi (40\u00a0km) across.[6] Near the point of landfall, the hurricane defoliated citrus trees and downed power lines, and flash floods washed out roadways.[12] Throughout its path, the hurricane generated prolific rains. Peak rainfall along the path totaled 13.6\u00a0in (350\u00a0mm) at Lake Alfred;[13] West Palm Beach recorded 11.4 inches (290\u00a0mm) of rain within a 24-hour period.[14] Rainfall in Orange County exceeded 6\u00a0in (152\u00a0mm), which proved beneficial to dry orange groves;[12] the heavy rains ended one of the worst droughts in Florida's history.[2]  Overall, damage in the Miami area was described as being slight, totaling $75,000 (1945 USD).[5] The hurricane also produced two tornadoes in Florida, one near LaBelle and another near Melbourne.[5] Along the Georgia coast, the hurricane produced only fringe impacts, including strong winds and heavy rain. Wind gusts to 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) were reported from Tybee Island,[9] and portions of coastal North Carolina received up to 8.24\u00a0in (209\u00a0mm) of rain.[15] In New York and New England, the outer bands of the hurricane produced gale-force winds and high surf;  peak winds were reported at up to 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) on Long Island Sound, and large waves caused some boats to capsize and people to need rescue.[16] Offshore, even higher velocities were reported: a weather station on Nantucket, Massachusetts, measured a peak wind of 66\u00a0mph (106\u00a0km/h), and in the Atlantic Ocean winds reaching 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) battered Coast Guard vessels. The Coast Guard nevertheless sought to escort troubled ships into port. Heavy rainfall fell across coastal New England, peaking at 4.59\u00a0in (120\u00a0mm) on Nantucket. The heavy rains and gale-force winds hindered normal traffic; a vehicle struck and killed a man at Warwick, Rhode Island. At least 10,000 telephone lines were taken out of service, 7,000 of them in the Cape Cod region. Besides causing power outages, the stormy conditions damaged trees, buildings, and crops; in the Boston area, high winds knocked down trees and chimneys.[16] A strong temperature gradient existed between the cyclone and the Northeast U.S.: in New York City, the daily high on June 26 was almost 20\u00b0 F lower than on the preceding day.[17]"

This happened in the year 1099 ME in the Malayalam Calendar (Kollam Era). As the Malayalam Calendar was popular in Kerala, the flood is generally referred to as \"The Great flood of \"99\".The rain continued for about three weeks. Many districts of present-day Kerala were deeply submerged by the flood - from Thrissur, to Ernakulam to Idukki, Kottayam even up to Alappuzha and Kuttanad. A huge mountain called Karinthiri Mala was washed away by this flood and the road to Munnar also went along with it. As the road to Munnar was lost by this flood, a new road from Ernakulam to Munnar became necessary - the present day road from Ernakulam to Munnar was constructed after this. Kundala Valley Railway which was the first monorail system in India was also completely destroyed. Various remnants of the old Railway systems still exist at Munnar."

Kerala received 3,368\u00a0mm of rain during the monsoon season (June to September), 64 percent higher than normal and is the highest recorded rainfall.[1] The flood was probably caused by offshore vortices along the west coast and perturbations higher up in the troposphere and is not attributed to any depression or cyclonic disturbance in the Arabian sea or the bay of Bengal.[2] The rivers in the state were in spate and a sudden opening of the Periyar sluices caused even greater misery. The restriction in flow due to swelling of the Periyar river, blockages formed by debris, changes in the river flow and other related reasons caused flooding even in places like Munnar which is 1500m above sea level.[3] A letter from P. John John, owner of tea estates, to the land revenue commissioner stated: \"During the last floods my tea estates, Karimkulam and Karimtharuvi, sustained heavy losses and I herewith enclose a statement showing the losses. This was mainly due to the indiscriminate working of the sluice valves of the Mullaperiyar Dam without giving any previous warning. The rainfall all over the country and especially in the Peermade District was unprecedented and the river was already in flood due to these rains and the partial opening of the sluice valves. Then it is said that the authorities found the water level in the lake had risen much over the maximum limit and they opened the sluices to the full height thereby flushing the river.[4]"

Most of the areas in the erstwhile Travancore and Cochin states, parts of Malabar region were submerged under the floodwater.[5] In Munnar around 4850\u00a0mm of rain fall was reported during the flood and wide spread destruction happened. The old Aluva-Munnar route through Kothamangalam-Kuttampuzha-Mankulam was made unusable due to landslides (although the road was reconstructed till Pooyamkutty), and was completely abandoned, making the tribal village of Edamalakkudy very remote by allowing thick forests to grow in the area. Kundala Valley Railway the narrow gauge railway line at Munnar was completely destroyed by the landslides and flood waters.[6] Official Travancore records says that Aluva- Perumbavoor Road was submerged up to 10 feet of water for the entire stretch. \"By early August, thousands of refugees and displaced families were being fed at different relief centres: 4000 at Ambalapuzha, 3000 at Alleppey, 5000 in Kottayam, 3000 in Changanassery, 8000 in Parur and so on,\" writes Devan T. Raghavaiah, a civil servant deputed by the Madras presidency.[7] This flood is still a fearful memory with the old generation still alive in Kerala - most of them were kids then. \"The significance of the flood was such that many old people in Travancore used to anchor their memories in relation to the flood,\" writes historian Meenu Jacob.[8] Several church buildings were destroyed, which meant that the present-day church records in these churches start from 1924.[9]"

During the flood in the year 1924 AD (23 July 1924), the route was damaged due to landslides at Karinthiri near Munnar. Since then, the road was not used and an alternate route from Kothamangalam was conceived and constructed. The new route was constructed through the alignment recommended by the then British surveyor, Mr. Valetine through Neriamangalam, Mannamkandam, Pallivasal to Munnar. This was the route through which the elephants trespass. This road was completed in 1931 and inaugurated by Regent Queen Sethulakshmibai on 31 March the same year. The inauguration ceremony was organized at Ranikkallu near Neriamangalam. The general manager of Kannan Devan Tea Estate, Mr. Wallace invited the queen to declare the road open\" Kunjithomman, Elenjical, Kothamangalam made a long speech in this occasion.\"[12] Mr. K. Thanu Pillai, Executive Engineer, says in his report of 19 July 1924: \"The night of the 16th was an awful one for the town of Alwaye, especially its low lying suburbs. Cries of help were heard from all sides, The limited number of boats, public and private, could hardly cope with the rescue of lives, not to speak of property.. The current set up by the river overflowing its banks was so powerful that many boats engaged in rescue work are reported to have capsized. The roll of casualty is also said to be considerable but the exact number of casualties and the magnitude of the destruction and challenge caused by this unprecedented flood could not be known until the flood subsides. The flood reached its zenith on the afternoon of the 17th, it having risen nearly 6 ft. above the recorded M. F. L. it the local Railway bridge.

The first warning was given, apparently by the Assistant Manager of the mine (Mr. W. A. Beamtish) as the waters came in sight, traveling at terrible speed, and so far as is known, Mr. Beamish, who is numbered among the seven men who were reported last night to be missing, was able to warn only those people who were in the mines office before it was overwhelmed, and he himself was carried away.[citation needed] The floods and their impact were widely reported.[7][8][9][10]"

The fourteenth named storm and sixth hurricane of the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season, Nicholas originated from a tropical wave that emerged off the west coast of Africa on August\u00a028. The system developed into a tropical storm on September\u00a012, with the National Hurricane Center (NHC) naming the cyclone Nicholas. Nicholas gradually intensified initially, due to adverse effects of strong wind shear. However, late on September 13, Nicholas began intensifying at a faster rate, and at 03:00\u00a0UTC on September 14, Nicholas intensified into a Category 1 hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 988\u00a0mbar (29.2\u00a0inHg). At 5:30\u00a0UTC on the same day, Nicholas made landfall in Texas at peak intensity. Afterward, the system gradually weakened, weakening into a tropical storm several hours later, and weakening further into a tropical depression on the next day. The system proceeded to drift slowly over Louisiana. On September 15, Nicholas degenerated into a remnant low, before being absorbed into another extratropical system on September 20. The storm brought heavy rainfall and storm surge to parts of Texas and Louisiana. Some of the affected areas were still recovering from the effects of Hurricane Ida, which impacted the Gulf Coast of the United States a few weeks prior. Hurricane Nicholas caused four deaths and $1.1 billion in damage.[1]"

        "content": "On August\u00a028, a tropical wave moved off the west coast of Africa.[1] It moved steadily westward over the next week, producing only disorganized convection before moving into and through the Caribbean Sea. At 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a09, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began to monitor the northern portion the tropical wave over the western Caribbean Sea for potential development as it moved across northern Central America and the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula toward the Bay of Campeche.[2] By the next day, the wave began to interact with a surface trough over the southern Gulf of Mexico, producing widespread but disorganized showers and thunderstorms across the region.[3] Showers and thunderstorms associated with this system increased and become better organized on September\u00a012, and its top sustained winds reached 40\u00a0mph (65\u00a0km/h) (tropical storm-force), as confirmed by an Air Force hurricane-hunter flight that morning.[4] As a result, advisories were initiated at 15:00\u00a0UTC on Tropical Storm Nicholas.[5] After forming, the storm was found to be not very organized, as it lacked convective banding features. The center was also not well defined.[6] After satellite imagery from radar and aircraft, it was found that the center had re-formed 150 nautical miles more north than expected and the storm had gained speed.[7] The storm entered the southern part of a large area of deep convection, as signs of an eyewall structure forming were beginning to become prominent.[8] The eyewall structure then dissipated and a new center began forming north-northeast of the previous.[9] The storm then underwent a period of rapid intensification, the fifth hurricane of the season to do so, after intensifying by 35\u00a0mph (55\u00a0km/h) in a 24-hour period.[10] Consequently, at 03:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a014, the system was upgraded to a Category\u00a01 hurricane.[11] Shortly thereafter, at 05:30\u00a0UTC, Nicholas made landfall about 10\u00a0mi (16\u00a0km) west-southwest of Sargent Beach, Texas, with maximum sustained winds of 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h).[10][12] It then quickly weakened inland to tropical storm strength, as it moved to near Galveston Bay.[13] Nicholas was downgraded to tropical depression status at 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a015,[14] as it moved slowly into southern Louisiana, where residents were still recovering in the aftermath of Hurricane Ida.[15] At the time, the system consisted of a large swirl of low- to mid-level clouds and showers, with a few patches of deep convection well removed from the center, according to the NHC.[16] Early the following day, while situated near Marsh Island, along the Louisiana coast, Nicholas became post-tropical.[17][18] Nicholas's remnant low later moved further inland, stalling over northern Louisiana,[19][20][21] before its low-level circulation center became ill-defined on September\u00a018.[1] The storm's remnants persisted for another few days, before they were absorbed into an extratropical storm to the north on September 20.[1] The system's residual tropical moisture lingered over parts of the southeastern U.S. for several days.[22][23][24]"

The first hurricane warning was issued from Port O'Connor to Freeport, Texas at 03:00 UTC, when the storm was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane.[11] Flood watches were also issued in southern and central Louisiana when Nicholas slowed its forward speed to 5 miles per hour (8.0\u00a0km/h).[25] In addition to flood watches, the Weather Prediction Center issued a rare 50 percent high-risk flooding area for southwestern Louisiana.[26] Rainfall estimate totals were 8 to 16 inches (200 to 410\u00a0mm), with some locations potentially receiving 15 inches (380\u00a0mm). Coastal Louisiana, which was battered by Hurricane Ida just weeks earlier, was estimated to receive 5 to 10 inches (130 to 250\u00a0mm). Lake Houston was lowered by one foot (30\u00a0cm).[27] Schools in southern Texas and Louisiana were suspended on September 13.[28][29][30] At least 330 flights originating from William P. Hobby Airport and George Bush Intercontinental Airport were cancelled.[31] In Harris County, COVID-19 testing sites were closed.[32] Late on September 13, ferry service between Galveston and the Bolivar Peninsula were suspended. Service resumed the next day.[33] Governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, declared a state of emergency and noted that areas affected by Hurricane Ida would possibly feel the effects of the tropical storm.[34] Edwards also requested a federal disaster declaration, which was approved by President Joe Biden on September 14.[32][35] The Governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, issued a disaster declaration for 17 counties in southeastern Texas and ordered the State Operations Center to increase its readiness level.[36] The Louisiana National Guard deployed 80 high water vehicles, 23 boats and 15 aircraft across southern Louisiana.[31] On September 13, before the storm hit, singer-songwriter Harry Styles postponed his performance in Houston.[37] Dozens of barriers were constructed in Houston and readied high-water rescue vehicles.[38] The American Red Cross in the Texas Gulf Coast area prepared as Nicholas moved closer to landfall.[39]"

During the day, the heaviest band of rain kept moving south to be on top of the Townsville area, although Townsville had only relatively light rain during the day, (apx. 43\u00a0mm between 9\u00a0am and 6\u00a0pm), it was overnight that the intense rainfall caused severe flash flooding and high flood levels in the streams and rivers in the area. Around 335\u00a0mm of rain had fallen on the 10th between 6\u00a0pm and midnight and a further 236\u00a0mm fell in the next 3 hours. Late into the evening, the heaviest of the rain was now falling and gale-force winds were continuing (at its heaviest, the rain was falling at 100\u00a0mm per hour) as most streets in the city are flat, the city streets were underwater and blocked by fallen trees and power lines. Water was up to 3 meters deep through parts of the CBD and hundreds of businesses and homes were inundated in both Townsville and Thuringowa, plus around 200 people had to be evacuated. Black River was badly hit with 48 homes being uninhabitable, 14 homes destroyed and 8 being washed out to sea when the river broke its banks and at Bluewater 40 homes were badly damaged, while 5 other homes in the city had been destroyed plus 100's flooded,[3] phones were out in most parts the city and fallen power lines and flooded substations cut power to around 50% of homes. A landslide, estimated to be 20,000 cubic meters destroyed 12 and damaged 6 units on a Magnetic Island resort and another landslide destroyed a million dollar home on Stanton Terrace and boulders were also loosened on Castle Hill and rolled down into Stuart Street in the CBD. Townsville was declared a state of emergency that night.[4] \nRain had eased a little by the 11th but still had some heavy rain pass through, Ex-Cyclone Sid, a weak surface low was still just to the north of Townsville during Monday 12 January and by midday the trough had redeveloped again and heavy rain moved into the city for the rest of the day.[4]\nWith many businesses closed due to the weekend damage, the new lot of rain caused a complete shutdown of the city and many workers battled renewed floodwaters trying to get home, even emergency workers had to abandon cleanup work for the rest of the day.[4] On the 10 and 11 January, Townsville airport recorded 549\u00a0mm in 24 hours and from the 11th and 12th through to the 9\u00a0am the 13th 245\u00a0mm fell, giving a 3-day record of 794\u00a0mm. The period of the 10th to the 11th has since been dubbed the 'Night of Noah' by Townsville residents.[5]  Other areas around the city had readings from 895\u00a0mm up to 1300\u00a0mm.[3]"

The system was first noted within the South Pacific convergence zone as a small tropical depression on November 13, to the northeast of the Solomon Islands. Over the next few days the system gradually developed further within an area of light winds in the upper troposphere, before it was named Tia early on November 16. Later that day due to a developing northerly steering current, the system slowed and undertook a small anticlockwise loop before starting to move towards the southwest and rapidly intensify. After rapidly intensifying throughout November 16 and 17, Tia passed within 55\u00a0km (35\u00a0mi) of the Solomon Island: Anuta at around 1800 UTC on November 17, before passing near Tikopia Island six hours later. As Tia moved near Tikopia, the system reached its peak intensity as a category 3 severe tropical cyclone, with 10\u2011minute sustained windspeeds of 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph). During November 18, due to cooler waters and increased wind shear, Tia started to weaken as it moved southwards under the influence of a strengthening upper-level northerly wind flow. Over the next 24 hours, the system continued to move southwards and passed within 150\u00a0km (95\u00a0mi) of Vanuatu's Banks Islands, while gradually weakening further. Tia subsequently degenerated into a tropical depression during November 20, before it was last noted the next day as it crossed a part of its former track, where it had been producing hurricane-force wind speeds a few days earlier. While it was active Tia directly affected the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu, while it indirectly affected Kiribati. The Solomon Island of Tikopia was the worst affected island, after more than 1,000 people were left homeless on the island and 90% of all dwellings were  destroyed. Damage was minimal in Vanuatu, and was mainly confined to crops and fruit trees on the Banks and Torres Islands. After this usage of the name Tia, the name was retired and withdrawn from use on the tropical cyclone naming lists."

Pre-dating any modern flood defence construction low-lying land in Devon, Somerset, Gloucestershire, and across South Wales was flooded. The devastation was particularly severe on the Welsh side, extending from Laugharne in Carmarthenshire to above Chepstow in Monmouthshire. Cardiff was the most badly affected town, with the foundations of St Mary's Church destroyed.[citation needed] The impact was extensive: it is estimated that 2,000 or more people were drowned; houses and villages were swept away; and an estimated 200 square miles (51,800\u00a0ha) of farmland and livestock were destroyed.[2] Along the coasts of the Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary, local economies suffered greatly as a result of the flooding. The coast of Devon and the Somerset Levels as far inland as Glastonbury Tor, 14 miles (23\u00a0km) from the coast, were also affected.[citation needed] The sea wall at Burnham-on-Sea gave way,[3] and the water flowed over the low-lying levels and moors. Thirty villages in Somerset were affected, including Brean which was \"swallowed up\" and where seven out of the nine houses were destroyed with 26 of the inhabitants dying. For ten days the Church of All Saints at Kingston Seymour, near Weston-super-Mare, was filled with water to a depth of 5 feet (1.5\u00a0m). A chiselled mark remains showing that the maximum height of the water was 7.74 metres (25 feet 5 inches) above sea level.[4][5] Contemporary accounts of the flood were written by people such as the Puritan pamphleteer, William Jones: as soon as the people of those Countries, perceived that it was the violence of the Waters of the raging Seas, and that they began to exceede the compasse of their accustomed boundes, and making so furiously towardes them. happy were they that could make the best, and most speed away, many of them, leaving all their goods and substance, to the merciles Waters, being glad to escape away with life themselues: But so violent and swift were the outragiouse waves, that pursued one an other, with such vehemencie, and the Waters multiplying so much in so short a time, that in lesse then five houres space most part of those cuntreys (and especially the places which lay lowe) were all over flowen, and many hundreds of people both men women, and children were then quite devoured, by these outragious waters, such was the furie of the waves, of the Seas, the one of them dryving the other forwardes with such force and swiftnes, that it is almost incredible for any to beleeve the same....Many there were which fled into the tops of high trees, and there were inforced to abide some three daies, some more, and some lesse, without any victuals at all, there suffring much colde besides many other calamities, and...through ever much hunger and cold, some of them fell down againe out of the Trees, and so were like to perish for want of succour. Othersame, sate in the tops of high Trees as aforesaid, beholding their wives, children, and servants, swimming (remediles of all succour) in the Waters. Other some sitting in the tops of Trees might behold their houses overflowne with the waters. some their houses caryed quite away: and no signe or token left there of them.[6]"

This occurred in combination with a severe south-westerly gale with peak winds measured at Barnstaple from 3am to noon, and coastal flooding in East Anglia at night on the 30th, both of which are consistent with a storm tracking eastwards.[9] It has been demonstrated that the tide and weather event that occurred on this date were capable of generating a storm surge consistent with the observed inundation.[9][8]"

        "content": "A 2002 research paper, following investigations by Professor Simon Haslett of Bath Spa University and Australian geologist Ted Bryant of the University of Wollongong, suggested that the flooding may have been caused by a tsunami, after the authors had read some eyewitness accounts in the historical reports which described the flood.[10][11][12] The British Geological Survey has suggested that, as there is no evidence of a landslide off the continental shelf, a tsunami would most likely have been caused by an earthquake on a known unstable fault off the coast of southwest Ireland, causing the vertical displacement of the sea floor.[13] One contemporary report describes an earth tremor on the morning of the flood;[14] however, other sources date this earthquake to a few months after the event.[15] Haslett and Bryant's evidence for the tsunami hypothesis included massive boulders that had been displaced up the beach by enormous force; a layer up to 8 inches (20\u00a0cm) thick composed of sand, shells and stones within an otherwise constant deposit of mud that was found in boreholes from Devon to Gloucestershire and the Gower Peninsula; and rock erosion characteristic of high water velocities throughout the Severn Estuary.[16][17] However, because of high wave energy conditions it is not methodologically possible to distinguish between storm and tsunami boulder deposits on North Atlantic coasts.[18] In attributing the flood to a storm surge in their 2006 paper,[9] Horsburgh and Horritt show that those proposing a tsunami hypothesis underestimate the volume of water and coastal damage involved in storm surges, and fail to account for flooding on the opposite side of the country on the same day. There is also a lack of evidence for the event affecting West Wales, Cornwall, or southern Ireland. Their tsunami modelling showed that it would not be possible for a tsunami not to affect these areas, while causing flooding elsewhere in the country. Contemporary sources also indicate the flooding proceeded for a period of five hours, which is consistent with a storm surge rather than a tsunami.[9][19]"

The resultant financial loss in the parish was estimated as \u00a35,000 (equivalent to \u00a31.4\u00a0million in 2023).[22][23] The flood was commemorated in a contemporary pamphlet entitled God's warning to the people of England by the great overflowing of the waters or floods, by William Jones.[24] On the 400th anniversary, 30 January 2007, BBC for the Somerset area looked at the possible causes and asked whether it could happen again in the county.

        "content": " The Somerset Levels are a coastal plain and wetland area of Somerset, England, running south from the Mendips to the Blackdown Hills. The Somerset Levels have an area of about 160,000 acres (650\u00a0km2) and are bisected by the Polden Hills; the areas to the south are drained by the River Parrett, and the areas to the north by the rivers Axe and Brue. The Mendip Hills separate the Somerset Levels from the North Somerset Levels. The Somerset Levels consist of marine clay \"levels\" along the coast and inland peat-based \"moors\"; agriculturally, about 70\u00a0per cent is used as grassland and the rest is arable. Willow and teazel are grown commercially and peat is extracted. A Palaeolithic flint tool found in West Sedgemoor is the earliest indication of human presence in the area. The Neolithic people exploited the reed swamps for their natural resources and started to construct wooden trackways, including the world's oldest known timber trackway, the Post Track, dating from about 3800 BC. The Levels were the location of the Glastonbury Lake Village as well as two Lake villages at Meare Lake. Several settlements and hill forts were built on the natural \"islands\" of slightly raised land, including Brent Knoll and Glastonbury. In the Roman period sea salt was extracted and a string of settlements were set up along the Polden Hills. The discovery at Shapwick of 9,238 silver Roman coins, known as the Shapwick Hoard, was the second-largest ever found from the time of the Roman Empire. A number of Saxon charters document the incorporation of areas of moor in estates. In 1685, the Battle of Sedgemoor was fought in the Bussex area of Westonzoyland at the conclusion of the Monmouth Rebellion. As a result of the wetland nature of the Levels, the area contains a rich biodiversity of national and international importance. It supports a vast variety of plant and bird species and is an important feeding ground for birds and includes 32\u00a0Sites of Special Scientific Interest, of which 12 are also Special Protection Areas. The area has been extensively studied for its biodiversity and heritage, and has a growing tourism industry. People have been draining the area since before Domesday Book. In the Middle Ages, the monasteries of Glastonbury, Athelney and Muchelney were responsible for much of the drainage. The artificial Huntspill River was constructed during the Second World War as a reservoir, although it also serves as a drainage channel. The Sowy River between the River Parrett and King's Sedgemoor Drain was completed in 1972; water levels are managed by the Levels internal drainage boards. During 2009 and 2010 proposals to build a series of electricity pylons by one of two routes between Hinkley Point and Avonmouth, to transmit electricity from the proposed Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, attracted local opposition. Discussions have taken place concerning the possibility of obtaining World Heritage Site status for the Somerset Levels as a \"cultural landscape\".[2] It was suggested that if this bid were successful it could improve flood control, but only if wetland fens were created again; the plans were abandoned in 2010.[3]"

        "content": "The Levels are mainly flat areas of inland plains and a coastal sand and clay barrier, east and west of the M5 motorway. There are some slightly raised parts, called \"burtles\",[7] as well as higher ridges and hills. The Levels are about 20 feet (6\u00a0m) above mean sea level (O.D.). The general elevation inland is 10 to 12 feet (3 to 4\u00a0m) O.D. with peak tides of 25 to 26 feet (8 to 8\u00a0m) O.D. recorded at Bridgwater and Burnham-on-Sea.[8] Large areas of peat were laid down in the Brue Valley during the Quaternary period after the ice sheets melted.[7] The area's topography consists of two basins mainly surrounded by hills, the runoff from which forms rivers that originally meandered across the plain but have now been controlled by embanking and clyses (the local name for a sluice).[9] The area is prone to winter floods of fresh water and occasional salt water inundations. The worst in recorded history was the Bristol Channel floods of 1607, which resulted in the drowning of an estimated 2,000 or more people, houses and villages swept away, an estimated 200 square miles (500\u00a0km2) of farmland inundated, and livestock killed.[10] Another severe flood occurred in 1872\u20131873, when over 107 square miles (300\u00a0km2) were under water from October to March.[11] Although underlain by much older Triassic age[7][12] formations that protrude to form what would once have been islands\u2014such as Athelney, Brent Knoll, Burrow Mump and Glastonbury Tor\u2014the lowland landscape was formed only during the last 10,000\u00a0years, following the end of the last ice age. Glastonbury Tor is composed of Upper Lias Sand. The Poldens and the Isle of Wedmore are composed of Blue Lias and Marl, while the Mendips are largely Carboniferous limestone.[13] Although sea level changes since the Pliocene led to changes in sea level and the laying down of vegetation,[14] the peak of the peat formation took place in swamp conditions around 6,000\u00a0years ago, although in some areas it continued into medieval times.[15][16] It is a mainly agricultural region, typically with open fields of permanent grass surrounded by ditches with willow trees. Access to individual areas, especially for cattle, was provided by means of \"droves\", i.e. green lanes, leading off the public highways. Some of the old roads, in contrast to the old hollow ways found in other areas of England, are causeways raised above the level of the surrounding land, with a drainage ditch running along each side.[17]"

In the south, Aller, which has a population of 374,[18] includes the hamlet of Beer (sometimes Bere) and the deserted medieval village of Oath on the opposite bank of the River Parrett. The area known as the Isle of Athelney was once a very low isolated island linked by a causeway to East Lyng, each end of which was protected by a semi-circular stockade and ditch. The ditch on the island is now known to date from the Iron Age, and was used by Alfred the Great as a fort before the Battle of Ethandun in May 878; in gratitude for his victory Alfred founded a monastery, Athelney Abbey,[19] on the Isle in 888, which survived until the Dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII in 1539. Bawdrip is a small village which has a population of 498.[20] Brent Knoll is a large village at the foot of 449-foot (137\u00a0m) Brent Knoll Camp that dominates the surrounding landscape; the name means Beacon Hill in Old English.[21] Brent Knoll has been inhabited since at least the Bronze Age.[22] Before the Somerset Levels were drained, Brent Knoll was an island known as the Isle (or Mount) of Frogs.[23] Glastonbury (population 8,784)[24] and Street (11,066)[24] lie on opposite sides of the River Brue, and provide a central point for trade and commerce. Larger centres are generally on slightly higher ground around the edges of the Levels. Bridgwater is a market town, the administrative centre of the Sedgemoor district, and a major industrial centre. With a population of 33,698,[20] it straddles the major communication routes through South West England. Situated on the edge of the Somerset Levels, along both banks of the River Parrett and 10 miles (16\u00a0km) from its mouth, it was at one time a major port and trading centre. The hamlet of Dunball forms part of the port on the river. Burrowbridge lies on the River Parrett further inland. The name probably comes from the Old English buruh (fortified hill) and bry\u010b\u0121 (bridge).[25] In the village is Burrow Mump, an ancient earthwork now owned by the National Trust. Burrow Mump is also known as St Michael's Borough or Tutteyate.[26] It is a natural hill of Triassic sandstone capped by Keuper marl.[27] Excavations showed evidence of a medieval masonry building on the top of the hill.[28] Along the coast, settlements such as Berrow are built on the line of sand dunes separating the low-lying marshes from the Bristol Channel. At the northern end Bleadon lies on the River Axe; and there was for many years a small harbour, sometimes known as Lympsham Wharf.[29] The arrival of the Bristol and Exeter Railway in 1841, which crossed the Axe on a bridge, obstructed river traffic beyond the wharf, making it the limit of navigation for coastal vessels.[29] An Act of 1915 authorised the drainage of the river and installation of a flood gate at Bleadon,[30] although attempts to control the water had occurred on Bleadon Level since medieval times, including an early windmill, in 1613, to pump water into the sea from behind a sea wall.[31] Burnham-on-Sea (population 18,401)[32] is at the mouth of the River Parrett where it enters Bridgwater Bay.[33] The position of the town on the edge of the Somerset Levels has resulted in a history dominated by land reclamation and sea defences since Roman times.[34] Burnham was seriously affected by the Bristol Channel floods of 1607, and various flood defences have been installed since then.[35] A concrete sea wall was built in 1911, and after the Second World War further additions to the defences were made, using the remains of a Mulberry harbour; the present curved concrete wall was completed in 1988.[36] Highbridge, which neighbours Burnham, is near the mouth of the River Brue and the villages of East and West Huntspill.[33]"

Seasonal temperature variation is less extreme than most of the United Kingdom because of the adjacent sea. The summer months of July and August are the warmest, with mean daily maxima of approximately 21\u00a0\u00b0C (69.8\u00a0\u00b0F). In winter, mean minimum temperatures of 1 or 2\u00a0\u00b0C (33.8 or 35.6\u00a0\u00b0F) are common.[37] The Azores high pressure area influences the southwest of England's summer weather, but convective cloud sometimes forms inland, reducing the number of hours of sunshine. Annual sunshine rates are slightly less than the regional average of 1,600\u00a0hours.[37] In December 1998, there were 20\u00a0days without sun recorded at Yeovilton. Most rainfall in the southwest is caused by convection or Atlantic depressions, which are most active in autumn and winter, when they are the chief cause of rain. In summer, a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by the Sun heating the land, leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms. Average rainfall is around 700\u00a0mm (28\u00a0in), and about 8\u201315 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, and June to August have the lightest winds.

In 1200, a wharf was constructed at Rackley near Axbridge. The Parrett was navigable up as far as Langport in 1600, with 15 to 20\u00a0ton barges. The Domesday Book recorded that drainage of the higher grounds was under way, although the moors at Wedmoor were said to be useless.[42] In the Middle Ages, the monasteries of Glastonbury, Athelney, and Muchelney were responsible for much of the drainage. In 1129, the Abbot of Glastonbury was recorded as inspecting enclosed land at Lympsham. Efforts to control flooding on the Parrett were recorded around the same date. In 1234, 722 acres (2.9\u00a0km2) were reclaimed near Westonzoyland and, from the accounts in the abbey's rent books, this had increased to 972 acres (393\u00a0ha) by 1240.[43]"

They included Southlake Wall, Burrow Wall, and Lake Wall.[44] The River Tone was also diverted by the Abbot of Athelney and other land owners into a new embanked channel, joining the Parrett upstream from its original confluence.[45] The main drainage outlets flowing through the Moors and Levels are the rivers Axe, Brue, Huntspill, Parrett, Tone, and Yeo, together with the King's Sedgemoor Drain, an artificial channel into which the River Cary now runs. Previously, the Cary ran into the Tone while the Brue ran through Meare Pool (now drained) and the Panborough Gap, and then into the Axe. Another accomplishment in the Middle Ages was the construction of the tidal Pillrow Cut, joining the Brue and Axe. In 1500, there was said to be 70,000 acres (283\u00a0km2) of floodable land of which only 20,000 acres (81\u00a0km2) had been reclaimed. In 1597, 50 acres (20\u00a0ha) of land were recovered near the Parrett estuary; a few years later, 140 acres (57\u00a0ha) near Pawlett were recovered by means of embankments; and three further reclamations, totalling 110 acres (45\u00a0ha), had been undertaken downstream of Bridgwater by 1660.[46] In the early 17th century, during the time of King James I, abortive plans were made to drain and enclose much of Sedgemoor, which the local Lords supported but opposed by the Commoners who would have lost grazing rights.[47] In 1632, Charles I sold the Crown's interest in the scheme, and it was taken over by a consortium that included Sir Cornelius Vermuyden, a Dutch drainage engineer. However, the work was delayed by the English Civil War and later defeated in parliament after local opposition.[11] In 1638, it was reported that nearly 2,600 acres (11\u00a0km2) of Tealham and Tadham Moors were not reclaimed, with a total of 30,500 acres (123.43\u00a0km2) being undrained. Between 1785 and 1791, much of the lowest part of the peat moors was enclosed. In 1795, John Billingsley advocated enclosure and the digging of rhynes (a local name for drainage channels, pronounced \"reens\" in the east and rhyne to the west) between plots,[48] and wrote in his Agriculture of the County of Somerset that 4,400 acres (18\u00a0km2) had been enclosed in the last 20 years in Wedmore and Meare, 350 acres (1.4\u00a0km2) at Nyland, 900 acres (3.64\u00a0km2) at Blackford, 2,000 acres (8\u00a0km2) at Mark, 100 acres (0.4\u00a0km2) in Shapwick, and 1,700 acres (7\u00a0km2) at Westhay.[49] At Westhay Moor in the early 19th\u00a0century, it was shown how peat bogs could be successfully drained and top-dressed with silt deposited via flooding, creating a very rich soil.[50] The character of the soil was also changed by the spreading of clay and silt from the digging of King's Sedgemoor Drain.[51]"

It is unclear why windmills were not employed, as they were on the Fens of East Anglia, but only two examples have been recorded on the Levels: one at Bleadon at the mouth of the River Axe, where a sea wall had been built, and the other at Common Moor north of Glastonbury, which was being drained following a private Act of Parliament in 1721.[11] The first steam pumping station was Westonzoyland Pumping Station in 1830, followed by more effective ones from 1860. Automatic electric pumps are used today.[52] The human-made Huntspill River was constructed during World War II with sluices at both ends to provide a guaranteed daily supply of 4,500,000 imperial gallons (20,000,000\u00a0L; 5,400,000\u00a0US\u00a0gal) of \"process water\".[53] It was intended that in the summer, when water supply was lower, it would serve as a reservoir with water pumped from the moors; and in winter serve as a drainage channel, via gravity drainage.[53][54] Geotechnical problems prevented it from being dug as deep as originally intended and so gravity-drainage of the moors was not possible: thus, water is pumped up into the river throughout the year.[53] The Sowy River between the River Parrett and King's Sedgemoor Drain was completed in 1972.[55][56] The Levels and Moors are now artificially drained by a network of rhynes which are pumped up into \"drains\". Water levels are managed by the Levels internal drainage boards (IDBs); the Levels are not as intensively drained or farmed as the East Anglian fens, historically a similar area of low marsh. They are still liable to widespread fresh water flooding in winter. One of the approaches to reducing the risk of flooding within the catchment area of the Parrett is the planting of new woodlands.[57] Controversy about the management of the drainage and flood protection has previously involved the activities of IDBs.[58][59] However, IDBs have been actively participating with the Parrett Catchment Partnership, a partnership of 30 organisations that aims to create a consensus on how water is to be managed, in particular, looking at new ways to achieve sustainable benefits for all local stakeholders.[60] During 2009 and 2010, work was undertaken to upgrade sluice gates, watercourses, and culverts to enable seasonal flooding of Southlake Moor during the winter diverting water from the Sowy River onto the moor. It has the capacity to hold 1.2 million cubic metres as part of a scheme by the Parrett Internal Drainage Board to restore ten floodplains in Somerset. In spring, the water is drained away to enable the land to be used as pasture during the summer.[61] The scheme is also used to encourage water birds.[62]"

In addition, the problems of high fresh water floods are aggravated by the unrestricted entry of the tide along the Parrett,[63] which is the only river in the Levels and Moors that does not have a clyse on it. Discussions on whether a clyse is needed for the Parrett and whether it should be sited at Bridgwater or nearer the mouth of the river date back to 1939, at the start of World War II, and have not been resolved.[63] On 13 December 1981, a large Atlantic storm hit the North Somerset coast.[64] Meteorological conditions caused a large storm surge which coincided with high astronomical tides  in the Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary. Wind speeds were measured at 40 knots (74\u00a0km/h; 46\u00a0mph). Overtopping of the sea defences along a 7 miles (11\u00a0km) stretch of the Somerset coast at 22 locations from Clevedon to Porlock began after 19:30. Although there was no loss of life, the resultant flooding covered 12,500 acres (5,100\u00a0ha) of land, affecting 1,072 houses and commercial properties, with \u00a3150,000 worth of livestock killed and \u00a350,000 of feed and grain destroyed. Wessex Water Authority estimated the total cost of the damage caused at \u00a36M. This resulted in a three-year programme of sea defence assessment, repair and improvement.[64] With 400 properties affected in Burnham-on-Sea, after emergency repairs, Wessex Water Authority began planning new sea defences. Construction work started in 1983 on a \u00a37M scheme, creating what was then Britain's biggest wave return wall.[64] The Environment Agency's current \"Parrett Catchment Flood Management Plan\", published in December 2009, divides the Parrett catchment area into eight sub-areas, with the Somerset Levels and Moors falling into sub-area 6 and Bridgwater falling into sub-area 7.[65] As part of the published flood risk assessments for both these sub-areas, it is recognised that: at a future date a tidal clyse may be needed on the Parrett; this causes a funding dilemma; and, geomorphology studies of the Parrett and the Tone are needed to help address many of the uncertainties associated with a tidal exclusion project.[65]"

The sea wall was again breached in 1799, filling the Axe valley with sea water. In 1872, another flood covered 7,000 acres (28\u00a0km2) and in 1919, 70,000 acres (283\u00a0km2) were inundated with sea water, poisoning the land for up to 7\u00a0years.[66] Since 1990, the drainage boards have been charged with watching the rhynes and keeping them clear, under the overall responsibility of the Environment Agency. With rising sea levels, the work required to maintain the sea defences is likely to become more expensive, and it has been proposed that two inland seas be created.[67] Other studies have recommended maintaining the current defences for five years while undertaking further studies of available options.[68] Although the Environment Agency have made plans for the regular winter flooding, still in recent years this has resulted in a number of villages\u00a0\u2014 including Muchelney and Westonzoyland \u2014 being cut off. In November 2012, during the 2012 Great Britain and Ireland floods, after six days Somerset County Council-funded BARB rescue boats reached Muchelney on 29 November, rescuing nearly 100 people.[69] Rescue boats were again required during the rain and storms from Cyclone Dirk in the turn of the year 2014,[70] and subsequently during the Winter flooding of 2013\u201314 on the Somerset Levels. On 24 January 2014, in light of the continued flooded extent of the Somerset Moors and forecast new rainfall as part of the Winter storms of 2013\u201314 in the United Kingdom, both Somerset County Council and Sedgemoor District Council declared a major incident.[71][72] At this time, with 17,000 acres (6,900\u00a0ha) of agricultural land having been under water for over a month,[72] the village of Thorney had been abandoned and Muchelney had been cut off by flood waters for almost a month.[71] Environment Minister Owen Paterson visited the area on 27 January 2014, and after meeting local MPs, the Environment Agency and various community representatives the night before in Taunton, promised at a media-only press conference at North Moor pumping station that if a local water management plan could be developed over the next six weeks, he would approve it. Such plan would likely include the dredging of the rivers Tone and Parrett, and possibly a later sluice near Bridgwater.[73] There have been public protests about the river Parrett not being dredged in recent years. In mid-February 2014 the Environment Agency began installing giant pumps imported from the Netherlands to alleviate the continuing flooding.[74]"

An alternative suggestion is that the name derives from Seo-mere-saetan meaning \"settlers by the sea lakes\".[77] The Neolithic people continued to exploit the reedswamps for their natural resources and started to construct wooden trackways such as the Sweet and Post Tracks. The Sweet Track, named after the peat digger who discovered it in 1970 and dating from the 3800s BC, is the world's oldest timber trackway, once thought to be the world's oldest engineered roadway.[78] The track was built between what was in the early 4th\u00a0millennium BC an island at Westhay and a ridge of high ground at Shapwick, close to the River Brue. The remains of similar tracks have been uncovered nearby, connecting settlements on the peat bog including the Honeygore, Abbotts Way, Bells, Bakers, Westhay and Nidons trackways.[12] The Levels contain the best-preserved prehistoric village in the UK,[79] Glastonbury Lake Village, as well as two others at Meare Lake Village.[80] Discovered in 1892 by Arthur Bulleid,[81] it was inhabited by about 200\u00a0people living in 14\u00a0roundhouses,[79] and was built on a morass on an artificial foundation of timber filled with brushwood, bracken, rubble and clay.[82] Investigation of the Meare Pool indicates that it was formed by the encroachment of raised peat bogs, particularly during the Subatlantic climatic period (1st millennium BC), and core sampling demonstrates that it is filled with at least 2 metres (6.6\u00a0ft) of detritus mud.[83][84] The two villages within Meare Pool appear to originate from a collection of structures erected on the surface of the dried peat, such as tents, windbreaks and animal folds. Clay was later spread over the peat, providing raised stands for occupation, industry and movement, and in some areas thicker clay spreads accommodated hearths built of clay or stone.[85] The area continued to be inhabited during the Bronze Age, when the population supported itself largely by hunting and fishing in the surrounding marshes, living on artificial islands connected by wooden causeways on wooden piles. There have been many finds of metalwork during peat cutting, which may have been devotional offerings. Brent Knoll has been settled by people since at least the Bronze Age.  It is the site of an Iron Age hillfort known as Brent Knoll Camp, with multiple ramparts (multivallate) following the contours of the hill.[86] Several settlements and hill forts were built on the natural \"islands\" of slightly raised land, including Brent Knoll, Glastonbury, and the low range of the Polden Hills. According to legend Ider son of Nuth, who was one of King Arthur's knights, went to the Mount of Frogs on a quest to slay three giants who lived there.[87][88][89] The fort has been claimed as the site of the Battle of Mons Badonicus.[90] Sea salt was extracted during the Roman period, and a string of settlements were set up along the Polden Hills. Some possible settlement sites are also known in the Draycott and Cheddar Moors and around Highbridge.[91] The discovery at Shapwick of 9,238\u00a0silver Roman coins,[92][93] the second largest hoard ever found from the Roman Empire included coins dated from as early as 31\u201330 BC up until 224 AD.[94] The hoard also contained two rare coins which had not been discovered in Britain before,[93] and the largest number of silver denarii ever found in Britain.[92][95] A number of Anglo-Saxon charters document the incorporation of areas of moor in estates, suggesting that the area continued to be exploited.[96] It is easy to see why the area acquired a number of legends, particularly of King Arthur and his followers, who some believe based his court in the hill fort at South Cadbury.[97] According to legend, Alfred the Great burnt cakes when hiding in the marshes of Athelney, after the Danish invasion in 875. After the Battle of Edington the Danish king was baptised at Aller and a peace treaty signed at Wedmore.[98] In 1685, the Monmouth Rebellion ended at the Battle of Sedgemoor, which was fought in the Bussex area of Westonzoyland.[99]"

Cider is still produced in Somerset by Thatchers Cider, Gaymer Cider Company and numerous small independent producers.

        "content": "Willow has been cut and used on the Levels since mankind moved into the area. Fragments of willow basket were found near the Glastonbury Lake Village, and it was used in the construction of several Iron Age causeways.[119] The willow was harvested using traditional methods of pollarding, where a tree would be cut back to the main stem. New shoots of willow, called \"withies\", would grow out of the trunk and these would be cut periodically for use.[120] During the 1930s, over 9,000 acres (36\u00a0km2) of willow were being grown commercially on the Levels. Largely because of the replacement of baskets by plastic bags and cardboard boxes, the industry has severely declined since the 1950s. By the end of the 20th\u00a0century only about 350 acres (1.4\u00a0km2) were grown commercially, near the villages of Burrowbridge, Westonzoyland, and North Curry.[121] The Somerset Levels is now the only area in the UK where basket willow is grown commercially. For weaving, the species Salix triandra (almond willow, black maul) is grown, while Salix viminalis (common osier) is ideal for handles, bases, and the structural members in furniture and hurdles. Historically willow was used to make salmon traps or \"putchers\". Products including baskets, eel traps (kypes), lobster pots, and furniture were widely made from willow throughout the area in the recent past.[122] Among the more unusual products still made are passenger baskets for hot air balloons,[123] the frames inside the Bearskins worn by the regiments of the Grenadier Guards,[124] and an increasing number of willow coffins.[125] Another use of willow has been found by the Coate family, who make artists' charcoals in Stoke St Gregory. It has become in 30\u00a0years the leading artists' charcoal manufacturer in Europe, producing most of the natural charcoals sold under different art-material brands.[126] The industry is celebrated in the form of the Willow Man (sometimes known as the Angel of the South), a willow sculpture, 40\u00a0feet (12.2\u00a0m) tall, produced by artist Serena de la Hey in September 2000 that can be seen from the railway and the M5 motorway to the north of Bridgwater.[127] At Stoke St Gregory there is also a Willows and Wetlands Visitor Centre.[128]"

The resulting reduction in water levels put local ecosystems at risk; peat wastage in pasture fields was occurring at rates of 1\u20133\u00a0feet (0.3\u20130.8\u00a0m) over 100\u00a0years.[136] Peat extraction continues today, although much reduced.[7][137]"

        "content": "As a result of their wetland nature, the Moors and Levels contain a rich biodiversity of national and international importance.[12] They support a vast variety of plant species, including common plants such as marsh marigold, meadowsweet, and ragged robin. The area is an important feeding ground for birds including Bewick's swan, Eurasian curlew, common redshank, Eurasian skylark, common snipe, Eurasian teal, wigeon, and Eurasian whimbrel, as well as birds of prey including the marsh harrier and peregrine falcon.[138] A wide range of insect species is also present, including rare invertebrates, particularly beetles including the lesser silver water beetle, Bagous nodulosus, Hydrophilus piceus, Odontomyia angulata, Oulema erichsoni, and Valvata macrostoma. In addition, the area supports an important otter population.[139] Water voles (Arvicola amphibius) are being encouraged to recolonise areas of the Levels where they have been absent for 10\u00a0years, by the capture of mink (Mustela vison).[140] In 2010, a project was started to reintroduce the common crane to the Levels, after an absence of 400\u00a0years. The birds' eggs were flown from Germany to the Slimbridge wetland reserve managed by the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust (a UK charity) at Slimbridge, Gloucestershire,[141] and reared to the age of five months before being released onto the Levels.[142] The \"Great Crane Project\" aims to introduce around 20 of the birds each year until 2015. The work, which included collaboration with Pensthorpe Nature Reserve and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, was supported by a grant of \u00a3700k from Viridor Credits.[143] The Levels contain 32\u00a0Sites of Special Scientific Interest (12 of them also Special Protection Areas), the River Huntspill[144] and Bridgwater Bay national nature reserves,[145] the Somerset Levels and Moors Ramsar Site covering about 86,000 acres (348\u00a0km2),[146] the Somerset Levels National Nature Reserve,[147] Shapwick Heath National Nature Reserve,[148] Ham Wall National Nature Reserve[149] and numerous Scheduled monuments. The Brue Valley Living Landscape conservation project commenced in 2009 and aims to restore, recreate and reconnect habitat. It aims to ensure that wildlife is enhanced and capable of sustaining itself in the face of climate change[150] while guaranteeing farmers and other landowners can continue to use their land profitably. It is one of an increasing number of landscape scale conservation projects in the UK.[151][152] About 72,000 acres (291\u00a0km2) of the Levels are recognised as an Environmentally Sensitive Area,[153] and other areas are designated as Areas of High Archaeological Potential, but there is currently no single conservation designation covering the Levels and Moors.[154] A survey in 2005 discovered that 11 of the known wooden Bronze Age causeways on the Levels had been destroyed or vanished and others were seriously damaged, caused by the reduction in water levels and subsequent exposure of the timber to oxygen and aerobic bacteria.[155] Part of the Sweet Track is being actively conserved. Following purchase of land by the National Heritage Memorial Fund, and installation of a water pumping and distribution system along a 550-yard (500\u00a0m) section, several hundred metres of the track's length are now being actively conserved.[156] This method of preserving wetland archaeological remains (i.e. maintaining a high water table and saturating the site) is rare.[157] A 550-yard (500\u00a0m) section, which lies within the land owned by the Nature Conservancy Council, has been surrounded by a clay bank to prevent drainage into surrounding lower peat fields, and water levels are regularly monitored.[158] The viability of this method is demonstrated by comparing it with the nearby Abbot's Way, which has not had similar treatment, and which in 1996 was found to have become dewatered and desiccated.[159] Evaluation and maintenance of water levels in the Shapwick Heath Nature Reserve involves the Nature Conservancy Council, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Somerset Levels Project.[160]"

The Willows and Wetlands Visitor Centre near Stoke St Gregory offers tours of the willow yards and basket workshops and explains the place of willow in the history of the Levels. The Somerset Willow Company also allows visitors into its workshops.[128] The Avalon Marshes Centre[171] (formerly known as the Peat Moors Centre) between Westhay and Shapwick, is dedicated to the natural history, biodiversity, archaeology, history, and geology of the area. It also includes reconstructions of some archaeological discoveries of the area, such as a Roman Villa[172] and a Saxon Longhall.[173] The site offers much information on Iron Age finds, round houses, and ancient highways, the Post Track and Sweet Track. From time to time the centre offers events and courses in a number of ancient technologies in subjects including textiles, clothing and basket-making, as well as staging various open days, displays, demonstrations and guided nature excursions. The centre also contains the offices and workshops for the RSPB, Somerset Wildlife Trust, Natural England and The Hawk and Owl Trust for which all have reserves[174][175] close by. In February 2009 Somerset County Council, the owner of the Peat Moors Centre, announced its intention of closing the centre[176][177] and it finally shut on 31 October 2009,[178] but it was reopened as the Avalon Marshes Centre and is in the process of being modernized and improved from the previous set of buildings. The Tribunal in Glastonbury, a medieval merchant's house,[179] contains possessions and works of art from the Glastonbury Lake Village, which were preserved in almost perfect condition in the peat after the village was abandoned.[180] It also houses the tourist information centre.[181] Also in Glastonbury, the Somerset Rural Life Museum is a museum of the social and agricultural history of Somerset, housed in buildings surrounding a 14th-century barn once belonging to Glastonbury Abbey. It was used as a tithe barn[182] for the storage of arable produce, particularly wheat and rye, from the abbey's home farm of approximately 524 acres (2.12\u00a0km2). Threshing and winnowing would also have been carried out in the barn. The barn was built from local shelly limestone, with thick timbers supporting the stone tiling of the roof. It has been designated by English Heritage as a grade I listed building, and is a Scheduled monument.[183] The barn and courtyard contain displays of farm machinery from the Victorian and early 20th century periods. Other exhibits show local crafts, including willow coppicing, mud horse fishing on the flats of Bridgwater Bay, peat digging on the Somerset Levels and the production of milk, cheese, and cider. In reconstructed rooms detailing domestic life in the nearby village of Butleigh, the story of one farm worker, John Hodges, is told from cradle to grave. Outside, there is a beehive and rare breeds of poultry and sheep in the cider apple orchard.[184] The Langport & River Parrett Visitor Centre at Langport details local life, history, and wildlife.[185] The Westonzoyland Pumping Station Museum, near the town on the River Parrett, is housed in one of the earliest steam-powered pumping stations on the Levels, dating from the 1830s; it was closed in the 1950s. Featuring several steam engines, some built locally, the museum holds a number of live steam days each year. The pump house has been Grade II* listed,[186] and is on English Heritage's Heritage at Risk Register.[187]"

It had no official bounds; it ran year-round in 1975, but most tropical cyclones tend to form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean between June and December. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean. Tropical Storms formed in the entire west pacific basin were assigned a name by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. Tropical depressions in this basin have the \"W\" suffix added to their number. Tropical depressions that enter or form in the Philippine area of responsibility are assigned a name by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration or PAGASA. This can often result in the same storm having two names. Some of the notable storms here are Typhoon Nina, which caused the Banqiao Dam flood, which resulted in approximately 126,000 people dead, and Typhoon June, which was the strongest storm on record with a pressure of 875 mbar, until beaten by Typhoon Tip in 1979 with 870 mbar."

Early on November 19, a US Air Force reconnaissance aircraft measured a near record low pressure of 875mb just off the eyewall, indicating it could have been stronger. Shortly after the near-record peak, June then began a eyewall replacement cycle, becoming one of the first recorded cases of triple eyewalls.[5] It then began to slowly weaken as it moved northwest, weakening below category 5 status early on November 21, before beginning to recurve to the northeast as it began extratropical transition, achieving a forward speed as high as 70mph. June finally became extratropical late on November 23. The remnants then became a powerful extratropical storm, with a pressure of 960mb before it was last noted over far northeastern Siberia.[6] Typhoon June never made landfall, but passed 230 miles west of Guam, causing severe flooding.[7]  There were no casualties, but several buildings were destroyed by the strong winds by June, and storm surge and crop damage was estimated at $300,000 (1975 USD).[7]"

It is caused by a change of wind patterns over the region. This change causes heavy rains in the summer and long dry spells over the other months. In India, the monsoon rains can provide 70% of the country's rainfall for the year. The rain fall so quickly and heavily that it can cause sudden flooding. The rationale for the anomalous rainfall in 2018 might have recurred the extreme events in 2019; i.e., the High-Frequency Mixed Rossby-Gravity Waves in the Mid-Troposphere which were triggered by the synoptic disturbances of the tropical Pacific. [7] These high-frequency waves manifested as cyclonic and anticyclonic circulations and dilated the wind field to establish zones of convection in the tropics, as they propagated across the Indian Ocean basin. Although the Madden-Julian Oscillation phase with 20\u201340 days period has favored convection in the tropics, the high-frequency mode correlates better with the anomalous precipitation during the intervals of extreme events.

All 14 districts of the state were placed on red alert.[3][11] According to the Kerala government, one-sixth of the total population of Kerala was directly affected by the floods and related incidents.[12] The Indian government declared it a Level 3 Calamity, or \"calamity of a severe nature\".[13][14] It is the worst flood in Kerala after the great flood of '99 that took place in 1924. Thirty-five[15] out of the fifty-four[16] dams within the state were opened for the first time in history. All five overflow gates of the Idukki Dam were opened at the same time, and for the first time in 26 years, five gates of the Malampuzha dam of Palakkad were opened.[17] Heavy rains in Wayanad and Idukki caused severe landslides and had left the hilly districts isolated.[18][12] The situation was regularly monitored by the National Crisis Management Committee, which also coordinated the rescue and relief operations. The dam openings disrupted many of those living nearby.[19] With the recurrence of flood events in the state in the subsequent years, several studies have attempted to explain the behavior."

        "content": "Rainfall from the southwest monsoon was 23% higher than normal in Kerala in 2018, with August seeing rainfall 96% above normal.[20] On the evening of 8 August, Kerala received heavy rainfall which was 116% more than usual[clarification needed], resulting in dams filling to their maximum capacities. In the proceeding 48 hours, the state received 310\u00a0mm (12\u00a0in) of rain. Almost all dams had been opened since the water had risen close to overflow levels due to heavy rainfall, which flooded local low-lying areas.[21][22] For the first time in the state's history, 35[15] of its 54[16] dams had been opened. The deluge is considered an impact of global warming.[23][24] Independent scientific studies conducted by hydrology experts from IIT Madras, Purdue University, and IIT Gandhinagar concluded that heavy downpour and dam management resulted in the floods.[25][26][27] Based on a computer simulation of flood storage and flow patterns by a team of researchers from IIT Madras and Purdue University, it was found that the devastation wrought by the floods cannot be attributed to the release of water from dams. Further, the scientists added that the odds of such floods were 0.06% and no reservoir management could have considered such scenarios.[26] A hydrology expert from IIT Gandhinagar, Vimal Mishra, identified four major factors for the floods: unexpected above-normal downpour, extreme rainfall events occurring almost across Kerala during the season, over 90% reservoir storage even before the onset of extreme rainfall events, and the unprecedented extreme rainfall in the catchment areas of major reservoirs in the state.[27] The prime reason for the anomalous rainfall in 2018 is the high-frequency mixed Rossby-gravity waves in the mid-troposphere triggered by the synoptic disturbances of the tropical Pacific.[28][24] These high-frequency waves manifested as cyclonic and anticyclonic circulations and dilated the wind field to establish zones of convection in the tropics, as they propagated across the Indian Ocean basin. Although the Madden-Julian Oscillation phase with 20-to-40-day period has favored convection in the tropics, the high-frequency mode correlates better with the anomalous precipitation during the intervals of extreme events.[28][24] Expert bodies like the Central Water Commission have corroborated the findings by scientists from IIT Madras, Purdue University and IIT Gandhinagar.[29][30][31] A report by Adv. Jacob P. Alex, an advisor appointed by the Kerala high court, alleged that the devastating floods of 2018 were the result of bad dam management by the state government.[32][33][34][35] All 79 dams in the state were maintained with the objective to generate hydroelectricity or irrigation and controlling flooding wasn't their purpose. \"The major concern of the dam operators was to maximise reservoir levels, which conflicted with the flood control purpose for which the dams could be utilised. The 'flood cushion' of reservoirs \u2013 the storage space earmarked in dams to absorb unanticipated high flows \u2013 needed review as per the latest guidelines,\" Alex wrote in his report. \"Sudden release of water simultaneously from different reservoirs, during extreme rainfall aggravated the damage,\" it said, adding that various alerts\u2014blue, orange and red\u2014had been issued not in accordance with the EAP guideline. \"No proper follow-up action and effective precautionary steps (especially for evacuating people and accommodating them in safe location) were taken after issuance of Red Alert,\" it said. As of August\u00a02024[update], the high court of Kerala had not accepted the report.[36] The government of Kerala argued in the Supreme Court that the sudden release of water from the Mullaperiyar Dam by the Tamil Nadu government was one of the reasons for the devastating flood in Kerala.[12] The Tamil Nadu government rejected the argument, saying that Kerala suffered the deluge due to the discharge of excess water from 80 reservoirs across Kerala, spurred by heavy rains from within the state; It also argued that the flood surplus from the Idukki dam was due mainly to the flows generated from its own independent catchment due to unprecedented heavy rainfall, while the discharge from the Mullaperiyar dam was significantly less.[37][38]"

This was almost of the same order as that of rainfall of Devikulam which occurred during 16\u201318 July 1924. Assuming a runoff coefficient of 0.75, the runoff generated by 3 days of intense rainfall was estimated to be 12057 MCM for the entire state of Kerala. This huge runoff was beyond the carrying capacity of most of the rivers in Kerala, resulting in bank overflows from most of the rivers.[162] The total catchment area tapped by dams in Kerala, excluding barrages is about 6,610\u00a0km2 (2,552\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). The runoff generated from the catchment tapped by these dams during the period 15\u201317 August 2018 was estimated at 2.19 BCM, out of a total runoff of 12 BCM for the whole of Kerala. As per the study, with a total live storage in the state of 5.8 BCM and assuming a live storage availability of 20% on 14 August 2018, the extent of available flood moderation would have only been 1.16 BCM against an estimated inflow of 2.19 BCM. It was therefore essential to make releases from the reservoirs.[163] The study stated that the dams in Kerala neither added to the flood nor helped in reduction of flood, as most of the dams were already at or very close to FRL on 14 August 2018. Even if the reservoirs had been a few feet below FL, the flooding conditions would not have changed much as the heavy rainfall continued for 3\u20134 days. It would have been necessary to release water from the reservoirs after the first day of heavy rainfall.[162] The study concluded it would be necessary to review the rule curves of all reservoirs in Kerala, especially those with a live storage capacity of more than 200 MCM. This would help to create a dynamic flood cushion for moderating floods.[162]"

Water level in wells, ponds and rivers recorded lowest levels and some wells even collapsed.[164][165] Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan directed the state council for Science, Technology & Environment to carry out studies on the phenomenon after floods across the state, and suggest possible solutions to the problem.[166][167] A.B. Anita, executive director of the Centre for Water Resource Development Management (CWRDM), an autonomous research institution under the State government, said heavy run-off of the top soil in the upland areas and the siltation in the rivers were the reasons for the falling water level.[168] The top soil in the hills and upland areas were removed in the flash floods to a depth of up to two metres in many places. As the top soil was shaved off, it ruined the hills' capacity to sponge in rainwater, she said. Ms. Anita cited ecological destruction caused by deforestation, harmful land use in the upland areas and sand mining in the streams and rivers as having contributed to the top soil run-off and siltation. This was exacerbated by the impact of climate change at the macro level. Echoing her views, experts at the National Institute of Technology, Calicut, (NIT-C) said it was usual for the water level in the rivers and domestic wells to fall after fluvial floods. \"Normally, a river flows through the sand of its own bearing till the mouth. However, this time the discharge has been full, taking the sand and the rocks in the youth-stage along with the floods. So the water level in the rivers comes down. And when the river water level is reduced, the groundwater table also does not get replenished since the rivers and groundwater table are connected,\" said K.

        "content": " Severe Tropical Cyclone Raja was a tropical cyclone that holds the 24-hour rainfall record of 674.9\u00a0mm (26.57\u00a0in) for the French Overseas Territory of Wallis and Futuna. The system was first noted by the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) as a weak tropical disturbance northeast of Tokelau in mid-December 1986. The system developed further as it moved southwest over the next few days, and it was classified as Tropical Cyclone Raja on 23 December. The newly named system slowed and unexpectedly recurved southeast towards the French territory of Wallis and Futuna on 24 December. Over the next two days, Raja interacted with what would become Severe Cyclone Sally and executed a tight loop, passing within 55\u00a0km (35\u00a0mi) of Futuna. The system peaked as a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone on 28 December, with estimated 10-minute sustained winds of 90\u00a0mph (150\u00a0km/h). The storm turned southwest the next day and threatened Fiji, where it passed within 20\u00a0km (10\u00a0mi) of Vanua Levu and near (or over) several smaller islands in the Lau group during the following day. Raja gradually weakened over the next few days as it moved south of Fiji; it was last noted on 5 January 1987 after it filled up over the north Tasman Sea. Raja caused one death as it impacted the island nations of Tuvalu, Wallis and Futuna, Tonga and Fiji. Gusty winds and rough seas associated with the system caused extensive damage to crops, coastal installations and buildings in Tuvalu, and flooded low-lying areas. The island of Futuna was the worst hit, with crops, coastal installations and buildings damaged or destroyed by the system. Raja affected the main islands of Fiji twice between 24 and 30 December, and was responsible for the worst flood of the Labasa River since 1929. As a result of the damage to Fiji and portions of Polynesia, the name Raja was retired from the South Pacific naming lists."

        "content": "The South Pacific convergence zone was active in the middle of December 1986, with a mid-latitude upper-level trough of low pressure which extended into the tropics.[1] A westerly wind burst between Tokelau and Kanton Island resulted in a tropical disturbance developing to the northeast of Tokelau.[1] The Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) began to monitor the disturbance as a shallow tropical depression on 21 December, when the system was about 280\u00a0km (175\u00a0mi) east of the island of Funafuti, Tuvalu.[nb 1][3][4] At that time, the system was beyond the range of any reporting stations; its circulation was weak and ill-defined, which meant that there was considerable uncertainty about the location of its center.[3] The depression moved southwest and passed near the Tuvaluan atoll of Nukufetau, as it slowly deepened and organised over the next 36 hours.[3] After the system was named Tropical Cyclone Raja by the FMS on 23 December; the United States Naval Western Oceanography Center (NWOC) initiated advisories on the system and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 04P.[nb 2][5][6] During that day, the system slowed as it approached Rotuma; the subtropical ridge of high pressure weakened, and widespread falling pressure was recorded across the Pacific.[1][3] Raja then unexpectedly re-curved southeast and began moving towards the French territory of Wallis and Futuna on 24 December.[1][3] Satellite imagery the next day indicated that the system had developed an eye, and it passed within 55\u00a0km (35\u00a0mi) of Futuna.[3][7] Raja reached hurricane strength on 26 December, as it slowed and began to interact with what would become Severe Tropical Cyclone Sally.[1][8] Over the next two days, Raja approached to within 1,110\u00a0km (690\u00a0mi) of Sally in an anticlockwise cyclonic loop as it continued to intensify.[9] The system also passed about 110\u00a0km (70\u00a0mi) southeast of Futuna, as it re-curved east and began to threaten Fiji.[3][7] The FMS estimated on 28 December that Raja had peaked with 10-minute sustained winds of 90\u00a0mph (150\u00a0km/h), which made it a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale.[4] The system turned southwest that day, in response to a trough of low pressure developing over (and south of) Raja and Sally.[1][3] It passed within 20\u00a0km (10\u00a0mi) of Cikobia and Udu Point on Vanua Levu on 29 December, before it passed over or near several smaller Fijian islands in the Lau Group while beginning to turn south.[3] The NWOC estimated that Raja had peaked in intensity at this time with one-minute sustained wind speeds of 105\u00a0mph (165\u00a0km/h), which made it equivalent to a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale.[4] Over the next few days, Raja gradually weakened as it moved over cooler waters south of Fiji and its outflow became restricted before it degenerated into a depression during 1 January.[3] The depression subsequently passed under a subtropical jet and moved west, where it became part of a blocking pattern over New Zealand.[1] The system was last noted on 5 January, after filling over the north Tasman Sea.[1]"

However, its strong, gusty winds and high seas caused extensive damage to crops, coastal installations and buildings and flooded low-lying areas on the island nation.[3][10] Raja was expected to begin moving southeast after it passed near Rotuma on 24 December, which prompted the FMS to issue a tropical cyclone alert for the Tongan islands of Niuafo\u02bbou and Keppel.[3] Gale warnings were issued on 25 December for the two islands and remained in place until 28 December, when the system had turned southwest and moved well away from the islands.[3] A tropical cyclone alert was issued for the islands of southern Tonga on 29 December, when the possibility arose that Raja would turn southeast and affect central and southern Tonga.[3] A gale warning was subsequently issued for Tongatapu and the Nomuka group of islands before all warnings for Tonga were cancelled on 30 December.[3]"

The storm made landfall in Corsica on 29 October with powerful wind gusts in excess of 189\u00a0km/h (117\u00a0mph), winds the equivalent of a Category 3 hurricane. The storm made landfall along the French Riviera later that day, bringing high winds, heavy rain, thunderstorms and a severe storm surge along the south coast of France, causing coastal erosion in Nice.[8][9] The storm's weather front brought similar problems to northern Italy and the Adriatic coast. Throughout Italy, 11 fatalities were reported. The storm damaged the Basilica of San Marco and left 75% of Venice underwater,[10] but it also caused devastating damage to the Alpine forests south of the Dolomites. Additionally, as Storm Adrian pulled north, Central France experienced a winter storm with snowfall totals in excess of 50\u00a0cm (20\u00a0in) in higher elevations.

Cool Canadian air clashed with large quantities of warm moist air from the Gulf, producing torrential rains along a stationary front.  5 deaths across the central United States were attributed to the resulting flooding.[1][2][3]  Seven Minnesota counties,[4] eight Ohio counties,[5] fourteen counties in Wisconsin,[6] and seven counties in Illinois were declared Federal Disaster Areas.[7][8]"

        "content": "On Saturday, August 18, a warm front pushed northward into Iowa and Illinois, where it became stationary.  Warm, moist air pushing over the frontal boundary fueled showers and thunderstorms that moved in a west-to-east fashion, training over the same areas for hours at a time.  Some parts of Minnesota, Wisconsin and Iowa saw moderate to heavy rain for nearly a full day before the activity finally cleared out.  Additional thunderstorms formed over these areas on Sunday, August 19, exacerbating the flooding problems.[9] Tropical Storm Erin had pushed into the coast of Texas on August 15, and by August 18 had stalled over Oklahoma.  Though the remnants of Erin did not directly impact the flooding in these areas, moisture from Erin streamed northward, enhancing the thunderstorm activity for two to three days.[10] The stationary front and associated energy then extended eastward through Illinois, Indiana and Ohio on August 19 and August 20.  Similarly, the front was the focus for thunderstorm development, and the precipitation continued moving over the same areas, leading to extended periods of heavy rainfall.  Approximately 1,000,000 homes lost electricity due to the storms.[1] Runoff from the heavy rain also caused river flooding to the south of the affected areas.  The Rock River near Joslin, Illinois peaked at 17.11\u00a0feet, 5.11 feet (1.56\u00a0m) above flood stage.[11]  Moderate flooding was also reported on the Mississippi River from the Quad Cities to St. Louis, Missouri."

On August 7, Rockford was hit by five to seven inches (127\u2013178\u00a0mm) of rain. Many streets, including main thoroughfares, were flooded. There was also fear that the Alpine Dam might break.[13][14] The following day, Governor Rod Blagojevich declared both Rockford and Winnebago County a state disaster area. With this declaration, he dispatched both the Illinois Emergency Management Agency and the Illinois Department of Natural Resources to assist the city. Debris removal, law enforcement, damage assessment, and other physical assistance were offered by the governor.[14] Two weeks later on August 23, violent storms rolled through most of the Chicago metropolitan area. Tornado warnings were issued during the first round of storms, which produced wind gusts as high as 80\u00a0miles per hour\u00a0(130\u00a0km/h); the highest being reported in Manhattan.[15] A small tornado was reported in Bolingbrook in a DuPage County Forest Preserve. The storms shut down airports (including O'Hare International Airport and Midway International Airport), uprooted trees and left over 600,000 residents in northern Illinois without power, some for several days.[16] The storms also caused flooding on streets and major expressways such as the Bishop Ford Freeway. Rainfall totals in Boone and LaSalle Counties topped 1987 records.[17] Governor Rod Blagojevich declared McHenry, Lake, Cook (including Chicago), DuPage, and Kane counties to be disaster areas after the storm. Flooding across northern Illinois was widespread in the aftermath of the storms. Along the Rock River in Byron, the river reached moderate flood stage on August 24; moderate stage is above 14\u00a0feet\u00a0(4\u00a0m).[18] Officials in Ogle County recommended that people in low-lying areas along the Rock River, and along Killbuck Creek near Lindenwood, evacuate to higher ground.[17] Downstream, in Lee County at Dixon, the river had not reached flood stage as off August 25, though it continued to rise.[19] Though not affected by flooding as it was on August 7, the city of Rockford received 1.23\u00a0inches\u00a0(31\u00a0mm) of rain, setting an all-time record for Rockford's wettest month in recorded climate data history, with a total of 13.82\u00a0inches\u00a0(351\u00a0mm) of rain.[20] Other rivers and streams in the Rock River valley experienced moderate to major flooding as well. The Kishwaukee River at Perryville crested at 17.57\u00a0feet\u00a0(5.36\u00a0m), more than five feet above flood stage. The same river also rose above flood stage in Belvidere.[21] After 4.85\u00a0inches\u00a0(123\u00a0mm) of rain fell on August 23 and 24 in DeKalb County, at DeKalb, the South Branch Kishwaukee River rose to its highest level since 1983 and its second highest level in recorded history.[22] Numerous roads and bridges were closed, and the cities of DeKalb and Sycamore declared local emergencies, though DeKalb County was not included in Blagojevich's initial disaster declaration.[22] DeKalb County received state disaster area designation from Blagojevich on August 26.[23] In DeKalb and Sycamore, about 600 residents were displaced from their homes, and the DeKalb campus of Northern Illinois University was closed because of the flood.[24] The Fox River at Dayton crested after it rose to more than 17\u00a0feet\u00a0(5\u00a0m), over five feet above the river's flood stage.[25] In Plano, Illinois the Fox rose up around the historic Farnsworth House, a modern architecture masterpiece designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. Preservationists used a boat to save the home and its furnishings, which previously had been devastated by high water in 1996.[26] With the boat, preservationists were able to enter the house and move vulnerable furnishings to higher locations within the home. Water rose to within a foot of the Farnsworth House's raised platform, covering the terrace in front of the home, but the river crested before any damage occurred.[27] At Starved Rock State Park, parking lots were closed due to the level of the Illinois River, which stood at 26.5\u00a0feet on August 25, 6.5\u00a0feet\u00a0(2\u00a0m) above its flood stage.[28] Governor Blagojevich estimated total flood damages could cost nine Illinois counties and the state more than $22.8\u00a0million, and the state requested federal assistance.[29] On September 25, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) announced that federal disaster aid was available for the state of Illinois to assist with recovery from the August storms.[30] The disaster aid was made available when President George W. Bush declared DeKalb, Grundy, Kane, LaSalle, Lake, and Will Counties, in northern Illinois, \"major disaster\" areas.[8] The federal funding made individual assistance available to flood victims in Lake, Will and Grundy Counties, and individual and public assistance available to those in DeKalb, Kane and LaSalle Counties.[31]"

Twenty-four-hour rainfall totals of 15.10\u00a0inches\u00a0(384\u00a0mm) were recorded in Hokah, which easily broke the old state record of 10.84\u00a0inches\u00a0(275\u00a0mm).  An unofficial twenty-four-hour total of over 17\u00a0inches\u00a0(432\u00a0mm) was recorded near Caledonia.  During the entire weekend rainfall event, parts or all of 28 counties in Minnesota received at least 4\u00a0inches\u00a0(102\u00a0mm) of rain.  The highest total for the entire event was 18.17\u00a0inches\u00a0(462\u00a0mm) near La Crescent.[36] Southeast Minnesota and southwestern Wisconsin are in the Driftless Area, which was not covered by the last glaciation, and therefore is not covered by deep layers of glacial till.  The soils therefore are thin and less able to retain water; they lie atop porous rock into and through which surface waters can rapidly drain into the water table.[37]  The highly dissected topography, characterized by steep hills and bluffs and deep coulees, gives steep gradients to the drainage and makes streams highly erosive.  As the rains far exceeded the absorption rate  of 1.5\u00a0inches (3.8\u00a0cm) in six hours, flash floods rapidly overflowed the water courses and spread across the valley floors.[38][39]  The towns of Stockton, Houston, Elba, Minnesota City, and portions of Winona, on the Mississippi River, were evacuated. Citizens were moved to Saint Mary's University in Winona, Lewiston, and Caledonia, Minnesota. Massive bluffs gave way in Brownsville and several homes were completely washed away. Governor Tim Pawlenty ordered 240 National Guard soldiers to help and declared a state of emergency in six counties. The Minnesota Army National Guard soldiers guarded communities that were cleared out after the flooding early August 19. The Army Corps of Engineers opened up the floodgates on the rising Root River to release some of the water creating pressure on the dike in Houston.[40] High flood waters on the Middle Branch of the Whitewater River, which runs through Whitewater State Park, destroyed three bridges and damaged campgrounds, bathhouses, a group dining hall, and water and sewer systems in the park. About 500 campers were staying in Whitewater State Park at the time.[41] The park was closed to the public on August 20, 2007, for an indefinite period of time.[42] E. coli bacteria were found in the Rushford's water supply, and residents were urged not to use it until the city's water system could be flushed.[43] Amtrak train service between Minneapolis and La Crosse, Wisconsin was shut down for a week because of damage to the tracks.  Passengers were bussed between the two until repairs could be made.[44] The passenger rail line resumed service on August 27.[1] State Senator Sharon Erickson Ropes stated after initial flooding, \"This is the worst disaster that's hit southeast Minnesota in a lifetime.\"[45] Four thousand two hundred homes were damaged or destroyed in the state, and seven deaths were reported.[2]  It is estimated that there has been $67\u00a0million in damage.[46] Dodge, Fillmore, Houston, Olmsted, Steele, Wabasha, and Winona counties were declared federal disaster areas.[4]"

Bucyrus received 9\u00a0inches\u00a0(229\u00a0mm) of rain, and several hundred people were evacuated from their homes in Crawford County.[2][47][48]  The river also reached  8.7\u00a0feet\u00a0(3\u00a0m) above flood level in Ottawa, Ohio.[49] Ottawa's Main Street (U.S Route 224) was fully flooded, as were homes and churches for blocks around. Between Findlay and Ottawa, Route 224 was washed out in several spots.[48] The fire department in Ottawa rescued dozens of people from their deluged homes by boat.[48] Northwest Ohio's most serious flooding was along the Blanchard, though other rivers, including the Auglaize, Tiffin, Portage, and Sandusky, all experienced some level of flooding.[48] The cities of Bellevue and Shelby also had severe flooding that forced residents from their homes.

A passenger on the bus was killed, and the driver was injured, both having been shocked after coming out of the bus to help.[53] Before this torrential rain and flooding event, much of the state was in a moderate to severe drought that had persisted until mid-August. Although the southern half of the state received abundant precipitation, an upper-level high pressure ridge centered in Quebec caused a cut-off of precipitation to the north, leaving much of northern Wisconsin and Upper Michigan with continued drought conditions.[54]"

Two storm events (Nicole and Oratia) 28 October to 3 November, and the storm Rebekka from 4 November, resulted in continuous flooding.[10][11] 10,000 homes were flooded in 700 locations.[4] Peak flows on the Rivers Thames, Trent, Severn, Wharfe and Dee were the highest for 60 years. The River Ouse in Yorkshire reached the highest level since the 17th century.[4] In the United Kingdom a series of severe floods affected large parts of the country in the Autumn of 2000. The worst affected areas were Kent and Sussex during October and Shropshire, Worcestershire and Yorkshire in November. The Autumn of 2000 was the wettest on record in the England and Wales precipitation record with several major rainfall events causing flooding in different parts of the country during October and November. England and Wales had an average of 503\u00a0mm of rain from September\u2013November exceeding the previous record by nearly 50\u00a0mm.[12]"

The resulting report entitled Learning to Live with Rivers specifically criticised a reluctance to use computer models and inadequate representation of the dynamic effects of land use, catchment processes and climatic variability. More broadly, the report noted that sustainable flood risk management could only be achieved by working with the natural response of the river basin and by providing the necessary storage, flow reduction and discharge capacity. It concluded that floods can only be managed, not prevented, and the community must learn to live with rivers. The report found that damage was reduced by flood defences and by timely warnings and evacuations where the defences could not hold back the water. As a result, 280,000 properties were protected from the floods, but over 10,000 properties were still flooded at an estimated cost of \u00a31 billion."

There are two main seas in the North Indian Ocean\u00a0\u2013 the Bay of Bengal to the east of the Indian subcontinent and the Arabian Sea to the west. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) issued advisories for the systems in its official capacity as the local Regional Specialized Meteorological Center, while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center also issued advisories for two of the storms on an unofficial basis. Of the five disturbances tracked by the IMD, two intensified into cyclonic storms. There were no storms before June, and during that month, a deep depression formed off the east coast of India. It brought flooding rains as it moved through Bangladesh and dissipated over northeastern India. The depression struck in the midst of ongoing floods, which were responsible for 200\u00a0deaths in the country in June 1993. The next depression \u2013 the only to originate over the Arabian Sea in the season \u2013 formed on November\u00a08 and moved toward southern India. The system killed 35\u00a0people before weakening and turning to the northwest. It re-intensified into a very severe cyclonic storm, but weakened just off the coast of Pakistan due to wind shear. The storm killed 609\u00a0people in the country due to flooding. The final two depressions had their origins from the western Pacific basin. In late November, a convective system crossed the Malay Peninsula and developed into an intense tropical cyclone, reaching estimated peak winds of 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph) on December\u00a04. While at peak intensity, the cyclone moved ashore southern India near Karaikal, causing widespread damage estimated at US$216\u00a0million (1993\u00a0USD). The storm killed 70\u00a0people and displaced at least 68,000\u00a0people. The final depression was the reformation of Typhoon Manny.

Warnings and advisories were broadcast throughout India by telegraph and news media.[2] The basin's activity is sub-divided between the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal on opposite coasts of India, and is generally split before and after the monsoon season.[1] Storms were also tracked on an unofficial basis by the American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC).[3] During the year, the IMD tracked five tropical disturbances, one of which reformed into a very severe cyclonic storm. Significantly lower than the average of 15\u00a0disturbances per year, this made the 1993 season the quietest on record, with two fewer disturbances than the seven that developed in the 1984 season.[2] The inactivity followed the record active 1992 season. The JTWC tracked two tropical cyclones in the basin, the fewest since also tracking two in the 1980 season.[3] There were no tropical disturbances before the onset of the monsoon season in May, only the eighth time since 1891 for such an occurrence. For the first time since 1891, there was only one system that developed during the monsoon season. There were 14\u00a0non-developing low-pressure areas around India that contributed to normal amounts of rainfall for the country. One storm in the year formed in the Arabian Sea in 1993.

The structure was akin to a monsoon depression, as the circulation was broad, and the strongest winds were away from the center. Moving northeastward, the depression made landfall near the border of India and Bangladesh around 09:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a017. As it progressed into Bangladesh, the system intensified further into a deep depression, with maximum sustained winds estimated at 55\u00a0km/h (35\u00a0mph) by the IMD. In southeastern Bangladesh, a station in Chittagong recorded slightly higher sustained winds of 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph). The deep depression weakened as it reached northern Bangladesh, dissipating over Assam in eastern India on June\u00a019.[2][4] In Bangladesh, the depression struck in the midst of ongoing floods that began earlier in June. This resulted in additional rainfall, floods, and landslides. Around 103,000\u00a0houses were damaged or destroyed, leaving 50,000\u00a0people homeless. The floods also washed away bridges and railroad tracks, and damaged 5,002\u00a0km (3,108\u00a0mi) of roads. Transport links connecting flooded areas to the capital city Dhaka were restored within a few days. Rivers exceeded their banks, isolating tens of thousands of people in northeastern Bangladesh.[2][5] Storm flooding killed 200\u00a0people in the country throughout June.[6] In response to the flooding, the Bangladesh government worked in tandem with non-government organizations to provide food, medicine, and financial assistance to storm victims. The system enhanced the monsoon in eastern India, resulting in heavy rainfall and floods.[2] The Puthimari River, a tributary of the Brahmaputra River in Assam, reached 4.65\u00a0m (15.3\u00a0ft) above dangerous water levels.[7]"

On November\u00a08, the IMD classified the storm as a depression, giving it the identifier ARB 01. The depression moved northeastward toward southern India, moving ashore near Thoothukudi on November\u00a09, and soon degenerated into a remnant low-pressure area. The remnant low of the storm turned back to the northwest and re-emerged into the Arabian Sea. On November\u00a012, it re-intensified into a depression, after convection increased over the center, and the IMD gave the storm a new identifier, ARB 02. Later that day, the JTWC classified the system as Tropical Cyclone 01A. As the storm turned to the north and northeast, it intensified further, based on observations from two ships. The IMD upgraded it to a very severe cyclonic storm on November\u00a014, estimating peak winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph). The JTWC estimated higher wind speeds of 150\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph). Wind shear from the westerlies displaced the convection, which continued ahead of the circulation. The center of the storm slowed and turned to the southeast as the winds quickly diminished. By November\u00a016, the system weakened into a remnant low-pressure area off the coast of Gujarat and Sindh.[3][2] In southern India, the depression killed 35\u00a0people. The cyclone dropped heavy rainfall in western India, reaching 170\u00a0mm (6.7\u00a0in) in Bhuj, Gujarat.[2] Officials issued storm warnings for Karachi, Pakistan, in anticipation that the cyclone would continue on its trajectory and move inland.[8] The cyclone brought rainfall to widespread areas in southern Sindh province,[9] along with gusty winds, causing power outages and flooding in low-lying areas of the Karachi metropolis. High seas flooded the port of Keti Bandar, forcing residents to seek higher grounds. A fishing boat capsized off the southeast coast of Pakistan; ten of the crew were rescued, but two fishermen drowned.[10] In Thatta and Badin districts, storm flooding killed 609\u00a0people and displaced around 200,000\u00a0others.[11]"

A ridge to the north steered the convective system westward across the Malay Peninsula. The system entered the eastern Bay of Bengal on November\u00a029, and convection increased further in conjunction with a weak circulation. The JTWC classified the system as Tropical Cyclone 02B on November\u00a030, and the IMD designated it as a depression a day later. The storm gradually intensified while moving west-northwestward toward southeastern India, developing an eye in the center of the convection. On December\u00a04 between 04:00\u201305:00\u00a0UTC, the cyclone made landfall near the city of Karaikal, which recorded gusts of 198\u00a0km/h (123\u00a0mph) during the storm's passage. The IMD estimated peak winds of 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph), higher than the JTWC wind estimate of 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph). The storm rapidly weakened over land to depression intensity, and the IMD stopped tracking the system late on December\u00a04. The JTWC tracked the system into the Arabian Sea on December\u00a05, where the circulation dissipated shortly thereafter.[3][2] Along the northwest coast of Sri Lanka, the cyclone's flow produced a .5\u00a0m (1.6\u00a0ft) storm surge.[12] The IMD issued hourly warnings for southern India in advance of the cyclone, through electronic and print media. Around 40,000\u00a0people evacuated their houses near the coast.[2] Across southern India, the cyclone killed 70\u00a0people and left US$216\u00a0million in damage (1993\u00a0USD).[13][14] Heavy rainfall reached over 300\u00a0mm (12\u00a0in) in southern Andhra Pradesh,[2] causing landslides and flooding. The Sathanur Dam exceeded its capacity, forcing hundreds of people to leave their homes in Pondicherry.[13] A 3 to 4\u00a0m (9.8 to 13.1\u00a0ft) storm surge flooded 60\u00a0coastal villages, and waters reached 22\u00a0km (14\u00a0mi) inland. Around 12,000\u00a0people had to be rescued from inaccessible areas after the cyclone struck.[2][13] Train service was halted in and out of Chennai.[14] Roadways across Tamil Nadu were damaged or blocked by fallen trees, after high winds uprooted hundreds of trees and snapped power lines.[15] Hundreds of thousands of people in southern India were left without power or water service. The cyclone also damaged over 44,000\u00a0houses, of which 20,000 were in Pondicherry alone, where about 68,000\u00a0people were displaced. Knee-deep waters ruined 41,520\u00a0ha (102,600 acres) of crop fields.[14] After the storm, local governments worked to restore power lines and damaged roads,[16] while also providing food and fuel to affected residents.[15]"

Tropical Storm Arlene formed near Honduras on June 8 and moved northwards. It crossed western Cuba on June 10 and strengthened to just under hurricane strength before making its final landfall on the Florida Panhandle the next day. The storm weakened as it continued to move north over the United States, becoming extratropical on June 13. Arlene was responsible for two deaths and minor damage."

        "content": "Tropical Storm Arlene seemingly originated from the interaction between two tropical waves and the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) over the western Caribbean in early June 2005. The ITCZ, initially focused over Central America in the first days of the month, became more convective when the first wave arrived on June\u00a05\u20136. Two days later, a stronger tropical wave moved through the western Caribbean, triggering pressure drops and the expansion of thunderstorm activity. The establishment of an upper-level ridge over this disturbance on June\u00a08 led to a reduction in wind shear. The system became increasingly organized and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) marked the formation of Tropical Depression One at 18:00\u00a0UTC with the cyclone's center situated northeast of Honduras.[1] Hurricane Hunters investigating the system observed a poorly organized albeit closed circulation at this time with the strongest winds displaced to the north and east within banding features. The lopsided structure was the result of an upper-level trough over the Gulf of Mexico. Weak steering currents pushed the system along a slow northward trajectory.[2] Early on June\u00a09, notably deep convection organized into curved bands and signaled the system's intensification into a tropical storm by 06:00\u00a0UTC while situated 175\u00a0mi (282\u00a0km) west-southwest of the Cayman Islands. At this time, the NHC assigned the name Arlene to the cyclone.[1] The depression began to move northward toward western Cuba later that day, but as it was a very large and poorly organized system under the influence of high wind shear, the official forecasts from the National Hurricane Center emphasized that the route the storm would take was uncertain.[3] Despite this uncertainty, the official forecasts were highly accurate in predicting the storm's track. As the shear dropped, the depression strengthened further and it became Tropical Storm Arlene on June 9. It produced precipitation over a very wide area; the Cayman Islands reported tropical storm-force winds and heavy rain over 150 statute miles (240\u00a0km) east of the center. Arlene crossed the western tip of Cuba on the morning of June 10 with 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) winds. Tropical Storm Arlene had an unusual structure throughout its life, with a large circulation containing numerous small centers rotating about a larger gyre, as opposed to an inner convective core.[1] Arlene then entered the Gulf of Mexico later that afternoon and strengthened further to its peak strength of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h). The official forecast at this time called for further intensification to minimal hurricane strength.[4] This did not occur however and Arlene instead weakened as result of dry air entering the circulation. The storm made landfall just west of Pensacola, Florida in the afternoon of June 11 as a moderate tropical storm with winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h). As most of the convection of the storm was located north and east of the center, most of the effects of the storm were on land long before it made landfall.[1] Arlene was the most intense landfalling June storm since Hurricane Allison hit the same location as a strong tropical storm during the 1995 season. Arlene weakened into a tropical depression later that day, but managed to persist as a tropical system as it moved north over the United States. The storm finally became extratropical on June 13 just northeast of Flint, Michigan and was absorbed by a larger system the next day.[1]"

One person was killed in the state and another was injured. Some flooding occurred in parts of Campeche City.[7] Upon the formation of Tropical Depression One on June\u00a08, a tropical storm watch was issued for western Cuba and was soon upgraded to a tropical storm warning the next day.[1] On June\u00a09, the Instituto de Meteorolog\u00eda (Cuba)\u00a0[es] stated that western parts of Cuba, particularly Pinar del R\u00edo Province, would see impacts from Arlene.[8] Approximately 50,000 people were evacuated across Cuba in preparation for Arlene.[9] Fishermen were ordered to return to port and secure their vessels.[8] Between June\u00a09 and 10, Tropical Storm Arlene produced heavy rains over western areas of Cuba, leading to school closures in several cities. The area impacted by the rainfall was previously suffering from a severe drought and moisture brought in by Arlene helped alleviate the dry conditions.[10] Tropical storm-force winds buffeted communities in western Cuba, with sustained winds peaking at 47\u00a0mph (76\u00a0km/h) in Punta del Este on Isla de la Juventud. Rainfall reached a maximum of 6.81\u00a0in (173\u00a0mm) in Pinar del R\u00edo on the mainland.[1]"

This turned into a hurricane warning from Pearl River, Louisiana to Indian Pass due to fears of the system strengthening to hurricane strength. The warnings were reduced and were then canceled eight hours after the second landfall.[1] County authorities in parts of Alabama held conferences on June\u00a010 in anticipation of heavy rain from Tropical Storm Arlene. The Elmore County Emergency Management Agency had hundreds of sandbags ready for use.[13] Local officials in Escambia and Santa Rosa counties activated their emergency operations centers on June\u00a010. Transportation department crews were dispatched to clear debris from storm drains and distribute sandbags where necessary.[14] In accordance with a policy passed a week prior, FEMA began strapping down trailers provided for victims of Ivan shortly before the arrival of Arlene.[15] Still recovering from Hurricane Ivan which struck the Gulf Coast in September\u00a02004, construction contractors and residents were forced to hasten home repair efforts in order to secure structures.[16] Approximately 40,000 buildings in the Pensacola Bay area alone were covered by blue roof tarps.[17] State Farm Florida Insurance Spokesman Tom Hagerty advised residents to thoroughly document possessions for potential claims related to Arlene as they would be treated as a separate claim from those related to Ivan.[18] By June\u00a010, homes in and around Pensacola were boarded up with plywood or storm shutters. Gas canisters, tarps, and generators were in high-demand at local stores.[16] Debris from Ivan remained littered across Pensacola Beach, Perdido Key, and Navarre Beach.[15] Florida Governor Jeb Bush issued a state of emergency two days before the storm's final landfall. Recovery teams were also deployed to the area. An evacuation order was issued for all areas south of Gulf Beach Highway, including Pensacola Beach, Perdido Key, and Innerarity Point. Walton County officials issued a voluntary evacuation order for low-lying areas and mobile homes. Walton County also opened a shelter in Freeport, and four shelters and one special needs shelter were opened in Escambia County.[19] Two days prior to landfall, 36 oil platforms and 16 rigs were evacuated.[20] The cumulative production loss caused from the evacuation of the storm totalled 0.109% of the yearly production, approximately 575\u00a0million barrels. The stopped rigs also accounted for 3.87% of the daily production on June 13.[21]"

Damage was limited to snapped tree limbs.[23][24][25] At Fowey Rocks Light, offshore to the east of Key Biscayne, a gust of 55\u00a0mph (89\u00a0km/h) was observed.[22] The only death attributed to Arlene was that of a woman caught in a rip current in Miami Beach, far from the center of circulation.[26] In the Florida Panhandle, the storm dropped heavy rainfall, peaking at 8.51 inches (216\u00a0mm) in Plantation Bay, Florida in Flagler County. Upon making landfall, Arlene caused a storm surge of up to 5 feet (1.5\u00a0m) in Walton County. Moderate beach erosion also occurred. Storm surge and strong waves caused moderate to severe damage to roads along the panhandle. Strong winds caused power outages to 500\u00a0people in Walton, Washington and Bay counties.

The winds downed several trees and power lines, leaving thousands without power for several hours. With the storm following a path similar to Hurricane Ivan just nine months earlier, many trees damaged previously by Ivan were downed completely. In addition, several homes experienced light wind damage. The outer bands of the storm also caused numerous funnel clouds, though no tornadoes were reported.

The effects were generally minimal.[25] In Indiana, the remnants of Arlene dropped heavy rainfall, peaking at 4.44 inches (113\u00a0mm) in Evansville. In Indianapolis, 3.04 inches (77\u00a0mm) fell at the International Airport. Rainfall from the storm was 85% of the typical June rainfall level. Arlene also spawned two tornadoes.

Outer rainbands also developed an F0 tornado just south of Indianapolis, downing a few tree limbs.[25] The remnants of Arlene combined with a non-tropical system caused heavy rainfall across New York, with some locations reporting 6 to 7 inches (150 to 180 millimetres) of precipitation in a 2-hour period. The rainfall collected into streams and rivers, with some officials calling it a 1 in 500\u00a0year flood. Flash flooding caused at least one mudslide and damaged several roads. The flooding forced at least 20 people to evacuate their homes, and numerous houses were damaged. Strong winds also downed trees and power lines, causing scattered power outages.

The seat of Zhouqu County was densely populated, with 50,000 people (42,000 of them are permanent population) in an area of 2 square kilometres (0.77\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[13] After the heavy rain, there was a buildup of water behind a dam of debris blocking a small river to the north of the city of Zhugqu; when the dam broke, around 1,800,000 cubic metres (64,000,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft) of mud and rocks swept through the town, in a surge reported as up to five stories high, covering more than 300 low-rise homes and burying at least one village entirely.[14][15] The mudslide left an area 5 kilometres (3.1\u00a0mi) long by 300 metres (980\u00a0ft) wide in average leveled by mud with average thickness of 5 meters (16\u00a0ft).[16][17] According to Gyurme Dorje's Tibet Handbook, the forest region of Zhugqu has, since the 1950s, \"shrunk by 30% and the reserve of timber reduced by 25% due to overfelling. The sand in the river water has increased by 60%, and the water volume has reduced by 8%, resulting in increased flooding and drought.\" Furthermore, in this county there were between 47 and 53 hydroelectric construction projects in recent years, with 41 completed and 12 approaching deadline, according to government data. These together have caused 749,000 tons of water and soil erosion and over 3,000,000 cubic meters of bulldozed material. In 2006, a Lanzhou University report concluded that these projects have made the whole area a volatile danger-zone.[18][dubious \u2013 discuss] The Christian Science Monitor reported that two science researchers had predicted the mudslides in 1997.[19] The People's Daily has argued that the mudslide was due to a \"perfect storm\" of natural events, including \"soft\" \"weathered\" rock, heavy rainfall, drought, and the Sichuan earthquake two years before.[20] Authorities dismissed claims that the mudslides were \"man-made\".[21]"

Multiple rounds of heavy rain occurred in the subsequent days, primarily in northern Kyushu.[6] On the 3rd of July Typhoon Prapiroon brought heavy rains and winds to southwestern Japan.[7] The surge of moisture brought north by the typhoon interacted with and enhanced precipitation along the front in Kyushu, Shikoku, and western and central Honshu.[6] Enhanced rainfall extended as far west as Okinawa Prefecture.[8] Large swathes of these areas saw 10-day rainfall accumulations in excess of 400\u00a0mm (16\u00a0in).[6] Deadly floods began on 5 July, primarily in Kansai region which was struck by a deadly earthquake three weeks prior.[9] Accumulations peaked at 1,852.5\u00a0mm (72.93\u00a0in) in Shikoku.[6] Multiple areas saw their greatest one-hour and three-day rainfall totals on record.[7] Some areas were hit by more than 1,000\u00a0mm (39\u00a0in) of rain, prompting the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) to issue emergency heavy rain warnings[note 1] for eight prefectures: Okayama, Hiroshima, Tottori, Fukuoka, Saga, Nagasaki, Hyogo, and Kyoto.[10][11] This marked the largest issuance of these warnings since their implementation. An official at the JMA described the event as \"heavy rain at a level we've never experienced\".[10] The torrential rain caused landslides and flash flooding, with water levels reaching 5\u00a0m (16\u00a0ft) in the worst hit areas.[11] Motoyama, K\u014dchi, saw 584\u00a0mm (23.0\u00a0in) of rain between 6 and 7 July.[12] One town in K\u014dchi measured 263\u00a0mm (10.4\u00a0in) of rain in two hours.[13] Mount Ontake observed its greatest three-day rainfall on record at 655.5\u00a0mm (25.81\u00a0in).[7] Although the Yura River remained within its banks in northern Kyoto Prefecture, an embankment built after Typhoon Tokage in 2004 prevented runoff from flowing into the river. This inadvertently led to flooding in Maizuru after the flood gate was closed.[14] As the rain lessened on July 9, high temperatures reaching 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F), coupled with some 11,200 households without electricity, raised concerns over heatstroke and unsafe drinking water.[15] Hiroshima prefecture alone had 1,243 mudslides in 2018, which is more than the entire nation's total in an average year.

Mighty river fleets were built and sailed several times from Jilin City, getting the chieftains of the local tribes to swear allegiance to the Ming rulers.[3] \nSoon after the establishment of the Manchu-led Qing dynasty, the territory of today's Primorsky Kray was put under the administration of Jilin. As the Russian Empire advanced eastward to the Pacific coast, the Qing government ordered a naval shipbuilding factory to be set up here in 1661. Jilin was officially established as a fort city in 1673 when Anzhuhu (\u5b89\u73e0\u745a), the Deputy Lieutenant-General (\u526f\u90fd\u7edf), was ordered to build a castle in Jilin. In 1676, the Military Governor of Ninguta was transferred to Jilin City because of its more convenient location and increasing military importance, while the former Deputy Lieutenant-General was transferred in the opposite direction to Ninguta.[4] Since then Jilin City has developed at a rapid pace. The nickname of Jilin City is River City (\u6c5f\u57ce), which originates from one sentence \"\u8fde\u6a2f\u63a5\u8230\u5c6f\u6c5f\u57ce\" of a poem written by Kangxi Emperor when he was visiting Jilin City in 1682.[citation needed] Jilin retained its importance into the 18th and 19th century as one of the few cities existing beyond the Willow Palisade, along with Qiqihar, Ninguta and Mukden.[citation needed] After Manchukuo established their capital in Xinjing (present-day Changchun), Jilin City's importance decreased. By 1940, Jilin's population was 173,624, while Xinjing's population reached 544,202 at the same time.[5][full citation needed] Soviet forces captured Jilin during the August Storm operation.[6] Jilin became the provincial capital of Jilin Province after the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, until Changchun took this position in 1956."

The explosion severely polluted the Songhua River, with an estimated 100 tons of pollutants containing benzene and nitrobenzene entering into the river.[10] The benzene level recorded was at one point 108 times above national safety levels. This caused downstream major cities including Harbin, Songyuan and Khabarovsk suspending their water supply for almost one week.[11] Chinese leaders later had to apologize to the Russian government over its handling of the incident as the pollutants finally flowed into the Amur (Heilong) River, the major boundary river between China and Russia.[12]"

'long river') is the longest river in Eurasia and the third-longest in the world. It rises at Jari Hill in the Tanggula Mountains of the Tibetan Plateau and flows 6,300\u00a0km (3,915\u00a0mi) in a generally easterly direction to the East China Sea.[8] It is the fifth-largest primary river by discharge volume in the world. Its drainage basin comprises one-fifth of the land area of China, and is home to nearly one-third of the country's population.[9] The Yangtze has played a major role in the history, culture, and economy of China. For thousands of years, the river has been used for water, irrigation, sanitation, transportation, industry, boundary-marking, and war. The Yangtze Delta generates as much as 20% of China's GDP, and the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze is the largest hydro-electric power station in the world that is in use.[10][11] In mid-2014, the Chinese government announced it was building a multi-tier transport network, comprising railways, roads and airports to create a new economic belt alongside the river.[12] The Yangtze flows through a wide array of ecosystems and is habitat to several endemic and threatened species, including the Chinese alligator, the narrow-ridged finless porpoise, and also was the home of the now extinct Yangtze river dolphin (or baiji) and Chinese paddlefish, as well as the Yangtze sturgeon, which is extinct in the wild. In recent years, the river has suffered from industrial pollution, plastic pollution,[13] agricultural runoff, siltation, and loss of wetland and lakes, which exacerbates seasonal flooding. Some sections of the river are now protected as nature reserves. A stretch of the upstream Yangtze flowing through deep gorges in western Yunnan is part of the Three Parallel Rivers of Yunnan Protected Areas, a UNESCO World Heritage Site."

        "content": "Ch\u00e1ng Ji\u0101ng (\u957f\u6c5f; \u9577\u6c5f) or \"Long River\" is the official name for the Yangtze in Mandarin Chinese. However, the Chinese have given different names to the upstream sections of the river up to its confluence with the Min River at Yibin, Sichuan.[14][15] Jinsha River (\"Gold Sands River\") refers to the 2,308\u00a0km (1,434\u00a0mi) of the Yangtze from Yibin upstream to the confluence with the Batang River near Yushu in Qinghai, while the Tongtian River (\"River that leads to Heaven\") describes the 813\u00a0km (505\u00a0mi) section from Yushu up to the confluence of the Tuotuo River and the Dangqu River.[citation needed] In Old Chinese, the Yangtze was simply called Jiang/Kiang \u6c5f,[16] a character of phono-semantic compound origin, combining the water radical \u6c35 with the homophone \u5de5 (now pronounced g\u014dng, but *k\u02e4o\u014b in Old Chinese[17]). Kong was probably a word in the Austroasiatic language of local peoples such as the Yue. Similar to *krong in Proto-Vietnamese and krung in Mon, all meaning \"river\", it is related to modern Vietnamese s\u00f4ng (river) and Khmer krung (city on riverside), whence Thai krung (\u0e01\u0e23\u0e38\u0e07 capital city), not k\u00f4ngkea (water) which is from the Sanskrit root g\u00e1\u1e45g\u0101.[18] By the Han dynasty, Ji\u0101ng had come to mean any river in Chinese, and this river was distinguished as the \"Great River\" \u5927\u6c5f (D\u00e0ji\u0101ng). The epithet \u9577 (simplified version \u957f), meaning \"long\", was first formally applied to the river during the Six Dynasties period.[citation needed] Various sections of the Yangtze have local names. From Yibin to Yichang, the river through Sichuan and Chongqing Municipality is also known as the Chu\u0101n Ji\u0101ng (\u5ddd\u6c5f) or \"Sichuan River\". In Hubei, the river is also called the J\u012bng Ji\u0101ng (\u8346\u6c5f; \u834a\u6c5f) or the \"Jing River\" after Jingzhou, one of the Nine Provinces of ancient China. In Anhui, the river takes on the local name W\u01cen Ji\u0101ng after the shorthand name for Anhui, w\u01cen (\u7696). Y\u00e1ngz\u01d0 Ji\u0101ng (\u63da\u5b50\u6c5f; \u626c\u5b50\u6c5f) or the \"Yangzi River\", from which the English name Yangtze is derived, is the local name for the Lower Yangtze in the region of Yangzhou. The name likely comes from an ancient ferry crossing called Y\u00e1ngz\u01d0 or Y\u00e1ngz\u01d0j\u012bn (\u63da\u5b50 / \u63da\u5b50\u6d25).[19] Europeans who arrived in the Yangtze River Delta region applied this local name to the whole river.[14] The dividing site between upstream and midstream is considered to be at Yichang and that between midstream and downstream at Hukou (Jiujiang).[20]"

        "content": "The river was called Quian (\u6c5f) and Quianshui (\u6c5f\u6c34) by Marco Polo[21] and appeared on the earliest English maps as Kian or Kiam,[22][23] all recording dialects which preserved forms of the Middle Chinese pronunciation of \u6c5f as K\u00e6wng.[16] By the mid-19th century, these romanizations had standardized as Kiang; Dajiang, e.g., was rendered as \"Ta-Kiang.\" \"Keeang-Koo,\"[24] \"Kyang Kew,\"[25] \"Kian-ku,\"[26] and related names derived from mistaking the Chinese term for the mouth of the Yangtze (\u6c5f\u53e3, p\u00a0Ji\u0101ngk\u01d2u) as the name of the river itself. The name Blue River began to be applied in the 18th century,[22] apparently owing to a former name of the Dam Chu[28] or Min[30] and to analogy with the Yellow River,[31][32] but it was frequently explained in early English references as a 'translation' of Jiang,[33][34] Jiangkou,[24] or Yangzijiang.[35] Very common in 18th- and 19th-century sources, the name fell out of favor due to growing awareness of its lack of any connection to the river's Chinese names[36][37] and to the irony of its application to such a muddy waterway.[37][38] Matteo Ricci's 1615 Latin account included descriptions of the \"Ian\u017fu\" and \"Ian\u017fuchian.\"[39] The posthumous account's translation of the name as Fils de la Mer (\"Son of the Ocean\")[39][40] shows that Ricci, who by the end of his life was fluent in literary Chinese, was introduced to it as the homophonic \u6d0b\u5b50\u6c5f rather than the usual \u63da\u5b50\u6c5f. Further, although railroads and the Shanghai concessions subsequently turned it into a backwater, Yangzhou was the lower river's principal port for much of the Qing dynasty, directing Liangjiang's important salt monopoly and connecting the Yangtze with the Grand Canal to Beijing. (That connection also made it one of the Yellow River's principal ports between the floods of 1344 and the 1850s, during which time the Yellow River ran well south of Shandong and discharged into the ocean a mere few hundred kilometers from the mouth of the Yangtze.[36][26]) By 1800, English cartographers such as Aaron Arrowsmith had adopted the French style of the name[41] as Yang-tse or Yang-tse\u00a0Kiang.[42] The British diplomat Thomas Wade emended this to Yang-tzu Chiang as part of his formerly popular romanization of Chinese, based on the Beijing dialect instead of Nanjing's and first published in 1867. The spellings Yangtze and Yangtze\u00a0Kiang was a compromise between the two methods adopted at the 1906 Imperial Postal Conference in Shanghai, which established postal romanization. Hanyu Pinyin was adopted by the PRC's First Congress in 1958, but it was not widely employed in English outside mainland China prior to the normalization of diplomatic relations between the United States and the PRC in 1979; since that time, the spelling Yangzi has also been used."

This source is found at 33\u00b025\u203244\u2033N 91\u00b010\u203257\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff33.42889\u00b0N 91.18250\u00b0E\ufeff / 33.42889; 91.18250 and while not the furthest source of the Yangtze, it is the highest source at 5,342\u00a0m (17,526\u00a0ft) above sea level. The true source of the Yangtze, hydrologically the longest river distance from the sea, is at Jari Hill at the head of the Dam Qu tributary, approximately 325\u00a0km (202\u00a0mi) southeast of Geladandong.[44] This source was only discovered in the late 20th century and lies in wetlands at 32\u00b036\u203214\u2033N 94\u00b030\u203244\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff32.60389\u00b0N 94.51222\u00b0E\ufeff / 32.60389; 94.51222 and 5,170\u00a0m (16,960\u00a0ft) above sea level just southeast of Chadan Township in Zadoi County, Yushu Prefecture, Qinghai.[45] As the historical spiritual source of the Yangtze, the Geladandong source is still commonly referred to as the source of the Yangtze since the discovery of the Jari Hill source.[44] These tributaries join and the river then runs eastward through Qinghai (Tsinghai), turning southward down a deep valley at the border of Sichuan (Szechwan) and Tibet to reach Yunnan. In the course of this valley, the river's elevation drops from above 5,000\u00a0m (16,000\u00a0ft) to less than 1,000\u00a0m (3,300\u00a0ft). Thus, over the first 2,600\u00a0km (1,600\u00a0mi) of its length, the river has fallen more than 5,200\u00a0m (17,100\u00a0ft).[46] It enters the basin of Sichuan at Yibin. While in the Sichuan basin, it receives several large tributaries, increasing its water volume significantly. It then cuts through Mount Wushan bordering Chongqing and Hubei to create the famous Three Gorges. Eastward of the Three Gorges, Yichang is the first city on the Yangtze Plain. After entering Hubei province, the Yangtze receives water from a number of lakes. The largest of these lakes is Dongting Lake, which is located on the border of Hunan and Hubei provinces, and is the outlet for most of the rivers in Hunan. At Wuhan, it receives its biggest tributary, the Han River, bringing water from its northern basin as far as Shaanxi. At the northern tip of Jiangxi province, Lake Poyang, the biggest freshwater lake in China, merges into the river. The river then runs through Anhui and Jiangsu, receiving more water from innumerable smaller lakes and rivers, and finally reaches the East China Sea at Shanghai. Four of China's five main freshwater lakes contribute their waters to the Yangtze River. Traditionally, the upstream part of the Yangtze River refers to the section from Yibin to Yichang; the middle part refers to the section from Yichang to Hukou County, where Lake Poyang meets the river; the downstream part is from Hukou to Shanghai. The origin of the Yangtze River has been dated by some geologists to about 45\u00a0million years ago in the Eocene,[47] but this dating has been disputed.[48][49]"

        "content": "The Yangtze River is important to the cultural origins of southern China and Japan.[52] Human activity has been verified in the Three Gorges area as far back as 27,000 years ago,[53] and by the 5th millennium\u00a0BC, the lower Yangtze was a major population center occupied by the Hemudu and Majiabang cultures, both among the earliest cultivators of rice. By the 3rd millennium\u00a0BC, the successor Liangzhu culture showed evidence of influence from the Longshan peoples of the North China Plain.[54] What is now thought of as Chinese culture developed along the more fertile Yellow River basin; the \"Yue\" people of the lower Yangtze possessed very different traditions \u2013 blackening their teeth, cutting their hair short, tattooing their bodies, and living in small settlements among bamboo groves[55] \u2013 and were considered barbarous by the northerners. The Central Yangtze valley was home to sophisticated Neolithic cultures.[56] Later it became the earliest part of the Yangtze valley to be integrated into the North Chinese cultural sphere. (Northern Chinese were active there since the Bronze Age).[57] In the lower Yangtze, two Yue tribes, the Gouwu in southern Jiangsu and the Yuyue in northern Zhejiang, display increasing Zhou (i.e., North Chinese) influence starting in the 9th century\u00a0BC. Traditional accounts[58] credit these changes to northern refugees (Taibo and Zhongyong in Wu and Wuyi in Yue) who assumed power over the local tribes, though these are generally assumed to be myths invented to legitimate them to other Zhou rulers. As the kingdoms of Wu and Yue, they were famed as fishers, shipwrights, and sword-smiths. Adopting Chinese characters, political institutions, and military technology, they were among the most powerful states during the later Zhou. In the middle Yangtze, the state of Jing seems to have begun in the upper Han River valley a minor Zhou polity, but it adapted to native culture as it expanded south and east into the Yangtze valley. In the process, it changed its name to Chu.[59] Whether native or nativizing, the Yangtze states held their own against the northern Chinese homeland: some lists credit them with three of the Spring and Autumn period's Five Hegemons and one of the Warring States' Four Lords. They fell in against themselves, however. Chu's growing power led its rival Jin to support Wu as a counter. Wu successfully sacked Chu's capital Ying in 506\u00a0BC, but Chu subsequently supported Yue in its attacks against Wu's southern flank. In 473\u00a0BC, King Goujian of Yue fully annexed Wu and moved his court to its eponymous capital at modern Suzhou. In 333\u00a0BC, Chu finally united the lower Yangtze by annexing Yue, whose royal family was said to have fled south and established the Minyue kingdom in Fujian. Qin was able to unite China by first subduing Ba and Shu on the upper Yangtze in modern Sichuan, giving them a strong base to attack Chu's settlements along the river. The state of Qin conquered the central Yangtze region, the previous heartland of Chu, in 278 BC, and incorporated the region into its expanding empire. Qin then used its connections along the Xiang River to expand into Hunan, Jiangxi and Guangdong, setting up military commanderies along the main lines of communication. At the collapse of the Qin Dynasty, these southern commanderies became the independent Nanyue Empire under Zhao Tuo while Chu and Han vied with each other for control of the north. Since the Han dynasty, the region of the Yangtze River grew ever more important to China's economy. The establishment of irrigation systems (the most famous one is Dujiangyan, northwest of Chengdu, built during the Warring States period) made agriculture very stable and productive, eventually exceeding even the Yellow River region. The Qin and Han empires were actively engaged in the agricultural colonization of the Yangtze lowlands, maintaining a system of dikes to protect farmland from seasonal floods.[60] By the Song dynasty, the area along the Yangtze had become among the wealthiest and most developed parts of the country, especially in the lower reaches of the river. Early in the Qing dynasty, the region called Jiangnan (that includes the southern part of Jiangsu, the northern part of Zhejiang and Jiangxi, and the southeastern part of Anhui) provided 1\u20443\u20131\u20442 of the nation's revenues. The Yangtze has long been the backbone of China's inland water transportation system, which remained particularly important for almost two thousand years, until the construction of the national railway network during the 20th century. The Grand Canal connects the lower Yangtze with the major cities of the Jiangnan region south of the river (Wuxi, Suzhou, Hangzhou) and with northern China (all the way from Yangzhou to Beijing). The less well known ancient Lingqu Canal, connecting the upper Xiang River with the headwaters of the Guijiang, allowed a direct water connection from the Yangtze Basin to the Pearl River Delta.[61] Historically, the Yangtze was the political boundary between north China and south China several times (see History of China) because crossing the river was difficult. This occurred notably during the Southern and Northern Dynasties, and the Southern Song. Many battles took place along the river, the most famous being the Battle of Red Cliffs in 208 AD during the Three Kingdoms period. The Yangtze was the site of naval battles between the Song dynasty and Jurchen Jin during the Jin\u2013Song wars. In the Battle of Caishi of 1161, the ships of the Jin emperor Wanyan Liang clashed with the Song fleet on the Yangtze. Song soldiers fired bombs of lime and sulfur using trebuchets at the Jurchen warships. The battle was a Song victory that halted the invasion by the Jin.[62][63] The Battle of Tangdao was another Yangtze naval battle in the same year. Politically, Nanjing was the capital of China several times, although most of the time its territory only covered the southeastern part of China, such as the Wu kingdom in the Three Kingdoms period, the Eastern Jin Dynasty, and during the Southern and Northern Dynasties and Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms periods. Only the Ming occupied most parts of China from their capital at Nanjing, though it later moved the capital to Beijing. The ROC capital was located in Nanjing in the periods 1911\u201312, 1927\u201337, and 1945\u201349."

This small vessel was to carry passengers and mail between Lintin Island, Macao, and Huangpu. However, the Chinese, draconian in their application of the rules relating to foreign vessels, were unhappy about a \"fire-ship\" steaming up the Canton River. The acting Viceroy of Liangguang issued an edict warning that she would be fired on if she attempted the trip.[64] On the Jardine's first trial run from Lintin Island the forts on both sides of the Bogue opened fire and she was forced to turn back. The Chinese authorities issued a further warning insisting that the ship leave Chinese waters. The Jardine in any case needed repairs and was sent to Singapore.[65]Subsequently, Lord Palmerston, the Foreign Secretary decided mainly on the \"suggestions\" of William Jardine to declare war on China. In mid-1840, a large fleet of warships appeared on the China coast, and with the first cannonball fired at a British ship, the Royal Saxon, the British started the first of the Opium Wars. Royal Navy warships destroyed numerous shore batteries and Chinese warships, laying waste to several coastal forts along the way. Eventually, they pushed their way up north close enough to threaten the Imperial Palace in Beijing itself.[64] The China Navigation Company was an early shipping company founded in 1876 in London, initially to trade up the Yangtze River from their Shanghai base with passengers and cargo. Chinese coastal trade started shortly after, and in 1883 a regular service to Australia was initiated.[64]"

        "content": "Steamers came late to the upper river, the section stretching from Yichang to Chongqing. Freshets from Himalayan snowmelt created treacherous seasonal currents. But summer was better navigationally and the three gorges, described as a \"150-mile passage which is like the narrow throat of an hourglass,\" posed hazardous threats of crosscurrents, whirlpools and eddies, creating significant challenges to steamship efforts. Furthermore, Chongqing is 700 \u2013 800 feet above sea level, requiring powerful engines to make the upriver climb. Junk travel accomplished the upriver feat by employing 70\u201380 trackers, men hitched to hawsers who physically pulled ships upriver through some of the most risky and deadly sections of the three gorges.[66] Archibald John Little took an interest in Upper Yangtze navigation when in 1876, the Chefoo Convention opened Chongqing to consular residence but stipulated that foreign trade might only commence once steamships had succeeded in ascending the river to that point. Little formed the Upper Yangtze Steam Navigation Co., Ltd. and built Kuling but his attempts to take the vessel further upriver than Yichang were thwarted by the Chinese authorities who were concerned about the potential loss of transit duties, competition to their native junk trade and physical damage to their crafts caused by steamship wakes. Kuling was sold to China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for lower river service. In 1890, the Chinese government agreed to open Chongqing to foreign trade as long as it was restricted to native crafts. In 1895, the Treaty of Shimonoseki provided a provision which opened Chongqing fully to foreign trade. Little took up residence in Chongqing and built Leechuan, to tackle the gorges in 1898. In March Leechuan completed the upriver journey to Chongqing but not without the assistance of trackers. Leechuan was not designed for cargo or passengers and if Little wanted to take his vision one step further, he required an expert pilot.[67] In 1898, Little persuaded Captain Samuel Cornell Plant to come out to China to lend his expertise. Captain Plant had just completed navigation of Persia's Upper Karun River and took up Little's offer to assess the Upper Yangtze on Leechuan at the end of 1898. With Plant's design input, Little had SS Pioneer built with Plant in command. In June 1900, Plant was the first to successfully pilot a merchant steamer on the Upper Yangtze from Yichang to Chongqing.  Pioneer was sold to Royal Navy after its first run due to threat from the Boxer Rebellion and renamed HMS Kinsha. Germany's steamship effort that same year on SS Suixing ended in catastrophe. On Suixing's maiden voyage, the vessel hit a rock and sunk, killing its captain and ending realistic hopes of regular commercial steam service on the Upper Yangtze. In 1908, local Sichuan merchants and their government partnered with Captain Plant to form Sichuan Steam Navigation Company becoming the first successful service between Yichang and Chongqing. Captain Plant designed and commanded its two ships, SS Shutung and SS Shuhun. Other Chinese vessels came onto the run and by 1915, foreign ships expressed their interest too. Plant was appointed by Chinese Maritime Customs Service as First Senior River Inspector in 1915. In this role, Plant installed navigational marks and established signaling systems. He also wrote Handbook for the Guidance of Shipmasters on the Ichang-Chungking Section of the Yangtze River, a detailed and illustrated account of the Upper Yangtze's currents, rocks, and other hazards with navigational instruction. Plant trained hundreds of Chinese and foreign pilots and issued licenses and worked with the Chinese government to make the river safer in 1917 by removing some of the most difficult obstacles and threats with explosives. In August 1917, British Asiatic Petroleum became the first foreign merchant steamship on the Upper Yangtze. Commercial firms, Robert Dollar Company, Jardine Matheson, Butterfield and Swire and Standard Oil added their own steamers on the river between 1917 and 1919. Between 1918 and 1919, Sichuan warlord violence and escalating civil war put Sichuan Steam Navigational Company out of business.[68] Shutung was commandeered by warlords and Shuhun was brought down river to Shanghai for safekeeping.[69] In 1921, when Captain Plant died at sea while returning home to England, a Plant Memorial Fund was established to perpetuate Plant's name and contributions to Upper Yangtze navigation. The largest shipping companies in service, Butterfield & Swire, Jardine Matheson, Standard Oil, Mackenzie & Co., Asiatic Petroleum, Robert Dollar, China Merchants S.N. Co. and British-American Tobacco Co., contributed alongside international friends and Chinese pilots. In 1924, a 50-foot granite pyramidal obelisk was erected in Xintan, on the site of Captain Plant's home, in a Chinese community of pilots and junk owners. One face of the monument is inscribed in Chinese and another in English. Though recently relocated to higher ground ahead of the Three Gorges Dam, the monument still stands overlooking the Upper Yangtze River near Yichang, a rare collective tribute to a westerner in China.[70][71] Standard Oil ran the tankers Mei Ping, Mei An and Mei Hsia, which were collectively destroyed on December 12, 1937, when Japanese warplanes bombed and sank the U.S.S. Panay. One of the Standard Oil captains who survived this attack had served on the Upper River for 14 years.[72]"

Kl\u00f8vedal had spent 12 years preparing and gathering the required permissions, and with a crew of Danes, his family members, a Chinese interpreter and several local maritime pilots, he became the first foreigner since 1949 to navigate the Yangtze.[75] His months-long journey was documented both in his 2004 book \"Kineserne syr med lang tr\u00e5d\" and the TV show \"Kl\u00f8vedal i Kina\" by DR.[76] In August 2019, Welsh adventurer Ash Dykes became the first person to complete the 4,000-mile (6,400\u00a0km) trek along the course of the river, walking for 352 days from its source to its mouth.[77]"

The floods large enough to overflow the dikes have caused great distress to those who live and farm there. Floods of note include those of 1931, 1954, and 1998. The 1931 Central China floods or the Central China floods of 1931 were a series of floods that are generally considered among the deadliest natural disasters ever recorded, and almost certainly the deadliest of the 20th century (when pandemics and famines are discounted). Estimates of the total death toll range from 145,000 to between 3.7\u00a0million and 4\u00a0million.[78][79] The Yangtze flooded again in 1935, causing great loss of life. From June to September 1954, the Yangtze River Floods were a series of catastrophic floodings that occurred mostly in Hubei Province. Due to unusually high volume of precipitation as well as an extraordinarily long rainy season in the middle stretch of the Yangtze River late in the spring of 1954, the river started to rise above its usual level in around late June. Despite efforts to open three important flood gates to alleviate the rising water by diverting it, the flood level continued to rise until it hit the historic high of 44.67 m in Jingzhou, Hubei and 29.73 m in Wuhan. The number of dead from this flood was estimated at 33,000, including those who died of plague in the aftermath of the disaster. The 1998 Yangtze River floods were a series of major floods that lasted from middle of June to the beginning of September 1998 along the Yangtze.[80] In the summer of 1998, China experienced massive flooding of parts of the Yangtze River, resulting in 3,704 dead, 15\u00a0million homeless and $26\u00a0billion in economic loss.[81] Other sources report a total loss of 4150 people, and 180\u00a0million people were affected.[82] A staggering 25\u00a0million acres (100,000\u00a0km2) were evacuated, 13.3\u00a0million houses were damaged or destroyed. The floods caused $26\u00a0billion in damages.[82] The 2016 China floods caused US$22\u00a0billion in damages. In 2020, the Yangtze river saw the heaviest rainfall since 1961, with a 79% increase in June and July compared to the average for the period over the previous 41 years. A new theory suggested that abrupt reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols, caused by shutdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic, was a key cause of the intense downpours. Over the past decades rainfall had decreased due to increase of aerosols in the atmosphere, and lower greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 caused the opposite effect \u2013 a major increase in rain. Such a dramatic reduction of aerosols caused a dramatic change in the various components of the climate system, but such sudden change of the climate system would be very different from changes in response to continuous but gradual policy-driven emissions reductions.[83]"

More than a hundred lakes were thusly cut off from the main river.[84] There were gates between the lakes that could be opened during floods. However, farmers and settlements encroached on the land next to the lakes although it was forbidden to settle there. When floods came, it proved impossible to open the gates since it would have caused substantial destruction.[85] Thus the lakes partially or completely dried up. For example, Baidang Lake shrunk from 100 square kilometers (39\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in the 1950s to 40 square kilometers (15\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in 2005. Zhangdu Lake dwindled to one quarter of its original size. Natural fisheries output in the two lakes declined sharply. Only a few large lakes, such as Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake, remained connected to the Yangtze. Cutting off the other lakes that had served as natural buffers for floods increased the damage done by floods further downstream. Furthermore, the natural flow of migratory fish was obstructed and biodiversity across the whole basin decreased dramatically. Intensive farming of fish in ponds spread using one type of carp who thrived in eutrophic water conditions and who feeds on algae, causing widespread pollution. The pollution was exacerbated by the discharge of waste from pig farms as well as of untreated industrial and municipal sewage.[84][86] In September 2012, the Yangtze river near Chongqing turned red from pollution.[87] The erection of the Three Gorges Dam has created an impassable \"iron barrier\" that has led to a great reduction in the biodiversity of the river. Yangtze sturgeon use seasonal changes in the flow of the river to signal when is it time to migrate. However, these seasonal changes will be greatly reduced by dams and diversions. Other animals facing immediate threat of extinction are the baiji dolphin, narrow-ridged finless porpoise and the Yangtze alligator. These animals numbers went into freefall from the combined effects of accidental catches during fishing, river traffic, habitat loss and pollution. In 2006 the baiji dolphin became extinct; the world lost an entire genus.[88] In 2020, a sweeping law was passed by the Chinese government to protect the ecology of the river. The new laws include strengthening ecological protection rules for hydropower projects along the river, banning chemical plants within 1 kilometer of the river, relocating polluting industries, severely restricting sand mining as well as a complete fishing ban on all the natural waterways of the river, including all its major tributaries and lakes.[89]"

The first lakes to be reconnected in 2004 were Zhangdu Lake, Honghu Lake, and Tian'e-Zhou in Hubei on the middle Yangtze. In 2005, Baidang Lake in Anhui was also reconnected.[86] Reconnecting the lakes improved water quality and fish were able to migrate from the river into the lake, replenishing their numbers and genetic stock. The trial also showed that reconnecting the lake reduced flooding. The new approach also benefitted the farmers economically. Pond farmers switched to natural fish feed, which helped them breed better-quality fish that can be sold for more, increasing their income by 30%. Based on the successful pilot project, other provincial governments emulated the experience and also reestablished connections to lakes that had previously been cut off from the river. In 2005 a Yangtze Forum has been established bringing together 13 riparian provincial governments to manage the river from source to sea.[92] In 2006 China's Ministry of Agriculture made it a national policy to reconnect the Yangtze River with its lakes. As of 2010, provincial governments in five provinces and Shanghai set up a network of 40 effective protected areas, covering 16,500\u00a0km2 (6,400\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). As a result, populations of 47 threatened species increased, including the critically endangered Yangtze alligator. In the Shanghai area, reestablished wetlands now protect drinking water sources for the city. It is envisaged to extend the network throughout the entire Yangtze to eventually cover 102 areas and 185,000\u00a0km2 (71,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). The mayor of Wuhan announced that six huge, stagnating urban lakes including the East Lake (Wuhan) would be reconnected at the cost of US$2.3\u00a0billion creating China's largest urban wetland landscape.[84][93]"

On occasions, the crossing may have been dangerous, as evidenced by the Zhong'anlun disaster (October 15, 1945). The river stood as a major geographic barrier dividing northern and southern China. In the first half of the 20th century, rail passengers from Beijing to Guangzhou and Shanghai had to disembark, respectively, at Hanyang and Pukou, and cross the river by steam ferry before resuming journeys by train from Wuchang or Nanjing West. After the founding of the People's Republic in 1949, Soviet engineers assisted in the design and construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, a dual-use road-rail bridge, built from 1955 to 1957. It was the first bridge across the Yangtze River. The second bridge across the river that was built was a single-track railway bridge built upstream in Chongqing in 1959. The Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, also a road-rail bridge, was the first bridge to cross the lower reaches of the Yangtze, in Nanjing. It was built after the Sino-Soviet Split and did not receive foreign assistance. Road-rail bridges were then built in Zhicheng (1971) and Chongqing (1980). Bridge-building slowed in the 1980s before resuming in the 1990s and accelerating in the first decade of the 21st century. The Jiujiang Yangtze River Bridge was built in 1992 as part of the Beijing-Jiujiang Railway. A second bridge in Wuhan was completed in 1995. By 2005, there were a total of 56 bridges and one tunnel across the Yangtze River between Yibin and Shanghai. These include some of the longest suspension and cable-stayed bridges in the world on the Yangtze Delta: Jiangyin Suspension Bridge (1,385 m, opened in 1999), Runyang Bridge (1,490 m, opened 2005), Sutong Bridge (1,088 m, opened 2008).

The remaining are also known from salt or brackish waters, such as the river's estuary or the East China Sea. This makes it one of the most species-rich rivers in Asia and by far the most species-rich in China (in comparison, the Pearl River has almost 300 fish species and the Yellow River 160).[94] 178 fish species are endemic to the Yangtze River Basin.[94] Many are only found in some section of the river basin and especially the upper reach (above Yichang, but below the headwaters in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau) is rich with 279 species, including 147 Yangtze endemics and 97 strict endemics (found only in this part of the basin). In contrast, the headwaters, where the average altitude is above 4,500\u00a0m (14,800\u00a0ft), are only home to 14 highly specialized species, but 8 of these are endemic to the river.[94] The largest orders in the Yangtze are Cypriniformes (280 species, including 150 endemics), Siluriformes (40 species, including 20 endemics), Perciformes (50 species, including 4 endemics), Tetraodontiformes (12 species, including 1 endemic) and Osmeriformes (8 species, including 1 endemic). No other order has more than four species in the river and one endemic.[94] Many Yangtze fish species have declined drastically and 65 were recognized as threatened in the 2009 Chinese red list.[95] Among these are three that are considered entirely extinct (Chinese paddlefish, Anabarilius liui liui and Atrilinea macrolepis), two that are extinct in the wild (Anabarilius polylepis, Schizothorax parvus), four that are critically endangered Euchiloglanis kishinouyei, Megalobrama elongata, Schizothorax longibarbus and Leiocassis longibarbus).[95][96] Additionally, both the Yangtze sturgeon and Chinese sturgeon are considered critically endangered by the IUCN. The survival of these two sturgeon may rely on the continued release of captive bred specimens.[97][98] Although still listed as critically endangered rather than extinct by both the Chinese red list and IUCN, recent reviews have found that the Chinese paddlefish is extinct.[99][100] Surveys conducted between 2006 and 2008 by ichthyologists failed to catch any, but two probable specimens were recorded with hydroacoustic signals.[101] The last definite record was an individual that was accidentally captured near Yibin in 2003 and released after having been radio tagged.[96] The Chinese sturgeon is the largest fish in the river and among the largest freshwater fish in the world, reaching a length of 5\u00a0m (16\u00a0ft); the extinct Chinese paddlefish reputedly reached as much as 7\u00a0m (23\u00a0ft), but its maximum size is labeled with considerable uncertainty.[102][103][104] The largest threats to the Yangtze native fish are overfishing and habitat loss (such as building of dams and land reclamation), but pollution, destructive fishing practices (such as fishing with dynamite or poison) and introduced species also cause problems.[94] About 2\u20443 of the total freshwater fisheries in China are in the Yangtze Basin,[105] but a drastic decline in size of several important species has been recorded, as highlighted by data from lakes in the river basin.[94] In 2015, some experts recommend a 10-year fishing moratorium to allow the remaining populations to recover,[106] and in January 2020 China imposed a 10-year fishing moratorium on 332 sites along the Yangtze.[107] Dams present another serious problem, as several species in the river perform breeding migrations and most of these are non-jumpers, meaning that normal fish ladders designed for salmon are ineffective.[94] For example, the Gezhouba Dam blocked the migration of the paddlerfish and two sturgeon,[97][98][103] while also effectively splitting the Chinese high fin banded shark population into two[108] and causing the extirpation of the Yangtze population of the Japanese eel.[109] In an attempt of minimizing the effect of the dams, the Three Gorges Dam has released water to mimic the (pre-dam) natural flooding and trigger the breeding of carp species downstream.[110] In addition to dams already built in the Yangtze basin, several large dams are planned and these may present further problems for the native fauna.[110] While many fish species native to the Yangtze are seriously threatened, others have become important in fish farming and introduced widely outside their native range. A total of 26 native fish species of the Yangtze basin are farmed.[106] Among the most important are four Asian carp: grass carp, black carp, silver carp and bighead carp. Other species that support important fisheries include northern snakehead, Chinese perch, Takifugu pufferfish (mainly in the lowermost sections) and predatory carp.[94]"

This is the only other place besides the United States that is native to an alligator and paddlefish species. In 2010, the Yangtze population of finless porpoise was 1000 individuals. In December 2006, the Yangtze river dolphin was declared functionally extinct after an extensive search of the river revealed no signs of the dolphin's inhabitance.[112] In 2007, a large, white animal was sighted and photographed in the lower Yangtze and was tentatively presumed to be a baiji.[113] However, as there have been no confirmed sightings since 2004, the baiji is presumed to be functionally extinct at this time.[114] \"Baijis were the last surviving species of a large lineage dating back seventy million years and one of only six species of freshwater dolphins.\" It has been argued that the extinction of the Yangtze river dolphin was a result of the completion of the Three Gorges Dam, a project that has affected many species of animals and plant life found only in the gorges area.[115] Numerous species of land mammals are found in the Yangtze valley, but most of these are not directly associated with the river. Three exceptions are the semi-aquatic Eurasian otter, water deer and P\u00e8re David's deer.[116] In addition to the very large and exceptionally rare Yangtze giant softshell turtle, several smaller turtle species are found in the Yangtze basin, its delta and valleys. These include the Chinese box turtle, yellow-headed box turtle, Pan's box turtle, Yunnan box turtle, yellow pond turtle, Chinese pond turtle, Chinese stripe-necked turtle and Chinese softshell turtle, which all are considered threatened.[118] More than 160 amphibian species are known from the Yangtze basin, including the world's largest, the critically endangered Chinese giant salamander.[119] It has declined drastically due to hunting (it is considered a delicacy), habitat loss and pollution.[117] The polluted Dian Lake, which is part of the upper Yangtze watershed (via Pudu River), is home to several highly threatened fish, but was also home to the Yunnan lake newt. This newt has not been seen since 1979 and is considered extinct.[120][121] In contrast, the Chinese fire belly newt from the lower Yangtze basin is one of the few Chinese salamander species to remain common and it is considered least concern by the IUCN.[121][122][123] The Yangtze basin contains a large number of freshwater crab species, including several endemics.[126] A particularly rich genus in the river basin is the potamid Sinopotamon.[127] The Chinese mitten crab is catadromous (migrates between fresh and saltwater) and it has been recorded up to 1,400\u00a0km (870\u00a0mi) up the Yangtze, which is the largest river in its native range.[125] It is a commercially important species in its native range where it is farmed,[124] but the Chinese mitten crab has also been spread to Europe and North America where considered invasive.[125] The freshwater jellyfish Craspedacusta sowerbii, now an invasive species in large parts of the world, originates from the Yangtze.[128]"

        "content": " Guangxi,[a] officially the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, is an autonomous region of the People's Republic of China, located in South China and bordering Vietnam (H\u00e0 Giang, Cao B\u1eb1ng, L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n, and Qu\u1ea3ng Ninh Provinces) and the Gulf of Tonkin. Formerly a province, Guangxi became an autonomous region in 1958. Its current capital is Nanning.[5] Guangxi's location, in mountainous terrain in the far south of China, has placed it on the frontier of Chinese civilization throughout much of Chinese history. The current name \"Guang\" means \"expanse\" and has been associated with the region since the creation of Guang Prefecture in 226 AD. It was given provincial level status during the Yuan dynasty, but even into the 20th century, it was considered an open, wild territory. The abbreviation of the region is \"\u6842\" (Hanyu pinyin: Gu\u00ec; Zhuang: Gvei), which comes from the name of the city of Guilin, the provincial capital during both the Ming dynasty and the Qing dynasty. Guangxi contains the largest population of China's ethnic minorities after Yunnan, in particular, the Zhuang people, who make up 34% of the population. Various regional languages and dialects such as Pinghua, Zhuang, Kam, Cantonese, Hakka, and Min are spoken alongside Mandarin Chinese.[6]"

        "content": "\"Gu\u01ceng\" (simplified Chinese: \u5e7f; traditional Chinese: \u5ee3) means 'expanse' or 'vast', and has been associated with the region since the creation of Guang Prefecture in AD 226.[7] Guangxi and neighboring Guangdong literally mean 'expanse west' and 'expanse east'. Together, Guangxi and Guangdong are called Liangguang (Liangkwang; traditional Chinese: \u5169\u5ee3; simplified Chinese: \u4e24\u5e7f; pinyin: li\u01ceng gu\u01ceng; Cantonese Yale: l\u00e9uhng gw\u00f3ng; lit. 'Two Expanses', Vietnamese: L\u01b0\u1ee1ng Qu\u1ea3ng). During the Song dynasty, the Two Guangs were formally separated as Gu\u01cengn\u00e1n X\u012bl\u00f9 (\u5ee3\u5357\u897f\u8def; \u5e7f\u5357\u897f\u8def; 'vast south west region') and Gu\u01cengn\u00e1n D\u014dngl\u00f9 (\u5ee3\u5357\u6771\u8def; \u5e7f\u5357\u4e1c\u8def; 'vast south east region'), which became abbreviated as Gu\u01cengx\u012b L\u00f9 (\u5ee3\u897f\u8def; \u5e7f\u897f\u8def) and Gu\u01cengd\u014dng L\u00f9 (\u5ee3\u6771\u8def; \u5e7f\u4e1c\u8def). Guangxi was also previously spelled as Kwangsi in postal and Wade\u2013Giles romanizations. The spelling of the province was replaced by the pinyin spelling of Guangxi in 1958 and has been widely used internationally after 1986.[citation needed] The official name was also known as Kwangsi Chuang Autonomous Region in a number of Western publications outside of China published in the 1950s to 1970s.[8]"

        "content": "Originally inhabited by a mixture of tribal groups known to the Chinese as the Baiyue (\"Hundred Yue\", Vietnamese: B\u00e1ch Vi\u1ec7t), the region first became part of China during the Qin dynasty. In 214 BC, the Han Chinese general Zhao Tuo (Vietnamese: Tri\u1ec7u \u0110\u00e0) claimed most of southern China for Qin Shi Huang before the emperor's death. The ensuing civil war permitted Zhao to establish a separate kingdom at Panyu known as Nanyue (\"Southern Yue\"). Alternatively submissive to and independent of Han dynasty control, Southern Yue expanded colonization and sinicization under its policy of \"Harmonizing and Gathering the Hundred Yue\" (\u548c\u96c6\u767e\u8d8a) until its collapse in 111 BC during the southward expansion of the Han dynasty.[9] The name \"Guangxi\" can be traced to the \"Expansive\" or \"Wide\" province (\u5ee3\u5dde) of the Eastern Wu, which controlled southeastern China during the Three Kingdoms period. Guilin formed one of its commanderies.[citation needed] Under the Tang dynasty, the Zhuang moved to support Piluoge's kingdom of Nanzhao in Yunnan, which successfully repulsed imperial armies in 751 and 754. Guangxi was then divided into an area of Zhuang ascendancy west of Nanning and an area of Han ascendancy east of Nanning.[citation needed] After the collapse of the Southern Zhao, Liu Yan established the Southern Han (Nanhan) in Xingwangfu (modern Guangdong). Although this state gained minimal control over Guangxi, it was plagued by instability and annexed by the Song dynasty in 971. The name \"Guangxi\" itself can be traced to the Song, who administered the area as the Guangnanxi (\"West Southern Expanse\") Circuit. Harassed by both Song and the Jiaozhi in modern Vietnam, the Zhuang leader Nong Zhigao led a revolt in 1052 for which he is still remembered by the Zhuang people. His independent kingdom was short-lived, however, and the tattooed Song general Di Qing returned Guangxi to China.[citation needed] The Yuan dynasty established control over Yunnan during its conquest of the Dali Kingdom in 1253 and eliminated the Southern Song following the Battle of Yamen in 1279. Rather than ruling Lingnan as a subject territory or military district, the Mongolians then established Guangxi (\"Western Expanse\") as a proper province. The area nonetheless continued to be unruly, leading the Ming dynasty to employ the different local groups against one another. At the Battle of Big Rattan Gorge between the Zhuang and the Yao in 1465, 20,000 deaths were reported.[citation needed] During the Ming and Qing dynasties, parts of Guangxi were ruled by the powerful Cen (\u5c91) clan. The Cen were of Zhuang ethnicity and were recognized as tusi or local rulers by the Chinese emperors. The Qing dynasty left the region alone until the imposition of direct rule in 1726, but the 19th century was one of constant unrest. A Yao revolt in 1831 was followed by the Jintian Uprising, the beginning of the Taiping Rebellion, in January 1851 and the Da Cheng Rebellion in April 1854. The execution of St. Auguste Chapdelaine by local officials in Guangxi provoked the Second Opium War in 1858 and the legalization of foreign interference in the interior. Although Louis Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle was unable to invade its depot at Longzhou, the Guangxi Army saw a great deal of action in the 1884 Sino-French War. Largely ineffective within Vietnam, it was still able to repulse the French from China itself at the Battle of Zhennan Pass (modern Friendship Pass) on 23 March 1885.[citation needed] Following the Wuchang Uprising, Guangxi seceded from the Qing Empire on 6 November 1911. The Qing governor, Shen Bingdan, initially remained in place but was subsequently removed by a mutiny commanded by General Lu Rongting. General Lu's Old Guangxi clique overran Hunan and Guangdong as well and helped lead the National Protection War against Yuan Shikai's attempt to re-establish an imperial government. Zhuang's loyalty made his Self-Government Army cohesive but reluctant to move far beyond its own provinces. Subsequent feuding with Sun Yat-sen led to defeat in the 1920 and 1921 Guangdong\u2013Guangxi War. After a brief occupation by Chen Jiongming's Cantonese forces, Guangxi fell into disunity and profound banditry for several years[10] until Li Zongren's Guangxi Pacification Army established the New Guangxi clique dominated by Li, Huang Shaohong, and Bai Chongxi.[citation needed] Successful action in Hunan against Wu Peifu led to the Zhuang GPA becoming known as the \"Flying Army\" and the \"Army of Steel\". After the death of Sun Yat-sen, Li also repulsed Tang Jiyao's revolt and joined the Northern Expedition establishing control over other warlords by the Republic of China. His was one of the few Kuomintang units free from serious Chinese Communist Party (CCP) influence and was therefore employed by Chiang Kai-shek for the Shanghai massacre of 1927. Within the People's Republic of China, Guangxi is also noted for the Baise Uprising, a failed CCP revolt led by Chen Zhaoli and Deng Xiaoping in 1929.[citation needed] In 1937, the Guangxi Women's Battalion was founded as a response to Soong Mei-ling's appeal for women to support the Sino-Japanese War.[11][12] Reports on the size of the battalion vary from 130 students,[13] to 500,[14] to 800.[11] Being in the far south, Guangxi did not fall during the Chinese Civil War, but joined the People's Republic in December 1949, two months after its founding.[citation needed] In 1952, a small section of Guangdong's coastline (Qinzhou,  Lianzhou (now Hepu County), Fangchenggang and Beihai) was given to Guangxi, giving it access to the sea. This was reversed in 1955, and then restored in 1965.[citation needed] The Guangxi Massacre, during the Cultural Revolution, involved the killing of 100,000 to 150,000 in the region in 1967 and 1968.[15][16] While some development of heavy industry occurred in the 1960s and 1970s, the region remained largely a scenic tourist destination.[citation needed] Even the economic growth of the 1990s seemed to leave Guangxi behind. However, in recent years, there has been a growing amount of industrialization and increasing concentration on cash crops. Per capita GDP has risen as industries in Guangdong transfer production to comparatively lower-wage areas in Guangxi.[citation needed] During the 1979 Sino-Vietnamese War, Guangxi communities were important to the Chinese war effort.[17]:\u200a101\u200a They supplied logistical support to the People's Liberation Army, including food and housing.[17]:\u200a101\u200a Militia members from Guangxi performed tasks including building roads, bridges, trenches, other logistical efforts, and caring for the wounded.[17]:\u200a101"

Most other railways in Guangxi are connected to the Xianggui Line. From Nanning, the Nanning\u2013Kunming Railway heads west through Baise to Kunming, Yunnan and the Nanning\u2013Fangchenggang Railway runs south to Qinzhou, Fangchenggang and Beihai on the coast.  From Liuzhou, the Guizhou\u2013Guangxi Railway extends northwestward through Hechi to Guizhou and the Jiaozuo\u2013Liuzhou Railway runs due north to Hunan, and eventually Hubei and Henan in central China.  From Litang Township on the Xianggui Line between Nanning and Liuzhou, the Litang\u2013Qinzhou Railway runs south to Qinzhou on the coast and the Litang\u2013Zhanjiang Railway (Lizhan Line) extends southeastward through Guigang and Yulin to Zhanjiang, Guangdong. The Luoyang\u2013Zhanjiang Railway (Luozhan Line), which intersects with the Xianggui Line on the Hunan side of the border at Yongzhou, runs south through Hezhou and Wuzhou in eastern Guangxi and joins the Lizhan Line at Yulin.  At Cenxi, a branch of the Luozhan Line heads east to Maoming, Guangdong, forming a second rail outlet from Guangxi to Guangdong."

Its culture and language are reflected in this. Though now associated with the Zhuang ethnic minority, Guangxi's culture traditionally has had a close connection with Cantonese. Cantonese culture and language followed the Xi River valley from Guangdong and are still predominant in the eastern half of Guangxi today. Outside of this area, there is a huge variety of ethnicities and language groups represented. Guangxi is known for its ethnolinguistic diversity. In the capital of Nanning, for example, three varieties of Chinese are spoken locally: Southwestern Mandarin, Yue (specifically Cantonese), and Pinghua, in addition to various Zhuang languages and others.[citation needed]"

        "content": " Henan[a] is an inland province of China. Henan is home to many heritage sites, including the ruins of Shang dynasty capital city Yin and the Shaolin Temple. Four of the historical capitals of China, Luoyang, Anyang, Kaifeng and Zhengzhou, are in Henan.[8] Although the name of the province means \"south of the river\",[9] approximately a quarter of the province lies north of the Yellow River, also known as the Huang He. With an area of 167,000\u00a0km2 (64,479\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), Henan covers a large part of the fertile and densely populated North China Plain. Its neighboring provinces are Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, Anhui, and Hubei. Henan is China's third-most populous province with a population of over 99 million as of 2020. It is also the world's seventh-most populous subnational entity, and, if it were a country by itself, Henan would be the 14th-most populous country in the world, ahead of Egypt and Vietnam. People from Henan often suffer from regional discrimination.[10][11] Henan is the 5th-largest provincial economy of China, the second largest in South Central China after Guangdong, and the largest among inland provinces, with a nominal GDP of 5.88 trillion RMB (US$926 billion) as of 2021, ahead of the GDP of Turkey of 815 billion.[12][13] If it were a country, it would be the 18th-largest economy as of 2021.[14] However, per capita GDP is low compared to other eastern and central provinces.[15] The economy continues to grow based on aluminum and coal prices, as well as agriculture, heavy industry, tourism and retail. High-tech industries and the service sector are concentrated around Zhengzhou and Luoyang. Henan hosts more than 150 higher education institutions, ranking first in the Central China region.[16] As of 2023, three major cities in the province ranked in the top 200 cities in the world (Zhengzhou 76th, Kaifeng 154th and Xinxiang 195th) by scientific research output, as tracked by the Nature Index.[17]"

However, its strategic location also means that it has suffered from nearly all of the major wars in China. In addition, the numerous floods of the Yellow River have caused significant damage from time to time.[19] Kaifeng, in particular, has been buried by China's Yellow River's silt seven times due to flooding."

        "content": "Archaeological sites reveal that prehistoric cultures such as the Yangshao Culture and Longshan Culture were active in what is now northern Henan since the Neolithic Era. The more recent Erlitou culture has been controversially identified with the Xia dynasty, the first and largely legendary Chinese dynasty that was established,[20] roughly, in the 21st century\u00a0BC. Virtually the entire kingdom existed within what is now north and central Henan. The Xia dynasty collapsed around the 16th century BC following the invasion of Shang, a neighboring vassal state centered around today's Shangqiu in eastern Henan. The Shang dynasty (16th\u201311th centuries BC) was the first literate dynasty of China. Its many capitals are located at the modern cities of Shangqiu, Yanshi, and Zhengzhou. Their last and most important capital of Yin, located in modern Anyang, is where the first Chinese writing was created. In the 11th century BC, the Zhou dynasty of Shaanxi arrived from the west and overthrew the Shang dynasty.[21] During the Western Zhou period (c.\u20091046 \u2013 771 BC), the capital and political and economical center was moved away from Henan for the first time. The Spring and Autumn period, a period of warfare and rivalry, began in 721\u00a0BC. What is now Henan and all of China was divided into a variety of small, independent states, constantly at war for control of the central plain. Although regarded formally as the ruler of China, the control that Zhou king in Luoyang exerted over the feudal kingdoms had virtually disappeared. Despite the prolonged period of instability, prominent philosophers such as Confucius emerged in this era and offered their ideas on how a state should be run. Laozi, the founder of Taoism, was born in northern Chu, part of modern-day Henan.[22] Later on, these states were replaced by seven large and powerful states during the Warring States period, and Henan was divided into three states, the Wei to the north, the Chu to the south, and the Han in the middle. In 221\u00a0BC, state of Qin forces from Shaanxi conquered all of the other six states, ending 800 years of warfare."

        "content": "Ying Zheng, the leader of Qin, crowned himself (220\u00a0BCE) as the first emperor of China. He abolished the feudal system and centralized all powers, establishing the Qin dynasty and unifying the core of the Han Chinese homeland for the first time. The empire quickly collapsed after the death (210\u00a0BCE) of Ying Zheng and was replaced by the Han dynasty in 206\u00a0BC, with its capital at Chang'an. Thus, a golden age of Chinese culture, economy, and military power began. The capital moved east to Luoyang in 25\u00a0AD, in response to a coup in Chang'an that created the short-lived Xin dynasty. Luoyang quickly regained control of China, and the Eastern Han dynasty (25\u2013220) began, extending the golden age for another two centuries. The late Eastern Han dynasty saw war and rivalry between regional warlords. Xuchang in central Henan was the power base of Cao Cao, who eventually succeeded in unifying all of northern China under the Kingdom of Wei.[23] Wei then moved its capital to Luoyang, which remained the capital after the unification of China by the Western Jin dynasty. During this period Luoyang became one of the largest and most prosperous cities in the world, despite being repeatedly damaged by warfare. With the fall of the Western Jin dynasty in the 4th and 5th centuries, nomadic peoples from the north invaded northern China and established many successive regimes in northern China, including Henan. These people were gradually assimilated into the Chinese culture in a process known as sinification. The short-lived Sui dynasty reunified China again in 589 with its capital back in Chang'an. It collapsed due to Sui Emperor Yang's costly attempt to relocate the capital from Chang'an to Luoyang and the construction of many extravagant palaces there.[24] The succeeding Tang dynasty (618\u2013907) kept its capital in Chang'an, marking the beginning of China's second golden age, with Henan being one of the wealthiest places in the empire. The Tang dynasty lasted for three centuries before it eventually succumbed to internal strife. In the Period of Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms (907\u2013960) that followed, Kaifeng in eastern Henan became the capital of four dynasties. The Song dynasty that reunified China in 982 also had its capital at Kaifeng. Under Song rule, China entered another era of culture and prosperity, and Kaifeng overtook Luoyang and Chang'an as the largest city in China and in the world.[25] In 1127, however, the Song dynasty succumbed to Jurchen (Jin dynasty) invaders from the north in the Jin\u2013Song war, and in 1142 ceded all of northern China, including Henan. The Song government moved its capital to Hangzhou in Southern China, which, under the Southern Song dynasty (1127\u20131279) continued to enjoy relative economic and culture prosperity. A prolonged period of peace and cultural and economic prosperity in the Yangtze delta Jiangnan region (modern southern Jiangsu, northern Zhejiang, and Shanghai) made this the new center of Chinese culture and economy. Kaifeng served as the Jurchen's \"southern capital\" from 1157 (other sources say 1161) and was reconstructed during this time.[26][27] But the Jurchen kept their main capital further north, until 1214, when they were forced to move the imperial court southwards to Kaifeng in order to flee the Mongol onslaught. In 1234 they succumbed to combined Mongol and Song dynasty forces. Mongols took control, and in 1279 they conquered all of China, establishing the Yuan dynasty and set up the equivalent of modern Henan, with borders very similar to the modern ones. Neither its territories nor its role in the economy changed under later dynasties. Henan remained important in the Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644) and Qing dynasty (1644\u20131911) that followed, though its economy slowly deteriorated due to frequent natural disasters."

Despite the rise of Zhengzhou, Henan's overall economy repeatedly stumbled as it was the hardest hit by the many disasters that struck China in its modern era. Henan suffered greatly during the Second Sino-Japanese War. In 1938, when the Imperial Japanese Army captured Kaifeng, the government led by Chiang Kai-shek bombed the Huayuankou dam in Zhengzhou in order to prevent Japanese forces from advancing further.[30] However, this caused massive flooding in Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths. In 1942 Henan was hit by a great famine resulting from a mix of drought, locusts and destruction caused by the war.[31] In 1954, the new government of the People's Republic of China moved the capital of Henan from Kaifeng to Zhengzhou,[32] as a result of its economic importance. The PRC had earlier established a short-lived Pingyuan Province consisting of what is now northern Henan and western Shandong with Xinxiang as its capital. This province was abolished in 1952.[33] In 1958, Yashan in Suiping County, Henan, became the first people's commune of China, heralding the beginning of the \"Great Leap Forward\".[34] In the subsequent famines of the early 1960s popularly attributed to the Great Leap Forward, Henan was one of the hardest hit and millions of people died.[35][unreliable source?] Suffering under famine and economic chaos caused by the Great Leap, locals in Henan offered low-level resistance mostly through banditry.[36] In 1959, however, a full peasant uprising erupted and was only defeated after twenty days of fighting.[37] A destructive flooding of the Huai River in the summer of 1950 prompted large-scale construction of dams on its tributaries in central and southern Henan.\nUnfortunately, many of the dams were not able to withstand the extraordinarily high levels of rainfall caused by Typhoon Nina in August 1975. Sixty-two dams, the largest of which was the Banqiao Dam in Biyang County collapsed; catastrophic flooding, spread over several counties throughout Zhumadian Prefecture and further downstream, killed at least 26,000 people.[38][39] Unofficial human life loss estimates, including deaths from the ensuing epidemics and famine, range as high as 85,600,[38] 171,000[40] or even 230 000.[38] This is considered the most deadly dam-related disaster in human history.[38] By the early 1970s, China was one of the poorest countries in the world, and Henan was one of the poorest provinces in China.[41] In 1978, however, when the communist leader Deng Xiaoping initiated the open door policy and embraced capitalism, China entered an economic boom that continues today. The boom did not reach inland provinces such as Henan initially, but by the 1990s Henan's economy was expanding at an even faster rate than that of China overall. In November 2004, martial law was declared in Zhongmou County, Henan, to quell deadly ethnic clashes between Han and Hui Chinese.[42] The reported number of deaths ranged between 7 and 148. In July 2021, high amounts of rainfall caused flooding, killing 302 and damaging amounting to 82 billion yuan.[43] In January 2024 there was the Yingcai Boarding School fire in the dormitory of a primary boarding school in Dushu.[44] The fire resulted in one injury and the deaths of at least 13 third-grade students between nine and ten years old.[45] In the same month also the 2024 Pingdingshan mining explosion occurred."

Much of the province forms part the densely populated North China Plain, an area known as the \"breadbasket of China\". The Taihang Mountains intrude partially into Henan's northwestern borders from Shanxi, forming the eastern edge of Loess Plateau. To the west the Xionger and Funiu Mountains form an extensive network of mountain ranges and plateaus, supporting one of the few remaining temperate deciduous forests which once covered all of Henan. The renowned Mount Song and its Shaolin Temple is located in the far east of the region, near the capital city Zhengzhou. To the far south, the Dabie Mountains divides Hubei from Henan. The Nanyang Basin, separated from North China Plain by these mountains, is another important agricultural and population center, with culture and history distinct from the rest of Henan and closer to that of Hubei's. Unlike the rest of northern China, desertification is not a problem in Henan, though sandstorms are common in cities near the Yellow River due to the large amount of sand present in the river. At 2413.8 meters above sea level, the highest point in Henan province is Laoyachanao (\u8001\u9e26\u5c94\u57b4).[46] The Yellow River passes through central Henan. It enters from the northwest, via the Sanmenxia Reservoir. After it passes Luoyang, the mountains gave way to plains. Excessive amount of sediments are formed due to the silt it picks up from the Loess Plateau, raising the river bed and causing frequent floods which shaped the habitat of the region. More recently however, construction of dams and levees, as well as the depletion of water resources have ended the floods. The Huai River in southern Henan is another important river, and has been recognized as part of the boundary dividing northern and southern Chinese climate and culture.[47] Henan shares borders with six other provinces. It is bordered to the west by Shaanxi, to the south by Hubei, and to the north by Shanxi (northwest) and Hebei (northeast). To the east lie Shandong (northeast) and Anhui (southeast), whose borders meet at a narrow strip of land which separates Henan from Jiangsu to the east."

It is also the fifth most populous sub-national division in the world. If it were a country by itself, it would be the twelfth most populous in the world, just behind Mexico and ahead of the Philippines. However, the hukou system shows Henan as the most populous province in China with over 103\u00a0million people, as it counts the migrant Henanese laborers as residents of Henan, instead of the province they currently reside in. On the other hand, Guangdong is shown as having only 81\u00a0million people, though the actual population is 95\u00a0million due to the influx of migrants from other provinces. The population is highly homogeneous with 98.8% of the population being Han. Small populations of Mongols and Manchus exists in scattered rural communities as well as major urban centers.\nAlong with Jiangxi, Henan has one of the most unbalanced gender ratios in China. As a result of the Chinese government's one-child policy (many parents do not want the only child to be female and abort the fetus), the gender ratio was 118.46 males for 100 females in 2000. Subsequently, aborting fetuses due to their female sex was banned in Henan and heavy fines are issued for those who violate the law. In addition, daughter-only families receive an annual allowance from the government.[64] Despite these efforts the problem seems to have become far worse. Based on a 2009 British Medical Journal study, the ratio is over 140 boys for every 100 girls in the 1\u20134 age group;[65] this might be a strong exaggeration, as many families with more than one child do not register their daughters to the hukou in order to escape fines."

This rapid growth has transformed Henan from one of the poorest provinces to one that matches other central provinces. Henan is the 5th-largest provincial economy of China, the second largest in South Central China after Guangdong, the largest in Central China and the largest among inland provinces, with a nominal GDP of 5.88\u00a0trillion RMB (US$926\u00a0billion) as of 2021, ahead of the GDP of Turkey of 815 billion.[12][13] If it were a country, it would be the 18th-largest economy as well as the 14th most populous as of 2021.[14] However, per capita GDP is low compared to other eastern and central provinces.[15] Henan is a semi-industrialized economy with an underdeveloped service sector. Agriculture has traditionally been a pillar of its economy, with the nation's highest wheat and sesame output and second highest rice output, earning its reputation as the breadbasket of China. Henan is also an important producer of beef, cotton, maize, pork, animal oil, and corn. Although Henan's industry has traditionally been based on light textiles and food processing, recent developments have diversified the industry sector to metallurgy, petrol, cement, chemical industry, machinery and electronics. Mining-related industries are a major part of Henan's economy.[70]:\u200a23\u200a Henan has the second largest molybdenum reserves in the world. Coal, aluminum, alkaline metals and tungsten are also present in large amounts in western Henan. Henan houses some of the biggest limestone reserves in China estimated over 24\u00a0billion tons.[71] Export and processing of these materials is one of the main sources of revenues. Henan has planned its economy around the provincial capital of Zhengzhou, and it is hoped that the province may become an important transportation and manufacturing hub in the years to come.[72] In July 2021, extreme flooding inflicted an estimated US$12.7\u00a0billion[73] of economic damage in Henan."

The Jingguang and Longhai Railway, the nation's two most important railways, run through much of the province and intersect at Zhengzhou. Other railway hubs such as Shangqiu, Xinxiang, and Luohe have also become important centers of trade and manufacturing as a result. Zhengzhou is also an important hub of China's high-speed railway network with railway lines connecting the city from 8 directions with all preferecture-level cities in Henan and other important cities in the country. Zhengzhou East Railway Station is one of the largest high speed railway stations in China and the world. Henan's expressway system is highly developed and the total length is approximately 5,000\u00a0km (3,100\u00a0mi), the highest total for any Chinese province. The state of air transport is less stellar, the only 3 public airports are located in Xinzheng (near Zhengzhou), Luoyang, and Nanyang."

        "content": "Hunan[a] is an inland province of China. Located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze watershed, it borders the province-level divisions of Hubei to the north, Jiangxi to the east, Guangdong and Guangxi to the south, Guizhou to the west, and Chongqing to the northwest. Its capital and largest city is Changsha, which abuts the Xiang River. Hengyang, Zhuzhou, and Yueyang are among its most populous urban cities. With a population of just over 66 million as of 2020[update] residing in an area of approximately 210,000\u00a0km2 (81,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), it is China's 7th most populous province, the fourth most populous among landlocked provinces, the second most populous in South Central China after Guangdong and the most populous province in Central China. It is the largest province in South-Central China, the fourth largest among landlocked provinces, and the 10th most extensive province by area. Hunan's nominal GDP was US$724 billion (CNY 4.6 trillion) as of 2021, appearing in the world's top 20 largest sub-national economies, with its GDP (PPP) being over US$1.1 trillion.[6][7] Hunan is the 9th-largest provincial economy of China, the fourth largest in South Central China, the third largest in Central China and the fourth largest among landlocked provinces. Its GDP (nominal) per capita exceeded US$10,900 (69,300 CNY), making it the third-richest province in the South Central China region after Guangdong and Hubei.[6] As of 2020, Hunan's GDP (nominal) reached 605 billion US dollars (CNY 4.18 trillion),[8][9] exceeding that of Poland, with a GDP of US$596 billion and Thailand, with a GDP of US$501 billion, the 22nd and 25th largest in the world respectively.[10] The name Hunan literally means \"south of the lake\".[11] The lake that is referred to is Dongting Lake, a lake in the northeast of the province. Vehicle license plates from Hunan are marked Xi\u0101ng (Chinese: \u6e58), after the Xiang River, which runs from south to north through Hunan and forms part of the largest drainage system for the province. The area of Hunan was under Chinese rule as far back as 350 BC. Hunan was the birthplace of communist revolutionary Mao Zedong,[12] who became the Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party and the founding father of the People's Republic of China. Hunan today is home to some ethnic minorities, including the Tujia and Miao, along with the Han Chinese, who make up a majority of the population. Varieties of Chinese spoken include Xiang, Gan and Southwestern Mandarin. Wulingyuan was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1992.[13] Changsha, the capital, is located in the eastern part of the province; it is now an important commercial, manufacturing and transportation centre.[14] The busiest airports serve domestic and international flights for Hunan, including Changsha Huanghua International Airport, Zhangjiajie Hehua International Airport and Changde Taohuayuan Airport.[15] Hunan is the seat of the Yuelu Academy (later become Hunan University), which is one of the four major academies over the last 1000 years in ancient China.[16] As of 2023, Hunan hosts 137 institutions of higher education, ranking fifth among all Chinese provinces .[17] In 2017, two major cities in Hunan (Changsha and Xiangtan) ranked in the top 500 cities in the world by scientific research output, as tracked by the Nature Index.[18]"

        "header": "History",
        "content": "Hunan's primeval forests were first occupied by the ancestors of the modern Miao, Tujia, Dong and Yao peoples. The province entered written Chinese history around 350 BC, when the province became part of the Zhou dynasty. After Qin conquered the Chu in 278 BC, the region came under the control of Qin, and then the Changsha Kingdom during the Han dynasty. At this time, and for hundreds of years thereafter, the province was a magnet for settlement of Han Chinese from the north, who displaced and assimilated the original indigenous inhabitants, cleared forests and began farming rice in the valleys and plains.[19] The agricultural colonization of the lowlands was carried out in part by the Han people, which managed river dikes to protect farmland from floods.[20] To this day, many of the small villages in Hunan are named after the Han families who settled there. Migration from the north was especially prevalent during the Eastern Jin dynasty, Sixteen Kingdoms and the Northern and Southern dynasties periods, when the north was mostly ruled by non-Han ethnic groups (Five Barbarians) and in perpetual disorder. During the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, Hunan was home to its own independent regime, Ma Chu. Hunan and Hubei became a part of the province of Huguang until the Qing dynasty. Hunan province was created in 1664 from Huguang, renamed to its current name in 1723. Hunan became an important communications center due to its position on the Yangzi River. It was an important centre of scholarly activity and Confucian thought, particularly in the Yuelu Academy in Changsha. It was also on the Imperial Highway constructed between northern and southern China. The land produced grain so abundantly that it fed many parts of China with its surpluses. The population continued to climb until, by the nineteenth century, Hunan became overcrowded and prone to peasant uprisings. Some of the uprisings, such as the ten-year Miao Rebellion of 1795\u20131806, were caused by ethnic tensions. The Taiping Rebellion began in the south in Guangxi Province in 1850. The rebellion spread into Hunan and then further eastward along the Yangzi River valley. Ultimately, it was a Hunanese army (Xiang Army) under Zeng Guofan who marched into Nanjing to put down the uprising in 1864. In 1920, a famine raged throughout Hunan and killed an estimated 2 million Hunanese civilians.[21] This sparked the Autumn Harvest Uprising of 1927. It was led by Hunanese native Mao Zedong, and established a short-lived Hunan Soviet in 1927. The Communists maintained a guerrilla army in the mountains along the Hunan-Jiangxi border until 1934. Under pressure from the Nationalist Kuomintang (KMT) forces, they began the Long March to bases in Shaanxi Province. After the departure of the Communists, the KMT army fought against the Japanese in the second Sino-Japanese war. Four different battles were fought against the Japanese at Changsha, the Battle of Changsha (1939), Battle of Changsha (1941), Battle of Changsha (1941\u20131942) and Battle of Changsha (1944), They defended Changsha until it fell in 1944,. China also fought the Battle of Changde and Battle of Hengyang against Japan there. Japan launched Operation Ichigo, a plan to control the railroad from Wuchang to Guangzhou (Yuehan Railway). Japan later lost the Battle of West Hunan in 1945.\nHunan was relatively unscathed by the civil war that followed the defeat of the Japanese in 1945. In 1949, the Communists returned once more as the Nationalists retreated southward. In addition to CCP Chairman Mao Zedong, a number of other first-generation communist leaders were also from Hunan: Chinese President Liu Shaoqi; CCP Secretaries-General Ren Bishi and Hu Yaobang; Marshals Peng Dehuai, He Long, and Luo Ronghuan; Wang Zhen, one of the Eight Elders; Xiang Jingyu, the first female member of the CCP's central committee; Senior General Huang Kecheng; and veteran diplomat Lin Boqu. An example of a more recent leader from Hunan is former Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji."

        "content": "Hunan is located on the south bank of the Yangtze River, about halfway along its length, situated between 108\u00b0 47'\u2013114\u00b0 16' east longitude and 24\u00b0 37'\u201330\u00b0 08' north latitude. Hunan covers an area of 211,800 square kilometres (81,800 square miles), making it the 10th largest provincial-level division. The east, south and west sides of the province are surrounded by mountains and hills, such as the Wuling Mountains to the northwest, the Xuefeng Mountains to the west, the Nanling Mountains to the south, and the Luoxiao Mountains to the east. Mountains and hills occupy more than 80% of the province, and plains less than 20%. At 2115.2 meters above sea level, the highest point in Hunan province is Lingfeng (\u9143\u5cf0).[22][23][24] The Xiang, the Zi, the Yuan and the Lishui Rivers converge on the Yangtze River at Lake Dongting in the north of Hunan. The center and northern parts are somewhat low and a U-shaped basin, open in the north and with Lake Dongting as its center. Most of Hunan lies in the basins of four major tributaries of the Yangtze River. Lake Dongting is the largest lake in the province and the second largest freshwater lake of China. The Xiaoxiang area and Lake Dongting figure prominently in Chinese poetry and paintings, particularly during the Song dynasty when they were associated with officials who had been unjustly dismissed.[25] Changsha (which means \"long sands\") was an active ceramics district during the Tang dynasty, its tea bowls, ewers and other products mass-produced and shipped to China's coastal cities for export abroad. An Arab dhow dated to the 830s and today known as the Belitung Shipwreck was discovered off the small island of Belitung, Indonesia with more than 60,000 pieces in its cargo.[citation needed] The salvaged cargo is today housed in nearby Singapore. Hunan's climate is subtropical, and, under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, is classified as being humid subtropical (K\u00f6ppen Cfa), with short, cool, damp winters, very hot and humid summers, and plenty of rainfall. January temperatures average 3 to 8\u00a0\u00b0C (37 to 46\u00a0\u00b0F) while July temperatures average around 27 to 30\u00a0\u00b0C (81 to 86\u00a0\u00b0F). Average annual precipitation is 1,200 to 1,700 millimetres (47 to 67\u00a0in).\nThe Furongian Epoch in the Cambrian Period of geological time is named for Hunan; Furong (\u8299\u84c9) means \"lotus\" in Mandarin and refers to Hunan which is known as the \"lotus state\".[26]"

The storm formed as an area of low pressure in the Arafura Sea, and moved westward. After receiving the name Clare on 7 January, the system ultimately peaked at Category 3 intensity on the Australian tropical cyclone scale. It moved ashore on the coast of the Pilbara and proceeded inland, dissipating on 10 January. Clare produced winds of 142\u00a0km/h (88\u00a0mph) at Karratha and triggered widespread torrential rainfall that led to flooding. Following its usage, the name Clare was retired by the Bureau of Meteorology, and will never be used again for a tropical cyclone in the area."

        "content": "On 4 January 2006, a weak area of low pressure was situated in the Arafura Sea. It moved westward, and by 6 January, it was located in the Timor Sea.[1] That same day, both the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) and the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) identified the system as a tropical disturbance.[2][3] On 7 January, the low began to show signs of strengthening. Continuing to organise, the BoM designated it as Tropical Cyclone Clare shortly thereafter. At the time, it was centred approximately 265\u00a0mi (426\u00a0km) to the north of Broome and moving west-southwestward.[1] The JTWC classified the cyclone, locally designated 05S, as a tropical storm at 1800 UTC.[3] By early on 8 January, the storm had begun to steadily gain power. Later that day, Clare achieved severe tropical cyclone status while located around 170\u00a0mi (270\u00a0km) north of Port Hedland. Tracking southwestward, the storm continued to mature.[1] On 9 January, the JTWC estimated the storm to have peaked in intensity with maximum sustained 1-minute winds of 110\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 980 millibars.[3] However, the BoM reported the storm to have been somewhat more intense, with sustained 10-minute winds of 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph) and a barometric pressure of 964 millibars.[2] This made Clare a Category 3 on the Australian tropical cyclone scale. Clare maintained roughly the same intensity as its track became more southerly. At 1600 UTC on 9 January the storm made landfall at the Pilbara to the west of Dampier. Heading ashore, the storm began to quickly deteriorate,[1] and both the JTWC and the BoM declared it dissipated on 10 January as it continued southward.[2][3] Throughout the storm's course, the JTWC's intensity estimates were below that of the BoM. Also, it is reported that the cyclone's presentation on satellite was not representative of its actual intensity.[1]"

Offshore, oil rigs were shut down and ports were closed.[4] At least 2,000 residents were evacuated from their homes in potentially susceptible areas of the Karratha region.[5] In areas between Broome and Port Hedland, people were urged to tidy debris and organise disaster supplies to prepare for the storm.[6] Upon moving ashore, the storm produced winds of 131\u00a0km/h (81\u00a0mph) at Legendre Island and a gust of 142\u00a0km/h (88\u00a0mph) at Karratha. Heavy precipitation\u2014often exceeding 200\u00a0mm (7.9\u00a0in)\u2014was recorded along the central Pilbara coast. Rainfall at Wickham totalled 215\u00a0mm (8.5\u00a0in), with 212\u00a0mm (8.3\u00a0in) at Karratha and more moderate amounts elsewhere. Since storm surge from the cyclone peaked during low tide, it was not severe and caused no known damage.[7] Clare produced extensive flooding that forced the closure of numerous roads,[8] including part of the North West Coastal Highway.[7] It also triggered torrential rains and flooding in southern areas of the country, including Gascoyne and the South-West Land Division. There, 224\u00a0mm (8.8\u00a0in) of rain fell in 24 hours. Additionally, the Greenough River surpassed its banks; a sandbagging effort prevented the resultant floods from inundating the town of Walkaway.[7] The storm cut off power and left tens of thousands of residents without telephone service.[9] Property damage was generally minor, and no casualties or significant injuries from the storm were reported.[7] The name Clare was retired following its usage in 2006. On 13 January 2006, the town of Lake Grace in the south of the state was flooded by Cyclone Clare, receiving 230\u00a0mm of rainfall. It was declared a disaster zone by the State Government.[10][11]"

Tourists are attracted by its natural environment.[5] August is the peak tourist season when thousands of western backpackers come to the area.

The cloudburst itself occurred between 0000\u20130030 hours IST on 6 August 2010, leading to flash flooding, debris flows, and mudflows over the region. The rainfall distribution was highly spatially variable. The most intense part of the storm was focused in a 6-kilometre (3.7\u00a0mi)-wide band parallel to, and a few kilometers from, the river Indus. This band was centred over most of the major settlements in the area, including Leh.[2] Outside the band, the rainfall intensity was unremarkable; the only weather station in the area, at Leh airport, recorded just 12.8 millimetres (0.50\u00a0in) of total rainfall for the night of 6 August.[12] However, within it precipitation intensities were over an order of magnitude higher, peaking at at least 150\u00a0mm/h (5.9\u00a0in/h) over Leh during the most intense part of the storm.[2] Estimates of the maximum total rainfall in some places were as high as 250 millimetres (9.8\u00a0in).[13] Note that the implied 75 millimetres (3.0\u00a0in) of rain over Leh during the most intense part of the storm is equivalent to around a year's worth of rain falling in 30 minutes. The rains occurred at night, and surprised everyone.[14] In Leh, many buildings were destroyed including hospitals, the bus terminal, radio station transmitter, telephone exchange and mobile-phone towers. BSNL communication systems were fully destroyed. Communications were later restored by the Indian Army.[8] The local bus station was severely damaged and some of the buses were carried more than a mile by the mud.[9] The city's airport was damaged but was rapidly repaired to allow relief flights the following day.  The village of Choglamsar on the outskirts of the city was particularly badly hit.[5] In neighbouring valleys, large numbers of smaller villages which lay under the main rainfall band were also heavily damaged, with large numbers of casualties. As in Leh, much of the destruction was caused by debris flows coming from the rocky sidewalls of the valleys, not by the flooding itself.[2] Notable impacts occurred in Sobu, Phyang, Nimu, Nyeh, and Basgo villages. In total, almost 1500 homes in 71 settlements across the area were reported to have been damaged.[1] Detailed mapping and estimation of the entrapped sediment mass within the transverse stream valleys of various sectors of Himalaya is required to predict the style of mass transfer during such events.[15] All of the estimated 3000 tourists in Leh, including 1000 foreigners were safe according to local officials.[16] Outside the town, six tourists were reported killed. However, official documents indicate that at least 255 local residents were killed, with a further 29 never found.[1] The true toll may have been significantly higher, perhaps more than 600 people.[2][17]"

Chidambaram said that over 6,000 security personnel were deployed in Leh for rescue operations. Prime minister Manmohan Singh expressed grief and announced compensation of Rs. 100,000 to the kin of deceased and Rs. 50,000 for those injured.[8] Chief Minister of the state Omar Abdullah directed the administration to undertake relief effort on a war footing.[19]"

The cyclone came from the sea towards the Rio Grande territory and arrived with less strength in the state of Santa Catarina, where it returned to the sea.[3] It was the sixteenth named storm to hit Brazil since Cyclone Catarina in 2004. Its severity was confirmed on 16 May 2022 by the National Meteorological Institute (INMET) and the Brazilian Navy, which automatically classified it as an orange alert, meaning a subtropical storm. The orange level is the penultimate level of the scale, and its promotion to the red level was not ruled out.[4] Winds of up to 100\u00a0km/h have been projected, and for this reason, both regional and federal civil defence had not denied the possibility of the cyclone turning into a hurricane as it moved towards land.[5] Yakecan caused two fatalities in Uruguay and Brazil. The first death in Uruguay happened when strong winds caused a palm tree to fall on the roof of a house. The other case was reported in Porto Alegre, where a fisherman's boat sank in Lake Gua\u00edba.[6][7] In the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, the wind brought down a hot air balloon on the banks of Rodovia Castello Branco, in the rural area between the towns of Boituva and Porto Feliz, the balloon carried nine people on board who were immediately rescued. One of them was in serious condition.[8] On the 17 May, due to the intensity of the cold air mass that accompanied the cyclone, its humidity caused freezing rain and snowfall in the higher portions of southern Santa Catarina and Paran\u00e1.[9][10][11] The name \u201cYakecan\u201d comes from Tupi-Guarani word meaning \"sound from the sky\".[12] The cyclone began to lose intensity as it moved northeastward and when it turned eastward away from the coast of S\u00e3o Paulo it dissipated in late 19 May, according to the CHM synoptic chart.[13]"

The gusts reached close to 100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph) and INUMET (Uruguay's National Meteorological Institute) declared an orange alert for the whole country.[31][32] In the Uruguayan capital Montevideo, a 23-year-old man died after a tree collapsed onto his home.[24]"

On New Year's Eve, heavy rains led to the collapse of earthen dams, which in turn led to the destruction of many homes in the valley and many deaths."

With RSMC Nadi reporting by 18:00\u00a0UTC (07:00\u00a0UTC+13, December 18) that the system had weakened into a category 3 severe tropical cyclone.[19][20] By December 19, wind shear from the northwest had exposed the system's low level circulation center completely, pushing the bulk of convection and thunderstorm activity about 120\u00a0km (75\u00a0mi) to the southeast of the center. Evan had also moved into cooler sea surface temperatures, below 27\u00a0\u00b0C (81\u00a0\u00b0C), so evaporation and thunderstorm development had waned, leading to falling cloud heights because of less moisture.[21] Later that same day, RSMC Nadi reported that Cyclone Evan had weakened below cyclone intensity and declassified it as a tropical cyclone, before the JTWC issued their final warning later that day as the system started to transition into an extratropical cyclone.[22][23] Over the next couple of days the remnant low continued moving southwards and moved below 25\u00b0S and into the Wellington tropical cyclone warning centre's (TCWC Wellington area of responsibility.[24][25] During December 21, the system started to move towards the southwest as it directed a moist tropical airmass onto the North Island during the next day.[24][26] The remnants of Evan were last noted by TCWC Wellington during December 25.[27][28]"

Many of the roads were blocked by flood waters and downed banana trees. Evan also caused damage to Faleolo International Airport in Apia, where the departures lounge collapsed, forcing its temporary closure.

A water treatment plant near Apia was also reported destroyed.[57] At least three deaths were reported after the storm,[58] including two children who were in low-lying areas and drowned. Authorities expressed concern over about the fate of at least 7 people who are still missing, as well as up to 3,000 others now living in emergency shelters.[59][60] The US Ambassador to New Zealand and Samoa David Huebner confirmed the United States had provided NZ$60,000 to the Samoan Red Cross for relief operations. New Zealand authorities said they were also ready to provide financial aid, if the local government requests it. On December 15, they did provide NZ$50,000, as well as a P-3 Orion plane to search for eight missing fishermen.[61] Two days later the New Zealand Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully announced an additional NZ$550,000 was to be made available to the Samoan government, as well as the Samoan Red Cross and any agencies on the ground that might need it. Five additional New Zealand Red Cross workers were also sent to support local efforts. The Samoan Parliament opened with a somber prayer session, as the legislators prepared to receive initial assessments of the economic damage wrecked by Evan. According to reports, the bill is expected to be at least NZ$200,000,000, and possibly rise as high as 300 million.[62][63] On December 17, Samoan authorities confirmed that the death toll reached 14, after rescuers abandoned the search for 10\u00a0missing sailors.[64] In all, damage from the storm amounted to WS$465\u00a0million (US$204\u00a0million).[65]"

        "content": " Tropical Cyclone Sose was a moderate storm system that chiefly impacted the island nation of Vanuatu in early April 2001. The developing cyclone was first detected on April 3, while situated well to the northeast of Vanuatu. As atmospheric conditions became more conducive to intensification, the disturbance gradually consolidated as it drifted toward the west-southwest. After receiving the name Sose on April 5, the cyclone was driven southeastward, passing just west of Espiritu Santo and neighboring islands. Although it never made landfall, Sose was particularly expansive, producing a wide area of gale-force winds. The cyclone peaked in strength between April 7 and 8 with maximum 10-minute sustained winds of 110\u00a0km/h (68\u00a0mph) and 1-minute sustained winds of 130\u00a0km/h (81\u00a0mph), placing it at Category 2 intensity on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. Ultimately, stronger wind shear and an increasingly hostile upper-air pattern took their toll on the cyclone as it progressed due south; Sose lost tropical characteristics to the northeast of Norfolk Island by April 12. The extratropical remnants of Sose continued into the Tasman Sea. Occurring just two months after Cyclone Paula affected Vanuatu, Sose compounded the damage already done by the previous storm, especially to crops and farmlands. Throughout the island chain, two people died to the storm. Roadways were blocked by debris and floodwaters, while schools and classrooms on several islands were damaged or ruined. The storm destroyed about 200 homes around the nation and damaged many more, particularly on southern Espiritu Santo. The storm's large fetch generated enormous swells as far away as Australia's Eastern Seaboard, where surfers took advantage of the abnormally intense conditions and two swimmers drowned. On Mar\u00e9 Island in New Caledonia, a man was swept away by a large wave and presumed dead. The storm later produced torrential rainfall and strong winds over the North Island of New Zealand, sparking damaging freshwater floods and downing trees and power lines. Hazardous driving conditions in the Waikato region led to a fatal traffic accident in which three people died. Another individual drowned in a swollen river. Sose reportedly contributed to coastal flooding as far away as Tonga. In all, Sose killed nine people; total monetary damage is unknown. As a result of the storm's destruction, its name was later retired."

        "content": "Cyclone Sose originated in a broad area of disturbed weather first identified on April\u00a03, well to the east-northeast of Vanuatu. \n[1] The system initially drifted generally toward the west under an improving upper-level wind shear pattern that began to catalyze favorable outflow.[2] Late on April\u00a04, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the disturbance,[3] noting strong banding features and a well-defined low-level center of circulation.[4] Tropical Depression\u00a013F formed at 1200\u00a0UTC next day as examined by the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS), the local Regional Specialized Meteorological Center.[5] At the time, the new cyclone was situated about 140\u00a0km (87\u00a0mi) to the northwest of Espiritu Santo.[1] The JTWC's official \"best track\" entry on the storm\u2014designated 19P\u2014first lists it as a tropical depression at 1800\u00a0UTC on April\u00a04,[6] though operationally, the agency did not issue its first tropical cyclone warning until late on April\u00a05.[4] The storm proceeded slowly westward and gradually continued to organize, its intensification hindered by residual wind shear and its proximity to the mountainous terrain of Espiritu Santo.[1] However, convection over the center continued to develop, and consequently the FMS upgraded 13F to Tropical Cyclone Sose at 1800\u00a0UTC.[2] Sose remained nearly stationary for a period of 24\u00a0hours, blocked by a strong subtropical ridge to the south. Over the course of April\u00a06, an approaching mid-level trough of low pressure created a weakness in the ridge, allowing Sose to accelerate southeastward.[1] The storm's environment steadily improved in both the lower and upper levels, triggering the consolidation of deep convection around the center. As a result, early on April\u00a07, a central dense overcast formed.[2] According to the FMS, Sose reached its peak strength at 1800\u00a0UTC, with maximum 10-minute sustained winds of 110\u00a0km/h (68\u00a0mph) and a central barometric pressure of 975\u00a0hPa (28.8\u00a0inHg).[5] The cyclone passed just to the west of the islands of Vanuatu as its outer bands contracted around the well-defined central dense overcast. A large feeder band persisted on the eastern side of the circulation, bridging the northwestern southeastern quadrants. The feature became a notable aspect of the cyclone's satellite presentation.[1][4] The JTWC estimated that 19P reached its peak intensity at 1200\u00a0UTC on April\u00a08, possessing 1-minute sustained winds of 130\u00a0km/h (81\u00a0mph) and gusts up to 170\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph).[3] The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission imaged the storm shortly thereafter, and revealed a distinct eye about 44\u00a0km (27\u00a0mi) across, bounded on the southern semicircle by strong convection activity.[4] Sose made its closest approach to New Caledonia early on April 8, passing about 280\u00a0km (170\u00a0mi) to the northeast.[4] A strong area of high pressure over New Zealand served to tighten to surface pressure gradient well to the south of Sose's center, contributing to an overall very large envelope of gale-force winds.[1] In turn, the cyclone affected numerous islands on both side of its path, despite never having made landfall.[2] As it progressed on its southeastward track, the cyclone began to show signs of weakening, at least partially due to increasing wind shear from an approaching upper trough.[1] At the same time, a mid-level ridge to the east forced the storm to turn due south; the conflicting wind patterns undermined the cyclone's circulation, causing its center at the surface to separate from the deep convection.[1] Both the FMS and the JTWC reflected steady weakening,[6][5] and by early on April 10, the center had become exposed and ill-defined.[4] Sose then entered the area of responsibility of the Tropical Cyclone Warning Center in Wellington, New Zealand, where it continued to deteriorate.[2] The JTWC issued its last warning on 19P at 0600 UTC on April 11, while the system was located about 335\u00a0km (208\u00a0mi) northeast of Norfolk Island.[4] TCWC Wellington soon downgraded Sose to a tropical depression as it underwent an extratropical transition. Drifting south-southwestward, the cyclone lost its tropical identity early on April 12.[1][5] The remnant low ultimately moved over the Tasman Sea,[7] where it was absorbed by a broad low pressure system about to travel over New Zealand's North Island. Abundant residual tropical moisture acted on the low pressure environment to create widespread precipitation across northern New Zealand.[8]"

Police increased their presence to unprecedented levels in an attempt to control speeding and other hazardous behaviors.[13] Due to the storm's \"negative impact on one or more countries\", Sose was retired from the cyclical list of tropical cyclone names;[14]"

Most severely impacted were the islands of Espiritu Santo, Malakula, Aoba, Efate, Erromango, Tanna, Aneityum, and the Shepherd Islands.[11] In several locations, Sose compounded or worsened the destruction wrought by Cyclone Paula in late February and early March.[1]  The storm produced significant precipitation, heavy seas, and sustained winds exceeding 100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph).[15] A resident of Malakula was struck and killed by a falling coconut while seeking shelter from the worsening conditions.[16][17] Agriculture on nearby Ahamb Island, already impaired by Paula, was further compromised; all crops, both those remaining after Paula and those planted in the intervening time, were destroyed. Four classrooms on the small island were also damaged beyond use. Buildings on Aoba incurred appreciable damage, while on Efate, the storm brought down utility poles, severely damaged local schools, and left roads covered with debris and floodwaters. Flooding in the nation's capital city of Port Vila forced 50 residents to leave their homes in search of higher ground. Espiritu Santo, particularly the island's south shore around Luganville, bore the brunt of Cyclone Sose. Several types of crops (also weakened by Paula) took a heavy beating, and 60 people had to evacuate due to encroaching floods. In total, the storm demolished 59 houses on the island and in some way damaged another 101. A young child drowned after being swept away while attempting to cross a swollen waterway. Just offshore, the M/V Omale succumbed to the heavy seas; all 16 of its occupants successfully swam four hours to shore.[1] Overall, the Vanuatu National Disaster Management Office estimated at least 50% each of food crops and buildings in the hardest-hit provinces were left in a state of damage.[11] The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs considered about 200 residences throughout the island nation \"lost\" to the storm.[18] The National Disaster Committee met on April 9 to discuss potential emergency aid for residents of the areas hardest hit by cyclones Sose and Paula. Around the same time, the Vanuatu Red Cross stated that it would distribute supplies such as materials for makeshift shelters and water purification tablets. The Red Cross was also to provide 500 bags of rice to villages in the Shepherd Islands. Political unrest on a national level limited the government's attention to initial recovery; it did not immediate declare a state of emergency or file any requests for international aid.[11]"

        "content": "The remnants of Cyclone Sose were a significant factor in stormy weather over the North Island of New Zealand between April 12 and April 14. Numerous locations received 10 to 20\u00a0cm (4 to 8\u00a0in) of rainfall, and 23.0\u00a0cm (9.1\u00a0in) of precipitation fell at Glenbervie, Northland region, in just seven hours. The heavy rainfall rates caused \"significant\" flooding of low-lying roads and farmlands in the region. Floodwaters inundated the township of Kaeo and entered several local businesses. The swollen Kaeo River temporarily rendered New Zealand State Highway 10 impassable to most vehicles at a bridge over the waterway. A hospital became isolated from the rest of the town. Further to the west, State Highway 1 was blocked by flooding at Rangiahua, as was State Highway 2 between Te Puke and Te Maunga Junction. At the former, the rains triggered a landslide and polluted the local supply of drinking water. Several residences throughout the region sustained damage. A 22-year-old man drowned in high waters along the Wairoa River.[7] Rising waters from the Kerikeri River threatened to affect the Mission House, the nation's oldest surviving building, where staff were on standby to relocate furnishings if necessary.[19] A severe traffic accident occurred on State Highway 28 at Tapapa, Waikato, on the morning of April 13. The head-on collision was attributed to slick roads resulting from the storm. Three individuals were killed and two more were hospitalized. Several other accidents were reported around the same time. In addition to the rainfall, strong winds brought down trees and utility poles across the island and as far south as Marlborough on the South Island. There, the strong winds fanned a large fire ignited by sparks from downed power lines. The fire covered more than 70 hectares (175 acres) of land and prompted several families to evacuate their homes. Three people were injured at Ohakune after a temporary tent collapsed at a local festival. Along the coast, swells triggered by Sose reached 3.5\u00a0m (11\u00a0ft) in height.[7] The tight pressure gradient between Cyclone Sose and the ridge to its south generated extremely rough seas along the eastern coast of Australia, especially Queensland. Along the state's southern shore, normally protected from strong swells, waves were as high as 8\u00a0m (26\u00a0ft) and frequently between 4\u20135\u00a0m (13\u201316\u00a0ft). A 53-year-old man and his 9-year-old son both drowned in the heavy surf near Gladstone on April 8.[1][20] Offshore Kingscliff, New South Wales, a yacht capsized, forcing its two occupants to swim to land.[20] The large swells proved popular with experienced surfers looking for a challenge.[21] Although the event became infamous within local surfing circles,[22] at least one surfer was hospitalized after being swept against rocks, and several others required rescue. Some beach erosion was reported in several locations,[23] leading to minor sandbagging efforts to hamper the erosion.[21]"

Coastal flooding on low-lying islands of Tonga reportedly destroyed houses and crops.[24]"

The EU would like to congratulate India and its democratic system for conduct of fair elections, unmarred by violence, in the state of Jammu and Kashmir\".[20][21][22] The European Parliament also takes cognizance of the fact that a large number of Kashmiri voters turned out despite calls for the boycott of elections by certain separatist forces.[21] However, elected Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mufti Muhammad Sayeed said, \"If God forbid the Hurriyat and the militants tried to disrupt the elections there would not have been as participative as they had been. They (Pakistan) also allowed these elections to take place.\" Ruling Party president Mehbooba Mufti also defended Mufti's remarks.[23] While taking a dig at Mufti's statement former Chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir and leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad said that, \"In fact, Pakistan and militant groups tried their best to destabilize the democratic process in the state.\"[24][25]"

As part of the deal, Nirmal Kumar Singh was to be the chief minister and JKNC's MLA Ali Mohammad Sagar was to be his deputy.[citation needed] The deal fell through after a revolt in the JKNC. The BJP also rejected this deal, citing morality issues.[citation needed] In the following days, the JKNC also announced its intention to support the PDP from outside by submitting a letter to the governor Narinder Nath Vohra after the dialogue with the BJP fell through. The PDP refused. A week after the results, the PDP and the BJP officially started talks. Both parties had a two-member team to form a Common Minimum Programme (CMP). The PDP was represented by Naeem Akhtar and Haseeb Drabu, while Ram Madhav and Nirmal Kumar Singh represented the BJP. Minister of State in the PMO, Jitendra Singh, supervised the dialogue. Omar Abdullah resigned as chief minister on 24 December. The Governor[who?] accepted his resignation but asked him to continue in an interim capacity until the formation of a new government. President's rule was imposed on 1 January 2015. After dealing with issues, both parties turned their attention to the composition of the cabinet. The PDP was initially reluctant for a three-year rotation of the chief minister's post but later agreed. There were also issues related to the joining of the government by separatist-turned-politician Sajjad Lone. In the run-up to the election, he met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and praised him by calling him \"big brother.\" The BJP reciprocated by not running a candidate against Lone for the Handwara seat, from where he won, and got elected to the assembly for the first time. Both parties announced on 25 February that the CMP was almost ready, in a joint press conference called by BJP national President Amit Shah and PDP President Mehbooba Mufti. They also stated that the ideological differences had been \"ironed out\" and both parties were now working on the formation of a cabinet. The dialogue between both parties ended successfully on 18 February - two months and 5 days after the beginning of talks. The new PDP-BJP government took the oath of office on 1 March in the Zorawar Singh Stadium of Jammu, with Mufti Mohammad Sayeed as chief minister for the full term of six years and Nirmal Kumar Singh as his deputy. Modi was also present for the occasion. Twelve cabinet ministers from each party were also sworn-in. This was the first time that the BJP was a coalition partner in the Jammu and Kashmir government. Lone and independent MLA for Udhampur, Pawan Kumar Gupta, were also sworn-in as cabinet ministers from the BJP's quota. The CMP was then released in a press conference. The CMP gave a vision of the \"all-around development of Jammu and Kashmir\" and \"Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas\" (with everyone, everyone's development). Contentious issues like Article 370 and AFSPA would be referred to a high-power committee, with representation from both parties and civil society. The PDP also agreed to join the NDA's central, with Mehbooba Mufti's induction into the union cabinet, at a later date, and also support the Modi government in both houses of parliament."

        "content": " The Central African Republic is a landlocked nation within the interior of the African continent. It is bordered by  Cameroon, Chad, Sudan, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of the Congo. Much of the country consists of flat, or rolling plateau savanna, about 1,640 feet (500\u00a0m) above sea level. In the northeast are the Fertit Hills, and there are scattered hills in the southwestern part of the country. To the northwest is the Karre Mountains (also known as Yade Massif), a granite plateau with an altitude of 3,750 feet (1,143\u00a0m). At 622,984 square kilometres (240,535\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), the Central African Republic is the world's 45th-largest country (after Somalia). It is comparable in size to Ukraine. Much of the southern border is formed by tributaries of the Congo River, with the Mbomou River in the east merging with the Uele River to form the Ubangi River. In the west, the Sangha River flows through part of the country. The eastern border lies along the edge of the Congo-Nile watershed. In the Central African Republic forest cover is around 36% of the total land area, equivalent to 22,303,000 hectares (ha) of forest in 2020, down from 23,203,000 hectares (ha) in 1990. In 2020, naturally regenerating forest covered 22,301,000 hectares (ha) and planted forest covered 2,000 hectares (ha). Of the naturally regenerating forest 9% was reported to be primary forest (consisting of native tree species with no clearly visible indications of human activity). For the year 2015, 91% of the forest area was reported to be under public ownership and 9% private ownership.[1][2] In 2021, the rate of deforestation in the Central African Republic increased by 71%.[3] The forest is highly diverse and includes commercially important species of Ayous, Sapele and Sipo."

There is a wet season and a dry season, and the temperature is hot throughout the year. The northern areas are subject to harmattan winds, which are hot, dry, and carry dust. The tip of the northern regions have been subject to desertification. The remainder of the country is prone to flooding from nearby rivers.

        "content": " Tropical Cyclone Emma was a weak but unusually large tropical cyclone that affected a substantial portion of Western Australia during the 2005\u201306 Australian region cyclone season. Forming out of an area of low pressure on 25 February, the precursor to Emma slowly tracked southward. Although classified tropical, the structure of the system represented that of a monsoonal storm. However, low wind shear and well-developed outflow gradually allowed convection to develop near the centre of circulation. As the system approached the Pilbara coastline of Western Australia on 27 February, it intensified into a Category 1 cyclone and attained peak 10-minute sustained winds of 75\u00a0km/h (47\u00a0mph). After moving inland near Mardie, Emma weakened to a tropical low but became exceedingly large; its cloud cover obscured most of Western Australia. The remnants of the weak storm persisted until 1 March, at which time they dissipated over the Great Australian Bight. Although a weak storm, rainfall from Emma caused flooding in numerous parts of Western Australia. In Karratha, six people required rescue after their cars became stranded in floodwaters. The most significant damage took place along the Murchison River which swelled to roughly 20\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi) in width. Although only one town was threatened by the river, large areas of farmland were inundated by the expanding river, leading to substantial agricultural losses. Despite the extensive flooding, no fatalities were reported as a result of Emma."

        "content": "Tropical Cyclone Emma originated from an area of low pressure that formed to the southeast of Java on 22 February 2006. Over the following few days, a monsoonal trough developed over the Timor Sea, leading to an increased likelihood of tropical cyclone formation from the initial low within several days.[1] On 25 February, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology began monitoring the system as a tropical low.[2] The low tracked slowly towards the south throughout the day and the centre of circulation relocated farther south late on 26 February.[1] By this time, the Bureau of Meteorology anticipated the low to develop into a tropical cyclone and attain winds of 95\u00a0km/h (59\u00a0mph) 10-minute sustained) before moving over land in Western Australia.[3] Early on 27 February, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified the system as a tropical depression.[4] During the day, a QuikSCAT pass revealed a broad low-level circulation with the highest winds located around the periphery of the storm, a characteristic of monsoonal systems. Although it was situated within a region of low wind shear and underneath an anticyclone, convective activity was mostly present in the system's large outer bands.[1] Later that day, the Bureau of Meteorology upgraded the system to a Category 1 cyclone on the Australian intensity scale and named it Emma.[2] At this time, Emma was located roughly 305\u00a0km (190\u00a0mi) north of Onslow, Western Australia.[1] Several hours later, the JTWC classified Emma as Tropical Storm 15S[4] following the development of convection near the centre of circulation.[1] The storm continued to track southward in response to a strong mid to upper-level ridge situated over central Australia.[5] Emma attained its peak wind speed of 75\u00a0km/h (47\u00a0mph) 10-minute sustained) late on 27 February as it neared landfall.[2] However, the JTWC assessed Emma to have been slightly weaker, peaking with winds of 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph) 1-minute sustained).[4] The storm maintained this intensity through its landfall early on 28 February near Mardie along the Pilbara coastline. Shortly after moving over land, the JTWC declared Emma extratropical and issued their final advisory on the storm.[1][4] The Bureau of Meteorology, however, continued to monitor the cyclone as it rapidly tracked over Western Australia.[2] Over land, the storm became unusually large, with outer bands from the storm covering most of Western Australia.[6] Late on 28 February, the lowest barometric pressure in relation to Emma, 988 hPa (29.18\u00a0inHg), was recorded at Meekatharra.[2] The remnants of Emma persisted through most of 1 March before the system moved over the Great Australian Bight and dissipated.[2] The Australian Bureau of Meteorology uses 10-minute sustained winds, while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center uses one-minute sustained winds.[7][8] The Bureau of Meteorology's peak intensity for Emma was 75\u00a0km/h (47\u00a0mph) 10-minute sustained, or 85\u00a0km/h (53\u00a0mph) one-minute sustained.[2][8] The JTWC's peak intensity for Emma was 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph) one-minute sustained, or 55\u00a0km/h (34\u00a0mph) 10-minute sustained.[4][8]"

The Bureau of Meteorology also issued tropical cyclone warnings for most of the Pilbara coastline on 28 February.[11] The same day, the Fire and Emergency Services of Australia issued a Yellow Alert[12] for Point Samson, Roebourne, Wickham, Dampier, Karratha, and Mardie. Residents in these areas were advised to evacuate if necessary and ensure that all cyclone preparations had been completed. Shelters were also opened for residents who sought need for one.[13] Schools throughout the Pilbara region were also closed for several days as a result of the storm.[14] Due to the low intensity of the storm at landfall, little or no wind damage took place from Emma. On land, sustained winds were recorded up to 78\u00a0km/h (48\u00a0mph) and gusts up to 95\u00a0km/h (59\u00a0mph).[1] A storm surge of 0.8\u00a0m (2.6\u00a0ft) was recorded at Dampier but, no damage resulted from it.[2] Heavy rains produced by the storm caused moderate to severe flooding in Western Australia. In Karratha, six people were rescued from two cars after they became stranded on a flooded road.[2][9] Total rainfall from the storm was 306\u00a0mm (12.0\u00a0in), recorded at Karratha Airport.[15][16] Localised flooding was reported in Pannawonica and Tom Price.[9][10] Some buildings reported minor flooding but overall structural damage was minimal.[14] The 190\u00a0mm (7.5\u00a0in) of rain that fell in a 24-hour span in Karratha pushed the city above its annual average rainfall totals in the first two months of the year.[1][17] Near the Yarraloola Station, the Robe River overflowed its banks, inundating the area and forcing the evacuation of everyone in the homestead.[18] In the Gascoyne region 30 cattle drowned after flood waters rapidly overtook a pasture.[19] In the Murchison region, rainfall exceeding 100\u00a0mm (3.9\u00a0in)[20] brought the worst floods in decades, inundating numerous farms and causing substantial agricultural losses.[21] Two weeks after the storm passed, the mouth of the Murchison River was closed after a ship became stranded in the swollen river.[20] By 14 March, the river had broadened to roughly 20\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi) in places normally 500\u00a0m (1,600\u00a0ft) in width.[22] These values marked the largest flood ever recorded in the river's history.[23] Officials distributed sandbags to build temporary levee to protect low-lying areas.[20] The largest operation took place at Kalbarri, near the mouth of the river, where 60 firefighters and 18 volunteers worked to put up 9,000\u00a0sandbags.[22] The Billabalong and Twinpeaks stations were also isolated from surrounding areas after the Murchison River inundated the area.[24] Several stations in the area remained under water for over a month and farmers requested urgent assistance from the government to help alleviate losses.[21] Initial damage from the storm was placed at A$1\u00a0million ($706,580 USD).[22] Flood waters from the Murchison River finally began to recede on 17 March; however, it took several weeks for the river to return to its normal level.[25] Although Emma had only minor effects in Carnarvon, the town enacted a A$14\u00a0million (US$10\u00a0million) flood protection plan in the wake of the storm. The plan would lead to the construction of new levees in areas surrounding the town and keep flood waters within Nicol Bay Flats. Additionally, four sections of the North West Coastal Highway were set to be upgraded for similar reasons.[26] Due to the combined effects of Cyclones Clare, Darryl, Jim, Emma, Kate and Glenda, gold production in Australia fell by 8 percent, resulting in earnings losses of A$130\u00a0million.[27] In January 2006, the town of Lake Grace in the south of the state was flooded by Cyclone Clare, receiving 230\u00a0mm of rainfall. It was declared a disaster zone by the State Government. Just over two weeks later, the town received another 30\u00a0mm of rain from Cyclone Emma. Large pumps were brought in to help dry out flooded roads, and the main highway to Perth was reopened six weeks later.[28][29]"

        "content": " Tropical Storm Arlene brought torrential rainfall to the western United States Gulf Coast, particularly to the U.S. state of Texas, in June\u00a01993. The first named storm of the 1993 Atlantic hurricane season, Arlene developed from an area of low pressure in the Bay of Campeche on June\u00a018. The depression slowly strengthened as it tracked west-northwestward and later north-northwestward across the western Gulf of Mexico. Arlene was subsequently upgraded to a tropical storm on June\u00a019, but failed to intensify further due to its proximity to land. The cyclone then made landfall on Padre Island, Texas, with winds of 40\u00a0mph (65\u00a0km/h) and degenerated into a remnant disturbance on June\u00a021. The precursor disturbance to Tropical Storm Arlene dropped heavy rainfall over Central America. As a result, 20\u00a0fatalities occurred, all of which were from a mudslide in El Salvador. Heavy rainfall also produced heavy rainfall on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. After Arlene became a tropical cyclone, rainfall in Mexico inundated areas of Campeche, where damage totaled US$33\u00a0million.[nb 1] In total, five people were killed in Mexico. Flood damage in South Texas was extensive, with widespread urban flooding and road closures. Entire plots of farmland were inundated by torrential rains brought by Arlene. The landfalling Arlene interacted with a passing cold front which helped to produce showers further northeast, though damage in those locales was comparatively less severe. In total, Arlene caused 26\u00a0deaths and at least US$60.8\u00a0million in damage."

        "content": "The precursor to Arlene was first identified in satellite images as a cluster of disturbed weather east of the Mosquito Coast on June\u00a09. Over the following week, the system grew in expanse as it slowly tracked northwestward as strong wind shear in the area prohibited the development of a tropical cyclone. On June\u00a016, the formation of an upper-level low over the Bay of Campeche and the progression of a tropical wave across the Caribbean Sea helped foster the development of a low-pressure area over the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. Although initially diffuse, new rainbands began to wrap around the new vortex's center, and at 0000\u00a0UTC, the National Hurricane Center\u00a0(NHC) classified the system as a tropical depression west of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. Although the storm was now considered a tropical cyclone, wind shear that had earlier inhibited development remained present, as well as the outflow of Tropical Storm Beatriz in the Eastern Pacific, disrupting the core of the infant tropical depression; aircraft reconnaissance often could not identify a defined center of circulation.[1] While the initial system in the Bay of Campeche continued to struggle in its organization, a new cluster of thunderstorms concentrated in a band developed to the depression's northwest late on June\u00a018. Over the next 24\u00a0hours, this new area of precipitation began to wrap cyclonically around a new and dominant circulation center;[2] the NHC assumed the tropical depression to have relocated to the northwest and classified the system as Tropical Storm Arlene at 1200\u00a0UTC on June\u00a019.[3] As Arlene would not strengthen after classification, peak intensity was attained concurrent with its upgrade to tropical storm strength with maximum sustained winds of 40\u00a0mph (65\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1000\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.71\u00a0inHg).[4] Meandering off the coast of South Texas due to the presence of a shortwave trough to its north, Arlene eventually made landfall at 0900\u00a0UTC on June\u00a020 at a virtually unchanged intensity at point on Padre Island roughly 45\u00a0mi (70\u00a0km) south of Corpus Christi, Texas. The tropical storm quickly deteriorated to tropical depression intensity after landfall,[2] and was no longer considered a tropical cyclone after 0600\u00a0UTC on June\u00a021.[4] The remnants of Arlene continued to track across the Rio Grande Valley before they faded into the ambient environment.[2]"

As a tropical cyclone, however, Arlene's highest rainfall total occurred in the Camargo Municipality of Tamaulipas, where 7.32\u00a0in (186\u00a0mm) of rain was reported.[8] In Matamoros, roads were blocked by mud and rocks.[7] Arlene passed over several offshore oil platforms as it tracked northwestward across the Gulf of Mexico, producing gusty winds. The strongest surface wind gust reported in association with Arlene was clocked at 63\u00a0mph (101\u00a0km/h) on an oil platform south of Sabine Pass, Texas.

Issued 21\u00a0hours before landfall, the warning was discontinued after the system moved inland.[10] Prior to the warning, Arlene had satisfied the criterion for a tropical storm watch as a developing tropical depression. However, the NHC and various National Weather Service forecast offices opted to delay the watch as a result of the poorly organized appearance of the cyclone at the time.[6] Given the weak nature of Arlene and the relatively unpopulated extent of coast which it impacted, evacuations were minimal\u00a0\u2013 only fifteen fled from summer homes along Magnolia Beach and Indianola, Texas due to the threat of flooding.[5] On the Texas coast, Arlene produced a small storm surge peaking at 4\u00a0ft (1.2\u00a0m) in some areas, breaching sections of Padre Island and causing flooding. The storm tide also eroded up to a foot (0.3\u00a0m) of sand from beaches in the lower Texas coast. Combined with the heavy rainfall associated with Arlene, the storm surge produced significant tidal flooding in some coastal stretches.[6] Beach erosion occurred as far north as Galveston Bay, where tides were reported to be as high as 5\u00a0ft (1.5\u00a0m).[11] A woman was swept into the sea off a jetty near Freeport and required rescue by United States Coast Guard.[7] Over the waters of Lake Corpus Christi, a large funnel cloud was reported but never touched down or caused any damage.[12] Nearby, the John F. Kennedy Memorial Causeway was completely inundated with the exception of one lane, prompting an extensive study of possible solutions to raising the causeway nearly two years later.[13] Precipitation from the tropical storm reached areas 170\u00a0mi (275\u00a0km) inland,[5] and was enhanced in northeastern Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas as a result of interaction between the cyclone and a passing frontal boundary.[8] Arlene exacerbated preexisting flood conditions in some areas of South Texas.[14] Rainfall peaked at 15.26\u00a0in (388\u00a0mm) in Angleton, Texas, and other localized rainfall maxima of at least 10\u00a0in (250\u00a0mm) were observed in Texas.[15] The torrential precipitation caused rivers to swell and overflow their banks, forcing farm-to-market roads to close and inundating plots of crops. Portions of Interstate 10 were forced to close after flood waters overran the highway. The entirety of the watermelon crop in Waller County was eliminated by the floods. In Kingwood, Texas, some homes were flooded.[16] One storm-related death occurred in Henderson, where rain was measured at 14.82\u00a0in (326\u00a0mm).[5] The deep moisture from Arlene caused extensive crop damage, with 20%\u00a0losses to the cantaloupe crop, 10%\u00a0for the watermelon crop, and 18%\u00a0of the tomato crop, resulting in US$3\u20135\u00a0million in damage in East Texas. In the Brownsville area, standing floodwaters ruined the near harvest-ready sorghum crop and killed blossoming cotton plants. Street flooding was prevalent in urban areas. At one point during the storm downtown Raymondville was completely underwater.[17] The U.S. Coast Guard deployed small boats to the city to encourage the evacuation of about 250\u00a0homes.[18] Urban flooding also occurred in the Corpus Christi area, in addition to an increase of weeds and insects.[19] A station in the city set a daily record for rainfall with 2.57\u00a0in (65\u00a0mm) of rain over a seven-and-a-half-hour period.[20] Roughly 50,000 ac (20,000\u00a0ha) of sorghum, 11,000\u00a0ac (4,000\u00a0ha) of cotton, and 8\u00a0ac (3\u00a0ha) of pima cotton were inundated in Refugio County.[21] Damage to crops in San Patricio County totaled US$2.8\u00a0million.[22] The destruction wrought to homes, businesses, and infrastructure across Texas reached US$22\u00a0million.[5]"

The estuary is permanently open to the sea, so is constantly affected by tides and the inflow of saline sea water. When river flow is low, the estuary accumulates sediment from the ocean, narrowing the river channel; this sediment is evacuated to the ocean during periods of high flow, but high flow also brings sediment into the estuary from upriver. Because of the high sediment load, and continual stirring by wind and river flow, the water is turbid.[9] The mouth of the estuary is a small delta, closed by a sandbar except for a narrow channel. Although this channel is permanently open, it is usually very narrow and shallow, and so is now dredged every year to allow passage by western rock lobster fishing boats.[9]"

In 1951 the town of Kalbarri was gazetted at the river mouth, and by the end of the 1990s the population was about 2,000. In 1963 the Kalbarri National Park was gazetted, formally protecting the lower reaches of the river, including the gorge.[9] The Galena Bridge, carrying North West Coastal Highway over the river at Galena, was opened by the Main Roads Department in December 1983.[13]"

Roads were cut for up to a fortnight resulting in food shortages in many isolated towns.[17] Ernest Lee Steere of Belele Station reported that over 5 inches (130\u00a0mm) of rain fell in less than a fortnight. Further downstream the river was reported to be running 15 miles (24\u00a0km) wide and at depths of up to 70 feet (21\u00a0m); despite the damage, pastoralists were jubilant at how quickly the grasses were growing.[18] Heavy flooding occurred along the course of the river in March 1926 following heavy rains upstream.[19] 15 to 20 men were stranded at the Three Sisters Mine on the north side of the river, at Galena, and were rescued by dinghy.[20] Flooding again occurred in 1939[21] and 1942,[22] and once more following another significant rain event in February 1945 that resulted in flooding and the old Galena Bridge being swept away, effectively stranding the citizens of Carnarvon. A ferry service was established using a fishing boat.[23] Bananas were the main item that urgently needed to be sent across for transport to market.[24] Following Cyclone Emma in 2006, much of the catchment area received 100 millimetres (4\u00a0in) of rainfall. The river swelled, reaching a width of over 20 kilometres (12\u00a0mi) in places, and Kalbarri had to be sandbagged to protect it from floodwaters.[25]"

The flow of Mundo, Alh\u00e1rabe, Argos, Qu\u00edpar and Mula rivers also increased rapidly. Thus, an enormous flood arose that reached 1,890 m\u00b3/s in the capital of Murcia and is estimated to have exceeded 2,000 m\u00b3/s in Orihuela. The city of Murcia was completely flooded by the Segura river that, after flooding numerous districts to the north and west of the urban area, surpassed the Malec\u00f3n dam-like construction and burst into the center. In Orihuela, after its confluence with the Guadalent\u00edn (Reguer\u00f3n) river, the Segura also reached heights of up to 3.80 meters in some streets, reaching the first floors.[2] The flood devastated the Guadalent\u00edn Valley, and the entire alluvial plain of Segura, with considerable human and material losses. The catastrophe left more than a thousand dead: 761 in Murcia, 300 in Orihuela,[3] 13 in Lorca, two in Librilla and one in Cieza. 5,762 houses and y barrackes in Murcia and Lorca were destroyed and 22,469 animals died in the disaster.[2] It is widely described as the \"most catastrophic flood ever recorded in Murcia\".[4] After the disaster, several people and companies dedicated themselves to carrying out charity collections for the victims, such as the one organized by the Murcian press that collected money from all over Spain until 1884. Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Mu\u00f1oz, a wealthy man from C\u00e1ceres, donated 500,000 pesetas to the Region of Murcia and 2,000,000 reales to the city of Orihuela.[5][4] In the month of March 1881, Piedad de la Cruz left Barcelona with three postulants. They arrived at the Huerta de Murcia, with the approval of the bishopric of Cartagena, with the intention of founding a religious family dedicated to caring for the poor, sick and orphans caused by the flood."

Principally utilized for irrigation purposes, only 32 kilometres (20\u00a0mi) of the river is used for navigation.[3] The highest flows of the river generally occur in spring and autumn of every year, when rainfall in the Apennines is at its greatest. The intensity of the 1966 flood was further increased by both the topography of the Apennines, which contributed to the high run-off rates and river discharges, and urban development. Roads, such as the Via dei Calzaiuoli, served as narrow channels for floodwaters, allowing for their greater speed and destruction within the city; bridges, on the other hand, hindered river flow where it was needed, allowing water to pour over the floodplain with great force.[4]"

City officials and citizens were unprepared for the storm and the widespread devastation that it caused. There were virtually no emergency measures in place, at least partially because Florence is located in an area where the frequency of flooding is relatively low. In fact, approximately 90% of the city's population were completely unaware of the imminent disaster. Residents were set to celebrate their country's World War I victory over Austria on 4 November, Armed Forces Day. In commemoration, businesses were closed and many of their employees were out of town for the public holiday. While many lives were likely spared as a result, the locked buildings greatly inhibited the salvaging of valuable materials from numerous institutions and shops, with the exception of a number of jewellery stores whose owners were warned by their nightwatchmen. 5,000 families were left homeless by the storm, and 6,000 stores were forced out of business.[6] Approximately 600,000 tons of mud, rubble and sewage severely damaged or destroyed numerous collections of books, manuscripts and fine art. It is estimated that between 3 and 4 million books and manuscripts were damaged, as well as 14,000 movable works of art.[7][1] Artist Marco Sassone, in a 1969 interview, recalled the impact of the flood on Florence's residents: \"The only thing you could do was watch and be helpless. Nature was master...the women became crazy with fear. They began throwing things from the windows and screaming 'who is going to save my children?'\" It was reported that 101 people lost their lives in the flood waters.[8]"

Art historian and professor Carlo Ludovico Ragghianti assembled a committee with Mayor Piero Bargellini as chairman to raise awareness of the needs of Florence's art and academic institutions. Members included prominent figures from around the world, representatives of their own respective institutions. A number of other international committees were formed with the intention of sponsoring various institutions in Florence: The work of and contributions made by these committees were supervised by a central committee in Rome. Additional funding came from various governments, UNESCO, and the International Committee for the Assistance of Museums, Works of Art, Libraries and Archives, among others.  The city of Edinburgh (Scotland), twinned with Florence, sent practical help for the citizens in the form of double-decker buses to temporarily replace those which had been lost in the floods.  When these eventually returned home, they operated with the international 'GB' registration plate still affixed to the rear; each also carried a small plaque presented by the Florentine transport authorities indicating their gratitude for the gesture made by the people of Edinburgh. Charity auctions were also organised. In a show of support for the Florentine art community, Pablo Picasso had one of his paintings, Recumbent Woman Reading, auctioned off on an internationally televised programme. He donated the $105,000 it earned to restoration efforts in Italy. Similarly, Pietro Annigoni and Luciano Guarnieri donated the money they earned from selling 575 colour lithographs (depicting the events surrounding the flood and its aftermath), produced from 13 of their drawings. Florentine native Franco Zeffirelli produced the short documentary Florence: Days of Destruction to raise awareness of the flood. Released a month after the disaster, it reputedly raised more than $20\u00a0million for reconstruction efforts.[6][15] The film was narrated in English and Italian by actor Richard Burton.[16] People from Aberfan, Wales sent parcels with toys and clothes to Florence, which had belonged to the children who had died during the Aberfan disaster two weeks earlier.[17] While many institutions from around the world financially compensated employees who travelled to Italy and aided in the restoration of Florence, many others volunteered their services for absolutely no pay.

The Angels cleaned the city of refuse, mud and oil, and retrieved works of art, books and other materials from flooded rooms; experts from around the world volunteered their time and knowledge in the conservation of the aforementioned materials.[1] In a 1996 interview, Primicerio offered three principal reasons as to why the Mud Angels felt compelled to help: a concern for future generations, a feeling of international unity and a pervasive sense of solidarity.[20] What we were doing was dictated by the desire to give back the traces of the history of the past to future generations, so that it could be used for the spiritual growth of people who perhaps had yet to be born...it was the international community that worked to try to save Florence, this unique patrimony which belonged to the whole world."

Following a thorough cleansing, the materials were then dried in Florentine libraries, space permitting, or at locations outside of the city, such as tobacco kilns and granaries. In some circumstances, large numbers of books were covered with sawdust, as a means of drawing out moisture. When not washed prior to drying, dried mud was then scraped off the exterior of the books. One or both of two drying techniques was applied: interleaving by hand and/or drying with the aid of domestic heaters or other mechanical equipment. Interleaving involved the placement of blotting papers within the text-block of a book and replacing them once they were fully soaked; a variety of papers were used, including mimeograph paper and green blotting paper (the latter of which ultimately caused more damage). In kilns, the humidity level was slowly lowered from ninety to forty percent. If deemed necessary, bindings were removed and dried separately.  Removed pages were hung out to dry on an apparatus similar to a clothes line. Fearing the spread of mold, workers completed these tasks with the greatest speed possible. After they were disinfected and dried, the items were then reassembled, restored and, if necessary, rebound. Card catalogs and in some cases, the actual books and documents were reproduced by reprinting on early presses, photocopying, or copying by hand.[7][18]\n[22][23][24]"

Together they devised a logical and efficient method of book repair, involving nine separate and clearly defined steps: This methodical nine-part system enabled workers to process between seventy and a hundred books a day.[7] After the Florence flood, the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale was not allowed to put books back into the lower levels.[25]"

Consequently, the paintings' colours dissolved as well. In addition, the moisture caused paintings to buckle and crack or develop blisters, and the paint to chip and fall.  Actions were taken to stabilize the problem by applying rice paper to the affected paintings and storing them in cool, stable environments where humidity was slowly decreased. In extreme cases, the paint layer was extracted from the wood and gesso and then reapplied to a new support. Nystatin, an antifungal, was sprayed on the wood to prevent mold from growing. Treatment facilities were established at locations such as the Boboli Garden Lemon-House, where over two hundred of these panel paintings were restored. Similar measures were necessary to conserve canvas paintings. First, an original canvas was relined and gauze applied to the painted surface, which was then ironed. This process is referred to as the rintelatura, or \"new canvas\" method. Relatively minor surface work was often completed with a variety of solvents and/or types of resin."

In some instances, the resultant efflorescence obscured painted images. In other cases, the impermeability of the fresco plaster caused the salt to become trapped beneath the surface, causing bubbles to form and erupt, and the paint to fall. The adhesion of the plaster to the wall was often also seriously compromised. A fresco could only be detached when fully dry. To dry a fresco, workers cut narrow tunnels beneath it, in which heaters were placed to draw out moisture from below (instead of outwards, which would have further damaged the paintings). Within a few days, the fresco was ready to be detached. Fuel oil, which coated many painted works of art, was removed by using Japanese tissue paper to apply a solvent, which dissolved the tar. An absorbent, such as talcum powder, was then distributed on the tissue paper."

Bronze objects were kept in dehumidification chambers for a few weeks and cleaned with distilled water or polished.

In terms of geographic interest, distinctions among the regions are no longer drawn. Membership in the National Trust for Historic Preservation grew from 10,700 in 1966 to 185,000 in 1986. More than 35 university graduate professional and technical courses directly related to historic preservation were created in the interim. It would be reasonable to estimate that more than 54,000 jobs were created in the administrative aspect of preservation alone."

        "content": " The 1926 Nova Scotia hurricane (also known as the 1926 Great August Gale) was one of the deadliest Canadian hurricanes in the 20th century. The second tropical cyclone and second hurricane of the season, the storm developed from a trough situated well east of the Leeward Islands on July\u00a029. Over the next few days, it moved west-northwest, becoming a tropical storm by July 31. The cyclone turned to the northwest on August\u00a01 and began strengthening rapidly, reaching hurricane intensity by the early afternoon. The next day, it became a major hurricane\u2014equivalent to Category 3 intensity on the modern-day Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale. Over the next few days, the storm's track varied between north-northwest and northwest. Early on August 5, it peaked with winds of 120\u00a0mph (190\u00a0km/h). The hurricane then began weakening as it curved northward. The storm began losing tropical characteristics while approaching Atlantic Canada, transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on August\u00a08. The remnants soon made landfall near Port Hawkesbury, Nova Scotia, with winds of 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h), before being last noted over Newfoundland later that day. The hurricane produced sustained winds of 54\u00a0mph (87\u00a0km/h) on Bermuda while passing about 80\u00a0mi (130\u00a0km) west of the island, but left minimal impact. In Atlantic Canada, the cyclone sank several ships and boats offshore Nova Scotia, including the schooners Sylvia Mosher and Sadie Knickle. A total of 55\u201358 deaths occurred, including at least 49 from those two ships crashing ashore Sable Island. On land, the storm downed trees and electrical poles in Nova Scotia, damaging some homes and leaving telephone service outages. Crops and fruit trees were also damaged. High winds interrupted telegraph communications in Newfoundland. Despite the number of fatalities, little was done to mitigate for a tropical cyclone prior to the hurricane in August 1927, which caused more than three times as many deaths."

On August\u00a01, the cyclone turned northwestward and began strengthening rapidly.[2] Based on ship reports of hurricane force and near-hurricane-force winds,[1] it estimated the storm intensified into a Category\u00a01 hurricane by 18:00\u00a0UTC. Early on August\u00a02, the system intensified into a Category\u00a02 hurricane. At 12:00\u00a0UTC, the cyclone became a major hurricane\u2014with winds of at least 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h)\u2014equivalent to Category\u00a03 intensity on the modern-day Saffir\u2013Simpson scale.[2] Around that time, a ship recorded a barometric pressure of 968\u00a0mbar (28.6\u00a0inHg) \u2013 the lowest known pressure in association with the storm. However, no ships entered the eye of the hurricane and sampled the lowest pressure in the storm.[1] Over the next few days, the track of the hurricane varied between north-northwest and northwest. After becoming a Category\u00a03 hurricane on August\u00a02, the hurricane may have maintained sustained winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h) for about three days, before wind increased slightly further to 120\u00a0mph (190\u00a0km/h),[2] an estimate made based on the pressure\u2013wind relationship.[1] It curved to the north and weakened to a Category\u00a02 before passing about 80\u00a0mi (129\u00a0km) west of Bermuda on August\u00a06. Around 00:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a08, the storm weakened into a Category\u00a01 hurricane and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone about six hours later. Shortly before 12:00\u00a0UTC, the extratropical remnants of the hurricane made landfall near Port Hawkesbury, Nova Scotia, with winds of 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h), and continued northeastward until being last noted over southwestern Newfoundland around 18:00\u00a0UTC.[2]"

Five people died and one other person was injured after the Norwegian steamer Ringhord capsized near Scatarie Island. One person also drowned after the Edith Newhall sank. Many other boats and ships in and near Nova Scotia capsized or ran aground, including 11\u00a0ships at New Harbour, 2\u00a0motorboats at Mosher's Head, another motorboat at Spectacle Island, and several at the Chester harbor. Additionally, at least nine small boats, four schooners, a skiff, and several other vessels were wrecked in Newfoundland and Labrador. Overall, between 55 and 58\u00a0deaths occurred at sea, including 49\u00a0from the Sylvia Mosher and the Sadie Knickle crashing ashore Sable Island.[5] On land, the storm extensively damaged fruit trees and crops in some areas of Nova Scotia, especially in Truro. Several homes were left without telephone service in Chester after lightning struck several poles. A few homes were damaged by lightning in the town, while a home and a shed were destroyed by lightning in Kemptville. High winds in Newfoundland also interrupted telegraph communications. In New Brunswick, 3.9\u00a0in (99\u00a0mm) of rainfall was observed Fredericton, the highest precipitation total recorded from the hurricane.[5] With at least 55\u00a0fatalities, the hurricane was the deadliest in Canada since a hurricane in 1900. The system also ranks as the third deadliest Canadian tropical cyclone of the 20th century, behind only a hurricane in 1927 and the remnants of Hurricane Hazel in 1954.[8] After the storm, Lunenburg Progress Enterprise publisher William Duff was one of few people calling for schooners to be supplied with transmission and receiving radio equipment, while there were a few requests for a rescue ship to be stationed at the fishing banks on standby should other ships become distressed. However, little was done to improve mitigation prior to the hurricane in August 1927. In Nova Scotia, the families of the victims of the storm received monetary compensation via the Workplace Safety & Insurance Board. The agency became severely depleted of funds, leading the board to announce a 5% increase in insurance rates for the fishing industry. Captains and vessel owners responded by threatening to go on strike, forcing the board to reverse their decision.[9]"

In response, the General Assembly passed the Vonderheide Act to enable the formation of conservancy districts. The Miami Conservancy District, which included Dayton and the surrounding area, became one of the first major flood control districts in Ohio and the United States.[1] The Dayton flood of March 1913 was caused by a series of severe winter rainstorms that hit the Midwest in late March. Within three days, 8\u201311 inches (200\u2013280\u00a0mm) of rain fell throughout the Great Miami River watershed on already saturated soil,[2] resulting in more than 90 percent runoff. The river and its tributaries overflowed. The existing levees failed, and downtown Dayton was flooded up to 20 feet (6.1\u00a0m) deep. This flood is still the flood of record for the Great Miami River watershed. The volume of water that passed through the river channel during this storm equaled the monthly flow over Niagara Falls.[3] The Great Miami River watershed covers nearly 4,000 square miles (10,000\u00a0km2) and 115 miles (185\u00a0km) of channel that feeds into the Ohio River.[4]  Other Ohio cities also had flooding from these storms but none as extensive as the cities of Dayton, Piqua, Troy, and Hamilton, along the Great Miami River.[5]"

The storms that caused the flood at Dayton continued over several days, and affected an area across all or parts of more than a dozen states, most notably states in the Midwest and along the Mississippi River.[7][8][9] Heavy rain and snow saturated the soil and produced widespread flooding, known as the Great Flood of 1913, across Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, New York, and Pennsylvania.[10][11]"

They built refugee camps, sheltering people in tents who had been permanently or temporarily displaced from their homes.[4] Initial access was provided by the Dayton, Lebanon and Cincinnati Railroad and Terminal Company, the only line not affected by the flood.[14] Governor Cox called on the state legislature to appropriate $250,000 ($7.71\u00a0million in 2023 dollars) for emergency aid and declared a 10-day bank holiday.[15] When newly elected President Woodrow Wilson sent telegrams to the governors of Ohio and Indiana asking how the federal government might help, Cox replied with a request for tents, rations, supplies, and physicians.[16] Governor Cox sent a telegram to the American Red Cross headquarters in Washington D.C. requesting their assistance in Dayton and surrounding communities.[17] Its agents and nurses focused their efforts in 112 of Ohio's hardest-hit communities, which included Dayton and others located primarily along Ohio's major rivers.[18] Some of the Dayton flood victims made their way to National Cash Register's factory and headquarters, where John H. Patterson, the company's president, and his factory workers assisted flood victims and relief workers.[15] NCR employees built nearly 300 flat-bottomed rescue boats.[5] Patterson organized rescue teams to save the thousands of people stranded on roofs and the upper stories of buildings.[6] He turned the NCR factory on Stewart Street into an emergency shelter, providing food and lodging. He organized local doctors and nurses to provide medical care.[5] NCR facilities served as the Dayton headquarters for the American Red Cross and Ohio National Guard relief and rescue efforts and provided food and shelter, a hospital and medical personnel, and a makeshift morgue. The company's grounds became a temporary campground for the city's homeless. Patterson also provided news reporters and photographers with food and lodging and access to equipment and communications to file their stories. When the presses of the Dayton Daily News became inoperable due to the floodwaters, the newspaper used NCR's in-house printing press, providing Dayton and NCR with press coverage on AP and UPI newswires.[15]"

Led by Patterson's vision for a managed watershed district, on March 27, 1913, Governor Cox appointed people to the Dayton Citizens Relief Commission. In May, the commission conducted a 10-day fundraiser, which collected more than $2 million ($61.7\u00a0million in 2023 dollars) to fund the flood control effort.[4] The commission hired hydrological engineer Arthur E. Morgan[3] and his Morgan Engineering Company from Tennessee to design an extensive plan based on levees and dams to protect Dayton from future floods.[25]\n[26] Morgan later worked on flood plain projects in Pueblo, Colorado, and the Tennessee Valley Authority. Morgan hired nearly 50 engineers to analyze the Miami Valley watershed and precipitation patterns and to determine the flood volume. They analyzed European flood data for information about general flooding patterns. Based on this analysis, Morgan presented eight different flood control plans to the City of Dayton officials in October 1913. The city selected a plan based on the flood control system in the Loire Valley in France. It consisted of five earthen dams and modifications to the river channel through Dayton. The dams would have conduits to release a limited amount of water, and a wider river channel would use larger levees supported by a series of training levees. Flood storage areas behind the dams would be used as farmland between floods. Morgan's goal was to develop a flood plan that would handle 140 percent of the water from the 1913 flood.[4] The analysis had determined the river channel boundaries for the expected 1,000-year major floods, and all businesses located in that area were to be relocated.[citation needed] With the support of Governor Cox, Dayton attorney John McMahon worked on drafting the Vonderheide Act, Ohio's conservancy law, in 1914.[5] The Act allowed local governments to define conservancy districts for flood control. Controversial elements of the Act gave local governments the right to raise funds for the civil engineering efforts through taxes and granted eminent domain to support the purchase or condemnation of the necessary lands for dams, basins, and flood plains.[1] On March 17, 1914, the governor signed the Ohio Conservancy Act, which allowed for the establishment of conservancy districts with the authority to implement flood control projects. The Act became the model for other states, such as Indiana, New Mexico, and Colorado.[25] Ohio's Upper Scioto Conservancy District was the first to form in February 1915.[25] The Miami Conservancy District, which includes Dayton and surrounding communities,[8] was the second, formed in June 1915.[25] Morgan was appointed as the Miami Conservancy District's first chief engineer.[27] The constitutionality of the Act was challenged in Orr v. Allen, a lawsuit brought by a landowner affected by the exercise of eminent domain, and attempts were made to amend it through the Garver-Quinlisk bills. Legal battles continued from 1915 to 1919 and reached the U.S. Supreme Court, which upheld the law.[28]"

As a result of establishing the conservancy area, the rail lines were moved several miles south out of the floodplain to run through Fairfield, Ohio. The citizens of Osborn decided to move their homes instead of abandoning them. Nearly 400 homes were moved three miles (5\u00a0km) to new foundations along Hebble Creek next to Fairfield. Some years later, the two towns merged to create Fairborn, Ohio, with the name selected to reflect the merging of the two villages.[5]"

The flood caused water damage in their workshop, creating cracks and blemishes on these photographic plates. Prints made from the plates prior to the flood were better quality than the prints made after the flood,[31] although they made few prints from the glass negatives before 1913. Images lost to flood damage were irreplaceable. By 1913, the Miami and Erie Canal was still intact, but barely used. To alleviate flooding conditions, local government leaders used dynamite to remove locks in the canal to allow the water to flow unimpeded. Sections of canal were also inundated and destroyed by nearby river flooding. Since they were no longer economically viable, Ohio's canals were simply abandoned except for limited sections that supplied water to industry.[22]"

        "content": "The Missoula floods (also known as the Spokane floods, the Bretz floods, or Bretz's floods) were cataclysmic glacial lake outburst floods that swept periodically across eastern Washington and down the Columbia River Gorge at the end of the last ice age. These floods were the result of periodic sudden ruptures of the ice dam on the Clark Fork River that created Glacial Lake Missoula. After each ice dam rupture, the waters of the lake would rush down the Clark Fork and the Columbia River, flooding much of eastern Washington and the Willamette Valley in western Oregon. After the lake drained, the ice would reform, creating Glacial Lake Missoula again. These floods have been researched since the 1920s. During the last deglaciation that followed the end of the Last Glacial Maximum, geologists estimate that a cycle of flooding and reformation of the lake lasted an average of 55 years and that the floods occurred several times over the 2,000 years between 15,000 and 13,000 years ago. U.S. Geological Survey hydrologist Jim O'Connor and Spain's Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales scientist Gerardo Benito have found evidence of at least twenty-five massive floods, the largest discharging about 10 cubic kilometers per hour (2.7 million m\u00b3/s, 13 times that of the Amazon River).[1][2] Alternate estimates for the peak flow rate of the largest flood range up to 17 cubic kilometers per hour.[3] The maximum flow speed approached 36 meters/second (130\u00a0km/h or 80\u00a0mph).[3] Within the Columbia River drainage basin, detailed investigation of the Missoula floods' glaciofluvial deposits, informally known as the Hanford formation, has documented the presence of Middle and Early Pleistocene Missoula flood deposits within the Othello Channels, Columbia River Gorge, Channeled Scabland, Quincy Basin, Pasco Basin, and the Walla Walla Valley. Based on the presence of multiple interglacial calcretes interbedded with flood deposits, magnetostratigraphy, optically stimulated luminescence dating, and unconformity truncated clastic dikes, it has been estimated that the oldest of the Pleistocene Missoula floods happened before 1.5 million years ago. Because of the fragmentary nature of older glaciofluvial deposits, which have been largely removed by subsequent Missoula floods, within the Hanford formation, the exact number of older Missoula floods, which are known as ancient cataclysmic floods, that occurred during the Pleistocene cannot be estimated with any confidence.[4][5]"

        "content": "Geologist J Harlen Bretz first recognized evidence of the catastrophic floods, which he called the Spokane floods, in the 1920s. He was researching the Channeled Scablands in Eastern Washington, the Columbia Gorge, and the Willamette Valley of Oregon. Beginning In the summer of 1922, Bretz conducted field research on the Columbia River Plateau for the next seven years. He had been interested in unusual erosion features in the area since 1910 after seeing a newly published topographic map of the Potholes Cataract. Bretz coined the term Channeled Scablands in 1923 to refer to the area near the Grand Coulee, where massive erosion had cut through basalt deposits.  Bretz published a paper in 1923 arguing that the Channeled Scablands in Eastern Washington were caused by massive flooding in the distant past. Bretz's view, which was seen as arguing for a catastrophic explanation of the geology, ran against the prevailing view of uniformitarianism, and Bretz's views were initially disregarded.  The Geological Society of Washington, D.C, invited the young Bretz to present his previously published research at a January 12, 1927, meeting where several other geologists presented competing theories.  Another geologist at the meeting, J.T. Pardee, had worked with Bretz and had evidence of an ancient glacial lake that lent credence to Bretz's theories.  Bretz defended his theories, which kicked off an acrimonious 40-year debate over the origin of the Scablands. Both Pardee and Bretz continued their research over the next 30 years, collecting and analyzing evidence that led them to identify Lake Missoula as the source of the Spokane flood and creator of the channeled scablands.[6][7] After Pardee studied the canyon of the Flathead River, he estimated that flood waters above 45 miles per hour (72\u00a0km/h) would be required to roll the largest of the boulders moved by the flood.  He estimated the water flow was 9 cubic miles per hour (38\u00a0km3/h), more than the combined flow of every river in the world.[8]  More recent estimates place the flow rate at ten times the flow of all current rivers combined.[3] The Missoula floods have also been referred to as the Bretz floods in honor of Bretz.[9]"

        "content": "As the depth of the water in Lake Missoula increased, the pressure at the bottom of the ice dam increased enough to lower the freezing point of water below the temperature of the ice forming the dam. This allowed liquid water to seep into minuscule cracks present in the ice dam.[citation needed] Over a period of time, the friction from water flowing through these cracks generated enough heat to melt the ice walls and enlarge the cracks. This allowed more water to flow through the cracks, generating more heat, allowing even more water to flow through the cracks.[citation needed]  This feedback cycle eventually weakened the ice dam so much that it could no longer support the pressure of the water behind it. It failed catastrophically.[10] This process is known as a glacial lake outburst flood, and there is evidence that many such events occurred in the distant past."

        "content": "As the water emerged from the Columbia River gorge, it backed up again at the 1 mile (1.6\u00a0km) wide narrows near Kalama, Washington. Some temporary lakes rose to an elevation of more than 400\u00a0ft (120\u00a0m), flooding the Willamette Valley to Eugene, Oregon and beyond. Iceberg-rafted glacial erratics and erosion features are evidence of these events. Lake-bottom sediments deposited by the floods have contributed to the agricultural richness of the Willamette and Columbia Valleys. Glacial deposits overlaid with centuries of windblown sediments (loess) have scattered steep, southerly sloping dunes throughout the Columbia Valley, ideal conditions for orchard and vineyard development at higher latitudes. After analysis and controversy, geologists now believe that there were 40 or more separate floods, although the exact source of the water is still being debated. The peak flow of the floods is estimated to be 27 cubic kilometers per hour (6.5 cubic miles per hour).[2] The maximum flow speed approached 36 meters/second (130\u00a0km/h or 80\u00a0mph).[3] Up to 1.9\u00d71019 joules of potential energy were released by each flood (the equivalent of 4,500 megatons of TNT). For comparison, this is 90 times more powerful than the most powerful nuclear weapon ever detonated, the 50-megaton \"Tsar Bomba\".[11][9] The cumulative effect of the floods was to excavate 210 cubic kilometres (50\u00a0cu\u00a0mi) of loess, sediment, and basalt from the Channeled Scablands of eastern Washington and to transport it downstream.[9][needs update]"

Waitt argued for a sequence of 40 or more floods.[13][14][15] Waitt's proposal was based mainly on analysis from glacial lake bottom deposits in Ninemile Creek and the flood deposits in Burlingame Canyon. His most compelling argument for separate floods was that the Touchet bed deposits from two successive floods were found to be separated by two layers of volcanic ash (tephra), with the ash separated by a fine layer of windblown dust deposits, located in a thin layer between sediment layers ten rhythmites below the top of the Touchet beds. The two layers of volcanic ash are separated by 1\u201310 centimetres (0.4\u20133.9\u00a0in) of airborne nonvolcanic silt. The tephra is Mount St. Helens ash that fell in Eastern Washington. By analogy, since there were 40 layers with comparable characteristics at Burlingame Canyon, Waitt argued they all could be considered to have similar separation in deposition time.[15]"

        "content": "The controversy about whether the Channeled Scabland landforms were formed mainly by multiple periodic floods or by a single grand-scale cataclysmic flood from late Pleistocene Glacial Lake Missoula or an unidentified Canadian source continued through 1999.[16]  Shaw's team of geologists reviewed the sedimentary sequences of the Touchet beds and concluded that the sequences do not automatically imply multiple floods separated by decades or centuries. Rather, they proposed that sedimentation in the Glacial Lake Missoula basin resulted from j\u00f6kulhlaups draining into Lake Missoula from British Columbia to the north.  Further, Shaw's team proposed the scabland flooding might have partially originated from an enormous subglacial reservoir that extended over much of central British Columbia, particularly including the Rocky Mountain Trench, which may have discharged by several paths, including one through Lake Missoula. This discharge, if occurring concurrently with the breach of the Lake Missoula ice dam, would have provided significantly larger volumes of water.  Further, Shaw and the team proposed that the rhythmic Touchet beds result from multiple pulses or surges within a larger flood.[16] In 2000, a team led by Komatsu simulated the floods numerically with a 3-dimensional hydraulic model. They based the Glacial Lake Missoula discharge rate on the rate predicted for the Spokane Valley\u2013Rathdrum Prairie immediately downstream of Glacial Lake Missoula, for which several previous estimates had placed the maximum discharge of 17 \u00d7 106m3/s and the total amount of water discharged equal to the maximum estimated volume of Lake Missoula (2184\u00a0km3). Neglecting erosion effects, their simulated water flow was based on modern-day topography. Their major findings were that the calculated water depth in each flooded location except for the Spokane Valley\u2013Rathdrum Prairie was shallower than the field evidence showed. For example, their calculated water depth at the Pasco Basin\u2013Wallula Gap transition zone is about 190 m, significantly less than the 280\u2013300 m flood depth indicated by high-water marks. They concluded that a flood of ~106m3/s could not have made the observed high-water marks.[17] In a comment on the Komatsu analysis, Brian Atwater and colleagues observed substantial evidence for multiple large floods, including mud cracks and animal burrows in lower layers, which were filled by sediment from later floods. Further, evidence for multiple flood flows up sidearms of Glacial Lake Columbia spread over many centuries has been found.  They also pointed out that the discharge point from Lake Columbia varied with time, originally flowing across the Waterville Plateau into Moses Coulee, but later, when the Okanagan lobe blocked that route, eroding the Grand Coulee to discharge there as a substantially lower outlet. The Komatsu analysis does not evaluate the impact of the considerable erosion observed in this basin during the flood or floods. However, the assumption that flood hydraulics can be modeled using modern-day topography is an area that warrants further consideration. Earlier narrower constrictions at places such as Wallula Gap and through the Columbia Gorge would be expected to produce higher flow resistance and correspondingly higher floods.[18]"

Based on Waitt's identification of 40 floods, this would give an average separation between floods of 50 years.[19]"

Initially, vigorous convection persisted throughout the wave axis, though dry air greatly diminished the convection on July 28. The wind field remained well-defined as it continued westward, and deep convection increased two days later along the northern end of the wave axis. Dvorak classifications began on July 30 in response to an increase in vertical depth and organization of the convection. On July 31 a buoy recorded a change of wind direction from northeast to west, indicating a small low pressure area formed. Convective organization rapidly increased as it turned to the northwest, and the system developed into Tropical Depression Three on August 1 while located about 235 miles (378\u00a0km) east-southeast of Barbuda.[1] Forecasters initially predicted wind shear from an upper-level low would prevent strengthening and cause dissipation within three days.[2] However, the depression continued to organize as deep convection continued to develop near the circulation despite moderate amounts of wind shear, and the system intensified into Tropical Storm Chris six hours after developing.[1][3] The convection gradually consolidated over the system, and by late on the 1st Chris reached winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) while passing 50 miles (80\u00a0km) north of the northern Leeward Islands.[4] The structure of Chris continued to improve and become more symmetrical, and an upper level eye feature developed early on August 2. Outflow improved in all quadrants, as well,[5] and the storm reached a peak intensity of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) shortly thereafter while located 120 miles (190\u00a0km) east of St. Thomas. Despite initial predictions of Chris intensifying to a hurricane as a ridge of high pressure forced it west-northwestward,[6] upper-level shear dissipated the well-defined inner core of the storm, and Chris started to weaken.[7] Early on August 3, strong wind shear over Chris detached the deep convection from the low level circulation, while a building ridge to its north turned the storm towards the west into an area of drier air.[1][8] By mid-day on the 3rd the circulation was devoid of any convection within 85 miles (137\u00a0km), while the deeper convection spread across Puerto Rico and Hispaniola.[9] Late on August 3, deep convection developed over the center of circulation again,[10] though persistent vertical shear weakened Chris to a tropical depression on August 4. Due to computer models predicting lesser amounts of shear, forecasters indicated the possibility of moderate strengthening in the Gulf of Mexico to a 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) storm.[11] However, convection remained minimal, and Chris degenerated into a remnant area of low pressure late on August 4.[1] Late on August 5, convection increased in the remnants of the storm, and forecasters indicated the potential for slow development over the Gulf of Mexico[12] due to marginally favorable conditions.[13] Redevelopment never occurred, and the remnant circulation dissipated near Havana, Cuba on August 6.[1]"

Anticipation of a threat to supply by a potential Hurricane Chris coupled with high demand during an ongoing heat wave were cited as factors in the price move.[21] In New Orleans, officials including Mayor Ray Nagin prepared for a possible evacuation of the city if Chris entered the Gulf of Mexico as a hurricane. The evacuation plan included moving all residents out of the city as a worst-case scenario, intended to avoid a re-occurrence of Hurricane Katrina around one year prior.[22] Florida Emergency Management requested ten mobile recovery centers, and placed hospitals in the Florida Keys on standby for evacuation. Officials in Mississippi identified the need for 110 to assist in an evacuation process in case of a possible landfall.

Portions of Warren, Issaquena, Sharkey, Yazoo, Humphreys, and Washington Counties were flooded. Almost half of the land area of Issaquena and Sharkey Counties experienced flooding. In late May, flood waters covered over 860 square miles (550,000 acres; 220,000 hectares), including about 390 square miles (250,000 acres; 100,000 hectares) of farmland. In a region where farming is the primary economic activity, farmers were unable to plant crops as flooding extended past planting deadlines.[34] In his letter of 19 July 2019 requesting a major, federal disaster declaration, Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant wrote \u201cTo say that the persistent flooding in these five Mississippi Delta counties has had a devastating impact on the lives of many Mississippians would be a gross understatement.\u201d  He noted that prolonged flooding was impacting the livelihood of thousands of agricultural workers in one of the most impoverished areas of the United States. Agricultural losses in the Yazoo Backwater Area were projected to exceed $800,000,000 with reported crop losses already reaching $648,000,000.[38] The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency reported that 222 homes were destroyed and an additional 482 homes were damaged by flooding.[39]  The extreme duration of flooding complicated attempts to erect and maintain temporary flood barriers around homes and communities as peak water levels could not be predicted months in advance. Officials in Issaquena County reported that all but 1.5 miles (2.4\u00a0km) of 86 miles (138\u00a0km) of county roads had been flooded and that some residents had been displaced since February. The Emergency Management Director in Sharkey County reported that 35 county roads were closed and 120 people had been displaced from 72 homes. Portions of state highways 1, 16, and 465 were closed at various times during the flood.  U.S. Highway 61 between Redwood and Onward, Mississippi, was the only major road not closed at some time by flooding despite being surrounded by flood waters over most of this route. The first flood-related fatalities in the Yazoo Backwater Area occurred on 17 June 2019 when a man and a pregnant woman drowned after their car skidded off Satartia Road near Holly Bluff and sank in flood waters surrounding the road.[34][40][41]"

        "content": "The Yazoo Backwater Area is protected from flooding by the Mississippi River Levee along the Mississippi River and the Yazoo Backwater Levee along the Yazoo River. Normally, streams within the Yazoo Backwater Area flow into the Yazoo River through the Steele Bayou Drainage Structure and the Little Sunflower River Drainage Structure. During floods on the Mississippi River, these drainage structures must be closed to prevent backwater flooding from the Mississippi River. However, when these structures are closed, rainfall in the Steele Bayou, Deer Creek, Little Sunflower River, and Sunflower River watersheds ponds on the protected side of the levees causing interior flooding.[Notes 1] When water levels on the river side of the Yazoo Backwater Levee fall below the interior flood level, the drainage structures are opened to permit evacuation of the ponded flood waters. With a 1-foot stage difference, the Steele Bayou and Little Sunflower River Drainage Structures can discharge 19,000 and 8,000 cubic feet per second (540 and 230 cubic meters per second) respectively into the Yazoo River. Within other constraints, larger stage differences permit significantly higher outflows from these structures.[47][48] The system of flood protection authorized for the Yazoo Backwater Area by the Flood Control Act of 1941 included a pumping system to relieve interior flooding. In 2008, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) blocked construction of a 14,000 cubic feet per second (396 cubic meters per second) pumping station recommended by the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The EPA determined that the proposed pumping station would adversely impact 105 square miles (67,000 acres; 27,000 hectares) of wetlands. The USACE plan included provisions for reforestation of up to 87 square miles (56,000 acres; 23,000 hectares) of developed, low-lying lands that would not be protected from flooding by the proposed pumping station.[47][48][49]  The Yazoo Backwater Inundation Map, With and Without Pump, published by the Mississippi Levee Board, indicates that the proposed pumping station would have reduced water levels by nearly 5 feet in mid-March 2019 and reduced the flooded area by about one-third."

A sustained fall over the remainder of July dropped the Mississippi River stage at Vicksburg below flood stage on 29 July 2019. This fall permitted significant drainage of ponded water through the Steele Bayou and Little Sunflower River Drainage Structures allowing water levels in the Yazoo Backwater Area to fall below record levels in late July.[50][51][52][53][54][55][56]"

        "content": " The 1912 Atlantic hurricane season was an average hurricane season that featured the first recorded November major hurricane (Category\u00a03 or higher on the modern day Saffir\u2013Simpson scale).[1] There were eleven tropical cyclones, seven of which became tropical storms; four of those strengthened into hurricanes, and one reached major hurricane intensity. The season's first cyclone developed on April\u00a04, while the final dissipated on November\u00a021. The season's most intense and most devastating tropical cyclone was the final storm, known as the Jamaica hurricane. It produced heavy rainfall on Jamaica, leading to at least 100\u00a0fatalities and about $1.5\u00a0million (1912\u00a0USD) in damage. The storm was also blamed for five deaths in Cuba. Other tropical cyclones that left notable impact include the fourth and sixth hurricanes. The former brought rough seas and storm surge to portions of the Gulf Coast of the United States, leaving locally severe damage, particularly in Mobile, Alabama, and Pensacola, Florida, totaling about $39,000. One fatality occurred after a barge capsized. The sixth hurricane brought rough seas and heavy precipitation to northeastern Mexico and south Texas, with flooding reported inland. The storm left 15\u00a0deaths and about $28,000 in damage. Overall, the tropical cyclones of this season collectively caused at least 122\u00a0fatalities and just under $1.6\u00a0million in damage. The season's activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 57,[2] near the 1911\u20131920 average of 58.7.[3] ACE is a metric used to express the energy used by a tropical cyclone during its lifetime. Therefore, a storm with a longer duration will have high values of ACE. It is only calculated at six-hour increments in which specific tropical and subtropical systems are either at or above sustained wind speeds of 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h), which is the threshold for tropical storm intensity. Thus, tropical depressions are not included here.[2]"

Strengthening slightly, the cyclone turned to the northwest by June\u00a011.[5] Around 12:00\u00a0UTC on the following day, a ship observed a barometric pressure of 995\u00a0mbar (29.4\u00a0inHg), the lowest known in relation to the storm. Based on this, maximum sustained winds were estimated at 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h).[4] Early on June\u00a013, the storm curved northeastward and made landfall near Franklin, Louisiana, around 05:00\u00a0UTC. The system slowly weakened and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the Outer Banks of North Carolina, while still at tropical storm intensity. By 12:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a016, the cyclone weakened to a tropical depression. About 24\u00a0hours later, the depression dissipated about 150\u00a0mi (240\u00a0km) north of Bermuda.[5] In Louisiana, heavy rainfall resulted in some flooding in inland areas.[4] Precipitation in Georgia and South Carolina caused rivers to approach or reach flood stage, necessitating a flood stage warning at Cheraw, South Carolina, along the Pee Dee River. There, the Pee Dee River crested at 27.5\u00a0ft (8.4\u00a0m), about 0.5\u00a0ft (0.15\u00a0m) above flood stage.[6] Some locations in eastern North Carolina reported strong winds, particularly at Fayetteville, where there was a \"severe local storm\".[4]"

Hundreds of homes and numerous acres of agricultural lands were flooded. Throughout the area, many streets were washed out, disrupting street car service and commuting.[7] In Pensacola, abnormally high tides caused severe damage. Wharves and small buildings used for storing fishing equipment washed away. About 20\u00a0barges were beached, strewing timber across the beach. Service via the Louisville and Nashville Railroad was briefly interrupted due to timber on a railroad bridge. Wind damage was relatively minor. A dance pavilion on Santa Rosa Island was partially deroofed, as was a hotel. Damage in Pensacola reached approximately $25,000 (1912\u00a0USD). In Alabama, the city of Mobile in particular suffered impact from the storm. Some ships and vessels capsized in the Mobile Bay and Mobile River, including a $2,000 barge, drowning a watchman.

        "content": "The 1642 Yellow River flood or Kaifeng flood was a man-made disaster in October, 1642, that principally affected Kaifeng and Xuzhou. Kaifeng is located on the south bank of the Yellow River, prone to violent flooding throughout its history. During the early Ming dynasty, the town was the site of major floods in 1375, 1384, 1390, 1410, and 1416.[1] By the mid-15th century, the Ming had completed restoration of the area's flood-control system[how?] and operated it with general success for over a century. The 1642 flood, however, was not natural, but directed by the Ming governor of the city[who?] in the hopes of using the floodwaters to break the six-month siege the city had endured from the peasant rebels led by Li Zicheng.[2] The dikes were burst in an attempt to flood the rebels, but the water destroyed Kaifeng. According to another account, the rebels under Li Zicheng intended to use the river to flood the imperial forces. \"Both the defenders and Li then tried using the Yellow River against each other,\" John W. Dardess of the University of Kansas wrote, \"the defenders attempted to breach the dikes and wash away Li's army, while Li did the same to flood the city and destroy it. Li won. On October 8, 1642, Li's men cut the dikes, and a rain-swollen Yellow River burst through with a tremendous war, flooding Kaifeng...\"[3] Harry Miller of the University of South Alabama wrote that \"Both sides tried to puncture the dikes on the Yellow River, in order to enlist flood as an ally. Finally, on October 7, the rain-swelled river burst through the weakened dikes in two places.\"[4] In any event, 300,000 of the 378,000 residents were killed by the flood and ensuing peripheral disasters such as famine and plague.[5] If treated as a natural disaster, it would be one of the deadliest floods in history. [citation needed] After this disaster the city was abandoned until 1662 when it was rebuilt under the rule of the Kangxi Emperor in the Qing dynasty. Archaeological research in the city has provided evidence for the 1642 flood and subsequent occupation in 1662.[6] It remained a rural backwater city of diminished importance and experienced several other less devastating floods. The flood also brought an end to the \"golden age\" of the Jewish settlement of China, said to span about 1300\u20131642. China's small Jewish population, estimated at around 5,000 people, was centered at Kaifeng. Furthermore, the flood destroyed the synagogue and most of the community's irreplaceable Torah."

It persisted through five solar rotation cycles, first receiving the designation as Region 11947 as it faced Earth, going unseen as it rotated past the far side of the Sun, then returning Earthside as Region 11976, before cycling as Regions 12007, 12045, and 12088, respectively.[9]"

A preceding series of solar flares and CMEs cleared the interplanetary medium of particles, enabling the rapid arrival in a process similar to the July 2012 solar storm.[2] Normalizing the transit times of other known extreme events to a standard 1 AU to account for the varying distance of the Earth from the Sun throughout the year, one study found the ultrafast 4 August flare to be an outlier to all other events, even compared to the great solar storm of 1859, the overall most extreme known solar storm, which is known as the \"Carrington Event\".[15] This corresponds to an ejecta speed of an estimated 2,850\u00a0km/s (1,770\u00a0mi/s).[16] The near Earth vicinity solar wind velocity may also be record-breaking and is calculated to have exceeded 2,000\u00a0km/s (1,200\u00a0mi/s) (about 0.7% of light speed). The velocity was not directly measurable as instrumentation was off-scale high.[17][18] Analysis of a Guam magnetogram indicated a shockwave traversing the magnetosphere at 3,080\u00a0km/s (1,910\u00a0mi/s) and astonishing sudden storm commencement (SSC) time of 62 s.[19] Estimated magnetic field strength of 73-103 nT and electric field strength of >200 mV/m was calculated at 1 AU.[20]"

Initially an exceptional geomagnetic response occurred and some extreme storming occurred locally later (some of these possibly within substorms), but arrival of subsequent CMEs with northward oriented magnetic fields is thought to have shifted the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) from an initial southward to northward orientation, thus substantially suppressing geomagnetic activity as the solar blast was largely deflected away from rather than toward Earth. An early study found an extraordinary asymmetry range of \u2248450 nT.[26] A 2006 study found that if a favorable IMF southward orientation were present that the Dst may have surpassed \u22121,600 nT, comparable to the 1859 Carrington Event.[27] Magnetometers in Boulder, Colorado, Honolulu, Hawaii,[28] and elsewhere went off-scale high. Stations in India recorded geomagnetic sudden impulses (GSIs) of 301-486 nT.[29] Estimated AE index peaked at over 3,000 nT and Kp reached 9 at several hourly intervals[30] (corresponding to NOAA G5 level).[12] The magnetosphere compressed rapidly and substantially with the magnetopause reduced to 4-5 RE and the plasmapause (boundary of the plasmasphere, or lower magnetosphere) reduced to 2 RE or less. This is a contraction of at least one half and up to two-thirds the size of the magnetosphere under normal conditions, to a distance of less than 20,000\u00a0km (12,000\u00a0mi).[31] Solar wind dynamic pressure increased to about 100 times normal, based upon data from Prognoz 1.[32]"

Radio blackouts commenced nearly instantaneously on the sunlit side of Earth on HF and other vulnerable bands. A nighttime mid-latitude E layer developed.[40] Geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) were generated and produced significant electrical grid disturbances throughout Canada and across much of eastern and central United States, with strong anomalies reported as far south as Maryland and Ohio, moderate anomalies in Tennessee, and weak anomalies in Alabama and north Texas. The voltage collapse of 64% on the North Dakota to Manitoba interconnection would have been sufficient to cause a system breakup if occurring during high export conditions on the line, which would have precipitated a large power outage. Many U.S. utilities in these regions reported no disturbances, with the presence of igneous rock geology a suspected factor, as well as geomagnetic latitude and differences in operational characteristics of respective electrical grids.[41] Manitoba Hydro reported that power going the other way, from Manitoba to the U.S., plummeted 120 MW within a few minutes. Protective relays were repeatedly activated in Newfoundland.[1] An outage was reported along American Telephone and Telegraph (now AT&T)'s L4 coaxial cable between Illinois and Iowa. Magnetic field variations (dB/dt) of \u2248800 nT/min were estimated locally at the time[31] and the peak rate of change of magnetic field intensity reached >2,200 nT/min in central and western Canada, although the outage was most likely caused by swift intensification of the eastward electrojet of the ionosphere.[42] AT&T also experienced a surge of 60 volts on their telephone cable between Chicago and Nebraska.[34] Exceeding the high-current shutdown threshold, an induced electric field was measured at 7.0 V/km.

One account claims that 4,000 mines were detonated.[44] It was known that solar storms caused terrestrial geomagnetic disturbances but it was as yet unknown to the military whether these effects could be sufficiently intense.

Apollo 16 returned to Earth on April 27, 1972, with the subsequent (and ultimately final) Apollo Moon landing scheduled to depart on December 7 that same year. Had a mission been taking place during August, those inside the Apollo command module would have been shielded from 90% of the incoming radiation. However, this reduced dose could still have caused acute radiation sickness if the astronauts were located outside the protective magnetic field of Earth, which was the case for much of a lunar mission. An astronaut engaged in EVA in orbit or on a moonwalk could have experienced severe radiation poisoning, or even absorbed a potentially lethal dose. Regardless of location, an astronaut would have suffered an enhanced risk of contracting cancer after being exposed to that amount of radiation. This was one of only a handful of solar storms which have occurred in the Space Age that could cause severe illness, and was potentially the most hazardous.[45] Had the most intense solar activity of early August occurred during a mission, it would have forced the crew to abort the flight and resort to contingency measures, including an emergency return and landing for medical treatment.[46]"

Almost fifty years after the fact, the storm was reexamined in an October 2018 article published in the American Geophysical Union (AGU) journal Space Weather. The initial and early studies as well as the later reanalysis studies were only possible due to initial monitoring facilities installed during the International Geophysical Year (IGY) in 1957-1958 and subsequent global scientific cooperation to maintain the data sets. That initial terrestrial data from ground stations and balloons was later combined with spaceborne observatories to form far more complete information than had been previously possible, with this storm being one of the first widely documented of the then young Space Age. It convinced both the military and NASA to take space weather seriously and accordingly devote resources to its monitoring and study.[1] The authors of the 2018 paper compared the 1972 storm to the great storm of 1859 in some aspects of intensity. They posit that it was a Carrington-class storm.[1] Other researchers conclude that the 1972 event could have been comparable to 1859 for geomagnetic storming if magnetic field orientation parameters were favorable,[20][47] or as a \"failed Carrington-type storm\" based on related considerations,[48] which is also the finding of a 2013 Royal Academy of Engineering report.[49]"

Wellington City Council said they had received many reports of flying debris with multiple reports of trees and powerlines down, along with broken windows and structural damage. In the suburb of Kingston a house lost its roof. Radio New Zealand listeners reported that roofing iron was blowing about on roads in Newtown. Emergency services said they were very busy during the storm. The Northern Police Communications Centre said 90% of the calls it received couldn't be answered by its overloaded central branch based in Wellington.[10] The storm damaged houses, roads and seawalls, as well as closing 150 schools and leaving thousands without power across the country.[11] The storm caused significant damage to the capital's electricity network and resulted in 30,000 homes and businesses without power at its peak.[11] Conditions were so dangerous that some council and power companies stopped their workers from carrying out repairs, until the storm had subsided.[12] Ocean waves measuring 15 metres (49\u00a0ft) from trough to peak were recorded from a buoy about 2 kilometres (1.2 miles) out to sea, near Wellington by NIWA.[1] The waves washed away parts of some coastal roads and seawalls, and were the largest recorded near the capital since measurements began in 1995.[13] Localised coastal flooding also occurred in the Wellington suburbs of Island Bay, Seaview and the city of Porirua.[14] In Lower Hutt the local council estimated a cost of $100,000 NZD to remove debris washed up on the Petone foreshore when parts of the wall were smashed by the storm surge. Logs and driftwood lay scattered around Marine Parade to Eastbourne.[8] The childhood holiday home of writer Katherine Mansfield was severely damaged by massive waves at Days Bay where several homes were completely destroyed.[15][16] Racing at Trentham Racecourse was cancelled following the storm and the start of the Wellington LUX light festival was postponed until 22 June.[17] The Hawkes Bay region saw destructive winds, with a peak gust of 80\u00a0km/h recorded at Hawkes Bay Airport on 21 June. Police and council workers spent much of the following weekend cleaning up after the storm, most of which involved uprooted trees and blocked roads. Hawke's Bay Civil Defence manager Trevor Mitchell said the region had got off \"pretty lightly\" compared to other parts of the country, though some areas suffered localised surface flooding.[18] The Insurance Council of New Zealand says the storm could be the biggest weather event, insurance-wise, in the lower North Island since the 2004 Manawat\u016b River floods.[11] Measurements placed the storm in the same category as five other major storms recorded in 1961, 1965, 1967, 1974, 1977 and 1985.[1]"

As it rose the lake level caused seepage at, then breached, the ancient level of Red Rock Pass, a mountain pass at the headwaters of the Portneuf River, a tributary of the Snake River above present-day American Falls Reservoir. Ancient Red Rock Pass was the site of two alluvial fans descending from opposite sides of the notch, forming a natural dam.[3] When the dam collapsed, it released a 410-foot-high (120\u00a0m)[4] flood crest down the Portneuf River valley, also spilling into the neighboring Bear River valley. When it reached the Snake River, it eroded away a lava dam that had been at the site of the present-day American Falls, releasing a 40-mile-long (64\u00a0km) lake, American Falls Lake, that had formed behind the natural dam.[5][6][7] At the peak of the flood, approximately 33,000,000 cubic feet per second (930,000\u00a0m3/s) poured over the Snake River Plain at speeds of up to 70 miles per hour (110\u00a0km/h) and deposited hundreds of square miles of sediments eroded from upstream.[8] The flood scoured the 600-foot-deep (180\u00a0m) Snake River Canyon through the underlying basalt and loess soil, creating Shoshone Falls and several other waterfalls along the Snake River. It also carved and increased in size many other tributary canyons, including those of the Bruneau River and Salmon Falls Creek. The flood then entered Hells Canyon, significantly widening the gorge. Its waters eventually reached the Pacific Ocean via the Columbia River.[9] A 2020 hypothesis presented evidence that Lake Bonneville achieved a stable outflow for possibly a thousand years leading up to the Bonneville Flood and then a massive, multi-segment earthquake on the Wasatch Fault caused surging and tsunami in Lake Bonneville with a surge wave over 140 feet (43\u00a0m) high.  This surge carried up into the Cache Valley and resulted in the failure of the natural dam at the Zenda threshold just north of Red Rock Pass.[10]"

The flood drained the top 351 feet (107\u00a0m) of Lake Bonneville, which constituted about 1,200 cubic miles (5,000\u00a0km3) of water, and lowered the lake level to a stage known as the Provo shoreline. The flood transformed the Snake River Plain into a series of channeled scablands resembling the Columbia Plateau. Also left by the flood were the many \"melon\" boulders distributed throughout the canyons in the Snake River Plain. According to some geologists, the total volume of the Bonneville flood was actually greater than any individual one of the Missoula Floods, although the Missoula floods released more water as a whole,[3] and at least one had a much higher peak flow rate.[11] Much of the sediment scoured by the flood was deposited near the mouth of the Snake River. It now lies beneath about 20 layers of Missoula Floods deposits.[12][13]"

The head of the Krymsk district council, Vasily Krutko, was dismissed. In August 2013, a Russian investigation convicted Krutko of negligence.[5][8][9] Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev set up a commission to help the victims.[10] On 7 July, Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived at the area and held a meeting with the representatives of all the services involved in search operations and tackling the consequences of the disaster, and then left to Gelendzhik which also suffered seriously.[citation needed] Earlier on the same day, Russian Emergency Situations Minister Vladimir Puchkov said those people whose houses were totally destroyed by the floods will receive 100,000 rubles compensation (about $3,000), and that 50,000 rubles ($1,500) will be paid to the residents whose dwellings were damaged. Approximately 5,200 homes have been affected by the disaster.[11] On 8 July 2012, Putin signed a presidential decree declaring 9 July a day of mourning in Russia for the victims of a bus crash in Ukraine and the devastating floods.[citation needed] The head of the liberal opposition Yabloko party, Sergey Mitrokhin, said on his Twitter feed that local activists had blamed the ferocity of the flood on the opening of sluice gates at a reservoir but Krasnodar's regional administration dismissed the allegation as \"absolute nonsense\", RIA Novosti news agency said.[12] Furthermore, there are no controllable sluice gates in the nearby Neberdzhaevskoe reservoir, thus refuting the allegation.[13][14][15] On 14 July, about 2,000 tons of humanitarian aid had been delivered to Krymsk, according to a spokesman for the local emergencies administration. The humanitarian aid included safe drinking water, foodstuffs, bed linen, hygiene items, and children's clothes. Humanitarian aid arrived from Azerbaijan, Belarus, Adygea, Kalmykia, Dagestan, Ingushetia, Kabardino-Balkaria, Karachay-Cherkessia, North Ossetia, the Astrakhan, Volgograd, Rostov, Moscow and Tula regions, and from the city of Moscow.[16] A day later, the Krasnodar Krai administration said in a statement posted on its website that Russia's regional and federal governments would allocate almost 9\u00a0billion rubles ($280\u00a0million) to restore Krymsk.[citation needed]"

Jose was the tenth named storm, fifth hurricane, and third major hurricane of the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season. Jose developed into a tropical storm on September\u00a05 from a tropical wave that left the west coast of Africa nearly a week prior. A period of rapid intensification ensued on September\u00a06, when Jose reached hurricane intensity. On September\u00a08, it reached its peak intensity as a high-end Category\u00a04 with 1-minute sustained winds of 155 mph. However, due to wind shear, it weakened over the next few days as it completed an anti-cyclonic loop north of Hispaniola. Despite weakening to a tropical storm on September\u00a014, Jose managed to regain hurricane intensity the next day as it began to curve northward. Never strengthening above Category\u00a01 status for the remainder of its lifespan, Jose degraded to a tropical storm once again on September\u00a020. Two days later, Jose degenerated into a post-tropical cyclone as it drifted northeastwards off the coast of New England. By September\u00a026, Jose's remnants had dissipated off the East Coast of the United States. Initially projected to impact the Antilles already affected by Hurricane Irma, Jose triggered evacuations in catastrophically damaged Barbuda, as well as in Saint Martin. Eventually, as Jose changed its path, its inner core and thus the strongest winds stayed offshore. Nonetheless, Jose still brought tropical storm-force winds to those islands. Later on, Jose brought heavy rain, swells, and rough surf to the East Coast of the United States, causing beach erosion and some flooding. A woman died after she was caught in a rip current in Asbury Park."

        "content": "On August\u00a031, a westward-moving tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa.[1][2] The wave passed south of Cape Verde on September\u00a02, with a large area of disorganized thunderstorms. However, environmental conditions favored gradual development, which prompted the National Hurricane Center (NHC) to start tracking the system.[3] Early on September 4, a surface low formed within the wave while located around 615\u00a0mi (990\u00a0km) west-southwest of the Cape Verde islands. Continued organization occurred, and it is estimated a tropical depression formed by 06:00\u00a0UTC on September 5, with intensification to tropical storm status occurring six hours later; as such, it was named Jose.[1] Operationally, the NHC did not initiate advisories until 15:00\u00a0UTC that day as a tropical storm, nine hours after it had actually formed.[4] Once Jose became a tropical storm, gradual intensification ensued within the favorable environment of warm sea surface temperatures, low wind shear, and abundant moisture.[5] The storm developed an eye-like feature and symmetric, radial convection as it tracked west-northwest under the influence of a subtropical ridge.[1] Early on September 6, a period of rapid intensification ensued, due to the favorable conditions, with Jose attaining hurricane intensity by 18:00\u00a0UTC that day.[1] Meanwhile, Jose, along with hurricanes Irma and Katia, marked the first time that three hurricanes were simultaneously present in the Atlantic since 2010.[6] Despite being close to the outflow from the much larger Hurricane Irma to its west, Jose continued to quickly intensify over the next two days, which eventually culminated with it attaining peak winds of 155\u00a0mph (250\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 938\u00a0mbar (27.7\u00a0inHg) at 18:00\u00a0UTC on September 8, while located to the east of the Leeward Islands.[1] Jose slowly weakened as the eye became cloud-filled and wind shear began affecting the storm,[7] dropping below Category\u00a04 intensity by 18:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a010.[1] The storm weakened below major hurricane status 06:00 UTC the following day, and below Category 2 status by 18:00 UTC September 11 as higher wind shear began to erode the core.[1][8] As the storm was entering an anti-cyclonic loop, Jose was downgraded to a tropical storm at 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a015 based on Dvorak estimates which put its wind speed below hurricane strength.[1] At this time the NHC noted that northerly wind shear had kept all significant banding to the southeastern quadrant and the center was to the northwest of most convection.[9] However, as the storm was completing the anti-cyclonic loop later on that day, a reconnaissance plane recorded surface winds above hurricane threshold. Accordingly, the NHC re-upgraded Jose to a hurricane.[10] Rounding the western periphery of the subtropical ridge, Jose moved northward, beginning on September\u00a016.[11] Despite an asymmetric appearance on satellite imagery, the hurricane intensified slightly, reaching a secondary peak intensity of 90\u00a0mph (150\u00a0km/h) at 12:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a017.[1] The wind field expanded as Jose continued northward, and a large convective band developed along the northern periphery as the central area of thunderstorms diminished.[12][13] An area of convection and an eye feature reformed on September\u00a019 while the storm was east of North Carolina.[14] A Hurricane Hunters flight on September\u00a020 indicated that Jose weakened to tropical storm status, by which time the storm turned to the northeast.[15] Thereafter, the central convection diminished as the storm passed north of the Gulf Stream over cooler water temperatures.[16] Early on September\u00a022, the NHC redesignated Jose as a post-tropical cyclone, after convection had diminished for over 12\u00a0hours, and since the storm had acquired a frontal system.[1] The northern convective band moved over New England while the center drifted southeast of Cape Cod.[17] The remnants of Jose meandered around for another three days, before dissipating on September 25.[1]"

Tropical storm warnings were also issued for Long Island, and the coastline of Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts. Storm surge warnings were also posted for Nantucket, Massachusetts and parts of the Outer Banks.[15] On September\u00a019, rough surf and swells from Jose flooded portions of the Outer Banks of North Carolina, causing road closures along sections of NC 12.[29] Jose produced a storm surge along the Atlantic coast, with the highest rise recorded at 3.14\u00a0ft (0.96\u00a0m) in Wachapreague, Virginia.[1] The storm brought heavy winds and rain to Ocean City, Maryland on September 19, with large waves and strong currents flooding a parking lot at the Ocean City Inlet.[30] Sand erosion at Assateague Island National Seashore forced the closure of two parking lots, but had otherwise negligible effects.[31] On September 19, waves from Jose breached a dune and flooded a portion of Delaware Route 1 in Sussex County, Delaware, forcing the road to be closed and traffic detoured.[32] Large waves from Jose caused beach erosion along the Jersey Shore. In North Wildwood, waves from the storm went over a seawall and high tide caused street flooding along the bay.[33] Damage in North Wildwood reached an estimated $2\u00a0million.[34] Flooding from Jose shut down Ocean Drive between Avalon and Sea Isle City.[33] One person was found unconscious after being caught in a rip current in Asbury Park; she died in the hospital the following day.[35] Rough waters in the Long Island Sound and Block Island Sound forced many Cross Sound Ferry trips on September 20 to be cancelled.[36] While the storm meandered offshore, tropical storm conditions affected parts of coastal Massachusetts. On Nantucket, wind gusted to 62\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h),[37] and rainfall at the airport reached 6.48\u00a0in (165\u00a0mm).[38] Rough seas prompted suspension of ferry service to and from the island.[39] Similar winds affected southern Martha's Vineyard. These conditions downed trees and power lines, disrupting travel and leaving more than 43,000\u00a0people without electricity.[37][39] One tree fell on a car in Plymouth,[37] and another struck a home and nearby shed in Norton.[40] Overall damage was relatively light, amounting to $337,000.[41]"

Tracking generally west, the system steadily organized into a tropical storm, passing Vietnam to the south, before striking Thailand along the Malay Peninsula on November\u00a015. Once over the Bay of Bengal, Forrest turned northward on November\u00a017 and significantly intensified. It reached its peak intensity on November\u00a020 as a Category\u00a04-equivalent cyclone on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale with winds of 230\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph). Hostile environmental conditions soon affected the cyclone as it turned abruptly east-northeastward. Forrest made landfall in northwestern Myanmar as a weakening system on November\u00a021 before dissipating early the next day. The majority of deaths associated with Forrest resulted from a plane crash on November\u00a014 in Vietnam which killed 30 of the 31\u00a0occupants. In Thailand, the system produced significant storm surge, damaged or destroyed 1,700\u00a0homes, and killed two people. Agricultural losses in the hardest hit areas were estimated at \u0e3f800\u00a0million (US$32\u00a0million). On November\u00a020, as Forrest reached its peak intensity, fears arose across Bangladesh that a repeat of the catastrophic April 1991 cyclone would take place. As a result, mass evacuation plans were enacted across coastal areas of the country, with plans to relocate up to 2\u00a0million people. But the storm abruptly turned eastward, and the successful evacuation of 600,000\u00a0residents spared countless lives. Only two deaths were recorded, and overall damage was light, though half of all homes on St. Martin's Island were damaged."

        "content": "The second of four notable tropical cyclones in the Western Pacific in early November\u00a01992, Forrest was first identified as an area of disturbed weather over the western Caroline Islands on November\u00a09.[1] Moving generally west-northwest,[2] convection associated with the system steadily organized and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) subsequently issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on November\u00a010. Development into a tropical depression was not anticipated until the system cleared the Philippines; however, organization was slower than forecast and a second TCFA was issued late on November\u00a011. Once west of Palawan Island and over the South China Sea on November\u00a012, the convective structure rapidly consolidated. The disturbance was designated Tropical Depression 30W at 12:00\u00a0UTC,[1] when it was 940\u00a0km (580\u00a0mi) east-southeast of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.[2] The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) followed suit six hours later.[3] Moving toward the west-southwest, the system steadily organized; later that day, it attained gale-force winds and was assigned the name Forrest by the JTWC.[1] As the storm approached Vietnam, it turned southwest and moved parallel to the coast before resuming its westerly track. Forrest made its closest approach to the nation on November\u00a014, passing 110\u00a0km (68\u00a0mi) south of C\u00e0 Mau province.[2] The storm's proximity to land inhibited intensification, and it attained winds of 100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph) as it moved over the Gulf of Thailand on November\u00a014. The next day, the storm made landfall in the Nakhon Si Thammarat province of Thailand.[1][4] While crossing the Malay Peninsula, Forrest lost most of its convection, though its circulation remained well-defined. Failing to reorganize, the system continued to weaken as it moved across the Andaman Sea.[1] At 06:00\u00a0UTC on November\u00a016, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) began tracking the system as Depression BOB 08, although the agency quickly upgraded it to a deep depression and later a cyclonic storm.[5] Two days later, a subtropical ridge over Southeast Asia nudged Forrest toward the north, and it regained organized convection. Early on November\u00a018, the storm attained hurricane-force winds as favorable outflow and upper-level winds aided intensification. Strengthening continued through early on November\u00a020, at which time Forrest reached its peak intensity with winds of 230\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph), a Category\u00a04-equivalent cyclone on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale.[1] The IMD assessed three-minute sustained winds to have been 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph), making it a modern-day \"extremely severe cyclonic storm\", and its barometric pressure was estimated at 952 mbar (hPa; 28.11\u00a0inHg).[3] Forrest maintained its peak intensity for six hours before increasing wind shear disrupted it. Unexpectedly, the storm turned sharply northeast later on November\u00a020, sparing most of Bangladesh from a direct hit. More dramatic weakening ensued on November\u00a021 as Forrest neared landfall,[1] with its eye becoming obscure.[6] The cyclone made landfall along the northern coast of Rakhine State in Myanmar between 06:00 and 12:00\u00a0UTC with winds of 155\u2013175\u00a0km/h (96\u2013109\u00a0mph).[2] The IMD estimated Forrest to have been far weaker as it moved ashore, reporting peak three-minute winds to be 85\u00a0km/h (53\u00a0mph) at that time.[3] Once onshore, the high terrain of northern Myanmar further eroded the cyclone's circulation. Forrest dissipated early on November\u00a022 over the Magway Region.[1] Throughout the storm's existence in the Bay of Bengal, it was monitored by the ERS-1 satellite. It became the first North Indian Ocean cyclone to be observed by scatterometer instruments, providing the data necessary to calibrate the device for minimizing directional ambiguity of its measurements.[7]"

Widespread blackouts were reported throughout the affected areas.[13] Across Nakhon Si Thammarat province, two people were killed and 1,700\u00a0homes were damaged. The hardest hit area was Tha Sala District where 1,000\u00a0homes were damaged or destroyed. In the Pak Phanang District, storm surge destroyed at least 100\u00a0homes and damaged 400\u00a0more. At least 16,000 hectares (40,000 acres) of rubber plantations and 1,600 hectares (4,000 acres) of shrimp farms were damaged as well.

        "content": "On April\u00a029 of the previous year, a catastrophic Category\u00a05-equivalent cyclone had struck Bangladesh killing an estimated 140,000\u00a0people. On November\u00a020, 1992, the entire coast of Bangladesh was placed on red alert, the highest level of cyclone warning, and deputy director of the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society, Harun-ur Rashid, advised thorough and efficient evacuations. Amid forecasts that Forrest's intensity at landfall would be greater than that of the April\u00a01991 cyclone, officials and volunteers scrambled to warn residents in its path of the impending danger. An estimated 21,000\u00a0volunteers traveled to outlying islands and rural areas to urge residents to move to the mainland for safety. Following the 1991\u00a0cyclone, the Red Cross planned to construct 3,000\u00a0shelters across the coastline; however, by this time, only 44\u00a0had been completed. Of greatest concern was the lack of shelters on Maheshakhali, where 30,000\u00a0were killed in the earlier cyclone. Additionally, 21\u00a0makeshift camps housing 265,000\u00a0Muslim refugees from Myanmar were in the forecast path.[14] An emergency meeting was called by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to discussion the Muslim refugee situation.[15] The scramble to protect residents was noted by one foreign relief official as an attempt to \"[not get] caught with our pants down like last year.\"[14] Plans were made to evacuate 2\u00a0million people along the immediate coastline, including 300,000\u00a0in the Cox's Bazar District alone. Harun-ur Rashid stated: \"if necessary the volunteers have orders to use force to evacuate people.\"[15] Residents were readily willing to leave their homes in the District, in stark contrast to the complacency seen prior to the 1991\u00a0cyclone. Some people, traumatized by the events of the earlier storm, left at the \"slightest hint of calamity\".[16] By late on November\u00a020, approximately 500,000\u00a0people had been evacuated.[17] Following a change in the cyclone's course, the focus of evacuations shifted closer to the Bangladesh\u2013Myanmar border. Relocations in this new area included: 200,000\u00a0in Chittagong, 55,000\u00a0in Chokoria, 51,000\u00a0in Moheshkhali, and 40,000\u00a0on Kutubdia Upazila.[18] An emergency Cabinet meeting was convened by Prime Minister Khaleda Zia to discuss the storm. Government officials were similarly placed on emergency alert despite the day being a weekly holiday. Bangladesh Television cancelled all entertainment programs and relayed announcements on the cyclone non-stop. Relief Minister Lutfar Rahman Khan also convened an unscheduled, high-level meeting concerning the allocation of relief goods for eight districts.[19] Overall, 600,000\u00a0people evacuated inland or to one of 238\u00a0shelters.[20] During the evacuations, one person was killed in a stampede at a crowded shelter.[21] The cyclone ultimately spared the country a direct hit, turning due east, weakening, and striking Myanmar on November\u00a021.[20] Meteorologists regarded the storm's change of course and weakening as a \"miracle\", as large cyclones have historically caused tremendous loss of life and damage in Bangladesh.[22] Off St. Martin's Island, the southernmost area in Bangladesh inhabited by 4,500\u00a0fishermen, high winds snapped radio lines to the mainland.[20] High tides flooded the island, damaging half of its dwellings. Fifty people sustained minor injuries,[23] and one was killed after being struck by lightning.[21] On nearby Shah Farid Island, 200\u00a0thatched homes were damaged; all 500\u00a0families had previously evacuated and were left unharmed.[23] Squalls affected Teknaf Upazila,[20] damaging a food storeroom and office at one of the Muslim refugee camps.[23] Gusts in Cox's Bazar peaked at 104\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph) as the storm passed 140\u00a0km (87\u00a0mi) south.[1]"

The megaflood was a result of sustained major rain storms across the region, enhanced by an unusually powerful atmospheric river.[1] The flooding affected the indigenous peoples of California, in pre-industrial advancement populations. In addition to this event, geologic evidence indicates that other \"megafloods\" occurred in the California region in the following years A.D.: 212, 440, 603, 1029, c. 1300, 1418, 1750, 1810, and 1861\u20131862.[2][1] United States Geological Survey sediment research revealed that the 1605 flood deposited a layer of silt two inches thick at the Santa Barbara basin, indicating that it was the worst flood event of the past 2,000 years, being at least 50% more powerful than any of the others recorded based on geological evidence.[1] The United States Geological Survey has developed a hypothetical scenario, known as the \"ARkStorm\", that describes the affects of a similar event in modern-day California.[2][3] In 1861\u20131862, another atmospheric river event resulted in the Great Flood of 1862, which submerged most of Central Valley and parts of Southern California, and caused the state capital to be temporarily moved from the flooded Sacramento to San Francisco, with other adjacent western states also flooded.[4]"

Comparisons can be made between Manchester, on the western side of the Pennines, and Sheffield on the eastern side. These two cities are 35 miles (56\u00a0km) apart,[2] and 128 feet (39\u00a0m) and 433 feet (132\u00a0m) above sea level respectively. Manchester's average rainfall is 33.8 inches (858\u00a0mm) and Sheffield's is 31.6 inches (802\u00a0mm).[3] Between the two cities is the Peak District, which has the same effect as the Pennines, dropping more rain on the west than on the east.[4] Of the top ten rainiest cities or towns in England, only Huddersfield, in Yorkshire, is on the eastern side of mainland Britain; the rest are on the west side of the rain shadow.[note 1][6] The wettest location in the Yorkshire Dales is Snaizeholme (near to Widdale) 1,900 feet (579\u00a0m) above sea level, and where the average annual rainfall is 77 inches (1,957\u00a0mm).[7] The Yorkshire Dales (and the Howgill Fells) have suffered historical flooding in 1870,1890, 1899[8] and 1986 (Hurricane Charley).[9] The floods of January 1890 swept away the bridge over the Swale at Gunnerside.[10] Peak flooding has also been recorded in the 1940s, the 1960s and the 1980s. Flash floods have affected the area throughout the 21st century, with events occurring in 2009,[11] in June 2012,[12] and September 2012 which closed the A1 road.[13] In 2016, a flash flood inundated the White Scar Caves visitor centre.[14] Most of these flood events have been described as \"intense, highly localized convectional summer storms, under anticyclonic conditions, or by slow moving or near-stationary fronts.\"[15] This can be seen in the fact that the area where the water fell, was concentrated in a 4-mile (6.4\u00a0km) radius around the town of Reeth; places like Bellerby and Leyburn suffered as a result of rainfall elsewhere, whereas Richmond, 10 miles (16\u00a0km) to the east,[16] was described as having no rain at all on the day of the floods.[17] Most flooding events in Britain have been the result of a climatic condition known as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO-) when it has been in a negative phase, which can lead to wetter seasons.[18] Records indicate that the River Swale has had 145 flash flood events between 1700 and 2013.[19] Flooding in Swaledale, Wensleydale and Nidderdale, usually results in flooding on the River Ouse in York.[20][21]"

Malham Tarn in the Craven District of Yorkshire, typically receives 3.5 inches (89\u00a0mm) of rain as a monthly average; on the 30 July 2019, 3.2 inches (81\u00a0mm) fell in a 24-hour period, with most of that actually falling within four hours.[22] Langthwaite in Arkengarthdale, was stated to have received 5.2 inches (132\u00a0mm) in two hours,[23] and Arkle Town received 4 inches (102\u00a0mm), with 3.2 inches (82\u00a0mm) of that falling in 90 minutes.[24] Over 7.7 square miles (20\u00a0km2) of land around the village of Reeth, was listed as having been inundated with over 2,100,000 litres (460,000\u00a0imp\u00a0gal; 550,000\u00a0US\u00a0gal) in just under five hours. A report later stated that this was enough water to fill over 800 Olympic-sized swimming pools.[25] The same weather front caused flooding in South Manchester, East Cheshire and Whaley Bridge in Derbyshire which lead to the town being partly evacuated in case the damaged reservoir failed and caused an extreme flood event.[26]"

        "content": "The valleys of Arkengarthdale, Swaledale and Wensleydale were badly hit with flooding, though most of the damage caused by the flooding was in Swaledale and Arkengarthdale. At least 13 footbridges were swept away and 2.2 miles (3.5\u00a0km) of footpaths were damaged, eroded completely or covered in debris. More than a dozen rights of way were still closed by the end of December 2019.[27] Park Rangers from the Yorkshire Dales National Park expressed their dismay at the event, stating that Storm Desmond wreaked such devastation that they thought they wouldn't see the likes of it again.[28] The Settle and Carlisle railway line was subjected to a landslip between Ribblehead and Dent railway stations.[29] Whilst this was rectified relatively quickly, buses replaced trains for two days whilst the landslip was dealt with.[30] The bridge over Cogden Gill on the Grinton Moor road between Grinton and Leyburn was destroyed by the flash floods.[31] Further upstream, part of the grade II* listed Grinton Smelt Mill (the barrel-arched watercourse)[32]  was destroyed by the floodwater, and leaving the main building in danger of becoming unstable due to erosion by floodwater.[33] The bridge on Grinton Moor had been made famous by featuring in the 2014 Grand Depart of the Tour de France.[34] A bridge that spanned the same stream on the B6270 between Downholme and Grinton, was weakened and became unsafe to drive over and additionally, part of that road was washed away.[35][36] Extreme flash flooding affected properties in Reeth, Leyburn, Fremington, Grinton, Bellerby, Middleham and Langthwaite.[37][38] One farmer in Reeth had to rescue his sheep from a tree which had been carried there by floodwater \"12-foot (3.7\u00a0m) deeper than normal.\"[39] One woman who was watching the water from her cottage in Arkengarthdale, stated how she saw the water approaching Langthwaite. A huge surge of water was observed \"..taking the [drystone] walls down, one by one, in the valley. It was unbelievable - they were like dominoes. Then it hit Grinton and Reeth.\"[40] Whilst no deaths were reported, there were some injuries and close-calls; the landlady of the Red Lion Inn in Langthwaite was in her pub when water came in with such force that it was 5 feet (1.5\u00a0m) deep and leaving her submerged up to her chin.[41] A postal worker on his rounds and another man rescued a 92-year old woman who had fallen into a \"waist-high stream of water\" in her back garden.[41] Pets and livestock were killed and crops ruined.[42] Many houses and other buildings were completely ruined by floodwater ingress. North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service stated that they had received 115 calls to reports of flooding in Leyburn and Reeth and that over 100 homes were flooded out with sheds and oil tanks floating down roads inbetween houses.[43] The fire station in Leyburn suffered from extreme flooding whilst its crew were out helping those who were affected by the water. The building was renovated and repaired, and was able to be re-occupied by December 2019.[44] The Swaledale Mountain Rescue Team (SMRT) went to help people caught in the flooding, including one family who were trapped upstairs in their house. When the team entered the property, the fridge was floating on the water and touching the ceiling of a downstairs room.[45] By the end of the day, the SMRT had effected the rescue of ten people.[30] The Ard Rock off-road cycling event, that is held annually in Grinton over the first weekend in August, had to be called-off as the campsite, and main showground, were submerged underwater.[46] The organiser's later awarded the charity clean-up fund almost \u00a350,000.[47] The flooding of the River Swale on the other side of Grinton, inundated the Dales Bike Centre at Fremington, with water pouring off the moor through Grinton Beck flooding properties there, including the Bridge Inn, which had its access footbridge swept away by flood water.[48]"

A house at the bottom of the beck was in danger of collapsing into the water, and a \"wait and see\" scenario was being undertaken.[53] In October 2019, the Dry Stone Walling Association (DSWA) held a Reeth Wallathon to help repair many broken boundaries in the fields; they managed to rebuild over 720 feet (220\u00a0m).[59] Businesses in Leyburn were still just re-opening some six months after the flooding. The local newspaper, the Darlington and Stockton Times, said the effects of the flash-flooding were long-lasting and described the event as \"monsoon-like weather\".[60] In February 2020, the local authority's application for extra funding was refused by the government as the flash-flooding was not deemed severe enough in terms of damage to properties and livelihoods. The response stated that \"we normally expect that the local authorities have well established contingency arrangements in place such as funding from existing budgets and the resources to respond and support local communities. We appreciate that this would come as disappointing news, but we would not be able to extend this funding to flooding outside of this.\"[25] Also in February 2020, many of the communities and valleys listed above, suffered further flooding in Storm Dennis and Storm Ciara.[61] The new bridge over Cogden Gill carrying the B6270 Richmond to Grinton road, was opened to traffic in November 2020. Both it, and the bridge over Cogden Gill on the Grinton to Leyburn road, had temporary bridges installed by the council. The second bridge (on the road to Leyburn), was expected to open soon after,[62] and was unveiled in March 2021.[63][64]"

The heaviest rainfall fell on the night of Tuesday, 30 July 2002.[1][2] The East End of Glasgow was the worst affected district of the city, and two hundred people were evacuated from their homes in Greenfield and Shettleston on the Tuesday night.[3] The antiquated 19th century storm drain and sewer system in that area, having received minimal investment from Scottish Water, was blamed due to its inability to deal with the high capacity of surface runoff. Many of the homes affected were in working class areas, and as a result, did not have contents insurance.[1] The West Coast Main Line, Glasgow to Edinburgh via Carstairs Line and Queen Street Station were closed as a result of flooding and landslides. A number of roads were also badly affected by flooding in Sighthill, Springburn as well as the main A82 and A8 Roads.[3] Buchanan Street Subway Station on the Glasgow Subway was closed, although trains continued to run through the station without stopping. Parts of the Argyle Line were also flooded, with low level stations from Dalmarnock through to Exhibition Centre closed for a number of weeks. The water parasite cryptosporidium was discovered in Mugdock Reservoir at Milngavie Water Treatment Works on 4 August 2002, as a result of the flooding. Cryptosporidium can cause severe diarrhoea. About 140,000 people in Glasgow were affected, and were told not to drink tap water without boiling it first. This later led to a major redevelopment of the water treatment works.[4]"

Further problems with the melting snow are expected. One person was buried by an avalanche on 13 September at Karwendel and remains missing. Rescue operations were hampered by severe weather. A secondary avalanche injured a rescuer.[13] On 15 September, a skier was found dead under a snowdrift in Untertauern.[14]"

Jesen\u00edk and Opava were among the worst hit places[17] where a few houses were destroyed by the overflown river.

The biggest city hit by the floods was Ostrava.[17] There is an ongoing threat in parts of the South Bohemian Region. Four people were reported missing nationwide, thousands were displaced and around 250 thousand left without electricity.[18] Several roads and railroads were closed and water entered a station of the Prague Metro causing it to close, but the rest of the network remained operational.[19] Jesen\u00edk received nearly 500\u00a0mm (20\u00a0in) of rain. Parts of Moravia and Silesia exceeded 1997 flood rainfall totals.[20] On 15 September, Martin Kupka, the Czech transport minister, announced that railway operations in the Moravian-Silesian Region will remain suspended for at least a week to eliminate the damage caused by heavy rain and following floods.[21] On 15 and 16 September, four people died in the Moravian-Silesian Region. The first person died on 15 September in the Krasovka Stream. On 16 September, two people in Krnov and one in a flooded apartment were found dead.[22] A woman also drowned in Kobyl\u00e1 nad Vidnavkou.[23] The floods led the Interior Ministry to take direct control of organising voting for the 2024 Czech Senate election on 20 to 21 September in five severely affected towns, while in other areas, voting was held in tents, containers, or in open-air venues.[24]"

        "content": " Sheffield is a city[a] in South Yorkshire, England, whose name derives from the River Sheaf which runs through it. The city serves as the administrative centre of the City of Sheffield. It is historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire and some of its southern suburbs were transferred from Derbyshire to the city council. It is the largest settlement in South Yorkshire.[1][2][3] The city is in the eastern foothills of the Pennines and the valleys of the River Don with its four tributaries: the Loxley, the Porter Brook, the Rivelin and the Sheaf. Sixty-one per cent of Sheffield's entire area is green space and a third of the city lies within the Peak District national park and is the fifth largest city in England.[4] There are more than 250 parks, woodlands and gardens in the city,[4] which is estimated to contain around 4.5\u00a0million trees.[5] The city is 29 miles (47\u00a0km) south of Leeds and 32 miles (51\u00a0km) east of Manchester. Sheffield played a crucial role in the Industrial Revolution, with many significant inventions and technologies having developed in the city. In the 19th century, the city saw a huge expansion of its traditional cutlery trade, when stainless steel and crucible steel were developed locally, fuelling an almost tenfold increase in the population. Sheffield received its municipal charter in 1843, becoming the City of Sheffield in 1893. International competition in iron and steel caused a decline in these industries in the 1970s and 1980s, coinciding with the collapse of coal mining in the area. The Yorkshire ridings became counties in their own right in 1889, the West Riding of Yorkshire county was disbanded in 1974. The city then became part of the county of South Yorkshire; this has been made up of separately-governed unitary authorities since 1986. The 21st century has seen extensive redevelopment in Sheffield, consistent with other British cities. Sheffield's gross value added (GVA) has increased by 60% since 1997, standing at \u00a311.3\u00a0billion in 2015. The economy has experienced steady growth, averaging around 5% annually, which is greater than that of the broader region of Yorkshire and the Humber.[6] Sheffield had a population of 556,500 at the 2021 census, making it the second largest city in the Yorkshire and the Humber region. The Sheffield Built-up Area, of which the Sheffield sub-division is the largest part, had a population of 685,369 also including the town of Rotherham. The district borough, governed from the city, had a population of 566,242 at the mid-2019 estimate, making it the 7th most populous district in England. It is one of eleven British cities that make up the Core Cities Group.[7] In 2011, the unparished area had a population of 490,070.[8] The city has a long sporting heritage and is home both to the world's oldest football club, Sheffield F.C.,[9] and the world's oldest football ground, Sandygate. Matches between the two professional clubs, Sheffield United and Sheffield Wednesday, are known as the Steel City derby. The city is also home to the World Snooker Championship and the Sheffield Steelers, the UK's first professional ice hockey team."

        "content": "The area now occupied by the City of Sheffield is believed to have been inhabited since at least the late Upper Paleolithic, about 12,800 years ago.[14] The earliest evidence of human occupation in the Sheffield area was found at Creswell Crags to the east of the city. In the Iron Age the area became the southernmost territory of the Pennine tribe called the Brigantes. It is this tribe who are thought to have constructed several hill forts in and around Sheffield.[15] Following the departure of the Romans, the Sheffield area may have been the southern part of the Brittonic kingdom of Elmet, with the rivers Sheaf and Don forming part of the boundary between this kingdom and the kingdom of Mercia.[16] Gradually, Anglian settlers pushed west from the kingdom of Deira. A Britonnic presence within the Sheffield area is evidenced by two settlements called Wales and Waleswood close to Sheffield.[17] The settlements that grew and merged to form Sheffield, however, date from the second half of the first millennium, and are of Anglo-Saxon and Danish origin.[15] In Anglo-Saxon times, the Sheffield area straddled the border between the kingdoms of Mercia and Northumbria. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle reports that Eanred of Northumbria submitted to Egbert of Wessex at the hamlet of Dore (now a suburb of Sheffield) in 829,[18] a key event in the unification of the kingdom of England under the House of Wessex.[19] After the Norman conquest of England, Sheffield Castle was built to protect the local settlements, and a small town developed that is the nucleus of the modern city.[20] By 1296, a market had been established at what is now known as Castle Square,[21] and Sheffield subsequently grew into a small market town. In the 14th\u00a0century, Sheffield was already noted for the production of knives, as mentioned in Geoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales,[22] and by the early 1600s it had become the main centre of cutlery manufacture in England outside London, overseen by the Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire.[23] From 1570 to 1584, Mary, Queen of Scots, was imprisoned in Sheffield Castle and Sheffield Manor.[24]"

The resulting poor conditions culminated in a cholera epidemic that killed 402\u00a0people in 1832.[15] The population of the town grew rapidly throughout the 19th\u00a0century; increasing from 60,095 in 1801 to 451,195 by 1901.[15] The Sheffield and Rotherham railway was constructed in 1838, connecting the two towns. The town was incorporated as a borough in 1842, and was granted city status by letters patent in 1893.[28][29] The influx of people also led to demand for better water supplies, and a number of new reservoirs were constructed on the outskirts of the town. The collapse of the dam wall of one of these reservoirs in 1864 resulted in the Great Sheffield Flood, which killed 270 people and devastated large parts of the town.[30] The growing population led to the construction of many back-to-back dwellings that, along with severe pollution from the factories, inspired George Orwell in 1937 to write: \"Sheffield, I suppose, could justly claim to be called the ugliest town in the Old World\".[31]"

The city was partially protected by barrage balloons managed from RAF Norton.[32] More than 660\u00a0people died and many buildings were destroyed or left badly damaged, including the Marples Hotel, which was hit directly by a 500lb bomb, killing over 70 people.[33]"

The 1980s saw the worst of this run-down of Sheffield's industries, along with those of many other areas of the UK.[35] The building of the Meadowhall Centre on the site of a former steelworks in 1990 was a mixed blessing, creating much-needed jobs but hastening the decline of the city centre. Attempts to regenerate the city were kick-started when the city hosted the 1991 World Student Games, which saw the construction of new sporting facilities such as the Sheffield Arena, Don Valley Stadium and the Ponds Forge complex.[15]"

One such, the Heart of the City Project, has initiated a number of public works in the city centre: the Peace Gardens were renovated in 1998, the Millennium Galleries opened in April 2001, the Winter Gardens were opened in May 2003, and a public space to link these two areas, the Millennium Square, was opened in May 2006. Additional developments included the remodelling of Sheaf Square, in front of the refurbished railway station: the square contains \"The Cutting Edge\", a sculpture designed by Si Applied Ltd[36] and made from Sheffield steel. Recent development known as the 'Heart of the City' includes the restoration of the listed Leah's Yard complex.[37] Sheffield was particularly hard hit during the 2007 United Kingdom floods and the 2010 'Big Freeze'. Many landmark buildings such as Meadowhall and the Hillsborough Stadium flooded due to being close to rivers that flow through the city. In 2010, 5,000 properties in Sheffield were identified as still being at risk of flooding. In 2012 the city narrowly escaped another flood, despite extensive work by the Environment Agency to clear local river channels since the 2007 event. In 2014 Sheffield Council's cabinet approved plans to further reduce the possibility of flooding by adopting plans to increase water catchment on tributaries of the River Don.[38][39][40] Another flood hit the city in 2019, resulting in shoppers being contained in Meadowhall Shopping Centre.[41][42] Between 2014 and 2018, there were disputes between the city council and residents over the fate of the city's 36,000 highway trees. Around 4,000 highway trees have since been felled as part of the 'Streets Ahead' Private Finance Initiative (PFI) contract signed in 2012 by the city council, Amey plc and the Department for Transport to maintain the city streets.[43] The tree fellings have resulted in many arrests of residents and other protesters across the city even though most felled trees in the city have been replanted, including those historically felled and not previously replanted.[44] The protests eventually stopped in 2018 after the council paused the tree felling programme as part of a new approach developed by the council for the maintenance of street trees in the city.[45] In May 2022, Sheffield was named a \"Tree City of the World\" in recognition of its work to sustainably manage and maintain urban forests and trees.[46] This honour was given before the release of the independent inquiry's report on the so-called \"Sheffield Chainsaw Massacre\". The report concluded that \"thousands of healthy and loved trees were lost. Many more could have been\" and was critical of Sheffield City Council. The latter issued this statement on receipt of the report: \"the council has already acknowledged that it got many things wrong in the handling of the street-trees dispute, and we wish to reiterate our previous apologies for our failings\".[47]"

It lies directly beside Rotherham, from which it is separated largely by the M1 motorway. Although Barnsley Metropolitan Borough also borders Sheffield to the north, the town itself is a few miles further away. The southern and western borders of the city are shared with Derbyshire; in the first half of the 20th\u00a0century Sheffield extended its borders south into Derbyshire, annexing a number of villages,[56] including Totley, Dore and the area now known as Mosborough Townships. Sheffield is a geographically diverse city.[57] It nestles in the eastern foothills of the Pennines,[58] between the main upland range and Peak District National Park to the west, and the lower-lying South Yorkshire Coalfield to the east. It lies at the confluence of five rivers: Don, Sheaf, Rivelin, Loxley and Porter. As such, much of the city is built on hillsides with views into the city centre or out to the countryside. Blake Street, in the S6 postcode area, is the third steepest residential street in England, with a gradient of 16.6\u00b0.[59] The highest point in the City of Sheffield is 548\u00a0m (1,798\u00a0ft) near High Stones and Margery Hill.[60] The city's lowest point is just 29\u00a0m (95\u00a0ft) above sea level near Blackburn Meadows. However, 79% of the housing in the city is between 100 and 200\u00a0m (330 and 660\u00a0ft) above sea level[61] and the highest residential street is Redmires Lane at 302\u00a0m (991\u00a0ft).[62] This variation of altitudes across Sheffield has led to frequent claims, particularly among locals, that the city was built on Seven Hills. As this claim is disputed, it likely originated as a joke referencing the Seven Hills of Rome.[63][64] Estimated to contain around 4.5\u00a0million trees,[5] Sheffield has more trees per person than any other city in Europe and is considered to be one of the greenest cities in England and the UK,[65][66] which was further reinforced when it won the 2005 Entente Florale competition. With more than 250 parks, woodlands and gardens, it has over 170\u00a0woodlands (covering 10.91\u00a0sq\u00a0mi or 28.3\u00a0km2), 78\u00a0public parks (covering 7.07\u00a0sq\u00a0mi or 18.3\u00a0km2) and 10\u00a0public gardens. Added to the 52.0\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (134.7\u00a0km2) of national park and 4.20\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (10.9\u00a0km2) of water this means that 61% of the city is greenspace. Despite this, about 64% of Sheffield householders live further than 300\u00a0m (328\u00a0yd) from their nearest greenspace, although access is better in less affluent neighbourhoods across the city.[4][67] Sheffield also has a very wide variety of habitat, comparing favourably with any city in the United Kingdom: urban, parkland and woodland, agricultural and arable land, moors, meadows and freshwater-based habitats. There are six areas within the city that are designated as sites of special scientific interest.[68] The present city boundaries were set in 1974 (with slight modification in 1994), when the former county borough of Sheffield merged with Stocksbridge Urban District and two parishes from the Wortley Rural District.[4] This area includes a significant part of the countryside surrounding the main urban region. Roughly a third of Sheffield lies in the Peak District National Park. No other English city had parts of a national park within its boundary,[69] until the creation in March 2010 of the South Downs National Park, part of which lies within Brighton and Hove."

On average, through the winter months of December to March, there are 67 days during which ground frost occurs.[70] The Weston Park Weather station, established in 1882, is one of the longest running weather stations in the United Kingdom. It has recorded weather for more than 125 years, and a 2008 report showed that the climate of Sheffield is warming faster than it has at any time during this period, with 1990 and 2006 being the hottest years on record.[81] In collaboration with the Stockholm Environment Institute, Sheffield developed a carbon footprint (based on 2004\u201305 consumption figures) of 5,798,361\u00a0tonnes per year. This compares to the UK's total carbon footprint of 698,568,010\u00a0tonnes per year. The factors with the greatest impact are housing (34%), transport (25%), consumer (11%), private services (9%), public services (8%), food (8%) and capital investment (5%).[82] Sheffield City Council has signed up to the 10:10 campaign.[83]"

Large numbers of people were driven to the city as the cutlery and steel industries flourished. The population continued to grow until the mid-20th century, at which point, due to industrial decline, the population began to contract. However, by the early 21st century, the population had begun to grow once again. The population of Sheffield peaked in 1951 at 577,050, and has since declined steadily. However, the mid-2007 population estimate was 530,300, representing an increase of about 17,000 residents since 2001.[94] Although a city, Sheffield is informally known as \"the largest village in England\",[95][96][97] because of a combination of topographical isolation and demographic stability.[95] It is relatively geographically isolated, being cut off from other places by a ring of hills.[98][99] Local folklore insists that, like Rome, Sheffield was built \"on seven hills\".[99] The land surrounding Sheffield was unsuitable for industrial use,[95] and now includes several protected green belt areas.[100] These topographical factors have served to restrict urban spread,[100] resulting in a relatively stable population size and a low degree of mobility."

The abundance of streams in the area provided water power and the geological formations in the Hope Valley, in particular, provided sufficient grit stones for grinding wheels.[108] In the 17th century, the Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire, which oversaw the booming cutlery industry in the area and remains to this day, was established and focused on markets outside the Sheffield area, leading to the gradual establishment of Sheffield as a respected producer of cutlery.[108] this gradually developed from a national reputation into an international one.[108] Playing a crucial role in the Industrial Revolution, the city became an industrial powerhouse in the 18th century, and was dubbed \"Steel City\".[109] Many innovations in these fields have been made in Sheffield, for example Benjamin Huntsman discovered the crucible technique in the 1740s at his workshop in Handsworth.[110] This process was rendered obsolete in 1856 by Henry Bessemer's invention of the Bessemer converter. Thomas Boulsover invented Sheffield plate (silver-plated copper) in the early 18th\u00a0century. Stainless steel was invented by Harry Brearley in 1912, bringing affordable cutlery to the masses.[109][111] The work of F. B. Pickering and T. Gladman throughout the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s was fundamental to the development of modern high-strength low-alloy steels.[112] Further innovations continue, with new advanced manufacturing technologies and techniques being developed on the Advanced Manufacturing Park, situated just over the boundary in the borough of Rotherham, by Sheffield's universities and other independent research organisations.[113] Organisations located on the AMP include the Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC, a research partnership between the Boeing Company and the University of Sheffield), Castings Technology International (CTI), The Welding Institute (TWI),[114] Rolls-Royce plc and McLaren Automotive. Forgemasters, founded in 1805, is the sole remaining independent steel works in the world and dominates the north-east of Sheffield around the Lower Don Valley.[115] The firm has a global reputation for producing the largest and most complex steel forgings and castings and is certified to produce critical nuclear components, with recent projects including the Royal Navy's Astute-class submarines.[116] The firm also has the capacity for pouring the largest single ingot (570 tonnes) in Europe and is currently in the process of expanding its capabilities.[117] In July 2021 Forgemasters was bought outright by the UK Ministry of Defence for \u00a32.56\u00a0million, with the intention of investing a further \u00a3400\u00a0million over the next decade.[118] The decision was based on the important role Forgemasters plays in the construction of the UK nuclear submarine fleet as well other vessels for the Royal Navy.[118] While iron and steel have long been the main industries of Sheffield, coal mining has also been a major industry, particularly in the outlying areas, and the Palace of Westminster in London was built using limestone from quarries in the nearby village of Anston."

Recently developed offices in St Paul's Place and Riverside Exchange play host to the aforementioned government departments. Sheffield City Council, which is also a major public sector employer in the city, employs over 8,000 people, spread across four different sections (known as portfolios). Sheffield City Council is also the Local Education Authority (LEA) and as such manages all states schools and their associated staff. As part of its mandate to provide public services, Sheffield City Council maintains contracts with three private contractors \u2013 Amey, Veolia & Capita (contract ending in 2020).

Department stores in the city centre include Marks and Spencer and Atkinsons. Sheffield's main market was once Castle Market, built above the remains of the castle. This has since been demolished.[121] Sheffield Moor Market opened in 2013 and became the main destination for fresh produce. The market has 196 stalls and includes local and organic produce, as well as international fusion cuisine such as Russian, Jamaican and Thai.[122] In March 2021 it was announced that the Sheffield branch of John Lewis would close due to falling sales and a move to online shopping, which had increased because of the COVID-19 pandemic. John Lewis received \u00a33\u00a0million of public funding from Sheffield City Council in 2020 to keep the local store open.[123] The local Debenhams branches are expected to re-open after the lifting of the 2021 COVID-19 lockdown restrictions, but only to clear existing stock, after which it is expected the stores will close.[124][125] With the decline in high street shopping around the UK, efforts have been made to rejuvenate Sheffield City Centre and improve the retail and leisure offering. Major developments include Leopold Square, The Moor, St Paul's Place (a mixed use development) and the Heart of the City I & II projects. In March 2022 Sheffield City Council announced that a new leisure hub would be constructed at the southern end of Fargate. The \u00a3300,000 hub will feature cafes, shops and large screen TVs for sports events.[126] The development is also related to other efforts to rejuvenate the Fargate area, such as a new mixed-use events and coworking hub at 20\u201326 Fargate, also overseen by Sheffield City Council.[127]"

Attracting over 30\u00a0million visitors a year (up from 19\u00a0million in its first year), the centre hosts 270\u00a0shops, 37\u00a0restaurants and a cinema.[128][129] Many nationally renowned brands have a presence at the centre including Marks & Spencer, Hugo Boss and Jaeger. The centre is connected to the city centre by rail, Supertram and bus services.[128] Prior to the opening of Meadowhall, the site was occupied for East Hecla (steel) works, a major employer in the north-east of the city. The opening of Meadowhall in 1990 marked the beginning of major rejuvenation in the Lower Don Valley as the steel industry contracted. In a 2010 survey of forecast expenditure at retail centres in the United Kingdom, Meadowhall was ranked 12th and Sheffield City Centre 19th.[130] To the South of Meadowhall shopping centre is Meadowhall Retail Park, a 190,500\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (17,700\u00a0m2) retail park with 13 retail and food units.[131] Next to the retail park is the Sheffield IKEA store, opened in 2017. The opening ceremony was attended by dignitaries including the Swedish Ambassador to the UK.[132] The Sheffield store was the 20th opened in the UK and led to the creation of 480 new local jobs. The second largest shopping centre in Sheffield is Crystal Peaks, located in the south-east of the city, alongside Drakehouse Retail Park. Both the shopping centre and the retail park opened in 1988 and now attract around 11\u00a0million visitors a year.[133] In total there are 101 retailers (including eateries) at Crystal Peaks and Drakehouse, including a range high street brands.

The M18 branches from the M1 close to Sheffield, linking the city with Doncaster and ending at Goole.\nThe A57 and A61 roads are the major trunk roads through Sheffield.[138] These run east\u2013west and north\u2013south respectively, crossing in the city centre, from where the other major roads generally radiate spoke-like. An inner ring road, mostly constructed in the 1970s and extended in 2007 to form a complete ring,[139] allows traffic to avoid the city centre, and an outer ring road runs to the east, south-east and north, nearer the edge of the city, but does not serve the western side of Sheffield.[138] Sheffield Interchange is the city's bus main hub; other bus stations are at Halfway, Hillsborough and Meadowhall. After deregulation in 1986,[140] there were multiple new service providers. Current providers are First South Yorkshire, Stagecoach Yorkshire, TM Travel, Hulleys of Baslow and Sheffield Community Transport. First South Yorkshire, is the largest bus operator.[141][142] There is also the Bus Rapid Transit North route between Sheffield and Maltby via Rotherham. It was planned as two routes: the Northern route to Rotherham via Meadowhall and Templeborough, and the southern route via the developing employment centre and Waverley.[143] The northern route opened in September 2016; it involved an 800m Tinsley Road Link to be built between Meadowhall and the A6178 road.[144] Yorkshire Terrier, Andrews and the parent company Yorkshire Traction formerly operated in the city and were taken-over by Stagecoach Sheffield.[145] Stagecoach Group also operates the Supertram and has an integrated ticketing system with buses and tram.[146] Coach services running through Sheffield are operated by National Express and to a lesser extent Megabus and Flixbus. National Express services call at Sheffield Interchange, Meadowhall Interchange and Meadowhead Bus Stop. Megabus and Flixbus services only call at Meadowhall. National Express services 564, 560, 350, 320, 310 and 240 call at Sheffield, as do others on a less frequent basis.[147] The 560/564 service is a direct connection to London Victoria Coach Station via Chesterfield and Milton Keynes, operating 12 times a day in both directions. The 350 and 240 services connect Sheffield to Manchester Airport and Heathrow/Gatwick Airports respectively.[148] Two Megabus services, the M12 and M20, call at Sheffield en route to London from Newcastle upon Tyne and Inverness respectively.[149] Although hilly, Sheffield is compact and has few major trunk roads, therefore cycling in Sheffield is a popular method of transport. It is on the Trans-Pennine Trail, a National Cycle Network route running from West to East from Southport in Merseyside to Hornsea in the East Riding of Yorkshire and North to South from Leeds in West Yorkshire to Chesterfield in Derbyshire.[150] There are many cycle routes going along country paths in the woods surrounding the city, and an increasing number of cycle lanes in the city itself."

High Speed 2 had been planned to serve a city centre station in Sheffield as a spur from the main eastern HS2 line. It was scheduled to be operational by 2033, with four trains an hour, reducing journey times to London and Birmingham to 1 hour 19 minutes and 48 minutes respectively.[153] In November 2021, the UK government published the Integrated Rail Plan for the North and Midlands which announced HS2's eastern spur route (between the East Midlands and Leeds, including Sheffield) had been cancelled. The document announced upgrades to the Midland Mainline, with HS2 trains able to run on this upgraded and electrified route.[154] There are several local rail routes running along the city's valleys and beyond, connecting it with other parts of South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, Lincolnshire and Derbyshire. These local routes include the Penistone Line, the Dearne Valley Line, the Hope Valley Line and the Hallam Line. As well as the main stations of Sheffield and Meadowhall, there are five suburban stations at Chapeltown, Darnall, Woodhouse and Dore & Totley.[155] As part of improvements to rail services along the Hope Valley Line between Sheffield and Manchester, a new platform, station facilities and track are being built at Dore & Totley Station with the expanded station due to open in 2023.[156] The Sheffield Supertram (not derived from the previous tramways), opened in 1994 and was operated by Stagecoach. The opening was shortly after the similar Metrolink scheme in Greater Manchester. The Supertram network consists of 37\u00a0mi (60\u00a0km) of track and four lines (with all lines running via the city centre): from Halfway to Malin Bridge (Blue Line), from Meadowhall to Middlewood (Yellow Line), from Cathedral to Herdings Park (Purple Line),[157] and the from Cathedral to Rotherham Parkgate (Black Line).

Budge (Mining) Ltd for the construction and operation of the airport and the development of adjacent land. In 1997, Sheffield City Airport was opened on land close to the M1 and the Sheffield Parkway. The airport was operated on STOLPORT model similar to London City Airport and operated a limited range of short range business focused flights to destinations in the British Isles and the Netherlands. The airport fell into decline with the growth of low cost airlines in the late 1990s and the last scheduled flight took place in 2002. The airport closed and lost its Civil Aviation Authority license in 2008.[162] Doncaster Sheffield Airport (also known as Robin Hood Airport) then became the closest international airport to Sheffield, located 18\u00a0mi (29\u00a0km) from the city centre. It opened on 28 April 2005 on the former RAF Finningley site and was served mainly by charter and budget airlines, with about one million passengers a year.[163] Destinations had included the Canary Islands, Balearics, Greece, Turkey, Poland and the Baltic countries with TUI Airways and Wizz Air operating from the airport.

The Millennium Galleries, being established in the early 2000s, is one of the newest museums and constitutes part of the Heart of the City development, connecting directly to the Winter Garden and Millennium Square. All three museums host a broad range of exhibits which reflect Sheffield's history and numerous other themes, including exhibitions on loan from other major galleries and museums. Sheffield Industrial Museums Trust manages the museums dedicated to Sheffield's industrial heritage of which there are three.[170] Kelham Island Museum (located just to the North of the city centre) is located on the site of a 19th-century iron foundry and showcases the city's history of steel manufacturing and includes a range of important historical artifacts, including a preserved Bessemer Converter (which won an Engineering Heritage Award in 2004 from the Institution of Mechanical Engineers), munitions and mechanical components from WW2 aircraft (Including a crankshaft from a Spitfire which, during the early stages of the war, could only be produced in Sheffield) and a fully functional 12,000 horsepower steam engine dating to the 19th century.[171] The museum is an Anchor Point for the ERIH, The European Route of Industrial Heritage. Abbeydale Industrial Hamlet (in the south of the city) is a Grade I listed building and a Scheduled Ancient Monument.[172] Shepherd Wheel (in the south-East of the city) is a former water-powered grinding workshop, Grade II listed and a Scheduled Ancient Monument.[173] Also there are Sheffield Archives. In August 2022 the Yorkshire Natural History Museum opened on Holme Lane in Sheffield. Many of the exhibits come from the collection of James Hogg and feature a collection of Jurassic marine life, such as ammonites, belemnites, plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs, many of which were collected from the Lias of the Yorkshire Coast. The museum has Europe's first publicly accessible fossil preparation and conservation laboratory with ultrasonic preparation facilities, an acid preparation laboratory, 3D scanning, CT scanning and 3D printing.[174][175] On the opening day palaeontologist Dean Lomax exmined one of the fossils on display and declared it to be the oldest example of a vertebrate embryo found in Britain and the oldest complete ichthyosaur embryo ever found in Britain.[176] There are also a number of independent museums in the city including the National Videogame Museum and the National Emergency Services Museum, as well as the University of Sheffield's Turner Museum of Glass."

Sheffield and Hallam are today Sheffield's two major non-league sides, although Sheffield now play just outside the city in nearby Dronfield, Derbyshire. Sheffield and Hallam contest what has become known as the Sheffield derby. By 1860 there were 15\u00a0football clubs in Sheffield, with the first ever amateur league and cup competitions taking place in the city.[189] Sheffield is best known for its two professional football teams, Sheffield United, nicknamed The Blades, and Sheffield Wednesday, nicknamed The Owls. United, who play at Bramall Lane south of the city centre, compete in the Premier League and Wednesday, who play at Hillsborough in the north-west of the city, compete in the EFL Championship. The two clubs contest the Steel City Derby, which is considered by many to be one of the most fierce football rivalries in English Football.[190] In the pre-war era, both Wednesday and United enjoyed large amounts of success and found themselves two of the country's top clubs; Sheffield Wednesday have been champions of the Football League four times \u2013 in 1902\u201303, 1903\u201304, 1928\u201329 and 1929\u201330, whilst Sheffield United have won it once, in 1897\u201398. During the 1970s and early 1980s the two sides fell from grace, with Wednesday finding themselves in the Third Division by the mid-70s and United as far as the Fourth Division in 1981. Wednesday once again became one of England's high-flying clubs following promotion back to the First Division in 1984, winning the League Cup in 1991, competing in the UEFA Cup in 1992\u201393, and reaching the final of both the League Cup and FA Cup in the same season. United and Wednesday were both founding members of the FA Premier League in 1992, but The Blades were relegated in 1994. The Owls remained until 2000. Both clubs had gone into decline in the 21st\u00a0 century, Wednesday twice relegated to League One and United suffering the same fate in 2011, despite a brief spell in the Premier League in 2006\u201307. United was promoted to the Premier League in 2019 under manager, and Sheffield United Fan, Chris Wilder. Despite being written off by most football pundits, and declared favourites for relegation from the Premier League, United exceeded expectations and finished in the top half of the table in the 2019\u201320 season. In the 2020\u201321 season, United sat at the bottom of the Premier League table by the conclusion of the season and were relegated. Sheffield was the site of the deadliest sports venue disaster in the United Kingdom, the Hillsborough disaster in 1989, when 97 Liverpool supporters were killed in a stampede and crush during an FA Cup semi-final at the venue. Rotherham United, who play in the Championship, did play their home games in the city between 2008 and 2012, having moved to play at Sheffield's Don Valley Stadium in 2008 following a dispute with their previous landlord at their traditional home ground of Millmoor, Rotherham. However, in July 2012, the club moved to the new 12,000 seat New York Stadium in Rotherham.

They made the Grand Final, by defeating Leigh, who were huge favourites in a playoff semi final. In the final, they were comprehensively beaten by Featherstone Rovers. Sheffield also put in a bid to be a host city for the 2013 Rugby League World Cup, but their bid was unsuccessful."

Ponds Forge is also the home of Sheffield City Swimming Club, a local swimming club competing in the Speedo league. The former Don Valley International Athletics Stadium, once the largest athletics stadium in the UK, was also constructed for the Universiade games.[197] Following the closure and demolition of Don Valley Stadium in 2013, The Sheffield Olympic Legacy Park was established and constructed on the same site, adjacent to the English Institute for Sport. The park is designed to a collaborative project with input from numerous stakeholders including both universities in Sheffield, the English Institute of Sport Sheffield, the NHS and private medical companies.[198] A key part of this collaboration is Sheffield Hallam University's \u00a314\u00a0million Advanced Well-being Research Centre (AWRC), which was established along similar lines to the University of Sheffield's Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre's (AMRC's).[198] The site also includes teaching facilities, a stadium and research & innovation facilities.[198] The Sheffield Ski Village was the largest artificial ski resort in Europe, before being destroyed in a series of suspected arson attacks in 2012 and 2013. The city also has six indoor climbing centres and is home to a significant community of professional climbers, including Britain's most successful competitive climber Shauna Coxsey. Sheffield was the UK's first National City of Sport and is now home to the English Institute of Sport \u2013 Sheffield, where British athletes trained for the 2012 Olympics.[199] Sheffield also has close ties with snooker, with the city's Crucible Theatre being the venue for the World Snooker Championships.[200] The English Institute of Sport hosts most of the top fencing competitions each year, including the National Championships for Seniors, Juniors (U20's) and Cadets (U17's) as well as the 2011 Senior European Fencing Championships.

Sixty-seven are Grade II*, but the overwhelming majority are listed as Grade II.[214] Compared to other English cities, Sheffield has few buildings with the highest Grade I listing: Liverpool, for example, has 26 Grade I listed buildings. This situation led the noted architecture historian Nikolaus Pevsner, writing in 1959, to comment that the city was \"architecturally a miserable disappointment\", with no pre-19th-century buildings of any distinction.[215] By contrast, in November 2007, Sheffield's Peace and Winter Gardens beat London's South Bank to gain the Royal Institute of British Architects' Academy of Urbanism \"Great Place\" Award, as an \"outstanding example of how cities can be improved, to make urban spaces as attractive and accessible as possible\".[216] In the summer of 2016 a public art event across the city occurred called the Herd of Sheffield which raised \u00a3410,000 for the Sheffield Children's Hospital.[217]"

The Sheffield Botanical Gardens are on a 19-acre site located to the south-west of the city centre and date back to 1836. The site includes a large, Grade II listed, Victorian era glasshouse. The Peace Gardens, neighboured next to the Town Hall and forming part of the Heart of the City project, occupy a 0.67 hectares (1.7 acres) site in the centre of the city. The site is dominated by its water features, principal among which is the Goodwin Fountain. Made up of 89 individual jets of water, this fountain lies at the corner of the quarter-circle shaped Peace Gardens and is named after Stuart Goodwin, a notable Sheffield industrialist. Since their redevelopment in 1998, the Peace gardens have received a number of regional and national accolades.[220] Hillsborough Walled Garden is located in Hillsborough Park, to the north-west of the city centre. The gardens date back to 1779 and have been dedicated to the victims of the Hillsborough Disaster since the redevelopment of the gardens in the early 1990s.[221] The Winter Garden, lying within the Heart of the City, is a large wood framed, glass skinned greenhouse housing some 2,500 plants from around the world.[222] Also within the city there are a number of nature reserves which when combined occupy 1,600 acres (6.5\u00a0km2) of land.[223] There are also 170 woodland areas within the city, 80 of which are classed as ancient.[223] The south-west boundary of the city overlaps with the Peak District National Park, the first national park in England (est. 1951).[224] As a consequence, several communities actually reside within both entities. The Peak District is home to many notable, natural, features and also human-made features such as Chatsworth House, the setting for the BBC series Pride and Prejudice.[225] Sheffield City Council has created a new chain of parks spanning the hillside behind Sheffield Station. The park, known as Sheaf Valley Park, has an open-air amphitheatre and will include an arboretum.[226] The site was once home to a medieval deer park, latterly owned by the Duke of Norfolk.[226]"

The repertoire at two nearby places can vary widely, and woe betide those who try to strike up a 'foreign' carol. Some are unaccompanied, some have a piano or organ, there is a flip chart with the words on in one place, a string quartet (quintet, sextet, septet) accompanies the singing at another, some encourage soloists, others stick to audience participation, a brass band plays at certain events, the choir takes the lead at another.[269] Sheffield was shortlisted to host the 2023 Eurovision Song Contest,[270] which took place between 9 and 13 May 2023 in Liverpool."

        "content": "Initial construction was completed in 1927, at a site located 39 miles (63\u00a0km) upstream of the Niobrara's confluence with the Missouri River.[3] The dam was originally 3,698 feet (1,127\u00a0m) long and 26 feet (7.9\u00a0m) high, constructed in several sections.[1] The powerhouse was located on the north bank of the river, consisting of two Westinghouse generators with capacities of 2000 and 1300 kilowatts.[2] The spillway consisted of four tainter gates and five stoplog gates to the south of the powerhouse. The combined length of the powerhouse and spillway was 404 feet (123\u00a0m); the rest of the dam was an earth embankment extending to the south side of the Niobrara valley.[2] The dam originally formed a reservoir with a capacity of 16,847 acre-feet (20,780,000\u00a0m3),[3] a normal storage of 5,306 acre-feet (6,545,000\u00a0m3),[1] and a surface area of 1,200 acres (490\u00a0ha).[2] In 1935 the dam was partially breached after an ice jam broke upstream. It was reconstructed in 1940.[3] Both after its initial construction and after rebuilding in 1940, the dam was filled with sediment within a few years.[5] Although this did not affect hydropower generation since the dam was operated to match the river flow,[1] twice-annual sluicing had been conducted since 1948 to clear sediment away from the power intakes.[2] The dam gates were opened for about two weeks each year, allowing the river to flow through and wash accumulated sediment downstream.[2] Between 1975 and 1989, fish kills occurred in the Niobrara River that were attributed to sluicing activities. In response, engineers began draining the reservoir more slowly, which has worked in preventing further fish kills.[2] By 1985, Spencer Dam was the only active hydroelectric plant on the Niobrara River, after the upstream Cornell Dam ceased operation.[1] The NPPD had rights to 1,400,000 acre-feet (1.7\u00d7109\u00a0m3) of water per year for power generation. As of 2007, the average annual flow through the power plant was 874,000 acre-feet (1.078\u00d7109\u00a0m3).[3] In 2007, in regards to severe declines in the flow of the Niobrara River as a result of upstream irrigation, NPPD requested that the state of Nebraska make farmers pay as compensation for lost power generation. Several lawsuits were filed as a result, but as of May 2010 all had been decided in favor of NPPD, whose water rights are senior to the irrigators' rights.[3] In September 2015, NPPD announced that it would be decommissioning the Spencer hydropower plant in 2017 due to increasingly uneconomical cost of power generation at this site. The water rights would be sold for $9 million to the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission and five local natural resources districts to manage the river for agriculture, recreation and wildlife conservation. The dam was planned to remain in place with the gates permanently removed, allowing the river to flow freely through the site.[6]"

        "content": "On the early morning of March 14, 2019, the dam was breached after a major storm caused heavy rain, snowmelt and ice breakage to swell the Niobrara River. The earth embankment was washed out in two locations, while the spillway remained partially intact (though heavily damaged). An 11-foot (3.4\u00a0m) wall of water was released by the failure, as recorded by a U.S. Geological Survey stream gage moments before it was washed away.[7] The initial break destroyed a saloon and private residence below the dam and washed out part of U.S. Highway 281. The owner of the home was reported missing and presumed dead. In the town of Niobrara, dozens of buildings and the Mormon Canal Bridge carrying Nebraska Highway 12 were washed away. A water pipeline under the Niobrara River bed was destroyed, cutting off the supply for about 2,000 people in Boyd County.[7] The dam failure forced the evacuation of residents in low-lying areas along the river.[8][9] Shortly after the dam burst, Knox County Sheriff Don Henery announced: \"The Knox County Sheriff\u2019s Office has been advised that the Spencer Dam has been compromised. We are trying to contact everyone along the Niobrara River to evacuate them. Please pass the word. Niobrara and Verdigre (Nebraska) Fire and Rescue are on stand-by.\"[10] As the floodwaters from the Niobrara reached the Missouri River, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers boosted releases at Gavins Point Dam to 90,000 cubic feet per second (2,500\u00a0m3/s), the highest level since 2011 and the second highest on record.[10] While the timing of Spencer Dam failing corresponds to increased releases from Gavins Point, correlation does not mean causation.  Both were a result from record flows on the Niobrara River. The Chief Standing Bear Memorial Bridge across the Missouri River below the Niobrara confluence was temporarily closed as the Nebraska approach flooded, but it reopened a few days later. NPPD later said that workers had attempted to open the dam's manually operated gates to release floodwater, but some were frozen shut by the cold weather and may have contributed to water overtopping the earthen embankment a short while later. In addition \"truck-sized ice chunks\" were reported to have hit the dam and also caused the destruction of the bridges downstream.[11] During an inspection in April 2018 the Nebraska Department of Natural Resources had warned that \"deficiencies [in the dam] exist which could lead to dam failure during rare, extreme storm events.\"[12] Because the 2015 sale of the dam had been delayed until after its destruction, the damsite will no longer be sold to the state of Nebraska as originally planned. The remains of the dam are planned to be demolished, although NPPD will retain the water rights to the river.[12]"

The season ran from November 1, 2011, to April 30, 2012, however, any tropical cyclones that form before June 30, 2012, would have fallen within the 2011\u201312 tropical cyclone year and would have counted towards the season total. The strongest and only severe tropical cyclone that occurred during the season was Severe Tropical Cyclone Jasmine, which tracked in from out of the South Pacific basin. Within the basin, tropical cyclones are monitored by the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center (RSMC) in Nadi, Fiji, and the Tropical Cyclone Warning Center (TCWC) in Wellington, New Zealand. RSMC Nadi attaches an F designation to tropical disturbances that form in or move into the South Pacific. The United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issues unofficial warnings within the South Pacific, designating tropical storm-equivalent or greater tropical cyclones with a number and a P suffix. RSMC Nadi and TCWC Wellington both use the Australian Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale, and measure windspeeds over a period of ten minutes, while the JTWC measures sustained winds over a period of one minute and uses the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale.[1]"

Cyclone Jasmine developed from an area of disturbed weather on February 1 in the Gulf of Carpentaria.[33] Initially, the storm moved towards the east and across the Cape York Peninsula.[34] As it moved across the South Pacific, earlier existing wind shear conditions lessened, and Jasmine began to strengthen at a faster rate. Steadily intensifying, Erica reached peak intensity on February 8 as a Category 4 equivalent on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale, while beginning to show annular characteristics. The next day Jasmine entered an area of vertical wind shear, which consequently weakened the cyclone and caused its eye to expand. A high-pressure area south of Jasmine later steered the weakening cyclone to the northeast on February 12.[35] Although it entered an area of warmer sea surface temperatures, Jasmine subsequently entered extratropical transition and later degenerated into an extratropical cyclone on February 16, before dissipating completely on February 19.[36] Cyclone Jasmine affected five\u00a0countries during its existence. The predecessor to Jasmine brought heavy rainfall to areas of extreme northern Queensland.[34] Jasmine also brought rainfall to areas of the Solomon Islands. As a result, pest infestations occurred across the region.[37] In Vanuatu, heavy rains and wind from Jasmine destroy numerous crops. Banana trees in particular are affected by the cyclone.[38] Cyclone Jasmine inundated areas of Tonga that had already been affected by Cyclone Cyril just a week prior.[39] Nuku\u02bbalofa recorded half of its average monthly rainfall in a 24\u2011hour span due to rains associated with the cyclone.[40] After the season, the name Jasmine was retired.[41]"

Forming out of a tropical disturbance on March\u00a09, 2010, designated 14F by the Fiji Meteorological Service, the system gradually organized within an environment favoring intensification. By March\u00a011, the disturbance had strengthened sufficiently to be classified as Tropical Cyclone Tomas, the eighth named storm of the 2009\u201310 South Pacific cyclone season. Modest intensification took place over the following few days, with the system attaining severe tropical cyclone status on March\u00a013. On March\u00a014, Tomas began to impact parts of Fiji while continuing to gain strength. As it passed near Vanua Levu on March\u00a015, the cyclone attained its peak intensity with winds of 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph) and a pressure of 930\u00a0hPa (mbar) according to the FMS. At the same time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center assessed it as a Category\u00a04 equivalent storm with 1-minute sustained winds of 215\u00a0km/h (135\u00a0mph). Cyclone Tomas proved to be very destructive throughout Fiji, leaving many homeless and entire villages under water. At least one person has been confirmed to have been killed by the storm after being swept out to sea while rescuing family members. Reports from outlying islands state that entire homes have been flattened by wind gusts up to 280\u00a0km/h (170\u00a0mph)."

Rapid intensification was expected to take place over the following 48\u00a0hours as sea surface temperatures ahead of the storm averaged 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F), well-above the threshold for tropical cyclone development.[6] Throughout the day on March\u00a012, Tomas steadily intensified,[7] and early the next day, the JTWC upgraded the storm to a Category\u00a01 equivalent hurricane with winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph).[8] Convective banding substantially increased on March\u00a013, allowing Tomas to become the fourth severe tropical cyclone of the season early the next morning.[9] Around the same time, the JTWC assessed the storm to have attained winds of 155\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph), ranking it as a Category\u00a02 cyclone.[8] By the afternoon of March\u00a014, Tomas had developed a banding-eye feature surrounded by deep convection. At this point, the FMS assessed the storm to have winds of 150\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph) and a pressure of 950\u00a0hPa (mbar).[10] The JTWC also noted further intensification, upgrading Tomas to a Category\u00a03 equivalent storm.[8] As it passed near Vanua Levu on March\u00a015, the cyclone attained its peak intensity with winds of 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph) and a pressure of 930\u00a0hPa (mbar) according to the FMS.

Officials feared that severe damage and loss of life occurred on the island. Many homes along rivers and the Pacific were washed away by rising waters and tides exceeding 7\u00a0m (23\u00a0ft). Parts of the region have been soaked with upwards of 350\u00a0mm (14\u00a0in) of rain over a two-day span with more falling. Power and running water was disrupted to numerous islands, forcing thousands to seek shelter. During the initial assessment of damage, at least 50 homes were confirmed to have been destroyed by Tomas. This prompted Fijian officials to declare a State of disaster for the northern and eastern divisions of Fiji.[12][13] On its way, the cyclone has passed near Futuna island, heavily damaging an important part of houses and other buildings and cutting the water and electricity supply, but leaving no human casualties. The most severed was the north-eastern part of the island and notably the village of Poi and its surroundings. There, the islands only road was washed away and most of the houses were completely demolished by strong wind and rising waves. After the storm, the governments of New Zealand and Australia each sent $1 million in their respective currencies to Fiji. The New Zealand Air Force sent relief supplies, including tarps and water purifying equipment.[14]"

It was one of eight storms to impact Mexico from either the Pacific or Atlantic oceans in the season. Larry formed in early October from an extratropical storm in the Bay of Campeche, and reached a peak intensity of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h). Due to weak steering currents, the storm moved southward, which resulted in the storm making landfall on the Tabasco coastline. It was the first tropical storm to strike the region since Tropical Storm Brenda in 1973.[1] Larry drifted across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, dropping heavy rainfall of over 9\u00a0in (230\u00a0mm) in places. The rainfall led to flooding and mudslides, causing damage to thousands of houses. The flooding killed five people and resulted in $53.6\u00a0million (2003\u00a0USD) in damage.

It moved across the shear-ridden Atlantic Ocean without development, and remained disorganized until reaching the western Caribbean Sea on September 26. There, the wave situated itself beneath an upper-level anticyclone, allowing for favorable upper-level outflow and for deep convection to develop. On the September 27, a low pressure area developed while the system was located a few hundred miles to the east of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. The system continued to organize, and nearly developed into a tropical depression before moving ashore on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula on September 29.[2] Dry air and land weakened the tropical wave, and when it entered the area of the Bay of Campeche, it merged with a stationary frontal boundary. Cool, dry air around the system caused the system to develop a cold core, and the area organized into an extratropical low on September 30. A large high pressure system over the northern Gulf of Mexico forced the system southward, where it developed significant convection. The system developed a warm core, and on October 1 the storm organized into Tropical Storm Larry while located 300\u00a0mi (480\u00a0km) east-southeast of Tampico, Mexico.[2] Weak steering currents allowed for Larry to drift westward at about two\u00a0mph\u00a0(3\u00a0km/h) while marginally favorable conditions allowed the storm to strengthen to a peak of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) on October 3. A mid-level ridge forced the storm more to the south-southeast, where after remaining a 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) storm for three days, Larry made landfall at Para\u00edso, Tabasco, on October 5. It steadily weakened over land, and degenerated into a remnant low on October 6 while midway through the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The remnant low turned to the southwest, and reached the eastern Pacific Ocean on the October 7.[2] The remnants of Larry re-organized somewhat in the eastern Pacific, with the National Hurricane Center indicating for the possibility of redevelopment into a tropical depression on October 9.[3] However, the convection diminished, and further development was no longer anticipated.[4]"

        "content": "In the winter of 1909\u20131910, Paris and the surrounding area experienced higher than normal rainfall which saturated the ground and filled rivers to overflowing. In January 1910, Parisians were preoccupied with daily life and lulled into a false sense of security because the Seine's water level had risen and fallen again in December. Consequently, they largely ignored reports of mudslides and flooding occurring upriver. They were also slow to notice warnings signs within the city as the Seine's water level rose eight meters (26.2467) higher than normal;[2] its water began to flow much faster than normal, and large amounts of debris appeared.[3] By late January, the Seine River flooded Paris when water pushed upwards from overflowing sewers and subway tunnels, then seeped into basements through fully saturated soil and from the sewer system that got backed up, which led to the basements of several buildings sustaining damage.[4] The waters did not overflow the river's banks within the city, but flooded Paris through tunnels, sewers, and drains. These larger sewer tunnels were engineered by Baron Haussmann and Eugene Belgrand in 1878 which magnified the destruction caused by the floods in 1910.[5] In neighboring towns both east and west of the capital, the river rose above its banks and flooded the surrounding terrain directly. Winter floods were a normal occurrence in Paris but, on 21 January, the river began to rise more rapidly than normal. This was seen as a sort of spectacle where people were actually standing in the streets watching the water rise in the Seine.[5] Over the course of the following week, thousands of Parisians evacuated their homes as water infiltrated buildings and streets throughout the city, shutting down much basic infrastructure. The infrastructure was more vulnerable to flooding because most of it was built within the sewage system in order to avoid cluttering the streets.[4] Police, firemen, and soldiers moved through waterlogged streets in boats to rescue stranded residents from second-story windows and to distribute aid. Refugees gathered in makeshift shelters in churches, schools, and government buildings. Although the water threatened to overflow the tops of the quay walls lining the river, workmen were able to keep the Seine back with hastily built levees. Once water invaded the Gare d'Orsay rail terminal, its tracks soon sat under more than a meter (3.28 feet) of water. To continue moving throughout the city, residents traveled by boat or across a series of wooden walkways built by government engineers and civilians. On 28 January the water reached its maximum height at 8.62 meters (28.28\u00a0feet) above its normal level.[4] In March, the Seine finally returned to normal levels."

A considerable amount of molasses had been stored there by the company, which used the harborside Commercial Street tank to offload molasses from ships and store it for later transfer by pipeline to the Purity ethanol plant situated between Willow Street and Evereteze Way in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The molasses tank stood 50 feet (15 meters) tall and 90\u00a0ft (27\u00a0m) in diameter, and contained as much as 2.3\u00a0million\u00a0US\u00a0gal (8,700\u00a0m3). On January 15, 1919, temperatures in Boston had risen above 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius), climbing rapidly from the frigid temperatures of the preceding days,[7]:\u200a91,\u200a95\u200a and the previous day, a ship had delivered a fresh load of molasses, which had been warmed to decrease its viscosity for transfer.[8] Possibly due to the thermal expansion of the older, colder molasses already inside the tank, the tank burst open and collapsed at approximately 12:30\u00a0p.m. Witnesses reported that they felt the ground shake and heard a roar as it collapsed, a long rumble similar to the passing of an elevated train; others reported a tremendous crashing, a deep growling, \"a thunderclap-like bang!\", and a sound like a machine gun as the rivets shot out of the tank.[7]:\u200a92\u201395 The density of molasses is about 1.4 metric tons per cubic meter (12 pounds per US gallon), 40 percent more dense than water, resulting in the molasses having a great deal of potential energy.[9] The collapse translated this energy into a wave of molasses 25\u00a0ft (8\u00a0m) high at its peak,[10] moving at 35\u00a0mph (56\u00a0km/h).[5][6] The wave was of sufficient force to drive steel panels of the burst tank against the girders of the adjacent Boston Elevated Railway's Atlantic Avenue structure[11] and tip a streetcar momentarily off the El's tracks. Stephen Puleo describes how nearby buildings were swept off their foundations and crushed. Several blocks were flooded to a depth of 2 to 3\u00a0ft (60 to 90\u00a0cm). Puleo quotes a Boston Post report: Molasses, waist deep, covered the street and swirled and bubbled about the wreckage\u00a0[...] Here and there struggled a form\u2014whether it was animal or human being was impossible to tell. Only an upheaval, a thrashing about in the sticky mass, showed where any life was\u00a0[...] Horses died like so many flies on sticky fly-paper. The more they struggled, the deeper in the mess they were ensnared. Human beings\u2014men and women\u2014suffered likewise.[7]:\u200a98 The Boston Globe reported that people \"were picked up by a rush of air and hurled many feet\". Others had debris hurled at them from the rush of sweet-smelling air. A truck was picked up and hurled into Boston Harbor. After the initial wave, the molasses became viscous, exacerbated by the cold temperatures, trapping those caught in the wave and making it even more difficult to rescue them.[9] About 150 people were injured, and 21 people and several horses were killed. Some were crushed and drowned by the molasses or by the debris that it carried within.[12] The wounded included people, horses, and dogs; coughing fits became one of the most common ailments after the initial blast. Edwards Park wrote of one child's experience in a 1983 article for Smithsonian: Anthony di Stasio, walking homeward with his sisters from the Michelangelo School, was picked up by the wave and carried, tumbling on its crest, almost as though he were surfing. Then he grounded and the molasses rolled him like a pebble as the wave diminished. He heard his mother call his name and couldn't answer, his throat was so clogged with the smothering goo. He passed out, then opened his eyes to find three of his four sisters staring at him.[6]"

Copeland from USS\u00a0Nantucket, a training ship of the Massachusetts Nautical School (now the Massachusetts Maritime Academy) that was docked nearby at the playground pier.[13] The cadets ran several blocks toward the accident and entered into the knee-deep flood of molasses to pull out the survivors, while others worked to keep curious onlookers from getting in the way of the rescuers. The Boston Police, Red Cross, Army, and Navy personnel soon arrived. Some nurses from the Red Cross dove into the molasses, while others tended to the injured, keeping them warm and feeding the exhausted workers. Many of these people worked through the night, and the injured were so numerous that doctors and surgeons set up a makeshift hospital in a nearby building. Rescuers found it difficult to make their way through the syrup to help the victims, and four days elapsed before they stopped searching; many of the dead were so glazed over in molasses that they were hard to recognize.[6] Other victims were swept into Boston Harbor and were found three to four months after the disaster.[12] In the wake of the accident, 119 residents brought a class-action lawsuit against the United States Industrial Alcohol Company (USIA),[14] which had bought Purity Distilling in 1917. It was one of the first class-action suits in Massachusetts and is considered a milestone in paving the way for modern corporate regulation.[15] The company claimed that the tank had been blown up by anarchists[7]:\u200a165\u200a because some of the alcohol produced was to be used in making munitions, but a court-appointed auditor found USIA responsible after three years of hearings, and the company ultimately paid out $628,000 in damages[15] ($11\u00a0million in 2023, adjusted for inflation[16]).

        "content": "Several factors might have contributed to the disaster. The first factor is that the tank may have leaked from the very first day that it was filled in 1915.[21][22] The tank was also constructed poorly and tested insufficiently, and carbon dioxide production might have raised the internal pressure due to fermentation in the tank. Warmer weather the previous day would have assisted in building this pressure, as the air temperature rose from 2 to 41\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221217 to 5.0\u00a0\u00b0C) over that period. The failure occurred from a manhole cover near the base of the tank, and a fatigue crack there possibly grew to the point of criticality. The tank had been filled to capacity only eight times since it was built a few years previously, putting the walls under an intermittent, cyclical load. Several authors say that the Purity Distilling Company was trying to out-race prohibition,[23][24][25] as the 18th amendment was ratified the next day (January 16, 1919) and took effect one year later.[26] An inquiry after the disaster revealed that Arthur Jell, USIA's treasurer, neglected basic safety tests while overseeing construction of the tank, such as filling it with water insufficient to check for leaks, and ignored warning signs such as groaning noises each time the tank was filled. He had no architectural or engineering experience.[5][9] When filled with molasses, the tank leaked so badly that it was painted brown to hide the leakage. Local residents collected leaked molasses for their homes.[27] A 2014 investigation applied modern engineering analysis and found that the steel was half as thick as it should have been for a tank of its size even with the lower standards they had at the time. Another issue was that the steel lacked manganese and was made more brittle as a result.[28] The tank's rivets were also apparently flawed, and cracks first formed at the rivet holes.[5] In 2016, a team of scientists and students at Harvard University conducted extensive studies of the disaster, gathering data from many sources, including 1919 newspaper articles, old maps, and weather reports.[29] The student researchers also studied the behavior of cold corn syrup flooding a scale model of the affected neighborhood.[30] The researchers concluded that the reports of the high speed of the flood were credible.[30] Two days before the disaster, warmer molasses had been added to the tank, reducing the viscosity of the fluid. When the tank collapsed, the fluid cooled quickly as it spread, until it reached Boston's winter evening temperatures and the viscosity increased dramatically.[31] The Harvard study concluded that the molasses cooled and thickened quickly as it rushed through the streets, hampering efforts to free victims before they suffocated.[29][30][32]"

        "content": "United States Industrial Alcohol did not rebuild the tank. The property formerly occupied by the molasses tank and the North End Paving Company became a yard for the Boston Elevated Railway (predecessor to the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority). It is now the site of a city-owned recreational complex, officially named Langone Park, featuring a Little League Baseball field, a playground, and bocce courts.[33] Immediately to the east is the larger Puopolo Park, with additional recreational facilities.[34] A small plaque at the entrance to Puopolo Park, placed by the Bostonian Society, commemorates the disaster.[35] The plaque, titled \"Boston Molasses Flood\", reads: On January 15, 1919, a molasses tank at 529 Commercial Street exploded under pressure, killing 21 people. A 40-foot wave of molasses buckled the elevated railroad tracks, crushed buildings and inundated the neighborhood. Structural defects in the tank combined with unseasonably warm temperatures contributed to the disaster. The accident has since become a staple of local culture, not only for the damage the flood brought, but also for the sweet smell that filled the North End for decades after the disaster.[6] According to journalist Edwards Park, \"The smell of molasses remained for decades a distinctive, unmistakable atmosphere of Boston.\"[6] On January 15, 2019, for the 100th anniversary of the event, a ceremony was held in remembrance. Ground-penetrating radar was used to identify the exact location of the tank from 1919.[36] The concrete slab base for the tank remains in place approximately 20 inches (51\u00a0cm) below the surface of the baseball diamond at Langone Park. Attendees of the ceremony stood in a circle marking the edge of the tank. The 21 names of those who died in, or as a result of, the flood were read aloud.[37][38] Many laws and regulations governing construction were changed as a direct result of the disaster, including requirements for oversight by a licensed architect and civil engineer.[9][39]"

        "content": "Tropical Storm Arlene was a short lived, pre-season tropical storm which made landfall on the central Louisiana coastline on May 30, 1959, causing minor damages and one fatality. Arlene, the first named storm of the 1959 Atlantic hurricane season, developed out of a tropical wave which was first noted near the Dominican Republic on May 23. Development of the system was slow before it gained enough convection to be declared Tropical Storm Arlene on May 28. The storm slowly intensified and reached its peak intensity of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) on May 30. Rapid weakening took place as the storm neared land and Arlene made landfall with winds of 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h) later that night. Arlene weakened to what is now classified as a Tropical Depression early the next morning. The system degenerated into a remnant low on the afternoon of May 31 and fully dissipated late on June 2 while located over South Carolina. Arlene dropped heavy rains totaling over 1\u00a0ft (0.30\u00a0m) in localized areas as it moved into the Southeast United States. The maximum rainfall amount was 13.55\u00a0in (344\u00a0mm), recorded in Merrill, Mississippi, over a three-day period. The heavy rains caused minor flooding in Louisiana and property damage from the storm amounted to $500,000 ($3.7 million 2008 USD). One death was indirectly attributed to the storm when a man drowned in rough surf off the Texas coast."

        "content": "Tropical Storm Arlene developed out of a tropical wave which was first noted near the Dominican Republic on May 23. The wave slowly developed as it moved westward through the Caribbean Sea and developed into an area of low pressure on May 25. By May 27, the low entered the Gulf of Mexico and a ship report the next day showed that the low had developed a closed low-level circulation.[1] Early the next morning, the low was determined to have intensified into Tropical Storm Arlene, the first storm of the season, while located 300\u00a0mi (480\u00a0km) south-southeast of New Orleans, Louisiana with winds estimated at 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h). Arlene was moving towards the northwest at 10 to 15\u00a0mph (16 to 24\u00a0km/h). Arlene slowly intensified throughout the day as it continued towards the northwest at 12 to 15\u00a0mph (19 to 24\u00a0km/h).[2] On May 29, Arlene turned towards the west and its foreword motion slowed before becoming nearly stationary that night.[1][3] The storm was located 150\u00a0mi (240\u00a0km) south of Lafayette, Louisiana as it drifted northward and winds were estimated to have peaked at 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h).[4] However, in the post-season, it was determined that Arlene peaked near landfall with winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h).[5] As Arlene neared the coast, the storm began to weaken due to the interaction with land. Arlene made landfall about 40\u00a0mi (64\u00a0km) southeast of Lafayette, Louisiana at 2100\u00a0UTC (4 p.m.\u00a0CST). The operational landfall intensity was 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) but it was lowered to 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h) in the post season.[5][6] Upon making landfall, Arlene became the earliest landfalling tropical cyclone in Louisiana history.[1] Arlene weakened quickly to a tropical depression shortly after landfall. The storm further degenerated to a remnant area of low-pressure on the afternoon of May 31.[7] The remnant of the storm lingered in the Southern United States until June 2, when it dissipated over South Carolina.[5] Although the original low pressure system dissipated, a new, non tropical center formed further north over Virginia. This new low quickly tracked northeast, brushing the southern coast of New England before moving over Nova Scotia and losing its identity on June\u00a03.[8]"

        "content": "The low that eventually became Arlene prompted wind warnings and small craft advisories for both coasts in southern Florida on May 27.[1] The small craft advisory was significantly expanded the next day when the low was upgraded to Tropical Storm Arlene. The new warnings stretched from Sabine Pass, Texas to Saint Marks, Florida. Gale warnings were also issued upon the upgrade from Morgan City, Louisiana to Pascagoula, Mississippi. Rough seas and tides of two to four feet (0.6 to 1.2 metres)\u2014also known as storm surge\u2014were expected in the areas under the gale warning.[2] By May\u00a029, all craft were advised not to leave port in Louisiana. Memories of Hurricane Audrey led to numerous residents evacuating coastal areas upon hearing about Arlene.[9] In Pierre, 50 families evacuated to higher grounds.[10] Officials reported that 25 families were also evacuated from low-lying areas in Vermilion Parish.[11] As Arlene neared landfall, the small craft advisory was canceled from Pensacola, Florida southward. The new warnings extended from Pensacola to Galveston, Texas. The gale warnings shifted more towards the west, now extending from Galveston, Texas to Grand Isle, Louisiana.[3] Arlene produced winds up to 55\u00a0mph (89\u00a0km/h) with gusts up to 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h) upon landfall. The lowest pressure recorded on land was 999.7\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.52\u00a0inHg), which was rounded up to 1000\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.53\u00a0inHg) for the minimum pressure of the storm. Minor storm surge up to three feet was recorded at Weeks Island and Point Au Fer, Louisiana.[1] Heavy rains fell across much of the southeastern Louisiana coastline. During a 24\u2011hour span, 10.92\u00a0in (277\u00a0mm) of rain fell in Moisant International Airport.[12] Roughly 2\u00a0ft (0.61\u00a0m) of water flooded the control tower at the airport, forcing traffic control workers to relocate to the new tower which was under-construction.[13] A state maximum rainfall of 13.13\u00a0in (334\u00a0mm) fell in Houma.[1] Along the coast, a few towns reported downed trees and electrical lines from high winds, resulting in scattered power outages.[14] At the height of the storm, several of the main roads in New Orleans were shut down due to flooding.[12] At least 100 homes were flooded by the storm. In Baton Rouge, dozens of people were evacuated from a flooded home via ambulance and wagon to safer areas.[10] In nearby Mississippi, rainfall from the storm was mainly confined to the southeastern counties; however, significant accumulations, peaking at 13.55\u00a0in (344\u00a0mm), were recorded.[15] Rain from the remnant low spread into Georgia. Some stream flooding and crop damage were reported but overall, the damage was minor. In all, Arlene caused $500,000 ($3.7\u00a0million 2010 USD) in damage. One death was related to Arlene; a man drowned in rough surf off the Galveston coast.[1] After the initial low dissipated over the southeastern United States, the extratropical remnants of Arlene brought moderate rainfall to parts of the Mid-Atlantic States and New England.[8]"

        "content": " The 1854 Atlantic hurricane season featured five known tropical cyclones, three of which made landfall in the United States. At one time, another was believed to have existed near Galveston, Texas in September,[1] but HURDAT \u2013 the official Atlantic hurricane database \u2013 now excludes this system.[2] The first system, Hurricane One, was initially observed on June\u00a025. The final storm, Hurricane Five, was last observed on October\u00a022. These dates fall within the period with the most tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic. No tropical cyclones during this season existed simultaneously. One tropical cyclone has a single known point in its track due to a sparsity of data. Of the season's five tropical cyclones, three reached hurricane status. Furthermore, one of those strengthened into a major hurricane, which is Category\u00a03 or higher on the modern-day Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale. The strongest cyclone of the season, the third hurricane, peaked at Category\u00a03 strength with 125\u00a0mph (201\u00a0km/h) winds. After making landfall near the Georgia-South Carolina border, the storm caused 26\u00a0fatalities and extensive damage in the area. Hurricane Four caused four deaths and approximately $20,000 (1854\u00a0USD) in damage after striking the coast of Texas. Hurricane One also caused moderate damage in Texas."

It headed westward and strengthened into a hurricane about 12\u00a0hours later. Peaking with maximum sustained winds 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 982\u00a0mbar (29.0\u00a0inHg),[2][3] the storm maintained this intensity until making landfall in South Padre Island, Texas at 1200\u00a0UTC on June\u00a026. It quickly weakened inland and fell to tropical storm strength about six hours later. The system continued in a west-northwestward direction over northern Mexico, until dissipating in a rural area of Coahuila on June\u00a027.[2] This system brought near tropical storm-force winds to Texas as far north as Galveston. Brazos Island experienced the brunt of this storm, where winds blew a \"perfect hurricane\". Many buildings in the area lost their roofs or were moved by the winds. Additionally, a cistern at the Quartermaster's Department was destroyed. The coast of Texas was also impacted by storm surge, with several bath houses washed away at Lavaca. Precipitation in the region was generally light, peaking at 6.63\u00a0in (168\u00a0mm) at Fort Ringgold, which is near modern-day Rio Grande City.[4]"

The brig Reindeer sighted a hurricane about 25\u00a0mi (40\u00a0km) east of Hope Town in the Bahamas on September\u00a07.[1] With winds of 125\u00a0mph (205\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 938\u00a0mbar (27.7\u00a0inHg), this was the strongest tropical cyclone of the season. It moved northwestward and weakened slightly on September\u00a08. Later that day at 2000\u00a0UTC, the hurricane made landfall near St. Catherines Island, Georgia with winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h). Early on September\u00a09, it weakened to a Category\u00a01 hurricane, then a tropical storm several hours later. Thereafter, the storm accelerated northeastward and re-emerged into the Atlantic Ocean near Virginia Beach, Virginia on September\u00a010. The system re-strengthened, becoming a hurricane again on September\u00a011. It eventually began to weaken again while moving rapidly eastward and was last noted about 515\u00a0mi (830\u00a0km) southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland.[2] Gales were reported in Florida, including as far south as St. Augustine. In Georgia, the entire coast suffered significant impacts, with damage more severe from St. Simons northward. About 110 acres (45\u00a0ha) of rice crops were destroyed, equivalent to a loss of approximately 6,000\u00a0bushels. Between Savannah, Georgia and Charleston, South Carolina, \"extraordinary tides\" were reported.[7] Hutchinson Island, Georgia was completely submerged, while there was significant inundation in eastern Savannah. Storm surge also brought coastal flooding to much of South Carolina, from Beaufort to Georgetown. Wind damage in that area was mainly confined to downed trees. However, in Charleston, South Carolina, a two-story wooden building was destroyed and there was slight to moderate damage to other structures, limited to roofs and the destruction of fences. This hurricane compared similarly to hurricanes that struck Charleston in 1752, 1783, 1804, 1811, and 1822 in flooding and strength.[8][9] Throughout the United States, this storm resulted in at least 26\u00a0fatalities.[10]"

The storm drifted west-northwestward with winds of 105\u00a0mph (165\u00a0km/h), equivalent to a Category\u00a02 hurricane.[2] The lowest barometric pressure estimate was 965\u00a0mbar (28.5\u00a0inHg).[3] At 2100\u00a0UTC on September\u00a018, the storm made landfall near Freeport, Texas at the same intensity. It weakened to a Category\u00a01 hurricane early on the following day. The system further weakened to a tropical storm at 1200\u00a0UTC on September\u00a019. Re-curving northeastward, the storm persisted until dissipating over eastern Texas on September\u00a020.[2] The steamship Louisiana reported that a gale struck Matagorda, Texas with \"unparalleled fury\", with nearly all buildings and vessels in the area destroyed.[1] Several vessels also capsized near Galveston, including the Nick Hill and Kate Ward. Within the city of Galveston, merchants, businesses, and houses suffered significant water damage due to an 8\u00a0ft (2.4\u00a0m) storm surge. Cotton and sugar cane crops throughout the area were ruined. The storm caused at least four deaths, with several more occurring later due to a yellow fever outbreak.

        "content": "Severe Tropical Cyclone Bola was one of the costliest cyclones in the history of New Zealand,[1] causing severe damage as an extratropical cyclone when it passed near the country in March 1988. It formed on February 24 to the north of Fiji, and tracking generally southwestward it reached hurricane-force winds near Vanuatu on February 28. The next day it generated peak wind velocities of 195\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph), though it quickly weakened as it accelerated southward. On March 4, Bola transitioned into an extratropical storm, passing to the north of the North Island of New Zealand on March 8. It weakened further and was absorbed by a stationary trough near the South Island on March 12. The cyclone first affected Fiji, where it produced gale-force winds and strong waves. In Vanuatu, Bola dropped heavy rainfall, which destroyed two bridges and caused severe damage to islands in the group. Bola caused severe damage to the North Island of New Zealand, where heavy rainfall peaked at 917\u00a0mm (36.1\u00a0in) in the Gisborne Region. Damage totaled over $82\u00a0million (1988\u00a0USD).[2] Seven people were killed due to flooding,[3] and hundreds were evacuated when a swollen river threatened Wairoa. In Whangaruru Harbour, Northland, an elderly male suffered a heart attack and died during the peak of the storm while attempting to tie down a neighbour's empty water tank."

        "content": "The system that was to become Severe Tropical Cyclone Bola was first noted during February 24, as a depression that had developed within the South Pacific Convergence Zone about 850\u00a0km (530\u00a0mi) to the north-east of Nadi, Fiji.[4][5] During that day the system moved south-westwards and passed about 260\u00a0km (160\u00a0mi) to the north of Nadi, Fiji, before it started to move north-westwards during February 25.[5] The system was subsequently named Bola by the Fiji Meteorological Service during the next day, after it had become a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale.[4] The system subsequently moved south-westwards which meant that the islands of Maewo and Pentecost were threatened.[6] However, as Bola moved further southwards it entered a region of light and variable wind during February 27, which along with an area of high pressure in the Tasman Sea blocked Bola's movement southwards.[6] By this time Bola had become a category 2 tropical cyclone on the Australian scale, with wind speeds of between 95\u2013110\u00a0km/h (60\u201370\u00a0mph) occurring near the centre.[5] During February 28, the system became a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian scale, as it performed a small clockwise loop, between the Shepherd Islands and Efate.[5][6] After completing its first cyclonic loop during February 29, Bola started to move south-eastwards, before it performed a second cyclonic loop during the next day.[5][6] As it completed its second cyclonic loop during March 2, the FMS reported that the system had peaked with 10-minute sustained wind speeds of 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph), which made it a Category 4 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian scale.[5][6] The United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center also reported that the system had peaked with 1-minute sustained wind speeds of 195\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph), which made it equivalent to a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale.[7] After reaching peak intensity, Cyclone Bola quickly weakened as it accelerated southeastward toward a frontal trough.[8][9] On March 3, its winds dropped below hurricane-force,[8] and it gradually lost its tropical characteristics. The structure became asymmetric, with a large band of clouds extending well south of the circulation.[9] By March 4, Bola had completed the transition into an extratropical cyclone.[8] It then turned south and began to affect the North Island of New Zealand on March 6. A building ridge of high pressure to its south caused the extratropical remnants of Bola to slow and turn to the west on March 7. The next day, the storm passed about 110\u00a0km (68\u00a0mi) north of the North Island. Around the same time, the storm began slowly filling, meaning the low pressure area associated with Bola was losing its identity. It turned southward on March 9, and on March 12 was absorbed by a stationary trough in the Westerlies near the western coast of the South Island.[9][10]"

        "content": "Cyclone Bola created some of the largest rainfall totals for a single storm in the history of New Zealand, with some locations receiving more than half of their annual rainfall totals from the storm. While the cyclone passed north of the island, a strong easterly flow over the North Island contained the interaction between moist air from Bola and drier air from the ridge to its southeast. In the Gisborne region, the flow resulted in the heaviest rainfall totals, when the moisture ascended over the region's western mountainous areas and condensed into precipitation. One station recorded 419\u00a0mm (16.5\u00a0in) in a 24\u2011hour period.[9] The maximum rainfall total attributed to the storm was 917\u00a0mm (36.1\u00a0in), reported at a station near Tolaga Bay.[1] Heavy rainfall totals of up to and over 300\u00a0mm (12\u00a0in) were observed in the regions of Auckland and Northland.[9] The cyclone is the largest to be recorded in 93\u00a0years of rainfall records. As such, it had a large and lasting effect on the rivers of the area when it deposited a large amount of sediment, as recorded in the sedimentary record of Lake T\u016btira.[16] Shortly prior to losing its identity, the remnants of Bola also dropped 100\u2013200\u00a0mm (3.9\u20137.9\u00a0in) of precipitation on the South Island of New Zealand.[9] Storm damage was heaviest in Gisborne, where rain destroyed or damaged several roads and bridges.[9] Three days of continuous rainfall led to mudslides, flooding,[1] and erosion.[2] Seven people drowned in the flooding.[3] In Te Karaka in Gisborne, a flooded river forced 500\u00a0residents to evacuate. A total of 1,765\u00a0farmers were affected by the flooding, accounting for about 3,600 hectares (8,900 acres) of damaged crop fields and about $90\u00a0million in crop damage (1988\u00a0NZD$, 82\u00a0million 1988\u00a0USD). Water supplies were disrupted in two cities due to flooding. Rainfall in Northland Region caused flooding and outages to telephone and power.[1] Additionally, beginning on about 6 March, the cyclone began affecting the North Island with strong easterly winds of over hurricane force, caused by the interaction between the extratropical remnants of Bola and a ridge of high pressure to its south. The winds damaged a few homes, including some in which the roofs were damaged or destroyed.[1][9] In addition, the strong winds downed several trees, and at the same time, erosion and landslides left hillsides bare without grass or trees.[2][9] Crop and stock losses were high and among the thousands of people who fled three people died when their car was washed away by floodwaters.[17] The government responded with Michael Bassett, the Minister of Civil Defence, flying to Gisborne on 8 March in an air force plane (the airport was closed to normal passenger flights). There he met with Colin Moyle, the Minister of Agriculture, to organise restoring water and food supplies to the area. On 11 March the Prime Minister, David Lange, flew in an air force helicopter to areas north of Gisborne to accompany a mission to drop supplies to stranded people. At the final destination Lange famously was met by a farmers wife wearing a pink nightgown and gumboots who burst into tears of relief when presented with an aid package by Lange.[18] After regular warm summer weather resumed, with fresh running water connection still not fully reestablished, a health scare developed. Lange insisted on having a member of his personal staff in Gisborne, which inadvertently cut across lines of command established by Ed Latter, the Director of Civil Defence, causing confusion. After the dissipation of the cyclone a rebuilding effort was begun in Gisborne which benefitted the town.[19] Agriculture losses amounted to $90 million and the government's repair bill was more than $111 million.[17] Due to the effects of Cyclone Bola, many farms in Taranaki converted from horticulture to dairy farming.[20] The Royal New Zealand Navy Frigate HMNZS\u00a0Waikato sailed from Newcastle Australia to Auckland NZ when all merchant shipping had been stopped and encountered Cyclone Bola in the Tasman Sea. Waikato was a day late reaching Auckland and suffered some heavy damage, Crew Members still often talk about the passage back to New Zealand likening it to being tossed about like a Cork in the heavy Seas.[citation needed]"

In Bergen op Zoom, the Domain Council, the local administration, had issued the warning, but it had not had the intended effect, as most victims were not reached by the warning and were caught unprepared by the flood. With a level of more than four meters above the mean high water, the flood was well above the height of the dikes existing at the time, which were also severely neglected. In numerous places, the dikes were overrun by the water masses, causing incredible devastation. For example, in the area around Antwerp, four villages disappeared under a thick layer of mud and in Zeeland the small island Wulpen was permanently lost to the sea.[3] Chroniclers of the time reported that 80 percent of the country was under water.[1] It was confirmed that the floods drowned 20,000 people.[4] East Frisia and the offshore islands were also hit hard. A high tide mark at the church of Suurhusen, located north of Emden, showed + 4.40 m NN.[5] In many places, the dikes broke and devastated entire stretches of land that were under water for up to four weeks. The salt water meant that fields and meadows could no longer be used for a long time. The flooding reached as far as the Alte Land on the Elbe, the Vierlande near Hamburg and as far as Eiderstedt. Between the Ems and Weser rivers, around 10,000 people died and tens of thousands were left homeless. Entire villages disappeared and livestock and supplies were destroyed. The storm surge was seen as God's punishment. In the Protestant provinces of the Netherlands, it was understood as a call to rebel more vigorously against Spanish oppression, after the still unsuccessful uprising in 1568. In 1572, the Geuzen succeeded in conquering the provinces of Zeeland and Holland, which had been badly hit by the floods.[6]"

        "content": " The 1940 Nova Scotia hurricane swept through areas of Atlantic Canada in mid-September\u00a01940. The fifth tropical cyclone and fourth hurricane of the year, it formed as a tropical depression east of the Lesser Antilles on September\u00a07, though at the time weather observations in the area were sparse, so its formation was inferred. The disturbance gradually intensified throughout much of its early formative stages, attaining tropical storm strength on September\u00a010; further strengthening into a hurricane north of Puerto Rico occurred two days later. Shortly thereafter, the hurricane recurved northward, and reached peak intensity the following day as a Category\u00a02\u00a0hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of at least 988\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.18\u00a0inHg). The cyclone steadily weakened thereafter before making landfall on Nova Scotia on September\u00a017 with winds of 85\u00a0mph (135\u00a0km/h). Moving into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence later that day, the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. The remnant system curved eastward and passed over Newfoundland before dissipating over the Atlantic on September\u00a019. While off the United States East Coast, the hurricane caused numerous shipping incidents, most notably the stranding of the Swedish freighter Laponia off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina on September\u00a016. Two other boat incidents resulted in two deaths. The hurricane also brought strong winds of tropical storm-force and snow over areas of New England. In Atlantic Canada, a strong storm surge peaking at 4\u00a0ft (1.3\u00a0m) above average sunk or damaged several ships and inundated cities. In New Brunswick, the waves hurt the lobster fishing industry. In Nova Scotia, strong winds disrupted telecommunication and power services. The winds also severely damaged crops. Roughly half of apple production in Annapolis Valley was lost during the storm, resulting in around $1.49\u00a0million in economic losses.[nb 1] Strong winds in New Brunswick caused moderate to severe infrastructural damage, and additional damages to crops occurred there. Overall, the hurricane caused three fatalities, with two off the United States and one in New Brunswick."

        "content": "The origins of the system can be traced to a tropical depression roughly midway between the Lesser Antilles and the west coast of Africa at 1800\u00a0UTC on September\u00a07.[1] Though initially believed to have developed on September\u00a011,[2] the disturbance was found to have formed earlier in post-season reanalysis, based on data from the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set.[3] In its early developmental stages, the disturbance remained a tropical depression with little change in intensity. At 0600\u00a0UTC on September\u00a010, it intensified into a tropical storm while still east of the Lesser Antilles.[1] Closer to the islands, ships reported a quickly intensifying tropical cyclone with low barometric pressures, strong winds and heavy thunderstorms, although most of the activity occurred to the east of its center.[2][3] At 1800\u00a0UTC on September\u00a012, the storm intensified into the equivalent of a modern-day Category\u00a01\u00a0hurricane to the north of Puerto Rico.[1] The following day, the hurricane began to recurve northward, attaining  Category\u00a02 intensity at 1200\u00a0UTC.[2][1] Numerous vessels in its vicinity reported hurricane-force winds; the S.S. Borinquen observed a minimum peripheral pressure of 988\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.18\u00a0inHg), the lowest observed pressure associated with the hurricane.[2][3] At the time, the storm had maximum sustained winds of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h), which it maintained throughout its duration as a Category\u00a02\u00a0system. Progressing rapidly into more northerly latitudes, the storm weakened to a Category\u00a01\u00a0hurricane by 1800\u00a0UTC on September\u00a015.[1] By the next day, two warm fronts began extending eastward from the cyclone as the wind field expanded in size, indicating the start of an extratropical transition. At 0200\u00a0UTC, the hurricane made landfall near Lockeport, Nova Scotia, with winds of 85\u00a0mph (135\u00a0km/h).[3][1][4] The storm fully transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over the Gulf of Saint Lawrence by 1200\u00a0UTC on September\u00a017.[1] In the gulf, the system turned eastward, causing it to move ashore Newfoundland just north of Cape Race during the evening of September\u00a018.[2] After passing over the island, the extratropical storm reentered the Atlantic Ocean, where it gradually weakened before dissipating on September\u00a019.[1]"

        "content": "Though initially perceived to be a potential threat to The Bahamas and Florida due to its westward motion, the hurricane curved northward on September\u00a013, mitigating any evacuation procedures.[5] Despite the storm's change in track, the United States Weather Bureau cautioned shipping interests in the outlying islands of the Bahamas.[6] Pan American World Airways was forced to postpone two transatlantic flights from New York City to Portugal due to the storm.[7][8] After the hurricane recurved, the Weather Bureau advised caution to areas of the New England coast, particularly in Nantucket and Cape Cod, Massachusetts, where strong winds and waves were anticipated.[7] Storm warnings were posted for coastal areas from Hatteras, North Carolina to Eastport, Maine on September\u00a016. The warnings were discontinued after the hurricane passed the warned areas.[8] On September\u00a016, strong waves produced by the hurricane disabled the Swedish freighter Laponia, which at the time was located 300\u00a0mi (480\u00a0km) east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. The ship was initially en route for Rio de Janeiro carrying cargo for the Bethlehem Steel Company. As a result of the stranded ship, the SS President Roosevelt was forced to divert its course in order to render aid. The United States Coast Guard cutters USCGC Sebago (WHEC-42) and USCGC Carrabasset (WAT-55) were sent from the Virginia Capes in order to provide assistance. In addition, a coast guard plane was dispatched from Elizabeth City, North Carolina.[7] The ships remained on standby to monitor the Laponia for three hours before conditions were considered safe to tow the stricken ship back to shore.[9] Two fishing vessels capsized off Barnegat, New Jersey and Edgemere, New York, with both incidents resulting in a fatality.[7] A cabin cruiser was sent to rescue occupants of the capsized boat off Edgemere, though it was also disrupted by rough seas. The ship was later able to rescue the other surviving crew members. Numerous other small craft off Long Island signaled distress calls to the US Coast Guard due to strong waves offshore.[8] Eventually passing east of New England, the storm's large size resulted in heavy rainfall near Nantucket Island, Massachusetts.[2] A weather station on the island reported maximum sustained winds of 45\u00a0mph (70\u00a0km/h). In Eastport, Maine, a weather station recorded a minimum barometric pressure of 993\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.33\u00a0inHg) and wind speeds of 33\u00a0mph (53\u00a0km/h).[3] In Maine, power lines were downed, damaging communications. In Bar Harbor, strong winds caused five fires, which were later extinguished. The schooner George Dresser ran aground on the port's coast. The hurricane also produced slight snowfalls in northern areas of the state.[10][11]"

        "content": "Most of the hurricane's damage occurred in Nova Scotia, where the storm made landfall early on September\u00a017.[1][3] As was the case off the United States East Coast, rough seas generated by the hurricane caused various ship incidents. Tides were 4\u00a0ft (1.3\u00a0m) above average. The abnormally high sea level inundated areas of Lockeport, isolating it from the rest of Nova Scotia and creating a temporary island in the process. One home in the city was flooded by the waves. Off Shelburne, a breakwater was destroyed by rough seas. In Halifax, two yachts were damaged. Another boat in East Ferry was destroyed. The strong waves grounded a schooner in Bridgewater, damaging a wharf. In Jordan Bay, two boat houses and a barn were toppled, while a wharf was washed away.[4] Further north near Anticosti Island, the British steamer Incemore became stranded.[10] Though not directly a result of the storm surge, ten boats in Lake Milo near Yarmouth were severely damaged. Strong winds were also felt throughout Nova Scotia. Winds peaked at 70\u00a0mph (115\u00a0km/h) in Lockeport, the strongest winds observed in the Canadian province. In Yarmouth, the storm's gusts were clocked at 60\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h) in Yarmouth. Trees were uprooted as a result of the strong winds. One tree fell into a home in Melville Cove, damaging the home's roof. Cabins were damaged in Summerville, and the garage of a lodge in Digby was blown out. A barn and associated equipment were destroyed in Pembroke. The strong winds also blew down numerous communication lines, disrupting telecommunication services across Nova Scotia. Downed wires in Halifax caused a fire which scorched five buildings.[4] Traffic in the city was also disrupted by the winds.[12] In addition to infrastructure, crops were also heavily damaged. In Digby County, grain and corn plantations were damaged. Grain crops in Cumberland County also saw heavy losses. In Annapolis Valley, an important agricultural region in western Nova Scotia, 600,000\u00a0barrels of apples were lost, resulting in CA$1.5\u00a0million in damages.[4] The lost apple production accounted for roughly half of the entire apple yield for the agricultural region.[10] Despite the hurricane's rapid movement through the Canadian Maritimes, the storm still produced heavy rainfall. In Halifax, 3\u00a0in (75\u00a0mm) of rain was reported over the duration of the hurricane. However, 3.5\u00a0in (90\u00a0mm) of rain fell in Yarmouth in a 24-hour period.[4]"

The rough seas impacted ships offshore the province, disrupting the lobster industry. Two groups of lobster fishermen went missing in the Northumberland Strait; they were later found. Thousands of lobster traps and several wharves were either damaged or destroyed in the strait.[4] Hundreds of boats were set adrift or sunk in the strait as well.[3] Several boats in Rothesay and Westfield were also lost. A man in Dixon Point lost CA$1,000\u00a0of live lobsters due to the storm. A wharf in Shediac was washed away. Fifty boats were sunk off Cap-Pel\u00e9, while in Greville, four scows were destroyed. The rising seawater inundated a bridge crossing the Millstream River under 3\u00a0ft (0.9\u00a0m) of water. A bridge crossing the Little River and another bridge in Cocagne were also damaged. Dykes in the Baie Verte area were damaged, resulting in thousands of dollars in damages.[4] Further inland, winds caused infrastructural and agricultural damage. Winds peaked at 85\u00a0mph (135\u00a0km/h) at Lakeburn Airport.[4] The strong winds disrupted power and telecommunication services in Moncton. Streets were blocked by trees blown down by strong winds. Offshore, three yachts were destroyed.[10] A tree fell onto the Gagetown United Church as a result of the winds, causing considerable damage. Grain and apple crops were also destroyed in Gagetown.[4] In Saint John, chimneys were toppled.[4] Flying debris injured several people, and power outages also greatly affected the city.[11][12] High waves in conjunction with strong gusts scattered boats in the nearby Saint John River.[11] Tents in the Sussex Military Camp were destroyed. The hurricane's effects resulted in a car accident which injured eight people. Though no fatalities were confirmed in New Brunswick, a person went missing in Bathurst, who was later presumed dead.[4]"

        "content": " The 2020\u201321 Australian region cyclone season was a below average but very deadly season when most tropical cyclones formed in the Southern Indian Ocean and Pacific Oceans between 90\u00b0E and 160\u00b0E. It produced 8 tropical cyclones with 3 strengthening into severe tropical cyclones. However, it featured the region's third-deadliest cyclone on record\u2014Cyclone Seroja, which brought severe floods and landslides to southern Indonesia and East Timor. The season officially began on 1\u00a0November 2020 and started with the formation of Tropical Low 01U on 24 November within the basin, which would later become Tropical Storm Bongoyo in the South-West Indian Ocean, and ended with the dissipation of a tropical low on 24 April, 6 days before the season ended on 30 April. However, a tropical cyclone could form at any time between 1\u00a0July 2020 and 30\u00a0June 2021 and would count towards the season total. During the season, tropical cyclones were officially monitored by one of the three tropical cyclone warning centres (TCWCs) for the region which are operated by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, National Weather Service of Papua New Guinea and the Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics. The United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) and other national meteorological services including M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France also monitored the basin during the season."

        "content": "In October 2020, Australia's Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) issued its tropical cyclone outlook for the 2020\u201321 season, and in the same month, the agency contributed towards the Southwest Pacific Tropical Cyclone Outlook, along with New Zealand's MetService, NIWA and the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS). Each of the outlooks accounted for analogue seasons and the effects of various climate drivers, which included the state of the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Below average sea surface temperatures in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean and atmospheric conditions indicated a La Ni\u00f1a pattern, and it was declared that a La Ni\u00f1a had emerged on 29\u00a0September 2020. The BOM predicted that the La Ni\u00f1a pattern will persist into early 2021, and waters north of Australia and the Southwestern Pacific Ocean will be warmer than average in the coming three months.[1][2] The bureau also advised that cyclone kits include a supply of face masks and hand sanitisers, owing to the concurrent COVID-19 pandemic.[3] The BOM expected an average to slightly above average number of tropical cyclones for the season. The agency predicted a 66% chance of above average activity for the region as a whole, compared with the average of 11 tropical cyclones. They also predicted that the Western and Northwestern sub-regions both had a 63% chance of experiencing more tropical cyclones than usual, the Northern region had a 57% chance of above average activity, and the Eastern region had a 67% chance of more tropical cyclones than the average.[1] The Northwestern sub-region had a probability of two tropical cyclones crossing the Western Australian coast, with a significant risk of at least one of these to be a severe tropical cyclone.[4] The Southwest Pacific Tropical Cyclone Outlook covered a portion of the Australian region that comprised waters surrounding Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, the Coral Sea, and the northern Tasman Sea including Norfolk Island. The outlook called for a reduced level of tropical cyclone activity in the early season, from November to January, but an increased level of activity in the late season, from February to April. Near normal activity during the season was expected for Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, while an elevated level of activity was expected in the Coral Sea and the northern Tasman Sea, especially during the late season.[5]"

        "content": "During mid to late November 2020, a moderate strength pulse of the Madden\u2013Julian Oscillation (MJO) tracked eastwards across the equatorial Indian Ocean towards the Maritime Continent and Australian longitudes.[6][7] The presence of the MJO brought an increase in tropical moisture to the atmospheric environment, as well as aiding the formation of Tropical Cyclone Alicia in the South-West Indian Ocean region in mid November.[6][7] On 24 November, the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) reported that a tropical low had developed within a trough in the far northwestern corner of the Australian region, located approximately 860\u00a0km (530\u00a0mi) northwest of the Cocos Islands.[8][9] The system was assigned the identifier code 01U by the BOM.[10] The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) assessed environmental conditions as being only marginally conducive for tropical cyclogenesis, with good poleward outflow and sea surface temperatures near 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F) being offset by the effects of moderate vertical wind shear.[11] Consequently, the tropical low was expected to have only a low chance of developing into a tropical cyclone prior to moving westwards out of the Australian region later in the week.[10][11] Deep convection persisted over the system as the tropical low tracked gradually southwards over the following days, and by early 27\u00a0November, a curved convective rainband had developed on the eastern side.[12] Despite this, the system remained mostly disorganised in the marginal environment, with an elongated low-level circulation centre.[13] On 29 November, the tropical low began to be steered slowly towards the west-northwest on the northern side of the subtropical high pressure belt.[14][15] The system encountered somewhat weaker wind shear along its new track, allowing deep convection to develop closer to the low-level circulation centre.[16] Before any significant intensification could occur, however, the tropical low exited the Australian region on 30\u00a0November, passing into the area of responsibility of M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France's tropical cyclone warning centre in R\u00e9union.[17] The system later intensified into Severe Tropical Storm Bongoyo in the South-West Indian Ocean cyclone region on 7\u00a0December.[18] At its peak intensity in the Australian region, the BOM estimated the system's minimum atmospheric pressure as 1005\u00a0hPa (29.68\u00a0inHg) on 25\u00a0November.[19] Satellite scatterometer data revealed maximum sustained winds of approximately 45\u00a0km/h (30\u00a0mph) at 02:30\u00a0UTC on 30\u00a0November, a few hours prior to the system exiting the Australian region.[20] Tropical Low 01U made its closest approach to the Cocos Islands on 27\u201328\u00a0November, passing a little more than 500\u00a0km (310\u00a0mi) to the west.[21][22] Increased winds, as well as occasional showers and thunderstorms, occurred across the islands while the system was located nearby.[23] Maximum 10-minute sustained winds of 39\u00a0km/h (24\u00a0mph) with gusts to 46\u00a0km/h (29\u00a0mph) were observed at the airport on West Island at 04:30\u00a0UTC on 27\u00a0November.[24] A total of 23.6\u00a0mm (0.93\u00a0in) of rainfall was also recorded on 24\u201328\u00a0November.[25]"

        "content": "On 6\u00a0December, the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) reported that a tropical low had developed within a monsoon trough near the western end of Java, approximately 200\u00a0km (120\u00a0mi) north-northeast of Christmas Island.[26][27] The system was assigned the official identifier code 02U upon formation.[26] Initially located in an unfavourable environment for intensification, the tropical low began to encounter somewhat improved conditions as it tracked towards the southeast.[28][29] On 7\u00a0December, warm sea surface temperatures and strong diffluence in the upper troposphere fuelled the development of deep convection around the system's low-level circulation centre. Referencing the tropical low's quickly improving structure and the presence of a weak eye feature in microwave satellite imagery, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the system at 05:30\u00a0UTC.[28] After tracking in a clockwise path around the northeastern side of Christmas Island, Tropical Low 02U became quasi-stationary on 8\u00a0December.[30][31] Deep convection continued to develop near the centre during the overnight period, and as the low began to track eastwards, the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical storm on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale at 18:00\u00a0UTC on 8\u00a0December.[32] Tropical Low 02U soon assumed a southeastward course, steered by the influence of a subtropical ridge situated to the east. Environmental conditions remained only marginally favourable for development, however, and the system's deep convection became displaced to the southwest of the centre due to northeasterly vertical wind shear, leaving the low-level circulation centre fully exposed.[33] During this period, the JTWC reported that the tropical low's one-minute sustained winds had decreased to approximately 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph), from the earlier peak of 85\u00a0km/h (55\u00a0mph).[32][33] By 12:00 UTC on 10 December, the system had begun to accelerate towards the southeast, moving into an environment more favourable for intensification.[34][35] The interaction with an upper-level trough enhanced the tropical low's poleward outflow channel, allowing deep convection to rebuild over the centre of the system.[35][36] This enabled the system to strengthen as it rapidly approached the coast of Western Australia at a speed of approximately 40\u00a0km/h (25\u00a0mph), although vertical wind shear once again began to increase.[37][38] Tropical Low 02U made landfall between Port Hedland and Whim Creek on the Pilbara coastline just after 03:00\u00a0UTC on 11\u00a0December.[39] About three hours prior to landfall, the JTWC reported that maximum one-minute sustained winds had increased to 75\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph).[37] Sustained gale-force winds were observed at Bedout Island and Port Hedland around the time of landfall, peaking at 70\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph) at both locations.[40][41] Ten-minute sustained winds also reached 63\u00a0km/h (39\u00a0mph) on Legendre Island at 00:00\u00a0UTC.[42] Despite these wind readings, the BOM did not classify the low as a Category\u00a01 tropical cyclone because they determined that gale-force winds did not extend more than halfway around the centre. They attributed the strong winds on the eastern side of the system to a combination of enhanced northwesterly monsoonal flow and the system's fast translational velocity, rather than the low having intensified into a tropical cyclone.[43] The tropical low continued rapidly inland across Western Australia over the next day, accelerating to about 50\u00a0km/h (30\u00a0mph) soon after landfall.[44][45] Despite tracking over land, the BOM indicated that sustained winds to gale force, accompanied by gusts of up to 100\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph), could still occur near the centre of the system, particularly on the eastern side.[46] The weakening tropical low was last mentioned by the BOM at around 08:00\u00a0UTC on 12\u00a0December, while located in the southeastern corner of Western Australia.[44][47]"

        "content": "The presence of the Madden\u2013Julian Oscillation and an equatorial Rossby wave in the Australian region contributed to the formation of another broad low-pressure system in the monsoon trough over the far eastern Indian Ocean during early December.[48][49] Initially lacking organised deep convection, the system proceeded to track in a generally southwards direction towards the Kimberley region of Western Australia. By late on 7\u00a0December, infrared satellite imagery indicated an improvement in the structure of the low, with the system displaying an increase in flaring deep convection, accompanied by rotation evident in the lower troposphere.[50] Owing to the increase in organisation, the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) classified the system as a tropical low by 21:00\u00a0UTC,[51] when it was located approximately 330\u00a0km (210\u00a0mi) northwest of Broome.[52] Environmental conditions around the system were conducive for tropical cyclogenesis, with low vertical wind shear, good upper-level outflow and sea surface temperatures near 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F).[50] Due to the system's proximity to the coast, however, both the BOM and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) forecast only a low chance of development into a tropical cyclone before making landfall.[48][50] As the tropical low tracked southeastwards towards the coast, environmental conditions continued to improve, with sea surface temperatures nearing 31\u00a0\u00b0C (88\u00a0\u00b0F) and the system maintaining a robust poleward outflow channel in the upper troposphere.[53] As the system strengthened in the moderately favourable environment, the BOM estimated the minimum atmospheric pressure at the centre of the low to be 997\u00a0hPa (29.44\u00a0inHg) at 18:00\u00a0UTC on 8\u00a0December.[54] The JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the tropical low at 21:30\u00a0UTC, noting the presence of convective rainbands wrapping into the system, as well as persistent deep convection over the low-level circulation centre. By this time, however, the system was quickly approaching the Australian coast, so the time available for further intensification was very limited.[53] The tropical low made landfall on the Kimberley coast between Bidyadanga and the Anna Plains cattle station just after 00:00\u00a0UTC on 9\u00a0December.[55] The system moved inland over the following days, tracking in a generally south-southeasterly direction. The system was last mentioned as a tropical low by the BOM on 11\u00a0December while located in central Western Australia.[56][57] The tropical low and associated thunderstorms generated strong winds in coastal and inland areas of the Kimberley and Pilbara regions as it tracked through the area, including sustained winds near gale force at several offshore sites. 10-minute sustained winds of at least 50\u00a0km/h (30\u00a0mph) persisted for approximately four hours on Adele Island late on 8 December (UTC), peaking at 56\u00a0km/h (35\u00a0mph) at 21:00\u00a0UTC, with a 76\u00a0km/h (47\u00a0mph) gust observed shortly thereafter.[58] Sustained winds also reached 56\u00a0km/h (35\u00a0mph) at Bedout Island on 8 December, with a peak gust of 67\u00a0km/h (42\u00a0mph),[59] and Rowley Shoals recorded maximum sustained winds of 52\u00a0km/h (32\u00a0mph) and gusts to 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph).[60] Maximum wind gust speeds recorded on the mainland included 67\u00a0km/h (42\u00a0mph) at Port Hedland;[61] 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph) in Warburton;[62] 63\u00a0km/h (39\u00a0mph) at Lombadina;[63] 61\u00a0km/h (38\u00a0mph) at Giles and Telfer,[64][65] 59\u00a0km/h (37\u00a0mph) at Christmas Creek;[66] 56\u00a0km/h (35\u00a0mph) at Broome, Curtin, Derby and Barimunya,[67][68][69][70] 54\u00a0km/h (34\u00a0mph) at Karratha and Marble Bar;[71][72] 52\u00a0km/h (32\u00a0mph) at Roebourne;[73] and 50\u00a0km/h (30\u00a0mph) at Mandora.[74] As the sprawling tropical low tracked inland, flood watches and warnings were issued for large swathes of the deserts of western central Australia, incorporating parts of Western Australia, the Northern Territory and South Australia.[75][76][77][78]"

Despite tracking over land, the tropical low showed signs of organisation, with the generally favourable atmospheric conditions allowing the development of formative convective banding in the system's southern semicircle.[87] After reaching the Dampier Peninsula on 20\u00a0December, the system turned sharply to the east and began tracking further inland.[88][89] By the following day, the tropical low became slow-moving over the southeastern Kimberley region, during which time a minimum atmospheric pressure of 992.5\u00a0hPa (29.31\u00a0inHg) was recorded at Halls Creek.[90][91] During the next couple of days, the system continued moving eastward, before dissipating on 23\u00a0December. Tropical Low\u00a003U generated strong winds in the Kimberley region and on nearby islands for several days while located nearby. Maximum 10-minute sustained winds of 57\u00a0km/h (35\u00a0mph) with a gust to 72\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph) were observed on Browse Island,[92] and Adele Island recorded sustained winds of 54\u00a0km/h (34\u00a0mph) with a gust to 69\u00a0km/h (43\u00a0mph).[93] Troughton Island also experienced a gust of 95\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph) during a thunderstorm on 21\u00a0December.[94]"

At 06:00\u00a0UTC, the tropical low was upgraded to a Category\u00a01 tropical cyclone by the BOM, and was named Imogen, becoming the first tropical cyclone of the 2020\u201321 season.[106][107] At the same time, the JTWC indicated that maximum one-minute sustained winds had increased to 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph), making Imogen equivalent to a tropical storm on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale.[108] In combination with the low-level northwesterly flow, an upper-tropospheric trough situated to the south of the system began to gradually accelerate Imogen towards the southeast. Deep convection continued to concentrate over the centre of the cyclone; however, due to the system's proximity to land, limited time was available for further intensification.[109] Tropical Cyclone Imogen made landfall just to the north of Karumba, Queensland, at 11:00\u00a0UTC on 3\u00a0January.[110][111] At the time of landfall, maximum 10-minute sustained winds were estimated at 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph), with gusts to 100\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph) and a minimum atmospheric pressure of 994\u00a0hPa (29.35\u00a0inHg).[109] The JTWC reported that maximum one-minute sustained winds had reached 85\u00a0km/h (55\u00a0mph) by this time.[112] Despite the centre of the system tracking over land, Imogen maintained its organisation for several hours, assisted by the flat terrain that had been saturated by heavy rainfall generated by the cyclone itself.[111] The BOM reported that maximum 10-minute sustained winds peaked at 85\u00a0km/h (55\u00a0mph), with gusts to 110\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph), at 15:00 UTC on 3 January\u2014about four hours after landfall\u2014as the cyclone was passing to the northeast of Normanton.[113] At this time, the automatic weather station at the town's airport recorded a minimum atmospheric pressure of 989.3\u00a0hPa (0.08859\u00a0inHg).[114] The system weakened to a tropical low, before it was last noted to the north-northwest of Townsville."

By 3 April, the tropical low fully developed within an active trough.[166] The low was located in a generally favorable environment with deep moisture, low vertical wind shear, and defined outflow.[167] The low drifted close to the coast of Timor very slowly with persistent spiraling bands of convection occupying the storm's circulation, producing prolific rainfall in the surrounding regions on 3\u20134 April.[168] At this time, the low-pressure system was located inside the Area of Responsibility (AoR) of TCWC Jakarta.[169] By the early morning of 4 April, the presentation of its structure had improved with spiral bands of deep convection and tight curvature at its center.[10] Although there were fluctuations in central convection, a favorable environment of deep moisture, low vertical wind shear, and good outflow meant further development of the system was expected.[11][13]\nMeanwhile, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued their first warning on the storm as Tropical Cyclone 26S at 15:00 on UTC 4 April.[170] The tropical low slowly gained strength, intensifying to a Category 1 tropical cyclone, and was given the name Seroja by the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre (TCWC) Jakarta at 20:00 UTC on 4 April, about 95\u00a0km (59\u00a0mi) north-northwest of Rote Island.[171][172] During 5 April, Seroja continued to move at 3\u00a0km/h (1.9\u00a0mph) in a west-southwest direction, away from the Indonesian coastline. The storm intensified to a Category 2 tropical cyclone at 19:00 UTC with 10-minute sustained winds of 105\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph) and its central pressure having deepened to 982\u00a0mb (29.00\u00a0inHg).[43] Long term uncertainty in both track and intensity persisted in the forecasting of Seroja's track, due to interaction with Tropical Low 23U, to the far west of the storm.[43] Seroja held this strength for roughly 12 hours before unexpectedly weakening to a Category 1 tropical cyclone yet again on 6 April, due to southeasterly wind shear and dry air partially exposing the low level circulation (LLC) and degrading its thunderstorm activity.[173] Seroja fluctuated in strength for several hours, intensifying slightly on 7 April as it continued in a generally southwesterly direction.[174] Seroja became disorganized on satellite imagery as convection became dislocated to the south on 8 April, while it began to interact with Tropical Cyclone Odette just to the northwest, as a result of the Fujiwhara effect, complicating the forecasts for the tropical cyclone and causing it to weaken again.[175] Seroja resumed intensification by the next day, re-intensifying into a Category 2 tropical cyclone at 13:16 UTC on 9 April, as the storm began to weaken and absorb Odette, and wind shear started to ease off.[176] On 10 April, Odette had lost most of its convection, and the storm began to be drawn into Seroja's circulation, before being absorbed into Seroja later that day. Afterward, Seroja turned southeastward while strengthening, becoming a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone early on 11 April.[177] Seroja continued rapidly accelerating towards the southeast, before making landfall near Gregory, Western Australia, or just north of Geraldton at peak strength, with 1-minute sustained winds of 130\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph), 10-minute sustained winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph), and a minimum central pressure of 971\u00a0hPa (28.7\u00a0inHg), with observations of gusts as high as 150\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph).[178][179] Following landfall, Seroja accelerated to the southeast while gradually weakening, before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone later that day. As a tropical low, Seroja caused widespread rainfall and thunderstorms in the East Nusa Tenggara province of Indonesia.[180][181] Within the province in East Flores Regency, 44 people were thought to have died and 9 people were critically injured from mudslides, burying their homes and bodies while bridges and roads connecting to Flores Island and Adonara Island were destroyed.[182][183] The death toll was later lowered to 41 after search and rescue teams reverified the victims' health, although an additional 27 were cited to be missing.[184] In East Timor, 3 people died in a landslide including a two-year-old child.[185] East Timor Prime Minister Taur Matan Ruak cited the floods as one of the most devastating incidents to effect the country in 40 years.[185] By 9 April, the death toll had risen to 209 with 167 dead in Indonesia and 42 in East Timor.[186][187] Damage from Seroja in East Timor was expected to exceed US$100 million, according to Prime Minister Taur Matan Ruak.[188] In Western Australia, damage from Seroja was estimated to cost up to AUD$200\u00a0million (US$155\u00a0million).

Total damages are estimated to be valued at more than 5\u00a0billion lei (\u20ac1.5\u00a0billion). In mid August, the North-East region of Romania was heavily affected, with 1,473 evacuated from their homes in Ia\u0219i, Suceava and Boto\u0219ani starting from 16 August. In Suceava county, 555\u00a0km of roads were affected, while nearly 600 bridges were flooded, resulting in the flooding of 520 houses, 16 of which were significantly destroyed. Several communications networks, particularly electric cables and optical fibres, were also affected. Before it had ended, on 22 August 2005, the Ministry of Interior was reported as saying that floods and landslides affected over 500 villages in 31 districts: 200 homes completely destroyed, 2,000+ other structures affected, 11,000 households flooded, 9,000 wells flooded with rainfall and groundwater displacement, 34,000+ hectares of farmland and 2,000+ hectares of forests and grasslands destroyed, 9 kilometers of highway, 265 kilometers of county roads and 906 other roads were all severely damaged, and 25 cities lost power.[1] Floods were particularly acute in the central county of Harghita, where flooding hit the town of Odorheiu Secuiesc and surrounding localities in mid-to-late August. The flooding was most intense in the period from 24 to 25 August, when ten people were killed, a further five were declared missing and 1,400 households were flooded. Other counties significantly affected in late August were Mure\u0219, Prahova and Bistri\u021ba-N\u0103s\u0103ud. The city of T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219, an important regional centre, was also affected by the rising of waters on the T\u00e2rnava River, even though there wasn't a significant amount of damage caused to infrastructure.[2][3] In northwestern Romania, the counties of Bihor and Cluj were also affected, although on a smaller scale than Harghita. In Cluj County, over 100 houses were flooded, with the flooding centred on the town of Turda. Railway lines in the county were also closed. The localities of Pope\u015fti, Suplacu de Barc\u0103u and Valea lui Mihai were affected in Bihor County."

The village of Lauterbrunnen in the Bernese Alps was completely cut off. The only exit from the town is by a very narrow gorge just wide enough to take the river, road and railway, and the river expanded to fill the entire gorge. This stranded thousands of tourists in the village, and the only way out was by helicopter or by crossing one of the high Alpine passes. The Tyrol and Vorarlberg states of Austria saw many areas cut off by flooded roads. The lower part of the Rhine overflowed, affecting the Swiss Graub\u00fcnden Canton, as well as parts of Vorarlberg. The river Danube and its tributaries overflowed in many places, flooding parts of Germany, Bavaria in particular.  Several floodings and landslides were reported in Lower Austria and Styria. The floods also meant the temporary closure of many mountain passes, amongst them the Gotthard in Switzerland, and the Arlberg in Austria. On a section of the Arlberg, the road and rail were washed away. Austrian Federal Railways have issued a statement (in German) that the rail line reconstruction will take at least a month. The main phone and data line between Vorarlberg and the rest of Austria was destroyed and had to be replaced by a radio communication.\nWith rain and flood waters subsiding on 27 August, people started to return to their homes, rail and road routes reopened and the cleanup began. The town of Ja\u0161a Tomi\u0107 in Serbia was devastated by floods. Poland, where seven bridges collapsed, and Slovenia were  also affected by flooding in August."

The eighth tropical cyclone and seventh named storm of the 1995 Atlantic hurricane season, Gabrielle developed from a tropical wave in the west-central Gulf of Mexico on August\u00a09. Initially a tropical depression, the system gradually intensified and by the following day, it became a tropical storm. Favorable conditions caused Gabrielle to continue to strengthen, with the storm nearly reaching hurricane status late on August\u00a011. However, it soon made landfall near La Pesca, Tamaulipas, thus halting further intensification. Once inland, Gabrielle rapidly weakened and dissipated by early on August\u00a012. As Gabrielle was impacting the east coast of Mexico, Hurricane Flossie in the Eastern Pacific was brushing the Baja Peninsula. The storm produced torrential rainfall in northeastern Mexico, totaling to 19.44 inches (494\u00a0mm). As a result, numerous reservoirs were filled, forcing dozens in southern Nuevo Leon to evacuate their homes. Additionally, highway infrastructure and streets in the region were affected. Damage in Mexico is unknown, though six fatalities were reported. Rainfall up to 6 inches (150\u00a0mm) brought minor flooding to Texas, mainly damaging unharvested cotton. Three days after dissipation, the remnants of Gabrielle also produced heavy thunderstorms in New Mexico on August\u00a015."

        "content": "A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean off the west coast of Africa during the last week of July. As it tracked across the Atlantic, it remained a well-defined system, but never organized into a tropical cyclone. On August\u00a08, the system entered the Gulf of Mexico, and by the following day, it developed a weak low-level circulation.[2] The circulation became better defined later that day, and was confirmed by Reconnaissance aircraft that afternoon, when it was declared Tropical Depression Eight while east of Tamaulipas.[3] From the outset, the cyclone's motion was altered by Hurricane Flossie off the Pacific coast of Mexico.[4] Initially, deep convection fired up gradually as the depression slowly tracked westward in the Gulf of Mexico.[5] At 1200\u00a0UTC on August\u00a010, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Gabrielle, as the storm curved southward. Gabrielle then strengthened slowly over the warm sea surface temperatures in a low wind shear environment, although land interaction slowed the intensification somewhat.[6] The storm shifted once again onto a west-northwest course on August\u00a011, moving very slowly towards the coast.[2] The storm made landfall at 2000\u00a0UTC on August\u00a011, just south of La Pesca in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas, about 175 miles (282\u00a0km) south of the United States-Mexico border and about 90 miles (140\u00a0km) north of Tampico. Simultaneously, Gabrielle attained its peak intensity with a maximum sustained wind speed of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 988\u00a0mbar (29.2\u00a0inHg). After landfall, the storm rapidly weakened, deteriorating to tropical depression status by early on August\u00a012 over northeast Mexico. Six hours later, the surface circulation of Gabrielle dissipated over the mountains of the Sierra Madre Oriental,[2] although its cloud pattern transited Mexico intact, moving into the Gulf of California before it sheared across northwest Mexico on August\u00a015.[4]"

By 0900\u00a0UTC on the following day, the warning was expanded to include areas south to Tampico, Tamaulipas and extended further to Tuxpan, Veracruz twelve hours later. As the latter was occurring, the tropical storm warning was discontinued for Texas. Early on August\u00a012, all the warnings in Mexico were discontinued, as the storm had already moved inland.[2] 800\u00a0people were evacuated in Soto la Marina and San Fernando in Tamaulipas. People in poor villages in the Rio Grande Valley were given sandbags with Tropical Storm Gabrielle approaching.[7] Overall damage was generally minor. There were no reports of wind damage, although tropical storm-force winds affected the northern coast of Tamaulipas. A newspaper in Mexico reported up to 24 inches (610\u00a0mm) of precipitation across much of Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon;[2] this figure is in dispute, however, as the rainfall database maintained by Mexico's National Weather Service shows the maximum amount to lie under 20 inches (510\u00a0mm).[4] The heavy rainfall from the storm filled nearly half the reservoirs in Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas, which were almost empty due to drought conditions in the region. As a result, dozens in southern Nuevo Leon were forced to evacuation their homes.[8] Rains from Gabrielle flooded streets and destroyed bridges and highways in northern Mexico.[1] No storm surge recordings were taken in Mexico, although it is estimated by the National Hurricane Center that a surge of a few feet took place to the north of the track. Six fatalities were reported in Mexico as a result of Gabrielle.[1] In Texas, rainfall from the storm peaked at 6.26 inches (159\u00a0mm) in Weslaco,[9] while many other areas in southern Texas reported only 1 to 3 inches (25 to 76\u00a0mm) of precipitation.[4] Gabrielle's rain came after a drought, and some of it soaked in. The rains also damaged unharvested cotton. Otherwise, minor flooding occurred.[10] Brownsville reported up to 4 inches (100\u00a0mm) of rain in association with Gabrielle.[11] In extreme southern Texas, minor coastal flooding occurred at some of the beaches in the region.[2] The remains of Gabrielle produced heavy thunderstorms in New Mexico on August\u00a015.[11]"

Attribution analysis indicated a significant increase in the El Ni\u00f1o-induced precipitation anomalies over Texas and Oklahoma when increases in the anthropogenic greenhouse gases were taken into account. Studies by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography found for Texas that precipitation totals have increased 10 percent in the last century, but mostly in eastern Texas, with more frequent, severe and longer drought conditions in west Texas.[34] The report Regional Climate Trends and Scenarios for the U.S. National Climate Assessment (NCA) from 2013 by NOAA, projects that parts of Texas, and parts of the Great Plains region can expect up to 30% (High emissions scenario based on CMIP3 and NARCCAP models) increase in extreme precipitation days by midcentury. This definition is based on days receiving more than one inch of rainfall.[35] A study from April\u00a02015 concluded that about 18% of the moderate daily precipitation extremes over land are attributable to observed temperature increase since the Industrial Revolution and that this primarily results from human influence.[36][37]"

        "content": "Tropical Storm Lingling, known in the Philippines as Tropical Depression Agaton,[nb 1] was a weak but deadly tropical cyclone that affected the Philippines in January 2014. The first named storm of the annual typhoon season, this early-season cyclone remained very disorganized throughout its lifespan.[1] Lingling was the first major natural disaster in the Philippines after Typhoon Haiyan just two months earlier, as it caused widespread landslide incidents and floods in Mindanao, resulting in 70 deaths and damage amounting to over 566 million pesos on the island.[2] The predecessor of Lingling formed as a tropical depression southeast of Mindanao on January 10, yet it weakened into a low-pressure area on January 12.[3][4] After crossing the island on January 13, the system redeveloped into a tropical depression off the northeast coast of Mindanao on January 15.[1] After drifting generally westward and consolidating slowly, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Lingling on January 18.[5] Without further improvements, Lingling weakened into a tropical depression on January 20 because of its sheared structure and diminishing convection.[6]"

        "content": "On January 10, the JMA reported that a tropical depression had developed, about 1,800\u00a0km (1,120\u00a0mi) to the southeast of Manila, Philippines.[7][8] The JMA expected the system to develop into a tropical storm within 24 hours, despite it being located in an area of marginal conditions for further development.[7][9] Under moderate vertical wind shear, the system became highly sheared on the next day, although strong northeasterly trade wind surges and a good westward outflow enhanced by the strong easterly upper-level winds were helping to sustain the associated convection.[10] On January 12, the JMA no longer expected a tropical storm and even downgraded the tropical depression to a low-pressure area late on the same day, when convection became more disorganized.[4][11] The low-pressure area crossed Mindanao, Philippines from the south on January 13 and emerged into the area off the northeast coast of Mindanao on the next day.[12][13] Although the JMA operationally upgraded the system back to a tropical depression on January 14, the RSMC best track data indicated that the tropical depression had not persisted until 00:00 UTC on January 15, with the poor structure under high vertical wind shear and strong northeasterly surges.[14] After the system slowly drifted west-northwestward and then southwestward, the JMA began to issue warnings on the tropical depression at noon on January 16, albeit not expecting it to intensify into a tropical storm.[15] Soon, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the system, for the consolidating and slightly better defined low-level circulation center, favorable sea surface temperature, moderate vertical wind shear, as well as highly diffluent outflow.[16] Early on January 17, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) upgraded the system from a low-pressure area to a tropical depression and assigned the local name Agaton, when the system was partially exposed with flaring deep convection along the northwestern quadrant.[17] The JMA upgraded the tropical depression to a tropical storm about 210\u00a0km (130\u00a0mi) east of Surigao City and named it Lingling at 00:00 UTC on January 18, shortly before the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical depression.[5] Lingling's central convection and the banding associated with a partially exposed low-level circulation center have become improved, when the storm started to drift southward away from a strong northeasterly surge in a weak steering environment.[18] Six hours later, the JTWC upgraded Lingling to a tropical storm, based on the scatterometer data and Dvorak estimates.[19] However, half a day later, the JTWC downgraded Lingling to a tropical depression as its deep central convection was diminishing under the influence of moderate to strong vertical wind shear.[20] Lingling began to accelerate south-southeastward under the influence of the strong northeasterly surge flow on January 19, and was struggling to consolidate due to the marginally favorable upper-level conditions.[21] Late on the same day, the JTWC issued the final warning on Lingling, as the infrared satellite imageries depicted an exposed, weakening low-level circulation center with isolated,\nflaring convection sheared to the northwest. A ship observation at 15:00 UTC, 72 nautical miles (133\u00a0km; 83\u00a0mi) north-northeast of the system, reported winds at only 10 knots (20\u00a0km/h; 10\u00a0mph) with atmospheric pressure of 1,013\u00a0hPa (29.9\u00a0inHg).[22] During January 20, the JMA reported that the system weakened into a tropical depression, before the system was last noted later that day as it dissipated to the southeast of the Philippines.[23]"

In Surigao City, the roads were littered with uprooted trees and metal roofing blown off houses.[26] Although no deaths were reported in Eastern Samar, heavy rain and strong winds from Tropical Storm Lingling still affected the region which had been severely devastated by Typhoon Haiyan two months earlier. Hundreds of survivors of Haiyan were forced to flee after many emergency shelters were damaged by Lingling, and rice fields in several municipalities were also flooded by the storm.[27]"

The rainfall that ensued that Monday was measured to add up to between 50 and 100 millilitres of rain, the bulk of it being in the period between 5:00 AM and 7:00 AM. The neighbouring department of Canelones also received similar amounts. 17,000 houses suffered power outages in the capital, and more than 11,000 in the neighbouring departments. Massive amounts of rain were also recorded elsewhere in the country, both towards the west and east of the capital, as well as up north. City authorities labelled the flood as \"unprecedented\" in its history. The mayor of one of the municipalities called the situation \"critical\", and added that \"especially for poorer neighbourhoods it has hit really hard\".[1] Around 200 calls were made to the local firefighting departments, 138 of which were for evacuation assistance purposes.

Rising waters from the River Barrow led to over 100 people being evacuated from a four-storey apartment block on Centaur Street.[26] Kennedy Street was closed off. The Civil Defence was monitoring two other apartment blocks ready to evacuate them if waters rose further. Elsewhere in the county, the road between Tullow and Rathtoe was blocked after a two-car collision in which six people were injured. The wounded were brought to St. Luke's General Hospital in Kilkenny. Garda\u00ed reported that there was still flooding in Daingean and Edenderry in County Offaly where the canal had burst its banks. There were reports of flooding around Clonygowan. In County Laois, Mountmellick's main street was flooded, whilst the Mountmellick to Ballyfinn (R423) and Mountmellick to Derryclooney roads were both impassable due to flooding. Diversions were in place on the N77 Kilkenny to Durrow road because of flooding at Ballyragget.

Parts of Carlow town were under almost two metres of flood water after the River Barrow burst its banks following heavy rainfall. Approximately 100 people spent the night in a hotel when they had to evacuate their apartment block on Centaur Street. Others were ferried to and from work in the morning by the Civil Defence. Minister for the Environment John Gormley, visited Carlow to view the crisis, and said that the contract for flood defences would proceed \"as quickly as possible\". Staff at Winnie Dalgarno's flooded pet store in Graiguecullen had to take animals home when electricity was switched off. Winnie said: \"We have lost a few reptiles, our birds have been badly affected, we had 20 hamsters floating, I have had to put rabbits in bird cages.\"[28] In Ennis, the body of 31-year-old cook and father-of-one, Przemyslaw Jablonski[28] was recovered from the River Fergus. He was pronounced dead at the scene.[29] Meath County Council advised people in Athboy to boil all water they used from the mains supply. Supply was shut down as a precautionary measure after a local river burst its banks, threatening to contaminate the drinking water supply. Eircom reported nearly 4,300 faults over the previous weekend, with 6,500 reported faults that day. The worst affected areas included Clontarf, Blanchardstown, Phibsboro, Portmarnock, Leixlip and Clane. Flooding at Portadown caused delays of up to 90 minutes on the Dublin to Belfast train service."

Speaking on RT\u00c9 Radio's News at One, Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government John Gormley said despite the economic downturn, money would be made available to provide flood defences for Carlow whose flood waters were subsiding (although a number of streets remained closed with dozens of residents who were forced to leave their apartments still being housed in temporary accommodation). The Office of Public Works said that contracts for flood defence systems would soon be finalised for towns such as Mallow, Ennis and Clonmel. Speaking on Morning Ireland, Tom Sherlock, principal officer of engineering services at the OPW, expressed confidence that new flood defence schemes already in place in some towns would hold for many years.[30]"

The year began with another wave in the COVID-19 pandemic, with Omicron spreading rapidly and becoming the dominant variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus worldwide. Tracking a decrease in cases and deaths, 2022 saw the removal of most COVID-19 restrictions and the reopening of international borders in the vast majority of countries, while the global rollout of COVID-19 vaccines continued. The global economic recovery from the pandemic continued, though many countries experienced an ongoing inflation surge; in response, many central banks raised their interest rates to landmark levels.[1] The world population reached eight billion people in 2022. The year also witnessed numerous natural disasters, including two devastating Atlantic hurricanes (Fiona and Ian), and the most powerful volcano eruption of the century so far. The later part of the year also saw the first public release of ChatGPT by OpenAI starting an arms race in artificial intelligence which increased in intensity into 2023, as well as the collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX. 2022 was also dominated by wars and armed conflicts. While escalations into the internal conflict in Myanmar and the Tigray War dominated the heightening of tensions within their regions and each caused over 10,000 deaths, 2022 was most notable for the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the largest armed conflict in Europe since World War II. The invasion caused the displacement of 15.7\u00a0million Ukrainians (8\u00a0million internally displaced persons and 7.7\u00a0million refugees), and led to international condemnations and sanctions and nuclear threats, the withdrawal of hundreds of companies from Russia, and the exclusion of Russia from major sporting events."

It is one of the strongest European windstorms on record and caused many fatalities in the UK and Europe. This storm has received different names, as there was no official list of such events in Europe at the time.[6] Starting on Burns Day, the birthday of the Scottish poet Robert Burns, it caused widespread damage and hurricane-force winds over a wide area."

By 24 January, it had a minimum central pressure of 992 millibars (29.3\u00a0inHg) and began to undergo explosive cyclogenesis, which was sometimes referred to as a weather bomb.[7] It made landfall on the morning of January 25 over Ireland. It then tracked over to Ayrshire in Scotland. The lowest pressure of 949\u00a0mbar (28.0\u00a0inHg) was estimated near Edinburgh around 16:00. After hitting the United Kingdom, the storm tracked rapidly east towards Denmark causing major damage and a further 30 deaths in the Netherlands and Belgium.[1]"

Strong gusts of up to 104\u00a0mph (167\u00a0km/h) were reported, which caused the most extensive damage. The Great Storm of 1987 contained considerably higher wind speeds across every parameter but affected a smaller area of the UK; both highest recorded sustained wind speeds of 86\u00a0mph and highest gust of 135\u00a0mph, for example. Sustained periods of high gust speeds were also far higher in 1987. However, during the 1987 storm, many anemometers stopped recording because of power outages, breakages by the excess wind speeds and measurement maxima being exceeded. By 1990, the meteorological community had newer devices that remained independent of external power and could measure higher wind speeds. The general opinion is that wind speeds measured during the Burns' Day Storm provide an accurate picture, but there is a tendency to downplay windspeeds from the 1987 storm because of the patchy data available. In the 1987 storm, it was the counties of Sussex, Surrey, Kent and Essex (i.e. the SE of England) which were worst hit and suffered the most damage. A Met Office forecaster the \nprevious day, Michael Fish, notoriously said he had assured a lady enquirer that \"there was not going to be a 'hurricane'\"."

It conducted research that showed that most of the general public could not understand the severity of the warnings. The storm has led to more awareness and understanding of storminess among the public by the KNMI, which started a teletext page and the introduction of special warnings for extreme weather events in reaction to these findings.[10]"

The actor Gorden Kaye was also injured during the storm when a plank of an advertising board was blown through his car's windscreen.[12] The storm caused extensive damage, with approximately 3\u00a0million trees downed, power disrupted to over 500,000 homes and severe flooding in England and West Germany. The storm cost insurers in the UK \u00a33.37 billion, the UK's most expensive weather event to insurers.[13]"

The storm complex produced 26 to 30-ft (nine to ten\u00a0m) waves along the eastern and northern coasts of Nova Scotia. The storm surge, which occurred at high tide, reached two\u00a0ft (0.6\u00a0m), eroding a section of the Canso Causeway. The causeway was closed when a trailer overturned from the high winds.[4] Around 1.6 inches (41\u00a0mm) of precipitation fell, causing flooding and downed trees. Overall, about 70,000\u00a0people in Nova Scotia were left without power.[3] In New Brunswick, the storm complex produced high winds with gusts of up to 84\u00a0mph (135\u00a0km/h). The winds downed several trees and power lines which resulted in power outages,[6] with Fredericton being the hardest hit.[4] About 16,000 were without power on the day after the storm struck.[6] The storm produced sustained winds of 76\u00a0mph (122\u00a0km/h) and gusts to 96\u00a0mph (154\u00a0km/h) at the Confederation Bridge. There, the wind gust was the highest ever recorded, resulting in the bridge being closed[4] for five hours,[6] the first time the bridge was closed in its history. Waves of up to 30\u00a0ft (nine\u00a0m) in height with a storm surge of over 3.3\u00a0ft (one\u00a0m) hit the northern coastline of Prince Edward Island. Every wharf and many coastal roads from Rustico to East Point were under water from the high waves and storm surge.[4] The winds left much of eastern Prince Edward Island without power.[5] In Newfoundland, the system produced over four\u00a0in (100\u00a0mm) of rain and strong winds. Many areas reported over 55\u00a0mph (89\u00a0km/h), with gusts peaking at 84\u00a0mph (135\u00a0km/h) at Channel-Port aux Basques. Coastal areas of the island reported storm surges of around two\u00a0ft (0.6\u00a0m). The strong winds of the storm destroyed the windows of six vehicles and blew off most of the roof of a truck in Holyrood, with the debris damaging a nearby weather radar.

It was, up until 2022, the worst flood in the history of the city. After being neglected and quietly deteriorating ever since the defeat of the Venetian Republic by Napoleon about a century and a half prior, Venice was suddenly recognized as a city in urgent need of restoration.[2]"

John Pope-Hennessy, a British art historian, detected that the first time the full extent of the city's problems was seen: In response, several national and international organizations began working tirelessly in both Venice and Florence, making remarkable development in conserving countless individual sites. The most notable of these organizations included Save Venice Inc., UNESCO, Venice in Peril Fund, and the World Monuments Fund.[citation needed]\nIn the early sixteenth century Venice's perilous physical situation was realized, when its doges tried to safeguard the lagoon city and its harbor by diverting rivers from the lagoon to prevent river silt from accumulating and blocking the lagoon. Despite these efforts, over the centuries as the mean sea level gradually rose and the foundations of many buildings settled further into the mudflats, the Venetians also gradually raised their islands, as verified by the deepest archaeological layer in St. Mark's Square, which is located approximately 10 feet below the present pavement. Thus, today's continuing flooding problem is worsened by an obsolete, 400-year old lagoon-dredging program and a sinking seabed.[4]\nIn combination with measures such as coastal reinforcement, the raising of quaysides, and paving and improvement of the lagoon environment, engineers at Fiat designed the MOSE Project. These gates are able to protect the city of Venice from extreme events such as floods and morphological degradation.[citation needed]"

        "content": " Tropical Storm Felice was a modest tropical cyclone that lightly affected parts of the Gulf Coast of the United States in mid-September 1970. Spawned by an upper-level trough over the Bahamas, the system crossed the Florida Keys and entered the Gulf of Mexico, where it gradually began to strengthen. Felice was a disorganized storm for its entire duration, plagued by dry air, a lack of deep thunderstorm activity, and an ill-defined center of circulation, but nevertheless managed to peak as a high-end tropical storm with winds just below Category 1 hurricane strength. Tracking northwestward, the storm brushed southern Louisiana on September 15 before making landfall northeast of Galveston, Texas, late that same day. Once ashore, Felice quickly deteriorated as it recurved into the central United States. While over southeastern Oklahoma, however, its remnants still closely resembled a formidable tropical cyclone. In advance of the cyclone, officials prompted residents in vulnerable communities to leave their homes, and temporary storm shelters were established. However, the effects from Felice were generally light. Beneficial rains fell over parts of southern Florida, while sections of coastal Louisiana experienced minimal gale-force winds and above-normal tides. Winds gusting to 55\u00a0mph (89\u00a0km/h) at Galveston\u2014and estimated near 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) elsewhere\u2014caused scattered power outages and minor tree damage, while heavy rainfall totaling over 6\u00a0in (150\u00a0mm) triggered some street flooding. Felice delayed the local rice harvest and damaged some hay that had been cut before the storm. Significant precipitation and gusty winds accompanied the system into northern Texas and Oklahoma. Overall, the storm left no fatalities or widespread property damage anywhere along its path."

        "header": "Meteorological history",
        "content": "Developing as a tropical depression near Nassau in the Bahamas on September 12, Felice had its origins in a persistent upper-level trough over the area. The nascent depression tracked slowly toward the west-southwest without much intensification, ultimately passing just north of Key West, Florida as it entered the Gulf of Mexico.[1][2] Over the open waters of the Gulf, the system accelerated toward the west-northwest along the southern periphery of a large ridge of high pressure to the north.[2][3][4] While reconnaissance aircraft data on the storm suggested that the depression strengthened into a tropical storm midday on September 14,[5] the official Atlantic tropical cyclone database known as HURDAT indicates the disturbance attained tropical storm status at 0000 UTC on September 15.[2] Despite continued gradual intensification, Felice remained disorganized as it approached the northern Gulf Coast at forward speeds of up to 20\u00a0mph (32\u00a0km/h).[1][5] The storm's center came within range of the weather radar site at New Orleans, Louisiana, resulting in close observation of the storm's progress. Felice suffered from restricted outflow and a nebulous circulation, marked by the appearance of two centers.[5][6] Near daybreak on September 15, a more distinct center had apparently formed 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km) to the west-northwest of the storm's initial core, which reportedly dissipated.[7] Operationally, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center believed a surge of southerly inflow transported a significant amount of atmospheric vorticity away from the old center of low pressure, allowing for a new surface-based circulation to form.[8] Indeed, a special off-hour advisory was issued to identify the storm's new location.[9] However, post-season analysis of Felice determined that due to the cyclone's disheveled nature, as well as technical problems at the time of observation, the center relocation could not be conclusively proven; as a result, the official storm path does not reflect any significant jogs.[1] Felice moved nearly parallel to the southern coast of Louisiana as it began to show signs of improved structure.[1][10] It reached its peak intensity as a high-end tropical storm with winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) at 0000 UTC on September 16, while located about 100\u00a0mi south of Lafayette.[2] Dry continental air from the north likely prevented Felice from reaching Category 1 hurricane strength.[10] Even as a strong tropical storm, Felice lacked deep convection typical of mature tropical cyclones.[4] Shortly after peaking, Felice moved ashore at High Island, Texas\u2014about 30\u00a0mi (48\u00a0km) to the northeast of Galveston\u2014during the evening hours of September 15 local time.[11] The storm rapidly deteriorated once over land and slowed in forward speed.[10] Curving toward the northwest, Felice passed near Houston and weakened into a tropical depression.[2][11] The diminishing system turned northward through north-central Texas late on September 16 and entered southeastern Oklahoma by September 17.[1] Although Felice officially dissipated as a tropical cyclone at 1200 UTC on September 17,[2] its remnants exhibited a structure very similar to that of a healthy tropical cyclone, as depicted by radar imagery from the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman. Curved rainbands surrounded a distinct eye feature, which passed about 90\u00a0mi (140\u00a0km) southeast of Norman. Two aircraft flew into the area to collect data on the unique storm; notably, they discovered that the system retained a deep warm core relative to its environment. Throughout the day on September 17, the remnants of Felice continued to weaken.[12] The residual surface low recurved toward the east-northeast over Oklahoma and Arkansas before fully dissipating after September 19.[13]"

        "content": "As Felice neared the coast, gale warnings were hoisted from Morgan City, Louisiana, to Galveston, while a hurricane watch extended from Morgan City to Port O'Connor, Texas.[14] Small craft advisories were also posted, cautioning light vessels to remain in port.[15] All coastal advisories were discontinued by the early hours of September 16.[16] Residents in the path of the storm generally evacuated in a timely manner.[11] Over 3,000 fled the storm in Cameron Parish, Louisiana;[17] around half of the residents in the low-lying southern part of the parish had already left before the mandatory evacuation was ordered.[18] Farther west, one of two evacuation routes out of Sabine Pass, Texas, had been rendered unusable a few days before the storm when a bridge was damaged in a maritime accident. As the remaining highway was considered susceptible to coastal flooding, officials quickly worked to evacuate 1,300 people in Sabine Pass before the storm's approach. The American Red Cross converted nine public schools into temporary storm shelters in and around Beaumont.[11] Shelters were also set up in Houston and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, though they went mostly unused.[19] The post offices in Sabine Pass, Gilchrist, and Port Bolivar transferred money orders, first-class parcels and postage stamps to the Beaumont office as a safety precaution.[20] While crossing the Florida Keys on September 13, the depression dropped modest but beneficial rainfall of around 1 to 3 in (25 to 75\u00a0mm) over the southern Florida Peninsula.[13][21] The highest tides associated with Felice ran 3.9\u00a0ft (1.2\u00a0m) above normal at Cameron, Louisiana.[10] Rainfall in Louisiana was light, peaking near 2.5 in (65\u00a0mm) in areas closest to the storm's path. Coastal locations experienced gusty winds, occasionally blowing gale-force;[17] an anemometer at Grand Chenier recorded northeasterly gusts up to 42\u00a0mph (68\u00a0km/h) on the evening of September 15.[22] Though the winds may have affected the quality of sugar cane crops in extreme southern areas of the state, no flooding or property damage was reported.[17] The storm's landfall was accompanied by significant rainfall, gusty winds, and heightened tides. At Crystal Beach, near where Felice crossed the coast, a distinct lull in the wind and rain coincided with the passage of the storm's poorly defined eye.[23] Weather observers in Gilchrist and Humble estimated gusts at 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) from the east and southwest, respectively.[20] Galveston endured sustained winds of 43\u00a0mph (69\u00a0km/h) and gusts as high as 55\u00a0mph (89\u00a0km/h).[20] The storm uprooted some newly planted palm trees, one of which landed on a parked car. Isolated power outages affected parts of the area, including the east side of Galveston after a transformer was hit by lightning.[23] Elsewhere, Felice brought down numerous tree limbs and power lines.[20] In Washington County to the north, the storm damaged vegetation,[24] and winds gusted to 46\u00a0mph (74\u00a0km/h) in Houston.[11] Heavy rains, accumulating to 6.73\u00a0in (171\u00a0mm), triggered minor urban flooding in downtown Galveston.[13][21] Moderate to heavy rainfall affected a broad area along the storm's path, with multiple reports of 5\u00a0in (130\u00a0mm) or more. The precipitation resulted in a few instances of inconsequential flooding, but more commonly proved beneficial as it helped to relieve dry conditions throughout eastern Texas.[11][20] Rice and hay crops sustained minor damage, with the harvest of the former delayed by about a week. Along the coast, storm tides peaked at 3.0\u00a0ft (0.9\u00a0m) above normal.[20] As the weakening storm progressed inland, it continued to drop heavy rainfall. Over 6\u00a0in (150\u00a0mm) of rain fell over Denton County in northern Texas.[20] In southeastern Oklahoma, the remnants of Felice produced rainfall rates up to 2 in (50\u00a0mm) per hour, contributing to totals over 4\u00a0in (100\u00a0mm). Relatively strong winds, peaking around 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h), occurred near the remnant center of circulation.[12] The system continued to generate showers and thunderstorms over the central Mississippi River Valley,[25] producing a swath of 3 inch or greater rainfall totals across northern Arkansas.[13]"

The season officially started on June\u00a01 and ended on November\u00a030, though the first storm, Hurricane Alex which formed in the Northeastern Atlantic, developed on January\u00a012, being the first hurricane to develop in January since 1938. The final storm, Otto, crossed into the Eastern Pacific on November\u00a025, a few days before the official end. Following Alex, Tropical Storm Bonnie brought flooding to South Carolina and portions of North Carolina. Tropical Storm Colin in early June brought minor flooding and wind damage to parts of the Southeastern United States, especially Florida. Hurricane Earl left 94\u00a0fatalities in the Dominican Republic and Mexico, 81\u00a0of which occurred in the latter. In early September, Hurricane Hermine, the first hurricane to make landfall in Florida since Hurricane Wilma in 2005, brought extensive coastal flooding damage especially to the Forgotten and Nature coasts of Florida. Hermine was responsible for five fatalities and about $550\u00a0million (2016\u00a0USD) in damage.[b] The strongest, costliest, and deadliest storm of the season was Hurricane Matthew, the southernmost Category 5 Atlantic hurricane on record and the first to reach that intensity since Felix in 2007, ending the longest streak of seasons without a hurricane of such intensity in the Satellite Era. With at least 603 deaths attributed to it, Matthew was the deadliest Atlantic hurricane since Stan of 2005. Furthermore, damage from Matthew is estimated to be at least $16.5\u00a0billion, making it the ninth costliest Atlantic hurricane on record at the time. Hurricane Nicole became the first major hurricane to directly impact Bermuda since Hurricane Fabian in 2003, leaving widespread but relatively moderate damage on the island. The final tropical cyclone of the season \u2013 Hurricane Otto \u2013 brought severe flooding to Central America in November, particularly in Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Otto left 23\u00a0deaths and about $190\u00a0million in damage. On November\u00a025, the storm emerged into the Eastern Pacific basin, the first such occurrence since Hurricane Cesar\u2013Douglas in 1996. Most of the season's tropical cyclones impacted land, and nine of those storms caused loss of life. Collectively, the storms left at least 736\u00a0fatalities and $17.49\u00a0billion in damage, making the season the costliest since 2012. Most forecasting groups predicted above average activity in anticipation of a dissipating El Ni\u00f1o event and the development of a La Ni\u00f1a, as well as warmer than normal sea surface temperatures. Overall, the forecasts were fairly accurate."

        "content": "Ahead of and during the season, several meteorological services and scientific agencies forecast how many named storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes will form during a season, and/or how many tropical cyclones will affect a particular country. These agencies include the Tropical Storm Risk (TSR) Consortium of the University College London, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), United Kingdom Met Office (UKMO), Coastal Carolina University (CCU), Colorado State University (CSU), and North Carolina State University (NCSU). The forecasts include weekly and monthly changes in significant factors that help determine the number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a particular year. Some of these forecasts also take into consideration what happened in previous seasons and the predicted weakening of the 2014\u20132016 El Ni\u00f1o event.[3] On average, an Atlantic hurricane season between 1981 and 2010 contained twelve tropical storms, six hurricanes, and two major hurricanes, with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index of between 66 and 103 units.[1] Broadly speaking, ACE is a measure of the power of a tropical or subtropical storm multiplied by the length of time it existed. Therefore, a storm with a longer duration or stronger intensity will have high values of ACE. It is only calculated for full advisories on specific tropical systems reaching or exceeding wind speeds of 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h). Accordingly, tropical depressions are not included here. After the storm has dissipated, typically after the end of the season, the NHC reexamines the data, and produces a final report on each storm. These revisions can lead to a revised ACE total either upward or downward compared to the operational value.[17]"

        "content": "The first forecast for the year was issued by CSU on December 11, who anticipated that one of four different scenarios could occur. The scenario considered most likely was that Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) and thermohaline circulation (THC) would be stronger, but effects from El Ni\u00f1o would remain, resulting in a slightly above average season. The next most likely scenario was that both the AMO and THC would strengthen and the El Ni\u00f1o effects would cease to exist, causing a well above average season. In the other two scenarios, which were given the same probability of occurrence, the AMO and THC would weaken and the effects of El Ni\u00f1o would either disappear or some would remain, resulting in either a near average or well below average season.[18] TSR subsequently issued their first outlook for the 2016 season during December 16, 2015 and predicted that activity would be about 20% below the 1950\u20132015 average, or about 15% below the 2005\u20132015 average. Specifically they thought that there would be 13 tropical storms, 5 hurricanes, 2 major hurricanes and an ACE index of 79 units.[3] A few months later, TSR issued their second prediction for the season during April 6, 2016 and lowered the predicted number of named storms to 12 but raised the number of hurricanes to 6.[4]  On April 14, CSU predicted that the season would be near-normal, predicting 13 named storms, 6 hurricanes and 2 major hurricanes with ACE near 93.[5] On April 15, NCSU predicted the season would be very active, with 15\u201318 named storms, 8\u201311 hurricanes and 3\u20135 major hurricanes. A month later, the UKMO released its forecast, predicting a slightly above-average season with 14 named storms and 8 hurricanes. It also predicted an ACE index of 125, above the defined average ACE index at 103.[8] On May 27, NOAA issued its first outlook calling for a near-normal season with a 70% chance that 10\u201316 named storms could form, including 4\u20138 hurricanes of which 1\u20134 could reach major hurricane status. NOAA also stated that there is a 45% chance of a near-normal season, 30% chance of an above-normal season and 25% chance of a below-normal season.[9] Also on May 27, TSR substantially increased their forecast numbers, predicting activity would be about 30% above the average with 17 named storms, 9 hurricanes, 4 major hurricanes and an ACE near 130. The reason for the increased activity forecast was the increased likelihood of La Ni\u00f1a forming during the season in addition to a trend towards a negative North Atlantic Oscillation, which generally favors a warmer tropical Atlantic. TSR predicted that there is a 57% chance that the 2016 Atlantic season would be above-normal, a 33% chance it would be near-normal, and only a 10% chance it would be below-normal.[10]"

        "content": "The 2016 Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June\u00a01, 2016.[7] It was an above average season and the most active since 2012, producing a total of 15\u00a0named storms, 7\u00a0hurricanes, and 4\u00a0major hurricanes. The first storm, Hurricane Alex, developed on January\u00a012, while the final system, Hurricane Otto, made a crossover to the Eastern Pacific on November\u00a025. The higher-than-normal activity was attributed to many factors. Most significantly, one of the strongest El Ni\u00f1o events recorded in history rapidly dissipated, transforming to cool-neutral conditions across the Pacific in late summer. This led to warmer than normal sea surface temperatures across the Atlantic, though the subtropical regions were slightly cooler than normal; slightly lower than normal sea level pressures; and reduced wind shear, especially in the Caribbean, which had experienced record values of wind shear in the past recent years. Moisture levels, however, were anomalously dry, which likely prevented some of the storms from becoming significant hurricanes. Steering currents had also been different from past years, which had previously had a trough of low pressure dominating the East Coast of the United States.[19]  The tropical cyclones of this season caused about $16.1\u00a0billion in damage and at least 748\u00a0deaths,[20] being the costliest season since 2012, the deadliest since 2008.[21] The Atlantic hurricane season officially ended on November\u00a030, 2016.[7] The year opened up with an anomalous storm in January: Hurricane Alex, the first system of such intensity to develop in January since 1938.[22] Activity picked up at the end of May into June, with three consecutive tropical storms: Bonnie, Colin, and Danielle. The latter two became the earliest third- and fourth-named storms on record respectively.[23][24][25] July saw no storm development for the first time in four years, however.[26] August saw the formation of five tropical cyclones, including Earl, Fiona, Gaston, Eight, and Hermine. A Category\u00a01 hurricane, Earl wrought tremendous damage in Belize and Mexico. With 81\u00a0lives lost in Mexico during the passage of Earl, it was the deadliest Atlantic hurricane in the country since 2005.[27] Gaston became the season's first major hurricane on August\u00a028, attaining peak winds of 120\u00a0mph (195\u00a0km/h) over the central Atlantic.[28] On September\u00a01, Hermine struck the Florida Peninsula as a Category\u00a01 hurricane, ending an 11-year drought of hurricane landfalls in the state, which began after Hurricane Wilma in October 2005.[29] September featured another five tropical cyclones: Ian, Julia, Karl, Lisa, and Matthew, the latter of which persisted into October. Matthew proved to be the most significant storm of the season, becoming the first Category\u00a05 hurricane in the Atlantic since Hurricane Felix in 2007,[30] and, with a death toll of over 600, it was the deadliest in the Atlantic basin since Hurricane Stan in 2005. It subsequently struck Haiti as a Category\u00a04 hurricane, and inflicted catastrophic damage across the impoverished nation. Matthew also caused extensive damage in Cuba, the Bahamas, and the Southeastern United States.[31] Concurrently, Hurricane Nicole meandered south of Bermuda for more than a week before making a direct hit on the territory as a major hurricane.[32] The next four weeks were quiet, until Hurricane Otto formed in the southwestern Caribbean during late November. Otto eventually became the latest-forming major hurricane in the Atlantic basin on record, surpassing a storm in 1934.[33] After striking Nicaragua and becoming the first hurricane on record to pass over Costa Rica, Otto \u2013 the final tropical cyclone of the season \u2013 then emerged into the Eastern Pacific basin on November\u00a025, the first such occurrence since Hurricane Cesar\u2013Douglas in 1996.[33] The season's activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy index of 141\u00a0units,[17] which was well above the 1981\u20132010\u00a0median of 92,[34] as well as the highest value since 2010.[17]"

The frontal wave intensified as it moved into the central Atlantic, temporarily attaining hurricane-force winds by January\u00a010. Steered by anomalous high pressure, the disturbance turned southeast and tracked over warmer waters. Its associated fronts dissipated, its wind field became more symmetric, and convection increased near the center, leading to the formation of Subtropical Storm Alex by 18:00\u00a0UTC on January\u00a012. Despite marginal ocean temperatures, Alex benefited from rapidly cooling upper-air temperatures, and it intensified quickly while turning northeast. The presence of deeper convection near the center and an eye on conventional satellite showcased the storm's transition into a fully tropical cyclone and intensification into a hurricane by 06:00\u00a0UTC on January\u00a014. Six hours later, it peaked with maximum sustained winds of 85\u00a0mph (135\u00a0km/h). Alex turned north after peak, and the storm weakened to a tropical storm before making landfall on Terceira Island, Azores. With decreasing core convection and an impinging warm front, Alex transitioned into an extratropical cyclone by 18:00\u00a0UTC on January\u00a015 and was absorbed by a larger extratropical low two days later.[22] The precursor disturbance to Hurricane Alex produced gusts up to 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h) on Bermuda, as well as swells up to 20\u00a0ft (6\u00a0m) offshore; this disrupted air travel, downed trees, caused sporadic power outages, and suspended ferry services.[35] In the Azores, the cyclone produced maximum rainfall accumulations up to 4.04\u00a0in (103\u00a0mm) in Lagoa.[36] Peak gusts of 57\u00a0mph (92\u00a0km/h) affected Ponta Delgada, causing minor to moderate damage.[37] Landslides also contributed to minor damage.[38] One death occurred when a victim that suffered a heart attack was unable to be airlifted to a hospital due to unsettled conditions.[39]"

Moving steadily west-northwestwards, Bonnie intensified into a tropical storm on May 28. Shortly thereafter, the storm reached its peak winds of 45\u00a0mph (70\u00a0km/h). However, due to hostile environmental conditions, Bonnie weakened to a depression hours before making landfall just east of Isle of Palms, South Carolina, on May\u00a029. Steering currents collapsed afterwards, causing the storm to meander over South Carolina for two days. The storm weakened further into a non-tropical remnant low on May\u00a031, before emerging off the coast while moving generally east-northeastwards. On June\u00a02, Bonnie regenerated into a tropical depression just offshore North Carolina as conditions became slightly more favorable. The next day, despite increasing wind shear and cooling sea surface temperatures, Bonnie reintensified into a tropical storm and reached its minimum barometric pressure of 1,006\u00a0mbar (29.7\u00a0inHg). The storm weakened to a tropical depression late on June\u00a04 and became a non-tropical low again early the next day to the north of Bermuda. The remnants moved east-southeast until dissipating on June\u00a09.[23] Rip currents along the coastline of the Southeast United States led to dozens of water rescues; the body of one 20-year-old man was recovered in Brevard County, Florida, after he drowned,[40] Lingering over South Carolina for a few days, Bonnie brought heavy rains and widespread floods to the Southeastern United States. Rainfall totals hit 6\u00a0in (150\u00a0mm) in much of South Carolina, and exceeded 10\u00a0in (250\u00a0mm) in some areas. Flooding resulted in the closure of the southbound lanes of Interstate 95 in Jasper County, and also inundated the Jasper County Sheriff's Office and Detention Center. In Ridgeland, several buildings were damaged and the local wastewater treatment plant overflowed, spilling discharge into the nearby Captain Bill Creek. Damage in this county alone exceeded $640,000. Record-breaking rainfall was observed across much of the Outer Banks; on Hatteras Island, Cape Point Campground was closed for a week due to flooding.[41] In North Carolina, the body of a 21-year-old man was recovered in New Hanover County, several days after he went missing in rough surf.[42]"

The low remained disorganized with only isolated convection, mostly in the eastern quadrant. Convection began to wrap into the center as the storm curved northward into the Gulf of Mexico on June\u00a03. After the low passed over the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula on June\u00a05, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) upgraded it to Tropical Depression Three. Later that day, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Colin. Gradually curving northeastwards, Colin remained disorganized as it accelerated towards the coast of Florida on June\u00a06.[24] The NHC noted that there was uncertainty in locating the circulation center, instead taking the midpoint between two small-scale circulations.[43] However, the NHC increased the winds to 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) following a strong burst in Colin's convection. Colin continued accelerating to the northeast and made landfall near Keaton Beach, Florida, at 02:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a07. Failing to weaken over land,[24] Colin began undergoing extratropical transition after the increasingly ill-defined circulation moved off the coast of Georgia,[44] and became fully extratropical hours later.[24] In Cuba, heavy rainfall resulted in flooding in the western portions of the island, especially Pinar del R\u00edo Province. Water left several roads impassable and inundated crops in some areas;[45] about 840,000 acres (340,000\u00a0ha) of crops were flooded overall.[46] In Old Havana, mudslides severely damaged three homes and impacted numerous others to a lesser degree.[47][48] The storm also produced heavy rainfall over portions of Florida, resulting in flooding in some areas, especially Hillsborough and Pinellas counties.[24] There, the freshwater flooding was compounded by coastal flooding from high tides. Winds caused over 93,300\u00a0power outages throughout the state.[49] The storm spawned at least one tornado, which knocked down trees and damaged several cars and homes in Jacksonville.[24] Four fatalities occurred in the Florida Panhandle due to drowning.[50] Heavy rainfall was also observed in portions of Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Two additional drowning deaths occurred in Georgia and one in Alabama. Damage throughout the East Coast reached $1.04\u00a0million.[51]"

Steered west-northwest and then northwest by a mid-level ridge, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Danielle by 06:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a020 and attained peak winds of 45\u00a0mph (70\u00a0km/h) six hours later. Interaction with land began to weaken the storm a few hours later, and Danielle made landfall near Tamiahua, Mexico with winds of 40\u00a0mph (65\u00a0km/h). The storm rapidly weakened as it moved inland, falling to tropical depression intensity by 00:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a021 and degenerating into a remnant low six hours later. The remnant low continued inland before dissipating over the mountains of eastern Mexico that same day.[25] A tropical storm warning was issued along the coast of Mexico from Laguna Verde to Rio Paranuco. It was later discontinued when Danielle moved ashore and rapidly weakened. Danielle dropped heavy rainfall across the affected regions, particularly the areas near Veracruz and Tamiahua. Official amounts were not reported, however the maximum rainfall that was observed was around 6.22\u00a0in (158\u00a0mm) at Cosautl\u00e1n de Carvajal. The cyclone also brought wind gusts up to 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h), reported near Tampico.[25] Across much of Veracruz, officials suspended school activities and the port of Veracruz was temporarily closed. Flooding in the Pueblo Viejo Municipality affected 1,200\u00a0families and prompted activation of public shelters.[52] A homeless man drowned in a storm drain in Ciudad Madero, Tamaulipas, after flash flooding impacted the area.[53]"

Steered generally westward by a ridge over the South United States, Earl intensified amid warm ocean temperatures and low shear, attaining hurricane intensity and peaking with winds of 85\u00a0mph (135\u00a0km/h) on August\u00a03. Earl struck Turneffe Caye in Belize around 04:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a04 and then made landfall just south of Belize City about two hours later. It quickly weakened over land, but emerged into the Bay of Campeche on August\u00a05 as a minimal tropical storm. A hurricane hunters mission flew into Earl later on August\u00a05, measuring 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h) winds. The cyclone made landfall at that intensity near Veracruz, Veracruz, around 02:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a06. Once inland, Earl quickly weakened, falling to tropical depression intensity at 12:00\u00a0UTC and dissipating by 18:00\u00a0UTC.[27] The precursor to Earl brought heavy rain and gusty winds to the Lesser Antilles and Greater Antilles. Strong winds in the Dominican Republic downed a power line onto a bus, subsequently causing a fire that killed six people. A boat crash in Saman\u00e1 Bay killed seven people.[54][55] Significant impacts were reported in Belize after Earl moved ashore as a hurricane, including downed trees and power lines, blown transformers, damaged or ripped-off roofs, coastal and inland flooding, and a significant storm surge.[56] About 2,000\u00a0homes were damaged or destroyed throughout Belize.[57] Damage in the country reached about $110\u00a0million. In Mexico, flooding and landslides resulted in severe damage and many deaths, especially in Puebla and Veracruz. In the former, mudslides damaged hundreds of homes, including 350\u00a0in the village of Chicahuaxtla alone. Huauchinango observed a month's worth of rainfall in only about 24\u00a0hours, resulting in mudslides that killed at least 13\u00a0people. Throughout Puebla, there were at least 41\u00a0deaths. In Veracruz, Earl and the resultant landslides damaged about 6,300 homes and 26 roadways, while 13\u00a0fatalities occurred.

The depression slowly organized after formation and developed a central dense overcast, with the system becoming Tropical Storm Fiona by 12:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a017.[59] Despite strong westerly shear, abundant mid-level dry air, and an otherwise disheveled satellite appearance,[60] an advanced scatterometer (ASCAT) pass indicated a maximum sustained wind speed of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) early on August\u00a019.[59][60] Although sporadic bursts of convection continued amid the hostile environment, Fiona weakened to a tropical depression by 06:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a022 and degenerated into a remnant low early on August\u00a023 about 375\u00a0mi (605\u00a0km) south-southwest of Bermuda.

Amid low shear and warm ocean temperatures, Gaston attained hurricane intensity for a second time at 18:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a027. About 24\u00a0hours later, the storm deepened to a Category\u00a03 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale, the first major hurricane of the season, by 18:00\u00a0UTC the next day. With a symmetric ring of deep convection surrounding a distinct eye, Gaston ultimately peaked with sustained winds of 120\u00a0mph (195\u00a0km/h) six hours later.[28] A mid-level trough moving southeastward across the North Atlantic eroded a series of ridges steering Gaston, causing the system to drift north and northeast. Cold water upwelling and an eyewall replacement cycle caused Gaston to weaken on August\u00a029,[66] although the cyclone unexpectedly re-intensified to 120\u00a0mph (195\u00a0km/h) for a second time around 00:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a031. Later that day, it began encountering increasingly cool waters and a higher shear, leading the storm to fall below major hurricane status by 18:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a031, and below hurricane intensity by 12:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a02. Continuous unfavorable conditions caused deep convection to dissipate, and Gaston transitioned into an extratropical cyclone as its center grazed Flores Island at 18:00\u00a0UTC.

Early on August 27, the low became well-defined, but lacked sufficient convection,[67] and was plagued by unfavorable conditions such as dry air and moderate wind shear.[68] However, a large burst of convection near and to the west of the center prompted the upgrade to Tropical Depression Eight at 12:00\u00a0UTC on August 28 about 350\u00a0mi (560\u00a0km) southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina.[67] A ridge to the north steered the depression westward into an area of moderate wind shear.[69] Late on August\u00a028, the center became exposed from the convection,[70] but convection increased again after about 24\u00a0hours.[71] As it approached the Carolina coastline on August 30, a weakness in the subtropical ridge caused the depression to slow down and turn northward; its closest approach to the United States was 60\u00a0mi (95\u00a0km) south-southeast of Cape Hatteras later that day. The depression then turned eastward in response to becoming entangled in the mid-latitude westerlies. As it accelerated, the circulation began to become elongated.

In Florida, abnormally high tides and heavy precipitation along the gulf coast caused significant damage.[29] In Citrus County, one of the worst areas impacted, 2,694\u00a0structures were damaged, of which 531\u00a0experienced severe damage, while damage reached about $102\u00a0million.[76] Similar coastal and freshwater flooding occurred in Pasco County, where 7\u00a0homes were destroyed, 305\u00a0sustained major damage, and 1,564\u00a0received minor damage.[77] Winds primarily left power outages and downed trees, some of which fell onto buildings and vehicles. About 325,000\u00a0people were left without electricity.[78] Near Ocala, a tree fell on a homeless man's tent, killing him. Flooding and fairly strong winds in other states such as Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina caused additional damage, but to a lesser extent.[29] One death each occurred in South Carolina and North Carolina.[29][79] In New York, two fishermen drowned near the Wading River on Long Island due to rough surf.[80] Overall, Hermine caused about $550 million in damage in the United States.[29]"

        "content": "On September\u00a05, the NHC indicated that the development of a tropical cyclone was possible in the East Atlantic over subsequent days.[81] A tropical wave emerged off the west coast of Africa on September\u00a06, slowly coalescing into Tropical Storm Ian by 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a012.[82] Steered north and the northeast by an approaching upper-level trough, the cyclone struggled within an environment of high shear, with its low-level center displaced west of its associated convection.[83] An upper-trough became superimposed with the storm's center by late on September\u00a014, yielding a more subtropical-like appearance on conventional satellite. As a result, Ian briefly transitioned into a subtropical storm around 18:00\u00a0UTC, but re-acquired tropical characteristics just 18\u00a0hours later while moving northeastward away from the aforementioned trough.[82] By 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a016, a small mid-level eye became apparent and Ian began to intensify,[84] with winds reaching 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h) at that time.[82][84] However, deep convection soon dissipated as cold air wrapped into the center, marking Ian's transition into an extratropical cyclone around 12:00\u00a0UTC.[85] On September\u00a017, Ian's remnants were absorbed by a larger extratropical cyclone and soon dissipated.[82]"

        "content": "On September\u00a01, a tropical wave entered the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa. A low-pressure area developed after a burst in convection near the Leeward Islands around September\u00a06, but dry air and wind shear inhibited further development. At 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a013, the system maintained sufficient organization to become a tropical depression. Around that time, it made landfall in Jensen Beach, Florida. Despite being inland, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Julia over Jacksonville and peaked with winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) shortly thereafter. The cyclone drifted north-northwestward and then northeastward, moving offshore the Southeastern United States on September\u00a014 under a weak steering regime. A cyclonic loop occurred as strong westerly air developed in the region.[86] The shear caused fluctuations in intensity, while there were bursts of convection around the disorganized center.[87] By September 19, the center of Julia was devoid of strong convection, as rainbands rapidly diminished, and soon degraded into a remnant low. The remnants dissipated over eastern North Carolina on September\u00a021.[86] In its precursor and early stages, the storm caused generally minor wind and flooding damage in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina due to its asymmetrical structure and fairly weak intensity. Parts of North Carolina received as much as 12\u00a0in (300\u00a0mm) of rain, while as much as 18\u00a0in (460\u00a0mm) fell in the Hampton Roads area of Virginia. A total of 63\u00a0people had to be rescued from their homes, and 61 were evacuated from nursing homes. One million gallons of sewage from Elizabeth City flowed into the Pasquotank River and Charles Creek. The Cashie River in Windsor, North Carolina, reached 15\u00a0ft (4.6\u00a0m) on September\u00a022, 2\u00a0ft (0.61\u00a0m) above flood stage. That same day, Governor Pat McCrory declared a state of emergency in 11\u00a0counties. Schools were closed in Bertie, Currituck and Hertford counties.[88] Overall, Julia caused about $6.13\u00a0million in damage.[89]"

The wave steadily organized while passing through the Cabo Verde Islands, and attained sufficient organization to be declared a tropical depression by 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a014.[90] Strong shear plagued the cyclone, with its low-level circulation misplaced from the convection.[91] By 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a015, however, a significant burst of deep convection prompted the depression's upgrade to Tropical Storm Karl. The cyclone continued west for several days across the unfavorable central Atlantic, with convection sheared to the northeast and the circulation occasionally becoming poorly defined. Despite continued predictions of intensification into a powerful hurricane, Karl instead succumbed to the hostile conditions and weakened to a tropical depression around 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a021 as it passed close to an upper-level low.[90][92] However, by the following day, the upper-level low moved away to the south, causing a reduction in shear that allowed the system to reattain tropical storm intensity as it curved near Bermuda.[90] Accelerating east-northeastwards, Karl continued to strengthen and it attained peak winds of 70\u00a0mph (115\u00a0km/h) early on September\u00a025.[90] However, cold air encroached on the low-level circulation by 12:00\u00a0UTC that day, marking Karl's transition to an extratropical cyclone.[93] Karl's remnant low continued northeast over the North Atlantic and was absorbed by another extratropical system early on September\u00a026.[90] In Bermuda, about 800\u00a0people lost power indirectly from the storm due to a mainline fault on the island. Otherwise, damage was relatively minor. Sustained winds of 46\u00a0mph (74\u00a0km/h) and gusts to over 68\u00a0mph (109\u00a0km/h) were observed,[90] along with 4.71\u00a0in (120\u00a0mm) of rainfall; this contributed to the wettest September on record in Bermuda.[94] Long-period swells from Karl reached the East Coast of the United States as the storm moved out to sea.[95]"

The storm soon began weakening due increasing wind shear, but Lisa briefly restrengthened on September\u00a024. Lisa managed to maintain tropical storm intensity while battling unfavorable conditions until early on September\u00a025, weakening to a tropical depression at that time.

Continuing westward under the influence of a mid-level ridge, the storm steadily intensified to attain hurricane intensity by 18:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a029. The effects of southwesterly wind shear unexpectedly abated late that day, and Matthew began a period of rapid intensification; during a 24-hour period beginning at 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a030, the cyclone's maximum winds more than doubled, from 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) to 165\u00a0mph (265\u00a0km/h), making Matthew a Category 5 hurricane,[31] the first since Hurricane Felix in 2007.[99] Due to upwelling of cooler waters, Matthew weakened to a Category\u00a04 hurricane later on October\u00a01. Matthew remained a powerful Category 4 hurricane for several days, making landfall near Les Anglais, Haiti, around 11:00 UTC on October 4 with winds of 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h). Continuing northward, the cyclone struck Mais\u00ed in Cuba early on October\u00a05. Cuba's and Haiti's mountainous terrain weakened Matthew to Category 3 status, as it began to accelerate northwestwards through the Bahamas.[31] Restrengthening occurred as Matthew's circulation became better organized, with the storm becoming a Category\u00a04 hurricane again while passing Freeport. However, Matthew began to weaken again as an eyewall replacement cycle took place. The storm significantly weakened while closely paralleling the coasts of Florida and Georgia, with the northwestern portion of the outer eyewall coming ashore in Florida while the system was a Category\u00a03 hurricane. Matthew weakened to a Category\u00a02 hurricane late on October\u00a07 and then to a Category\u00a01 hurricane by 12:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a08. About three hours later, the hurricane made landfall at Cape Romain National Wildlife Refuge, near McClellanville, South Carolina, with winds of 85\u00a0mph (135\u00a0km/h).[31] Convection became displaced as Matthew pulled away from land,[100] with the storm becoming extratropical about 200\u00a0mi (320\u00a0km) east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, on October\u00a09.[31] Heavy rains and strong winds buffeted the Lesser Antilles. The winds caused widespread power outages and damaged crops, particularly in St. Lucia, while flooding and landslides caused by the rainfall damaged many homes and roads. One person died in St. Vincent when he was crushed by a boulder.[101] The storm brought precipitation to Colombia's Guajira Peninsula, which saw its first heavy rain event in three years. One person drowned in a river in Uribia.[102] In Haiti, flooding and high winds disrupted telecommunications and destroyed extensive swaths of land; around 80% of J\u00e9r\u00e9mie sustained significant damage.[103] Matthew left about $1.9\u00a0billion in damage and at least 546\u00a0deaths.[31][104] Heavy rainfall spread eastward across the Dominican Republic, where four were killed.[105] Effects in Cuba were most severe along the coast, where storm surge caused extensive damage.[106] Four people were killed due to a bridge collapse,[107] and total losses in the country amounted to $2.58\u00a0billion, most of which occurred in the Guant\u00e1namo Province.[108] Passing through the Bahamas as a major hurricane, Matthew inflicted severe impacts across several islands, particularly Grand Bahama, where an estimated 95% of homes sustained damage in the townships of Eight Mile Rock and Holmes Rock. In Florida, much of the damage occurred was caused by strong winds and storm surge in the east-central and northeastern portions of the state. About 1.2\u00a0million people lost power.[31] Damage in Florida reached over $2.75\u00a0billion and there were 12\u00a0deaths.[109] An additional 1.3\u00a0million people lost electricity in Georgia and South Carolina combined. Torrential rain caused severe flooding, especially in North Carolina and South Carolina,[31] where some rivers exceed record heights set by Hurricane Floyd and the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane.[31][110] In North Carolina, 100,000\u00a0structures were flooded and damage reached $1.5\u00a0billion.[31] Overall, Matthew caused at least 603\u00a0deaths and about $15.1\u00a0billion in damage.[31][107][111][112]"

The NHC forecast only gradual strengthening as the storm moved slowly to the north due to weak steering currents.[113] An eye then became visible at both mid- and upper-level heights, and Nicole rapidly strengthened to a Category\u00a02 hurricane to the south of Bermuda, as winds reached 105\u00a0mph (170\u00a0km/h) early on October\u00a07.[32] With Matthew located offshore Florida, this was the first time since 1964 that two hurricanes at or above Category\u00a02 existed simultaneously in the western Atlantic Ocean (65\u00b0W).[114] However, Nicole was then impacted by wind shear, with the eye soon becoming no longer visible and convection diminishing.[115] Nicole rapidly weakened to a strong tropical storm on October\u00a07. Further weakening occurred as it drifted southward, and by October\u00a08, the circulation was exposed and the system was barely a tropical storm, with all convection displaced to the south.[116] Later that day, an impressive burst of convection flared up over the center, and Nicole again became more organized as it began to turn to the north.[117] Gradual intensification continued throughout the next few days before briefly stopping, then later resuming on October\u00a011 as the storm turned towards Bermuda and re-strengthened to Category 1 status. On October 12, Nicole became a Category 2 hurricane again. Later on the same day, Nicole became a major hurricane upon reaching Category 3 intensity. The next day, Nicole briefly strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane, peaking with maximum sustained winds of 140\u00a0mph (225\u00a0km/h). However, the storm weakened back to a Category 3 hurricane several hours later due to increasing vertical wind shear.[32] At 15:00\u00a0UTC on October 13, the hurricane's eye passed directly over Bermuda, where automated surface station measured sustained winds of 87\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) and a gust reaching 119\u00a0mph (192\u00a0km/h).[118] At 06:00 UTC on October\u00a014, southwesterly wind shear reduced the system to Category 1 status. The storm slowly began to weaken the next day, falling to a tropical storm intensity early on October\u00a018. Nicole transitioned into an extratropical cyclone at 06:00 UTC later that day. Overall, Nicole was responsible for $15\u00a0million in damages across Bermuda.[32] Along the East Coast of the United States, a swimmer in North Carolina drowned due to rip currents produced by Nicole.[119]"

Fueled by warm waters and good outflow, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Otto by 06:00\u00a0UTC on November\u00a021. Otto deepened into a hurricane on November\u00a023 while drifting westward; this was the latest date for a tropical cyclone to reach that intensity over the Caribbean Sea, one day later than the previous record set by Hurricane Martha in 1969. Otto rapidly intensified throughout the following day, and at 17:30\u00a0UTC November\u00a024, the storm made landfall on the southern Nicaragua coast near San Juan de Nicaragua at peak intensity, as a Category 3  hurricane with winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h). This was the southernmost hurricane landfall in Central America. Weakening ensued as Otto moved inland. Around 03:30\u00a0UTC on November\u00a025, Otto exited into the Eastern Pacific, marking the first time a tropical cyclone survived the crossover from the Atlantic to the Eastern Pacific since Hurricane Cesar\u2013Douglas in 1996.[120] In Panama, the outer bands of Otto brought heavy precipitation and strong winds. The hurricane left nine deaths in the country, with one after a house was struck by a falling tree in Panama City, three from landslides, two by drowning in a rain-swollen river, and three others after the ship Jessica sank.[121] Generally, rainfall of 3 to 6\u00a0in (76 to 152\u00a0mm) was observed in Nicaragua.[120] Throughout the country, Otto damaged 857\u00a0houses, 8\u00a0schools, and 2\u00a0health facilities. About 5,600\u00a0ft (1,700\u00a0m) of power lines were damaged, causing power and water outages.[122] Four deaths were reported.[123] In Costa Rica, rainfall peaked at 12.11\u00a0in (308\u00a0mm) at Miravalles Volcano.[120] Flooding and mudslides left 42\u00a0communities isolated and damaged 14\u00a0water systems.[122] Damage reached at least $190\u00a0million and there were 10\u00a0fatalities.[120][124]"

It spent most of its life as a tropical depression, and briefly gained tropical storm status before its landfall on the Texas coast on July 30. After landfall, it dissipated over central Texas on August 2.[1] The impacts from Dean were minimal, mainly due to heavy rain in Oklahoma and Texas that caused localized coastal and inland flooding.[2] Two F0 Tornadoes touched down in Texas as a result of Dean's landfall.[3] Also, Twenty families had to be evacuated in Chambers County, due to flooding in the area.[1] One fatality was recorded as a result of flooding in Oklahoma.[2] Several highways were flooded out in Oklahoma, which impeded travel in the state.[2] In addition approximately $500,000 (1995 U.S. dollars) worth of damage was recorded in the aftermath of Dean.[1]"

        "content": "The precursor system that would form Dean was a stationary front situated in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico in the last week of July. On July 27, it developed a weak upper-level circulation indicated by reports from buoys in the Gulf, its structure was disorganized but was in the process of organizing. The system continued to organize early on July 28, and that afternoon it developed a surface circulation. The tropical depression that spawned Dean was thought to have formed at around 1800 UTC, July 28. It was later declared Tropical Depression Four that same day with the center located about 345\u00a0miles (555\u00a0km) southeast of New Orleans.[1] At first, the depression slowly tracked westward because it was blocked by a ridge of high pressure to the north.[4] The system was under frequent reconnaissance surveillance, and the depression remained poorly organized and continued to be at tropical depression status well into 29 July.[1][5] The organization of the system hindered further development despite favorable conditions with low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures.[6] Late on July 29, the system began to execute a turn to the northwest with an increase in forward speed. It still remained a poorly organized tropical depression south of Louisiana.[7] On July 30, the system's circulation began to organize and the first reports of tropical storm-force squalls were reported as it moved closer to the Texas coast.[8] Based on this the National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued tropical storm warnings for much of the Texas and Louisiana coast, from Intracoastal City, Louisiana to Corpus Christi, Texas. Later that afternoon it strengthened into Tropical Storm Dean while located just 70\u00a0mi (110\u00a0km) off the coast.[1] The Hurricane Hunters confirmed that Dean strengthened in the final hours before its landfall on the Texas coast to a 45\u00a0mph (75\u00a0km/h) storm, and made landfall near Freeport, Texas at 8:30 pm CDT (0130 UTC) July 31.[9][10] Shortly after its landfall, Dean weakened back to tropical depression strength as it tracked further northwest into Texas. The depression stalled in central Texas on August 1 and remained there for 36 hours until the next day, dropping heavy rain over parts of the state.[11] Late on August 2, it merged with a non-tropical front and dissipated.[1][3] The remnants of Dean eventually moved up into Oklahoma, where it caused heavy rainfall, forcing roads to close and rescues to be made.[2] Dean also dropped heavy rain across the Midwest states as well. Some areas in Kansas received more than seven inches of rain. Illinois, Missouri, and Indiana each had areas that received more than 5\u00a0inches (127\u00a0mm) of rain from Dean.[11]"

A portion of State Highway 87 was flooded from the storm surge, although no significant property damage was reported as a result of it.[10] Minor beach erosion and street flooding was also reported on Galveston Island.[3] The highest wind gust on land was 51\u00a0mph (82\u00a0km/h) at Scholes Field.

The hurricane was first reported on September\u00a08 off the coast of Mexico. It slowly moved northwestward while intensifying. After peaking in intensity, it entered the Gulf of California, and weakened rapidly. It dissipated on September\u00a013. This system brought winds and heavy rain to the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula. The hurricane destroyed poorer sections of La Paz and its nearby villages. Two villages were completely destroyed. Furthermore, Cabo San Lucas was devastated. The torrential rains damaged roads and left thousands homeless. In addition, the hurricane destroyed the tuna canning industry in San Jos\u00e9 del Cabo. Throughout the devastated peninsula, 15 people were killed, and many others were injured. Initially following the storm, Cabo San Lucas was abandoned, but after World War II, most of the destroyed buildings were rebuilt. The remnants of the storm later brought rains to California and Arizona, peaking at 3.54\u00a0in (90\u00a0mm) at Mormon Lake."

It slowly moved northwestward, and entered the Gulf of California.[1] Subsequently, the hurricane made landfall along the southern portion of Baja California Sur,[2] with winds of 85\u00a0mph (135\u00a0km/h). This made the hurricane a Category\u00a01 on the modern-day Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale. Even though the Monthly Weather Review reported that the hurricane was last observed on September\u00a012,[1] the storm is presumed to have weakened thereafter as it moved up the coast and by September\u00a013, only a swirl of clouds remained.[3]"

The wind destroyed poorer sections of La Paz and nearby villages. Two villages, Santiago and Triunfo, were completely destroyed. The torrential rains damaged many highways across the peninsula and left thousands homeless.[1] The tuna canning industry declined rapidly in San Jos\u00e9 del Cabo following the hurricane because the storm had damaged the equipment needed for the industry.[10] According to personal accounts, a famous church was destroyed in Todos Santos.[11] Moisture from the Cabo San Lucas hurricane of 1941 later passed into the Southwestern United States, where it caused up to 1\u00a0in (25\u00a0mm) of rain in the mountains and deserts of California.[12] Further east, the storm brought heavy rains to portions of Arizona, peaking at 3.54\u00a0in (90\u00a0mm) at Mormon Lake. Four other weather stations recorded more than 2\u00a0in (51\u00a0mm).[3]"

The flood was preceded by heavy rains beginning March 9, 1936, which did not stop until March 22. The storms brought warmer weather with temperatures of 50\u00a0\u00b0F (10\u00a0\u00b0C) and was a cause of one stage of the flooding; the continuous rainfall was the second cause. The natural surface runoff of 1 to 3 inches (2.5 to 7.5\u00a0cm) was far surpassed by the deluge of from 10 to 30 inches (25 to 75\u00a0cm) of water in the region. The flood came before pending flood control legislation was enacted or any significant flood control measures were implemented. The narrowness of the valleys and the encroachment of buildings on riverbanks contributed to the record flooding. By the time nightfall on March 17, one-third of the city was under 17 feet (5.2\u00a0m) of water. Twenty-five people lost their lives in the disaster, and damages estimated at $43 million made it the worst flood since the flood of 1889. The event is chronicled at the Johnstown Flood Museum.[2] After the flood, sweeping nationwide flood control laws were enacted and from 1938 to 1943 Johnstown saw many projects completed. These measures gave residents the feeling that the area was now \"flood free\", and it was touted as such until the flood of 1977."

On March 14, 1907, there was flooding that was bested only by the one in 1889. There was talk of flood control but nothing was accomplished. Talks had finally determined that something needed to be done and the legislature was working on a bill by 1935. On March 15 and 16 heavy rains hit the Johnstown area. Warmer weather began to melt the accumulated snow on the ground, and the soil became saturated. By March 17, the Conemaugh River reached flood stage and was continuing to rise at the rate of 18 inches per hour. The raging streams merged and entered Johnstown. At Locust Street and Lee Place, the flood crest reached to within five feet of the high-water mark of the catastrophic flood of May 31, 1889. In the section known as Cambria City, the stone bridge, unlike in 1889, remained unobstructed, resulting in a flood level here that was 18 inches higher than that of the 1889 flood. On March 18, whistles and sirens began to scream, as word spread that the Quemahoning Reservoir dam had broken. People rushed for higher ground. This report turned out to be false and people started making their way back into town. Robert Bondy, the American Red Cross national director of disaster relief arrived to start relief efforts. The Works Progress Administration sent 7000 men and 350 to report to Mayor Shields. 1724 enlisted and 114 officers were mobilized by Governor George H. Earle effectively placing the area under martial law. 80 members of the Highway Patrol and 81 members of the State Police arrived to help restore and maintain order.[3] The gauge on the Poplar Street Bridge showed 15 feet above flood level and the 14 feet above flood stage at the \"Point\".[4]"

Those temperatures were accompanied by three days of severe rains, which saturated the land and caused swift run-off into local streams and rivers upstream from Johnstown.[6] The natural run-off of 1 to 3 inches (2.5 to 7.5 cm) was far surpassed by the deluge of from 10 to 30 inches (25 to 75 cm) of water in the region. Other areas affected by the same storm system included  Connecticut River at Hartford, Connecticut, was 8.6 feet higher than recorded in 300 years, the Susquehanna River at Harrisburg, was 3.5 feet higher than seen in 200 years, and the Ohio River at Pittsburgh was 6.1 feet higher than the previous highest level recorded in 1762.

The Johnstown Tribune and Democrat (which later merged with The Tribune-Democrat) demanded federal aid. Senators and Representatives in Washington, D.C. enacted the Flood Control Act of 1936 and the Flood Control Act of 1937. In August, 1938 work began on the most extensive flood control channel improvement project in American history. In Johnstown, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers constructed 6,500 feet of river walls and 3,000 feet of dykes.[10] On November 27, 1943, Colonel Gilbert Van B. Wilkes, Chief of the US Army Corps of Engineers, Pittsburgh District reported to Johnstown leaders that  the flood problem had been effectively solved.

        "content": " Tropical Storm Claudette was a weak tropical cyclone that caused heavy rain and tornadoes across the Southeastern United States in June 2021, leading to severe damage. The third named storm of the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season, Claudette originated from a broad trough of low pressure over the Bay of Campeche on June\u00a012. The disturbance moved erratically over the region for the next several days, before proceeding northward with little development due to unfavorable upper-level winds and land interaction. Despite this, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) initiated advisories on it as a Potential Tropical Cyclone late on June\u00a017, due to its imminent threat to land. The disturbance finally organized into Tropical Storm Claudette at 00:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a019 just before landfall in southeast Louisiana. Claudette weakened to a depression as it turned east-northeastward before moving through Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina. Baroclinic forcing then caused Claudette to reintensify into a tropical storm over North Carolina early on June\u00a021 before it accelerated into the Atlantic Ocean later that day. Soon afterward, it degenerated into a low-pressure trough on the same day, before being absorbed into another extratropical cyclone on the next day. Claudette produced gusty winds, flash flooding, and tornadoes across much of the Southeastern United States. Claudette overall caused minor impacts along the Gulf of Campeche's coastline due to the system stalling in the region as an Invest and a Potential Tropical Cyclone. Impacts were most severe in Alabama and Mississippi, where heavy rains caused flash flooding. Several tornadoes in the states also caused severe damage, including an EF2\u00a0tornado that damaged a school and destroyed parts of a mobile home park in East Brewton, Alabama, injuring\u00a020 people. A total of 14\u00a0people died in Alabama due to the storm, including 10 from car accidents. Monetary losses across the United States is estimated at $375 million."

        "content": "On June\u00a06, a tropical wave entered the Caribbean Sea.[1] The wave briefly became convectively active before moving inland over Nicaragua and Honduras on June\u00a010. The remnants of the system began to interact with the eastern portion of an enhanced monsoon trough in the Eastern Pacific and at 12:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a011, the National Hurricane Center noted the possibility of a trough of low pressure to develop in the upcoming few days over the Bay of Campeche and southwestern Gulf of Mexico.[2] The large disturbance then moved out of the Eastern Pacific into Mexico and 24\u00a0hours later, a cluster of convection formed over the Bay of Campeche and parts of Mexico and Central America. Moving erratically over the bight, the system split into two disturbances on either side of Central America, with the southern portion becoming Tropical Storm Dolores.[1] The northern disturbance gained a broad circulation on June\u00a013 and developed an area of low pressure on June\u00a014. After meandering in the Southern Gulf of Mexico for a couple of days, the sprawling, disorganized low began to move north-northeastward. Over the next few days, the structure of the system changed minimally due to unfavorable upper-level winds and land interaction, although convective activity occurred continuously.[3] Organization began to steadily increase east of the circulation, but a Hurricane Hunters reconnaissance aircraft investigated the system on June\u00a017 and did not find a closed surface circulation.[4][5] However, due to its imminent threat to land, the NHC designated the disturbance as Potential Tropical Cyclone Three at 21:00\u00a0UTC that day, and started issuing advisories on it.[6] This designation is given to tropical disturbances that have not acquired tropical cyclone status, but are likely to bring tropical storm-force or higher winds to an area, in this case the Gulf Coast of the United States, and was first used for the precursor to Tropical Storm Bret in 2017.[7] Around this time, convection was increasing and a broad curved banding feature developed on the eastern side of the storm, with the NHC describing its structure more resembled that of a subtropical cyclone.[8] Hurricane Hunters data indicated that the system was rather lopsided, with convective activity being displaced east of the ill-defined center of circulation.[1] This was due to wind shear produced by an upper-level trough over the western shore of the Gulf of Mexico.[9] The next day, the center reformed further north, which increased convection and adding a curvature to the lower-level clouds.[10] A hurricane hunter flight later that day confirmed the circulation had become well-defined and at 00:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a019, the system became a tropical storm as it already had gale-force wind. The storm had some characteristics of a subtropical storm, but was classified as sheared tropical storm since the upper-level trough responsible for its appearance was over Texas and not the storm itself. The system reached its peak intensity with winds of 50\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h) and a pressure of 1009\u00a0mb (29.80\u00a0inHg) as it made landfall in Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana 25\u00a0nm south-southwest of Houma at 04:30\u00a0UTC.[1] Operationally, the system was not upgraded to a tropical storm until 09:00\u00a0UTC, receiving the name Claudette, by which time it was already inland over southeastern Louisiana and weakening.[11][12] Turning northeastward, Claudette moved into Southeastern Mississippi and weakened to a depression at 18:00\u00a0UTC.[1] After crossing the state line into Alabama, Claudette gradually turned east-northeastward and moved through North Georgia into Upstate South Carolina as a tropical depression. Deep convection increased in curved bands late on June 20, but the center was not well defined.[13] At 06:00 UTC on June\u00a021 however, Claudette restrengthened into a tropical storm while still located over southeastern North Carolina as more organized rainbands formed along and just off the coast. Sustained winds at the time once again reached 50\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h), although its pressure was slightly higher this time.[1] Claudette emerged over the Western Atlantic Ocean later that day as a tropical storm while embedded within a larger low pressure envelope accelerating to east-northeast, as it began its extratropical transition. After moving into the Atlantic Ocean, Claudette moved alongside the coast of the United States and became an extratropical low at 06:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a022. The low continued to move northeastward, before dissipating about 100\u00a0nm southeast of the coast of Nova Scotia as it was absorbed into another extratropical storm to the west.[1]"

The De Soto National Forest shut down recreation sites near Saucier and river landings along Black Creek.[25][26] In neighboring Alabama, construction crews had to hastily finish repairs on bulkheads in Fairhope and drainage in Downtown Mobile, the former of which was damaged by Hurricanes Sally and Zeta from the previous year.[27] The Gulf Islands National Seashore in Florida closed down Fort Pickens, issuing a mandatory evacuation for all staff and visitors of the reserve which lasted until noon on June 18. This was due to concerns of high tides pushing sand onto Fort Pickens Road, creating hostile conditions for usage. Despite this, \"Opal Beach\", the landfall site of Hurricane Opal, and Perdido Key remained open.[28] A total of 5\u201315 inches of rainfall was forecasted by the NHC on June\u00a019 as Claudette moseyed eastward along the deep south.[29] At 15:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a019, a Tropical Storm Watch was issued for North Carolina from Cape Fear to Duck.[30][31] By 09:00\u00a0UTC the next day, a Tropical Storm Warning had been ordered from Little River Inlet, South Carolina to Duck. A Tropical Storm Watch also extended from Little River Inlet to the South Santee River in South Carolina.[32] Storm surge of up to 1\u20133\u00a0feet was possible from the North Carolina-Virginia border south to Little River Inlet. Heavy rain and even the potential for isolated tornadoes remained.[31]"

The Isla municipality saw the most damage with 192 homes affected. Several rivers overtopped their banks, inundating surrounding communities.[36] The overflowing Pintores River in Coatepec inundated 105 homes.[38] Sinkholes occurred the city of Veracruz, Cosamaloapan between the Gloria de Coapa and Poblado Dos communities, and in Misantla.[36][38] The Secretariat of National Defense (SEDNA) deployed personnel in Xalapa to assist in cleanup efforts.[39] Eight municipalities in Puebla saw minimal damage from the storm, primarily limited to minor flooding and blocked roads.[40] A landslide within the Sierra Norte de Puebla briefly isolated the communities of San Agust\u00edn Altiuacan and Tlapehuala. The swollen Balsas River (locally referred to as the Atoyac River) threatened multiple bridges and submerged some homes in the Reforma Sur neighborhood. The Secretary of Civil Protection and Comprehensive Risk Management provided 24 mats and 85 blankets to affected residents in that community.[41] A localized flood in the city of Puebla affected the Museo de la M\u00fasica Mexicana, the Museo Casa del T\u00edtere, and the Casa de la M\u00fasica de Viena; water reached a depth of 1.6\u00a0ft (0.5\u00a0m).[42] The combined influence of low pressure systems in the Gulf of Mexico and off the Pacific coast of Mexico led to prolonged rains in Oaxaca and Chiapas. In Oaxaca, the Chivaniza, Chapala, San Isidro, and Malatengo Rivers topped their banks and affected multiple communities. The Nisa Lubaa stream flooded 15 communities in Ixtepec, affecting more than 300 families. Two shelters were opened in the city.[43] At least ten Zapotec communities were impacted by overflowing streams and rivers, and damage to agriculture and infrastructure. The worst damage in Oaxaca was in the Sierra Sur and Costa regions, where mudslides made roads impassable.[44] Two people were killed by lightning in San Nicol\u00e1s Yaxe.[43] Two people drowned in Tuxtla Guti\u00e9rrez, Chiapas, after getting out of their flooded vehicle and being sucked into a sewer.[43] Lowland flooding in the Ci\u00e9naga 2000 subdivision of Progreso, Yucat\u00e1n, prompted the evacuation of 40 people some of whom had to be rescued by boat. Two shelters were opened at schools to house displaced persons.[45] The state government provided 500 food packages to the affected residents and five water pumps to clear out standing water.[46] Street flooding occurred in Teapa, Tabasco, with several residences requiring assistance. One home was damaged in Tacotalpa by a landslide.[47] Several days of heavy rain flooded streets in Mexico City.[48] Minor flooding in Quintana Roo disrupted traffic, though overall effects were negligible.[49] In Guatemala, heavy rains exacerbated the effects of the annual rainy season. One person was killed by a landslide in the Guatemala Department while 55,100 people were affected across the country by rains on June\u00a014\u201315.[50]"

The highest measured rainfall total was 6.44\u00a0in (164\u00a0mm) in northeastern Alabama, though meteorologists at the National Weather Service estimated totals may have been locally higher.[54] These rains contributed to the state producing 50\u00a0percent more hydroelectric power than expected during the month of June.[55] Flooding occurred along an area from Tuscaloosa to Birmingham to Fort Payne in conjunction with the heaviest rainfall during the overnight of June 19\u201320.[54] The state's Emergency Management Agency estimated 150\u2013200 homes to be damaged.[56] Search and rescue teams were deployed to search for those who were lost in flash floods, and crews used boats in Pebble Creek to do so.[57][58] Near Tuscaloosa, a private dam failed and the subsequent flooding washed out a water and sewer main at Nucor Corp.'s steel plant. This in turn damaged the city's sewage system, prompting officials to issue water restrictions for 100,000 people. Flooding in the city damaged or destroyed 45 homes. Damage to the sewer system alone is estimated at $1.5\u20134\u00a0million.[59][60] Flooding destroyed 5 homes, severely damaged 38, and otherwise impacted a further 53 in Northport and Tuscaloosa collectively. Residential and infrastructure damage between the two cities reached $3.35\u00a0million.[61] The strongest winds occurred in southern and coastal counties, with brief periods of sustained gales reported in Dauphin Island and Fort Morgan. A maximum gust of 49\u00a0mph (79\u00a0km/h) was measured in Point Clear.[62] Approximately 90,000 Alabama Power customers lost electricity due to downed power lines.[63] Storm surge accompanying the cyclone generally reached 1\u20133\u00a0ft (0.3\u20130.9\u00a0m), with a maxima of 3.67\u00a0ft (1.12\u00a0m) in Bayou La Batre. Surf heights on top of the surge in Mobile Bay reached 6\u201312\u00a0ft (1.8\u20133.7\u00a0m). Flooding forced the closure of roads in Bayou La Batre, Coden, and The Causeway along U.S. Route 90.[62] The Dauphin Island fishing pier sustained minor damage.[64] Three tornadoes touched down in the state: two were rated EF0 while the other was rated EF2. The former two caused minimal damage near Florala and the Cedar Point Pier in Mobile where one person was injured by debris.[62] The latter of these caused extensive damage along a 22\u00a0mi (35\u00a0km) path from East Brewton to Castleberry.[65] The tornado damaged or destroyed about 70 buildings and injured 20 people;[63] 2 people sustained serious injuries, one of whom was thrown from his home when it was destroyed.[65] A total of 14 people died in various incidents related to the cyclone: 10 from car accidents, 2 from fallen trees, and 2 from flooding.[52] Near Cottondale, a 24-year-old man and his 3-year-old son were killed when a tree loosened by saturated soil fell on their home; winds at the time were estimated at 20\u201330\u00a0mph (30\u201350\u00a0km/h).[66] A 31-year-old man died in Birmingham after being swept away by floodwaters and a 23-year-old woman drowned after driving her car into a swollen creek in Fort Payne.[67][68] The greatest loss of life occurred in a 17-vehicle crash\u20147 of which caught fire\u2014caused by hydroplaning along I-65 in Butler County;[69] ten people died in the collisions.[70] The Butler County coroner stated the accident occurred along a downhill turn along the highway notorious for hydroplaning incidents.[71] A van carrying nine people to the Tallapoosa County Girls Ranch, a home for abused, neglected, or abandoned girls was involved in the incident. Four residents, two guests, and two of the director's children died in the crash and subsequent fire; the children killed were from ages 3 to 17. The Ranch's director survived and was hospitalized in serious condition. A 29-year-old man and his 9-month-old daughter died in another vehicle involved in the crash.[71] Alabama Power deployed more than 200 linemen to restore service, as soon as the storm passed. Power was restored to \"all customers that could safely accept it\" by the evening of June\u00a020.[63] Governor Kay Ivey declared a state of emergency for Baldwin, Butler, Cherokee, DeKalb, Escambia, Mobile, Monroe, and Tuscaloosa counties and declared East Brewton a disaster area, though federal funding would not be available pending an assessment of damage.[56][72][73] The Alabama Department of Revenue provided tax relief to residents and businesses the aforementioned counties.[74] In East Brewton, the American Red Cross provided food to victims and local churches provided cleanup supplies.[75] GoFundMe established a hub page for donations relating to Tropical Storm Claudette.[69] The city of Tuscaloosa approved $500,000 in funds for infrastructure repair and a further $750,000 would come from a recently implemented 1 cent sales tax. As of July\u00a06, damage assessments across Alabama did not reach the $7.5\u00a0million threshold required for federal disaster assistance.[61] The United States Department of Agriculture provided aid to farmers and ranchers across the state.[76] Without federal aid available, the Government of Escambia County used millions of dollars of its own funds to assist relief efforts from the EF2 tornado.[77]"

        "content": "Claudette produced a modest storm surge in southeastern Louisiana, owing to weaker onshore winds compared to coastal Mississippi, with peak heights generally remaining below 3\u00a0ft (0.91\u00a0m). A peak inundation of 3.2\u00a0ft (0.98\u00a0m) was measured in Shell Beach.[1] Salt water flooding remained outside of the New Orleans federal levee system.[78] Claudette's asymmetrical structure led to the strongest winds remaining east of the circulation center and away from Louisiana, despite the core itself crossing the state. Wind generally remained below tropical storm-force,[1] though some areas in Jefferson, Plaquemines, and St. Tammany parishes observed gusts above this threshold.[79][80][81] The greatest effects were related to heavy rainfall east of New Orleans in southeastern St. Tammany Parish. There, accumulations averaged 8 to 10\u00a0in (200 to 250\u00a0mm) with a peak observation of 11.03\u00a0in (280\u00a0mm) a few miles southeast of Slidell.[1][79] Flash flooding in and around the community affected about 200\u00a0homes, half of which sustained minor damage.[79] Dozens of roads were closed due to high water, with at least 60 vehicles abandoned across the town, and emergency services conducted several high-water rescues.[79][82] Damage across Slidell was regarded as the worst since Hurricane Katrina in 2005.[83] Mississippi saw the greatest storm surge along the Gulf Coast, with a peak of 5.9\u00a0ft (1.8\u00a0m) in Bay St. Louis, which equated to a maximum inundation of 4.4\u00a0ft (1.3\u00a0m). Elsewhere in the state, surge values averaged 2 to 4\u00a0ft (0.61 to 1.22\u00a0m). Rainfall was particularly heavy in southern counties, an extension of the rainband that produced the greatest totals in Louisiana. These areas saw more than 10\u00a0in (250\u00a0mm) of rain, peaking at 15.28\u00a0in (388\u00a0mm) near Gulfport.[1] Flooding was most severe in Hancock County where approximately 100 homes were affected. High water covered dozens of roads and several people required rescue in Kiln after ignoring barricades.[84] Widespread flooding also occurred in Jackson and Pear River counties; numerous roads were shut down across both counties, two people required rescue in Pascagoula, and cars were stranded in Poplarville.[85][86] Portions of U.S. Route 90 were rendered impassable in Biloxi and Gulfport. The Biloxi and Wolf rivers saw water reach moderate flood stage. Winds were greatest along coastal areas, with gusts reaching 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) around Gulfport.[87] These winds caused little damage, primarily limited to downed tree branches and some power outages.[85][87] Four tornadoes touched down in the state, one of which was rated EF1 (the other three were rated EF0), each causing relatively limited damage.[1] Effects from Tropical Depression Claudette in Georgia were largely limited to moderate to heavy rain, with the greatest accumulations centered near the Alabama border. Peak totals of 8\u00a0in (200\u00a0mm) were estimated in Chattooga County, resulting in localized flash flooding. Multiple roads were flooded in Summerville, including portions of State Routes 27 and 48. Some businesses were inundated and damage in the county was estimated at $75,000.[88] An EF1 tornado caused relatively minor damage, primarily relegated to snapped and uprooted trees, along a 30\u00a0mi (48\u00a0km) path across rural areas of Early, Clay, and Randolph counties.[1][89] The rain forced the Atlanta Braves to postpone a game against the Saint Louis Cardinals.[90] Claudette traversed South Carolina as a tropical depression on June\u00a020, bringing modest rainfall to parts of the state. Accumulations were greatest across The Midlands, with totals generally reaching 4\u00a0in (100\u00a0mm);[91] a peak of 5.71\u00a0in (145\u00a0mm) was observed in Aiken.[1] Residents in Wagener reported a funnel cloud; however, later surveys by the NWS determined it did not reach the ground.[92] As Claudette reintensified on approach to oceanfall on June\u00a020\u201321, tropical storm-force winds were observed in eastern coastal communities. Sustained winds at the Isle of Palms pier reached 46\u00a0mph (74\u00a0km/h) with gusts to 62\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h).[1] Some trees fell onto roadways across the state.[93] Claudette had limited impact in North Carolina, with the most notable damage coming from a weak tornado near Somerset. A negligible storm surge occurred along the Pamlico Sound, peaking at 1.28\u00a0ft (0.39\u00a0m) in Oregon Inlet; surges along Atlantic-facing coastlines did not exceed 1\u00a0ft (0.30\u00a0m). Multiple coastal areas saw tropical storm-force winds, with Hatteras Island seeing sustained winds up to 46\u00a0mph (74\u00a0km/h) while rainfall peaked at 4.1\u00a0in (100\u00a0mm) near Waxhaw.[1] Rip currents produced by the storm were felt in the Texas Coastal Bend. Three children were pulled to sea off North Padre Island and were rescued safely.[94] Minor rainfall associated with Claudette was also reported in Tennessee and Virginia.[51] Localized flash flooding occurred in southeastern Virginia, with a portion of Interstate 64 temporarily shut down.[95]"

The average rainfall of 415\u00a0mm (16.3\u00a0in) was double the long-term level, with the media reporting it as \"Freak rain\".[12] On 15 June, more than 300 places in Shenzhen were submerged underwater.[6] Floods have forced more than 1.66 million people to evacuate, caused 67,000 houses to collapse, and killed 63 people.[1][13]  Three days later officials in Guangdong warned of a \"black June\" as high tides, rain and rivers threatened levees.  Across the region, 169 were reported killed in the floods.[2] On 21 June, the main precipitation areas include the Huai River valleys, Guizhou, Sichuan and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Heavy rain follow in Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, Hubei, Chongqing, Sichuan, Qinghai, and Inner Mongolia.[14]  At the end of the month, 252 people were killed in the rainstorms and flooding.[15]"

The North Lantau Highway was blocked, for the first and so far the only time since its opening in 1997, by a landslide.[16] Land traffic to the villages of Tai O was cut off, forcing the government to increase the frequency of ferries to and from the villages. Newspaper vendors in the streets reported that the water came very fast, flooding the area within five minutes to thigh-deep level (over-the-knee). One of the landslides killed two people in Tuen Mun. The Hong Kong Observatory thus changed the \"amber rainstorm\" warning to a \"black rainstorm\" warning.[16]"

The fifth tropical cyclone of the 1896 Atlantic hurricane season, it formed on October 7 in the southern Gulf of Mexico, and caused minor damage in Florida while crossing the state two days later. From October 10 through 13, the hurricane drifted northeastward along the coast, reaching its peak intensity as the equivalence of a Category 2 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir\u2013Simpson scale. The hurricane subjected many areas along the East Coast to days of high seas and damaging northeasterly winds, which halted shipping operations. The Mid-Atlantic coastline experienced flooding storm tides that submerged and heavily eroded Cobb's Island, part of the Virginia Barrier Islands. Hotels and cottages there were extensively damaged, and the hurricane brought about the end of the island's stint as a popular summer resort. Along the Jersey Shore, low-lying railroads were flooded, boardwalks were destroyed, and many beach houses sustained damage. The hurricane did $200,000 in damage to coastal installations on New York's Coney Island. To the north, wind gusts as high as 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) affected eastern New England. Four sailors died in two maritime incidents attributed to the hurricane, and overall damage amounted to $500,000."

        "content": "The fifth documented tropical cyclone of the 1896 season was first noted in the southern Gulf of Mexico as a weak tropical storm on October 7.[1] It tracked toward the east-northeast and made landfall in a sparely populated region of Southwest Florida around 00:02 UTC on October 9. The storm crossed the Florida Peninsula and emerged over open water near Sebastian.[1][2] Turning more northeastward, the storm gradually intensified and achieved hurricane intensity on October 10.[1] By that evening, hurricane warnings were hoisted along the East Coast of the United States from Jacksonville, Florida to Boston, Massachusetts.[3] The unusually slow-moving hurricane attained its peak intensity early on October 11, with estimated maximum sustained winds of 100\u00a0mph (155\u00a0km/h). Shortly thereafter, it made its closest approach to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, passing roughly 115\u00a0mi (185\u00a0km) to the southeast.[1] For several days, the hurricane brushed the coast from Virginia to southern New England with hurricane-force wind gusts.[3] The storm began to weaken as it slowly gained latitude. Unnseasonably cool temperatures were recorded in New York City as the system passed offshore, suggesting that it had begun losing its tropical characteristics.[3] By 00:00 UTC on October 14, the storm completed its transition into an extratropical cyclone,[1] and no winds stronger than tropical storm-force were observed north of 41\u00b0N.[4] A little over a day later, the hurricane's extratropical remnants struck the coast of central Nova Scotia before dissipating on October 16.[1]"

        "content": "The relatively weak storm caused little damage upon landfall in Florida, though some coastal flooding occurred near Punta Gorda. An apparent tornado north of the storm's track destroyed a home and an outbuilding.[2][5] Northeasterly gales and high tides affected northeastern portions of the state, including Fernandina, where lumber docks were flooded and parts of the Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad were washed out. Street flooding also plagued St. Augustine, but no major damage was reported there.[6] Strong northerly gales affected the Outer Banks of North Carolina for three days, peaking at 72\u00a0mph (116\u00a0km/h) in Kitty Hawk on October 11.[7] Winds reached 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) along the Virginia Capes and 40\u00a0mph (65\u00a0km/h) farther west at Norfolk. Just inside the capes, a cargo ship called the Henry A. Litchfield ran aground on October 12. Storm surge flooding inundated the Cape Henry Light keeper's house and washed away telegraph poles, while severe damage was reported in Virginia Beach.[8] There, high waves destroyed fishing nets and crumbled bulkheads, but advance warning of the storm allowed most vessels to safely ride out the storm in port.[9] Near Norfolk, floodwaters damaged the banks of the Dismal Swamp Canal to the point of collapse in some spots.[8] The storm inundated the Virginia Barrier Islands, completely covering Cobb's Island, a popular summer resort, to a depth of at least 1\u00a0ft (0.30\u00a0m). Pounding waves, reportedly 40\u00a0ft (12\u00a0m) high, crushed some cottages and partially buried others in sand, while depositing numerous boats in the middle of the island.[10] United States Life-Saving Service crews rescued two women in imminent danger of being swept out to sea. As waters rose, residents fled to the upper stories of their homes to await rescue by lifeguards. The Cobb's Island Hotel was a complete loss,[8] and almost every building on the island sustained some degree of damage. The storm claimed about 50 acres (20\u00a0ha) of Cobb's Island, reducing its size by two-thirds; subsequently, the inhabitants abandoned the island, and its use as a resort ended.[10] Due to the slow-moving nature of the hurricane, the flooding persisted for two days before receding.[8] Along the coast of Delaware near Cape Henlopen, the schooner Luther A. Roby was driven aground and broken up by the pounding surf. Three crew members died in the wreck, and five others safely reached shore with the help of rescue workers.[11] Offshore, the steamship Baron Innerdale was damaged in the storm, and one of the crew members was swept overboard.[12] The worst effects were observed along the Northeastern shoreline from New Jersey to New England. In these areas, coastal flooding and persistent gales inflicted an estimated $500,000 in damage to beachfront property. Many small houses, seawalls, wharves, and piers were damaged or destroyed.[5][11] Wind gusts along the Jersey Shore reached 75\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h), which unroofed buildings and blew summer cottages off their foundations.[13]  Homes and businesses in Asbury Park were bombarded by the debris from a half-mile stretch of boardwalk that was torn apart.[11] Thousands of spectators lined the shoreline there to watch the enormous waves.[13] One of the premier hotels in Sea Isle City was demolished,[11] along with numerous cottages.[13] The storm heavily flooded streets in the city and damaged yachts along the coast.[6] Just south of Sea Isle City, the steamer Spartan went ashore after her captain spent 30 hours fighting the storm at the wheel.[12] In Atlantic City, one amusement pier was heavily damaged by an impact from the dislodged wreckage of a previously sunk schooner,[14] while another was broken up by the surf.[11] Winds in Atlantic City gusted to 55\u00a0mph (90\u00a0km/h), and floodwaters surrounded some cottages, forcing residents to leave their homes by boat. The railway to Ocean City was washed out, leaving the community temporarily isolated. Railroad tracks were also submerged to the south at Cape May.[6] Farther inland, the winds brought down some few trees and overhead wires.[15] In Millville, high tides caused the Maurice River to overflow and destroy crops in bordering fields.[16] Hog Island, a barrier island that was mostly washed away by the 1893 New York hurricane,[17] was further eroded by the rough seas. Beaches, pavilions, bath houses, and boardwalks on Coney Island incurred significant damage, with many small buildings along Brighton Beach being \"picked up bodily and carried away.\"[13] Damage on Coney Island was expected to cost at least $200,000.[12] In Far Rockaway, Queens, beachfront houses built on stilts were leveled, while significant flooding extended well inland; multiple hotels were inundated by at least 2\u00a0ft (0.61\u00a0m) of water.[13] In New England, the storm kept all vessels at port for several days.[13] The strongest recorded winds on land occurred on Block Island, Rhode Island, where gusts reached 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h). Elsewhere, winds peaked at 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) on Nantucket, Massachusetts, and 52\u00a0mph (84\u00a0km/h) at Boston.[3] The storm partially destroyed a seawall and shifted a building off its foundation in Narragansett Pier, Rhode Island.[18] Near South Boston, the storm broke 15 yachts from their moorings and tossed them ashore, sinking several others.[19] The schooner Alsatin sank off Bakers Island; her crew of four was rescued by a passing steamer.[20] At Cohasset, a new lifeboat station constructed by the Massachusetts Humane Society was destroyed.[16] As the former hurricane moved over Nova Scotia, Halifax experienced gusty winds and moderate rainfall.[21]"

        "content": "On August\u00a08, an area of convection, or thunderstorms, formed to the west-northwest of Palau, with a weak circulation connected to the monsoon trough. The system had good outflow, although it was initially within an area of increasing moderate wind shear, which limited organization. Convection increased, and although the circulation was exposed, the shear later decreased enough for the system to organize into a tropical depression on August\u00a010;[1] the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)[nb 2] labeled it as Tropical Depression 18W,[3][nb 3] the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) [nb 4] labeled it as an unnumbered depression, and the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) gave it the name Tropical Depression Milenyo.[1] Upon developing, the depression was located in an area of weak steering currents,[3] still connected to the monsoon rough,[1] and it moved slowly to the west-northwest.[3] The thunderstorms continued to be sheared to the west of the circulation, which limited strengthening. On August\u00a012, the JTWC briefly upgraded the system to a tropical storm after a temporary increase in thunderstorms, although the system soon weakened.[1] A ridge to the north caused a general westward track toward the Philippines.[3] With a fully exposed circulation,[1] the depression made landfall at 0800\u00a0UTC on August\u00a013 near Infanta on the Philippine island of Luzon. It soon dissipated due to continued shear and land interaction.[3] The remnants continued westward into the South China Sea, and PAGASA and JMA both discontinued advisories early on August\u00a014. However, on August\u00a015, a tropical depression re-developed halfway between Vietnam and the Philippines, with a circulation exposed from the convection due to moderate wind shear.[1] That day, the JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Depression 20W.[3] After redevelopment, wind shear continued to be a problem, with convection located southwest of the center.[1] Early on August\u00a017, a pulse in the monsoon increased thunderstorms and allowed the system to become better organized.[3] The convection became more concentrated and the circulation less exposed.[1] As a result, the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Vongfong early on August\u00a018, still in the central South China Sea.[4] Around that time, the storm began moving more quickly to the northwest due to a developing ridge to its northeast.[1] Although the JMA estimated peak 10\u2013minute sustained winds of only 75\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph),[4] the JTWC assessed Vongfong as continuing to intensify to peak 1\u2013minute winds of 100\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph), early on August\u00a019.[3] By that time, the storm was near Hainan, and at 1240\u00a0UTC that day, Vongfong made landfall in southern China near Wuchuan, Guangdong. It quickly weakened over land,[1] dissipating early on August\u00a020 to the west of Guilin.[4]"

A vessel capsized offshore Antique Province, and its crew of 15 was rescued.[7] At least six people died due to electrocution, after downed power lines touched floodwaters. The storm spawned a tornado and caused landslides in Negros Oriental.[8] The storm killed 35\u00a0people in the country and injured 22\u00a0others. Damage was estimated at $3.3\u00a0million (\u20b1172\u00a0million 2002\u00a0PHP).[9][nb 5] Milenyo was the final storm to be named by PAGASA during 2002.[11] On August\u00a017, the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) issued standby signal number 1 due to the storm's reformation in the South China Sea. Vongfong made landfall west of the territory, although its outer rainbands spread across the region.[12] Slick roads contributed to a traffic accident in Sai Kung in which one person was killed.[13] Rainfall in Hong Kong reached 133\u00a0mm (5.2\u00a0in) in the town of Kwai Chung. The rainbands also produced gusty winds; sustained winds peaked at 75\u00a0km/h (47\u00a0mph), with gusts to 110\u00a0km/h (68\u00a0mph) at the mountain peak of Tai Mo Shan. While moving ashore, Vongfong produced a storm surge of 0.48\u00a0m (1.6\u00a0ft) in Shek Pik. The storm downed a few trees across the territory, and a fallen branch injured one man. Another person was injured by a damaged awning.[12] In Hainan, the threat from Vongfong prompted officials to close the primary airport and to restrict sea traffic with Guangdong.[12] As a result, 113\u00a0flights were delayed, stranding more than 3,000\u00a0people.[14] On the island, rainfall reached as high as 240\u00a0mm (9.4\u00a0in) in Haikou over a three-day period. In the city, the storm downed 2,145\u00a0trees, and damage was estimated at $456,000 (\u00a53.8\u00a0million CNY.[1][nb 6] In the midst of a deadly flooding season across China, including Tropical Storm Kammuri that affected the region only 12\u00a0days earlier,[16] Vongfong brought additionally heavy rainfall to southwestern China; totals in Guangdong peaked at 222.6\u00a0mm (8.76\u00a0in) in Zhanjiang, and in Guangxi, rainfall reached 124\u00a0mm (4.9\u00a0in) in a nine-hour period in Bobai County.[1] The storm washed a boat ashore about 60\u00a0km (37\u00a0mi) southwest of Hong Kong, although the passengers were rescued.[12] Rains spread as far north as Hunan, where previous flooding prompted a state of emergency.[17] In neighboring Jiangxi, floods caused the Yangtze River to crest above warning levels in Jiujiang. River levels also rose in Liuzhou in Guangxi.[18] Wind gusts as strong as 144\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph) were reported in Zhanjiang, and a station in Guangxi reported gusts to 115\u00a0km/h (71\u00a0mph).[1] The storm caused flooding and landslides that damaged thousands of houses. Some areas lost electricity during the storm,[12] and the storm disrupted traffic in the region.[19] Vongfong flooded 46,000\u00a0ha (110,000 acres) of crop fields, and storm flooding also damaged hundreds of reservoirs.[19] Vongfong destroyed 5,600\u00a0houses in Guangdong, many of them in Zhanjiang, and provincial damage there was estimated at $46\u00a0million (\u00a5382\u00a0million CNY).[1] In Guangxi, the storm killed twelve people,[1] eight due to landslides.[12] At least 400\u00a0houses were destroyed in Guangxi,[1] and damage in the province was estimated at over $36.2\u00a0million (\u00a5300\u00a0million CNY).[12]"

Forming out of a tropical disturbance early on January\u00a014, Urmil quickly intensified before weakening just as quickly. The intensification was a result of the main convective banding feature wrapping around the center of circulation. However, the combination of high wind shear and the rapid movement of the cyclone caused convection to become separated from the center.

Forming in the wake of Tropical Cyclone Tam, the disturbance rapidly organized within an environment of favorable diffulence aloft, warm waters (29\u00b0C; 84.2\u00b0F), and moderate wind shear.[2] Six hours later, RSMC Nadi upgraded 06F to a tropical cyclone and gave it the name Urmil while it was situated near Niuatoputapu, Tonga.[1] Shortly after, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert as the storm quickly traveled towards the south-southeast. Around 0600\u00a0UTC on January\u00a014, the JTWC classified Urmil as Tropical Cyclone 07P.[3] During the following six hours, Urmil underwent explosive deepening as the main feeder band wrapped around the center of circulation.[2] After the brief period of intensification, the storm reached its peak intensity with winds of 110\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph) according to both the RSMC Nadi and the JTWC, making it a high-end Category 2 cyclone on the Australian Scale.[1][3] The highly favorable environment, in combination with the fast forward motion of the storm, allowed Urmil to rapidly reach its peak intensity, despite wind shear reaching 35\u00a0km/h (25\u00a0mph).[2] However, as quickly as the storm strengthened, it began to weaken as convection weakened.[3] With both wind shear and forward motion increasing, the cyclone quickly became disorganized. Around 0000\u00a0UTC on January\u00a015, the center of circulation was devoid of shower and thunderstorm activity. About six hours later, Urmil transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and was subsequently absorbed into the mid-latitude westerlies.[2]"

        "content": "This is an accepted version of this page  The Indus (/\u02c8\u026and\u0259s/ IN-d\u0259s) is a transboundary river of Asia and a trans-Himalayan river of South and Central Asia.[6] The 3,180\u00a0km (1,980\u00a0mi)[3] river rises in mountain springs northeast of Mount Kailash in Western Tibet, flows northwest through the disputed region of Kashmir,[7] bends sharply to the left after the Nanga Parbat massif, and flows south-by-southwest through Pakistan, before emptying into the Arabian Sea near the port city of Karachi.[1][8] The river has a total drainage area of circa 1,120,000\u00a0km2 (430,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[3] Its estimated annual flow is around 175\u00a0km3/a (5,500\u00a0m3/s), making it one of the 50 largest rivers in the world in terms of average annual flow.[9] Its left-bank tributary in Ladakh is the Zanskar River, and its left-bank tributary in the plains is the Panjnad River which is formed by the successive confluences of the five Punjab rivers, namely the Chenab, Jhelum, Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej rivers. Its principal right-bank tributaries are the Shyok, Gilgit, Kabul, Kurram, and Gomal rivers. Beginning in a mountain spring and fed with glaciers and rivers in the Himalayan, Karakoram, and Hindu Kush ranges, the river supports the ecosystems of temperate forests, plains, and arid countryside. The northern part of the Indus Valley, with its tributaries, forms the Punjab region of South Asia, while the lower course of the river ends in a large delta in the southern Sindh province of Pakistan. The river has historically been important to many cultures of the region. The 3rd millennium BC saw the rise of Indus Valley Civilisation, a major urban civilization of the Bronze Age. During the 2nd millennium BC, the Punjab region was mentioned in the Rigveda hymns as Sapta Sindhu and in the Avesta religious texts as Hapta H\u0259ndu (both terms meaning \"seven rivers\"). Early historical kingdoms that arose in the Indus Valley include Gandh\u0101ra, and the Ror dynasty of Sauv\u012bra. The Indus River came into the knowledge of the Western world early in the classical period, when King Darius of Persia sent his Greek subject Scylax of Caryanda to explore the river, c.\u2009515\u00a0BC."

        "content": "The Indus River provides key water resources for Pakistan's economy \u2013 especially the breadbasket of Punjab province, which accounts for most of the nation's agricultural production, and Sindh. The word Punjab means \"land of five rivers\" and the five rivers are Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Beas and Sutlej, all of which finally flow into the Indus. The Indus also supports many heavy industries and provides the main supply of potable water in Pakistan. The total length of the river varies in different sources. The length used in this article is 3,180\u00a0km (1,980\u00a0mi), taken from the Himalayan Climate and Water Atlas (2015).[3] Historically, the 1909 The Imperial Gazetteer of India gave it as \"just over 1,800 miles\".[23] A shorter figure of 2,880\u00a0km (1,790\u00a0mi) has been widely used in modern sources, as has the one of 3,180\u00a0km (1,980\u00a0mi). The modern Encyclopedia Britannica was originally published in 1999 with the shorter measurement, but was updated in 2015 to use the longer measurement.[1] Both lengths are commonly found in modern publications; in some cases, both measurements can be found within the same work.[24] An extended figure of circa 3,600\u00a0km (2,200\u00a0mi) was announced by a Chinese research group in 2011, based on a comprehensive remeasurement from satellite imagery, and a ground expedition to identify an alternative source point, but detailed analysis has not yet been published.[25] The ultimate source of the Indus is in Tibet, but there is some debate about the exact source. The traditional source of the river is the S\u00eangg\u00ea Kanbab (S\u00eangg\u00ea Zangbo) or \"Lion's Mouth\", a perennial spring not far from the sacred Mount Kailash, marked by a long low line of Tibetan chortens. There are several other tributaries nearby, which may form a longer stream than S\u00eangg\u00ea Kanbab, but unlike the S\u00eangg\u00ea Kanbab, are all dependent on snowmelt. The Zanskar River, which flows into the Indus in Ladakh, has a greater volume of water than the Indus itself before that point.[26] An alternative reckoning begins the river around 300\u00a0km further upstream, at the confluence of the S\u00eangg\u00ea Zangbo and Gar Tsangpo rivers, which drain the Nganglong Kangri and Gangdise Shan (Gang Rinpoche, Mt. Kailash) mountain ranges. The 2011 remeasurement suggested the source was a small lake northeast of Mount Kailash, rather than either of the two points previously used.[25] The Indus then flows northwest through Ladakh (Indian-administered Kashmir) and Baltistan and Gilgit (Pakistan-administered Kashmir), just south of the Karakoram range. The Shyok, Shigar and Gilgit rivers carry glacial waters into the main river. It gradually bends to the south and descends into the Punjab plains at Kalabagh, Pakistan. The Indus passes gigantic gorges 4,500\u20135,200 metres (15,000\u201317,000\u00a0ft) deep near the Nanga Parbat massif. It flows swiftly across Hazara and is dammed at the Tarbela Reservoir. The Kabul River joins it near Attock. The remainder of its route to the sea is in the plains of the Punjab[27] and Sindh, where the flow of the river becomes slow and highly braided. It is joined by the Panjnad at Mithankot. Beyond this confluence, the river, at one time, was named the Satnad River (sat = \"seven\", nad\u012b = \"river\"), as the river now carried the waters of the Kabul River, the Indus River and the five Punjab rivers. Passing by Jamshoro, it ends in a large delta to the South of Thatta in the Sindh province of Pakistan. The Indus is one of the few rivers in the world to exhibit a tidal bore. The Indus system is largely fed by the snow and glaciers of the Himalayas, Karakoram and the Hindu Kush ranges. The flow of the river is also determined by the seasons \u2013 it diminishes greatly in the winter while flooding its banks in the monsoon months from July to September. There is also evidence of a steady shift in the course of the river since prehistoric times \u2013 it deviated westwards from flowing into the Rann of Kutch and adjoining Banni grasslands after the 1816 earthquake.[28][29] As of 2011[update], Indus water flows in to the Rann of Kutch during its floods breaching flood banks.[30]"

        "content": "The major cities of the Indus Valley Civilisation, such as Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, date back to around 3300\u00a0BC, and represent some of the largest human habitations of the ancient world. The Indus Valley Civilisation extended from across northeast Afghanistan to Pakistan and northwest India,[31] with an upward reach from east of the Jhelum River to Ropar on the upper Sutlej. The coastal settlements extended from Sutkagan Dor at the Pakistan-Iran border to Kutch in modern Gujarat, India. There is an Indus site on the Amu Darya at Shortughai in northern Afghanistan, and the Indus site Alamgirpur at the Hindon River is located only 28\u00a0km (17\u00a0mi) from Delhi. As of now, over 1,052 cities and settlements have been found, mainly in the general region of the Ghaggar-Hakra River and its tributaries. Among the settlements were the major urban centres of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, as well as Lothal, Dholavira, Ganeriwala, and Rakhigarhi. Only 40 Indus Valley sites have been discovered on the Indus and its tributaries.[32] However, it is notable that majority of the Indus script seals and inscribed objects discovered were found at sites along the Indus river.[a][33][34] Most scholars believe that settlements of Gandhara grave culture of the early Indo-Aryans flourished in Gandhara from 1700\u00a0BC to 600\u00a0BC, when Mohenjo-daro and Harappa had already been abandoned. The Rigveda describes several rivers, including one named \"Sindhu\". The Rigvedic \"Sindhu\" is thought to be the present-day Indus River. It is attested 176 times in its text, 94 times in the plural, and most often used in the generic sense of \"river\". In the Rigveda, notably in the later hymns, the meaning of the word is narrowed to refer to the Indus river in particular; for example, in the list of rivers mentioned in the hymn of Nadistuti sukta. The Rigvedic hymns apply a feminine gender to all the rivers mentioned therein, except for the Brahmaputra. The word \"India\" is derived from the Indus River. In ancient times, \"India\" initially referred to those regions immediately along the east bank of the Indus, where are Punjab and Sindh now but by 300\u00a0BC, Greek writers including Herodotus and Megasthenes were applying the term to the entire subcontinent that extends much farther eastward.[35][36] The lower basin of the Indus forms a natural boundary between the Iranian Plateau and the Indian subcontinent; this region embraces all or parts of the Pakistani provinces Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab and Sindh and the countries Afghanistan and India. The first West Eurasian empire to annex the Indus Valley was the Persian Empire, during the reign of Darius the Great. During his reign, the Greek explorer Scylax of Caryanda was commissioned to explore the course of the Indus. It was crossed by the invading armies of Alexander. Still, after his Macedonians conquered the west bank\u2014joining it to the Hellenic world, they elected to retreat along the southern course of the river, ending Alexander's Asian campaign. Alexander's admiral Nearchus set out from the Indus Delta to explore the Persian Gulf, until reaching the Tigris. The Indus Valley was later dominated by the Mauryan and Kushan Empires, Indo-Greek Kingdoms, Indo-Scythians and Hepthalites. Over several centuries Muslim armies of Muhammad ibn al-Qasim, Mahmud of Ghazni, Muhammad of Ghor, Timur and Babur crossed the river to invade Sindh and Punjab, providing a gateway to the Indian subcontinent."

The Indus River feeds the Indus submarine fan, which is the second largest sediment body on Earth.[37] It consists of around 5\u00a0million cubic kilometres of material eroded from the mountains. Studies of the sediment in the modern river indicate that the Karakoram Mountains in northern Pakistan and India are the single most important source of material, with the Himalayas providing the next largest contribution, mostly via the large rivers of the Punjab (Jhelum, Ravi, Chenab, Beas and Sutlej). Analysis of sediments from the Arabian Sea has demonstrated that before five million years ago the Indus was not connected to these Punjab rivers which instead flowed east into the Ganga and were captured after that time.[38] Earlier work showed that sand and silt from western Tibet was reaching the Arabian Sea by 45\u00a0million years ago, implying the existence of an ancient Indus River by that time.[39] The delta of this proto-Indus river has subsequently been found in the Katawaz Basin, on the Afghan-Pakistan border. In the Nanga Parbat region, the massive amounts of erosion due to the Indus river following the capture and rerouting through that area are thought to bring middle and lower crustal rocks to the surface.[40] In November 2011, satellite images showed that the Indus river had re-entered India and was feeding the Great Rann of Kutch, Little Rann of Kutch and a lake near Ahmedabad known as Nal Sarovar.[30] Heavy rains had left the river basin along with the Lake Manchar, Lake Hemal and Kalri Lake (all in modern-day Pakistan) inundated. This happened two centuries after the Indus river shifted its course westwards following the 1819 Rann of Kutch earthquake. The Induan Age at the start of the Triassic Period of geological time is named for the Indus region."

        "content": "The Indus River basin has high diversity, being the home of more than 180 freshwater fish species,[45] including 22 which are found nowhere else.[41] Fish also played a major role in earlier cultures of the region, including the ancient Indus Valley Civilisation where depictions of fish were frequent. The Indus script has a commonly used fish sign, which in its various forms may simply have meant \"fish\", or referred to stars or gods.[46] In the uppermost, highest part of the Indus River basin there are relatively few genera and species: Diptychus, Ptychobarbus, Schizopyge, Schizopygopsis and Schizothorax snowtrout, Triplophysa loaches, and the catfish Glyptosternon reticulatum.[45] Going downstream these are soon joined by the golden mahseer Tor putitora (alternatively T. macrolepis, although it often is regarded as a synonym of T. putitora) and Schistura loaches. Downriver from around Thakot, Tarbela, the Kabul\u2013Indus river confluence, Attock Khurd and Peshawar the diversity rises strongly, including many cyprinids (Amblypharyngodon, Aspidoparia, Barilius, Chela, Cirrhinus, Crossocheilus, Cyprinion, Danio, Devario, Esomus, Garra, Labeo, Naziritor, Osteobrama, Pethia, Puntius, Rasbora, Salmophasia, Securicula and Systomus), true loaches (Botia and Lepidocephalus), stone loaches (Acanthocobitis and Nemacheilus), ailiid catfish (Clupisoma), bagridae catfish (Batasio, Mystus, Rita and Sperata), airsac catfish (Heteropneustes), schilbid catfish (Eutropiichthys), silurid catfish (Ompok and Wallago), sisorid catfish (Bagarius, Gagata, Glyptothorax and Sisor), gouramis (Trichogaster), nandid leaffish (Nandus), snakeheads (Channa), spiny eel (Macrognathus and Mastacembelus), knifefish (Notopterus), glassfish (Chanda and Parambassis), clupeids (Gudusia), needlefish (Xenentodon) and gobies (Glossogobius), as well as a few introduced species.[45] As the altitude further declines the Indus basin becomes overall quite slow-flowing as it passes through the Punjab Plain. Major carp become common, and chameleonfish (Badis), mullet (Sicamugil) and swamp eel (Monopterus) appear.[45] In some upland lakes and tributaries of the Punjab region snow trout and mahseer are still common, but once the Indus basin reaches its lower plain the former group is absent and the latter are rare.[45] Many of the species of the middle sections of the Indus basin are also present in the lower. Notable examples of genera that are present in the lower plain but generally not elsewhere in the Indus River basin are the Aphanius pupfish, Aplocheilus killifish, palla fish (Tenualosa ilisha), catla (Labeo catla), rohu (Labeo rohita) and Cirrhinus mrigala.[45] The lowermost part of the river and its delta are home to freshwater fish, but also several brackish and marine species.[45] This includes pomfret and prawns. The large delta has been recognized by conservationists as an important ecological region. Here, the river turns into many marshes, streams and creeks and meets the sea at shallow levels. Palla fish (Tenualosa ilisha) of the river is a delicacy for people living along the river. The population of fish in the river is moderately high, with Sukkur, Thatta, and Kotri being the major fishing centres \u2013 all in the lower Sindh course. As a result, damming and irrigation have made fish farming an important economic activity."

        "content": "The Indus is the most important supplier of water resources to the Punjab and Sindh plains \u2013 it forms the backbone of agriculture and food production in Pakistan. The river is especially critical since rainfall is meagre in the lower Indus valley. Irrigation canals were first built by the people of the Indus Valley civilisation, and later by the engineers of the Kushan Empire and the Mughal Empire. Modern irrigation was introduced by the British East India Company in 1850 \u2013 the construction of modern canals accompanied with the restoration of old canals. The British supervised the construction of one of the most complex irrigation networks in the world. The Guddu Barrage is 1,350\u00a0m (4,430\u00a0ft) long \u2013 irrigating Sukkur, Jacobabad, Larkana and Kalat. The Sukkur Barrage serves over 20,000\u00a0km2 (7,700\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). After Pakistan came into existence, a water control treaty signed between India and Pakistan in 1960 guaranteed that Pakistan would receive water from the Indus River and its two tributaries the Jhelum River and the Chenab River independently of upstream control by India.[47] The Indus Basin Project consisted primarily of the construction of two main dams, the Mangla Dam built on the Jhelum River and the Tarbela Dam constructed on the Indus River, together with their subsidiary dams.[48] The Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority undertook the construction of the Chashma-Jhelum link canal \u2013 linking the waters of the Indus and Jhelum rivers \u2013 extending water supplies to the regions of Bahawalpur and Multan. Pakistan constructed the Tarbela Dam near Rawalpindi \u2013 standing 2,743 metres (9,000\u00a0ft) long and 143 metres (470\u00a0ft) high, with an 80-kilometre (50\u00a0mi) long reservoir. It supports the Chashma Barrage near Dera Ismail Khan for irrigation use and flood control and the Taunsa Barrage near Dera Ghazi Khan which also produces 100,000\u00a0kilowatts of electricity. The Kotri Barrage near Hyderabad is 915 metres (3,000\u00a0ft) long and provides additional water supplies for Karachi. The extensive linking of tributaries with the Indus has helped spread water resources to the valley of Peshawar, in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The extensive irrigation and dam projects provide the basis for Pakistan's large production of crops such as cotton, sugarcane and wheat. The dams also generate electricity for heavy industries and urban centres."

The Indus Basin Irrigation System is the \"largest contiguous irrigation system developed over the past 140 years\" anywhere in the world.[55] This has reduced the flow of water and by 2018, the average annual flow of water below the Kotri barrage was 33\u00a0billion cubic metres (43\u00d710^9\u00a0cu\u00a0yd),[56] and annual amount of silt discharged was estimated at 100\u00a0million tonnes (98\u00d710^6 long tons).[citation needed] As a result, the 2010 Pakistan floods were considered \"good news\" for the ecosystem and population of the river delta as they brought much-needed fresh water.[57][58] Any further utilization of the river basin water is not economically feasible.[59][60] Vegetation and wildlife of the Indus delta are threatened by the reduced inflow of fresh water, along with extensive deforestation, industrial pollution and global warming. Damming has also isolated the delta population of Indus River dolphins from those further upstream.[61] Large-scale diversion of the river's water for irrigation has raised far-reaching issues. Sediment clogging from poor maintenance of canals has affected agricultural production and vegetation on numerous occasions. Irrigation itself is increasing soil salinization, reducing crop yields and in some cases rendering farmland useless for cultivation.[62]"

The right bank side is also leveed from Guddu barrage to Lake Manchar.[82] In response to the levees construction, the river has been aggrading rapidly over the last 20 years leading to breaches upstream of barrages and inundation of large areas.[83] Tarbela Dam in Pakistan is constructed on the Indus River, while the controversial Kalabagh dam is also being constructed on Indus river.

This includes two regular monsoon seasons from June through September, and October to November. The rain during monsoon seasons combined with increasing amounts of glacial melt in lakes and rivers, contribute to frequent flooding events in Pakistan. The primary source of flood flows in 2016 were generated by moderate to heavy downpour in upper catchments of major rivers and their tributaries.[8]"

It was large quantities of rainwater and glacial melt into the Indus Basin area that primarily contributed to the 2016 floods.[14] Pakistan's monsoon rains originate from moisture which moves over India. Consequently, flooding events occur every year. However, the monsoons are beginning to migrate north-westerly, where there are fewer smaller and narrower rivers which are not sufficient to collect monsoon water to prevent flooding.[15] In the provinces of Punjab, Balochistan, Khyber-Paktunkhwa, FATA, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, it was reported that 171 houses were damaged as of the 18th of March 2016.[4] Rain started at night of Saturday, April 3,[16] rainfall began to spur floods in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region in the northwest.[17] As of the 13th of April 2016, it was reported that 2700 houses were damaged.[4] and many collapsed.[18] This was due to the heavy rain which caused flooding and consequently landslides. As a result, food shortages in Gilgit Balistan were experienced due to the blocking of the Karakoram Highway.[4] Houses are often poorly built, especially in rural areas which meant they were susceptible to collapse after heavy rain.[19] 300,000 families were registered displaced after the floods but now half have returned to their homes.[4] The recurrence of frequent floods in Pakistan poses serious threat to crops, properties and human life.[20] Another flood began in August. At least 82 people were killed during the floods, including a disaster involving a bus which resulted in the deaths of 27 people and the disappearance of four.[21]"

Entire homes and parts of some communities were swept away by flood waters, leading to costly damage to infrastructure in the region. Over 600 helicopter rescues and countless swift water rescues by boat were needed to evacuate people who were trapped by the quickly rising flood waters.  The flood event is said to be the deadliest natural disaster to hit eastern Kentucky in more than 80 years. [4] [5]"

In Mingo County, the Gilbert Creek area along the Kentucky/Virginia/West Virginia border had several homes impacted and several bridges washed out, limiting access to some areas.[7][8] More flooding occurred in nearby McDowell County as well, in addition to other areas. This, combined with additional rainfall and flooding on July 28, led to a state of emergency being declared by Governor Jim Justice for six counties: Mingo, McDowell, Fayette, Greenbrier, Logan, and Wyoming.[9] Partly as a result of the flooding, Huntington, West Virginia recorded their wettest July on record with 9.41\u00a0in (23.9\u00a0cm) of rain.[10]"

Many roads were shut down in these areas including Main Street in Hazard, Mayo Trail in Pikeville, KY 317 in Fleming-Neon, Lakeside Drive and Main Street in Jenkins, South Fork Road, South Mountain Road, Bold Camp Road, and Main Street in Pound, Virginia, and portions of US 23 in Wise, Virginia. Evacuations were ordered in the downtown areas of cities that were severely flooded including Hazard, Fleming-Neon, Jenkins, Martin, Pound, and Clintwood, Virginia.[17] The North Fork of the Kentucky River set record high crests in Whitesburg and Jackson,[14] and over 33,000 customers lost electricity.[18] In Hindman in Knott County, nearly all buildings in the downtown area sustained some level of flood damage from Troublesome Creek, which passes through the area. The Appalachian Artisan Center sustained extensive damage to the museum and several studios, a new swimming pool and skatepark in town were severely damaged, and many homes and businesses were heavily damaged or destroyed.[19] Nearby, Hindman Settlement School and Appalachian School of Luthiery were both flooded with several feet of water and heavily damaged, along with the Troublesome Creek Stringed Instrument Company.[20] Upstream from Hindman, Alice Lloyd College in Pippa Passes sustained major damage due to Troublesome Creek, along with the surrounding community.[21] Just northwest of Hindman, in a particularly tragic incident, four children were killed when they were swept out of their mother's arms along Montgomery Creek. Both parents survived despite being stranded in a tree for eight hours.[22] In Letcher County, Whitesburg, and surrounding communities were severely impacted by the North Fork River and Rockhouse Creek. Many businesses were destroyed in Whitesburg, including a used car dealership that had been in business for four decades.[23] At Appalshop, which housed a vast media collection of Appalachian history, some of the media vault's contents were swept away and scattered about, including film of oral history, musical performances, and photo collections.[20] The North Fork rose about 18 feet (5.5\u00a0m) in 10 hours[14] to set a record crest in Whitesburg of approximately 20 feet (6.1\u00a0m), beating the previous 1957 record by over 5 feet (1.5\u00a0m), before the gauge was apparently destroyed in the flood. In southern Knott County, Carr Creek Lake rose over 15 feet (4.6\u00a0m) in 12 hours along the Carr Fork River, a tributary of the North Fork.[24] Buckhorn in Perry County was inundated by Squabble Creek, a tributary of the Middle Fork of the Kentucky River, with numerous homes and Buckhorn School being completely flooded. The pavement was pulled up from the parking lot, and classrooms within the school building were destroyed ahead of the school's scheduled start date of August 11.[25][26] Robinson Elementary in the Ary community of northern Perry County sustained exterior wall and roof collapse along Troublesome Creek, downstream of Hindman and Knott County.[27] Further along the creek in Breathitt County, the community of Lost Creek was also inundated, with roads covered and homes swept off their foundations.[28][29] The Oneida community in Clay County was cut off by downed power lines and washed-out roads and bridges, with floodwater impacting many homes that had previously been flooded by an event in March 2020.[30] Parts of Floyd and Johnson counties were impacted by severe thunderstorms and flooding first on July 26, affecting homes and roads.[31] More severe flooding occurred on July 28, with the towns of Martin, Wayland, and Garrett in Floyd County being among those impacted. Numerous water rescues were conducted, with people being taken to the Wayland Fire Department, among other places. KY 7, KY 122, and KY 550 in Floyd County were shut down due to floodwaters.[30] Pike County in far eastern Kentucky also sustained flooding, with multiple roads being blocked by downed trees and power lines as well. In the Virgie area, south of Pikeville, Shelby Creek overran its banks and inundated several homes, leading to the closure of KY 610 in the area.[30] Late on July 28 and into July 29, part of the city of Jackson was evacuated and KY 15 was closed after officials became concerned that water from the North Fork River would top Panbowl Dam along KY 15 and potentially flood approximately 110 homes, 13 businesses, and other structures around Panbowl Lake, although the river began receding before the dam was overtopped.[32] The North Fork River set a record crest in Jackson of 43.47 feet (13.25\u00a0m), besting the previous record of 43.1 feet (13.1\u00a0m) from February 4, 1939,[24] while meteorologists at the National Weather Service forecast office in Jackson became trapped at the office due to nearby high water.[28] The fatality count from the event in Kentucky reached 38, with 17 deaths occurring in Knott County, nine in Breathitt County, seven in Perry County, three in Letcher County, and two in Clay County. A 39th fatality occurred in the days following the event due to an illness contracted during cleanup efforts.[33] A 40th fatality occurred in September during cleanup efforts in Pike County.[34] University professors and data analysts described the extreme flooding as made more likely by climate change in the United States.[35][36][37][38] Meteorologist Jeff Berardelli of WFLA in Tampa, Florida commented that the flooding in Kentucky was \"simply in its own universe\", and that an event that would happen on average one in a thousand years before global warming made its likelihood greater.[39][40][41][36] The government's Fourth National Climate Assessment says that the heaviest precipitation events have intensified.[37] Criticism was lobbied at local mining companies for failing to return the land to its natural state after decades of mining caused the loss of the natural ridge lines and vegetation.[42] The rainfall observed over the region during July 25\u201330 was over 600 percent of normal totals. The four-day rainfall totals of 14\u201316 inches (360\u2013410\u00a0mm) in some areas were reported to have a less than a 0.1 percent chance of occurring in any given year.[43]"

[52] A shelter was opened on July 28 at the Breathitt County Courthouse in Jackson for displaced residents, as well as other shelters in schools and churches around Perry County and Hazard and the Floyd County Community Center near the town of Martin.[30] Wolfe County, north of Jackson, opened three school buildings as shelters as well.[28] About 150 residents were housed at nearby state parks, while at least another 150 went to American Red Cross shelters. Curfews were established in areas such as Hindman and Breathitt County after reports of looting.[53] Some residents in Kentucky were stuck in their homes, unable to leave because of washed-out roads and bridges, leading to over 420 people being rescued by helicopter or boat.[53] By August 2, more than 5,600 customers in eastern Kentucky were still without power and more than 18,000 service connections were without water. An additional 45,600 customers were under a boil water advisory, according to Governor Beshear. Numerous people remained stranded in rural areas as a result of roads being washed away, with the only access in some instances being by ATV. The infrastructure problems caused difficulty in pinpointing the number of missing people in the days after the event.[49] The office manager of Troublesome Creek Stringed Instrument Company in Hindman set up a GoFundMe account for donations to help with flood relief, while Appalshop and Hindman Settlement School received help to keep valuable media archives refrigerated to prevent ruin. Some archives were transported to a freezer at East Tennessee State University in the days after the event.[20] School systems in Perry, Breathitt, and Floyd counties delayed the start of the school year due to recovery efforts. Several classrooms in Breathitt County were destroyed, along with the district's maintenance building and the bus garage.[27] Several other counties in the area had modified starts to the school year as well.[49] The University of Kentucky men's basketball team announced plans to play two games against Gonzaga, in 2022 and 2023, to raise money for Kentucky flood relief.[54] As of August 2024, flood recovery efforts were still ongoing in some areas.

Located at the junction of the Colorado Plateau, Great Basin, and Mojave Desert regions, the park has a unique geography and a variety of life zones that allow for unusual plant and animal diversity. Numerous plant species as well as 289 species of birds, 75 mammals (including 19 species of bat), and 32 reptiles inhabit the park's four life zones: desert, riparian, woodland, and coniferous forest. Zion National Park includes mountains, canyons, buttes, mesas, monoliths, rivers, slot canyons, and natural arches. The lowest point in the park is 3,666\u00a0ft (1,117\u00a0m) at Coalpits Wash and the highest peak is 8,726\u00a0ft (2,660\u00a0m) at Horse Ranch Mountain. A prominent feature of the 229-square-mile (590\u00a0km2) park is Zion Canyon, which is 15 miles (24\u00a0km) long and up to 2,640\u00a0ft (800\u00a0m) deep. The canyon walls are reddish and tan-colored Navajo Sandstone eroded by the North Fork of the Virgin River. The park attracted 5 million visitors in 2023. [4] Human habitation of the area started about 8,000\u00a0years ago with small family groups of Native Americans, one of which was the semi-nomadic Basketmaker Ancestral Puebloans (who used to be called Anasazi by early non-indigenous archeologists[5]) (c.\u00a0300 CE). Subsequently, what has been called the Virgin Anasazi culture (c.\u2009500) and the Parowan Fremont group developed as the Basketmakers settled in permanent communities.[6] Both groups moved away by 1300 and were replaced by the Parrusits and several other Southern Paiute subtribes. Mormons came into the area in 1858 and settled there in the early 1860s."

Many believed that Spanish and Indian names would deter visitors who, if they could not pronounce the name of a place, might not bother to visit it.[8] The new name, Zion, had greater appeal to an ethnocentric audience.\"[9] On November 19, 1919, Congress redesignated the monument as Zion National Park, and the act was signed by President Woodrow Wilson.[10] The Kolob section was proclaimed a separate Zion National Monument in 1937, but was incorporated into the national park in 1956.[11] Congress designated 85% of the park a wilderness area in 2009. The geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area includes nine formations that together represent 150 million years of mostly Mesozoic-aged sedimentation. At various periods in that time warm, shallow seas, streams, ponds and lakes, vast deserts, and dry near-shore environments covered the area. Uplift associated with the creation of the Colorado Plateau lifted the region 10,000 feet (3,000\u00a0m) starting 13 million years ago.[12]"

        "content": "The park is located in southwestern Utah mostly in unincorporated areas in Washington,[14] Iron,[15] and Kane counties.[16] The territory of Springdale extends into the park.[17] Geomorphically, it is located on the Markagunt and Kolob plateaus, at the intersection of three North American geographic provinces: the Colorado Plateau, the Great Basin, and the Mojave Desert. The northern part of the park is known as the Kolob Canyons section and is accessible from Interstate 15, exit\u00a040.[18] The 8,726-foot (2,660\u00a0m) summit of Horse Ranch Mountain is the highest point in the park; the lowest point is the 3,666-foot (1,117\u00a0m) elevation of Coal Pits Wash, creating a relief of about 5,100 feet (1,600\u00a0m).[19] Streams in the area take rectangular paths because they follow jointing planes in the rocks.[20] The stream gradient of the Virgin River, whose North Fork flows through Zion Canyon in the park, ranges from 50 to 80 feet per mile (9.5 to 15.2\u00a0m/km) (0.9\u20131.5%)\u2014one of the steepest stream gradients in North America.[21] The road into Zion Canyon is 6 miles (9.7\u00a0km) long, ending at the Temple of Sinawava, which is named for the coyote god of the Paiute Indians.[22] The canyon becomes more narrow near the Temple and a hiking trail continues to the mouth of The Narrows, a gorge only 20 feet (6\u00a0m) wide and up to 2,000 feet (610\u00a0m) tall.[23] The Zion Canyon road is served by a free shuttle bus from early April to late October and by private vehicles the other months of the year. Other roads in Zion are open to private vehicles year-round. The east side of the park is served by Zion-Mount Carmel Highway (SR-9), which passes through the Zion\u2013Mount Carmel Tunnel and ends at US 89 at Mount Carmel Junction. Park features on the east side of the park include Checkerboard Mesa and The East Temple. The Kolob Terrace area, northwest of Zion Canyon, features a slot canyon called The Subway, and a panoramic view of the entire area from Lava Point. The Kolob Canyons section, further to the northwest near Cedar City, features Tucupit Point and one of the world's longest natural arches, Kolob Arch.[24] Other notable geographic features of Zion Canyon include Angels Landing, The Great White Throne, the Court of the Patriarchs, The Sentinel, The West Temple, Towers of the Virgin, the Altar of Sacrifice, The Watchman, Weeping Rock, and the Emerald Pools.[25] Spring weather is unpredictable, with stormy, wet days being common, mixed with occasional warm, sunny weather. Precipitation is normally heaviest in March.[26] Spring wildflowers bloom from April through June, peaking in May. Fall days are usually clear and mild; nights are often cool. Summer days are hot (95 to 110\u00a0\u00b0F; 35 to 43\u00a0\u00b0C), but overnight lows are usually comfortable (65 to 70\u00a0\u00b0F; 18 to 21\u00a0\u00b0C).[26] Afternoon thunderstorms are common from mid-July through mid-September.[26] Storms may produce waterfalls as well as flash floods. Autumn tree-color displays begin in September in the high country; in Zion Canyon, autumn colors usually peak in late October. Winter in Zion Canyon is fairly mild. Winter storms bring rain or light snow to Zion Canyon and heavier snow to the higher elevations. Clear days may become quite warm, reaching 60\u00a0\u00b0F (16\u00a0\u00b0C); nights are often 20 to 40\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22127 to 4\u00a0\u00b0C).[26] Winter storms can last several days and make roads icy. Zion roads are plowed, except the Kolob Terrace Road which is closed when covered with snow.[26] Winter driving conditions last from November through March.[26]"

Archaeologists call this the Archaic period and it lasted until c.\u2009500.[31] Baskets, cordage nets, and yucca fiber sandals have been found and dated to this period. The Archaic toolkits included flaked stone knives, drills, and stemmed dart points. The dart points were attached to wooden shafts and propelled by throwing devices called atlatls.[31] By c.\u2009300, some of the archaic groups developed into an early branch of seminomadic Anasazi, the Basketmakers.[31] Basketmaker sites have grass- or stone-lined storage cists and shallow, partially underground dwellings called pithouses. They were hunters and gatherers who supplemented their diet with limited agriculture. Locally collected pine nuts were important for food and trade."

The padres passed near what is now the Kolob Canyons Visitor Center on October 13, 1776, becoming the first people of European descent known to visit the area.[33] In 1825, trapper and trader Jedediah Smith explored some of the downstream areas while under contract with the American Fur Company.[33] In 1847, Mormon farmers from the Salt Lake area became the first people of European descent to settle the Virgin River region.[21] In 1851, the Parowan and Cedar City areas were settled by Mormons who used the Kolob Canyons area for timber, and for grazing cattle, sheep, and horses.[34] They prospected for mineral deposits, and diverted Kolob water to irrigate crops in the valley below. Mormon settlers named the area Kolob which in Mormon scripture is the heavenly place nearest the residence of God.[35] Settlements had expanded 30 miles (48\u00a0km) south to the lower Virgin River by 1858.[21] That year, a Southern Paiute guide led young Mormon missionary and interpreter Nephi Johnson into the upper Virgin River area and Zion Canyon.[33] Johnson wrote a favorable report about the agricultural potential of the upper Virgin River basin, and returned later that year to found the town of Virgin. In 1861 or 1862, Joseph Black made the arduous journey to Zion Canyon and was very impressed by its beauty.[6] The floor of Zion Canyon was settled in 1863 by Isaac Behunin, who farmed corn, tobacco, and fruit trees.[6] The Behunin family lived in Zion Canyon near the site of today's Zion Lodge during the summer, and wintered in Springdale. Behunin is credited with naming Zion, a reference to the place of peace mentioned in the Bible.[6] Two more families settled Zion Canyon in the next couple of years, bringing with them cattle and other domesticated animals. The canyon floor was farmed until Zion became a Monument in 1909.[21] The Powell Geographic Expedition of 1869 entered the area after their first trip through the Grand Canyon.[21] John Wesley Powell visited Zion Canyon in 1872 and named it Mukuntuweap, under the impression that that was the Paiute name.[36] Powell Survey photographers John K. Hillers and James Fennemore first visited the Zion Canyon and Kolob Plateau region in the spring of 1872.[21] Hillers returned in April 1873 to add more photographs to the \"Virgin River Series\" of photographs and stereographs.[37] Hillers described wading the canyon for four days and nearly freezing to death to take his photographs.[37]"

The article and paintings, along with previously created photographs, paintings, and reports, led to President William Howard Taft's proclamation on July 31, 1909, that created Mukuntuweap National Monument.[33] In 1917, the acting director of the newly created National Park Service visited the canyon and proposed changing its name from the locally unpopular Mukuntuweap to Zion, a name used by the local Mormon community.[38] The United States Congress added more land and established Zion National Park on November 19, 1919.[6] A separate Zion National Monument, the Kolob Canyons area, was proclaimed on January 22, 1937, and was incorporated into the park on July 11, 1956.[39] Travel to the area before it was a national park was rare due to its remote location, lack of accommodations, and the absence of real roads in southern Utah. Old wagon roads were upgraded to the first automobile roads starting about 1910, and the road into Zion Canyon was built in 1917 leading to the Grotto, short of the present road that now ends at the Temple of Sinawava.[31] Touring cars could reach Zion Canyon by the summer of 1917.[31] The first visitor lodging in Zion Canyon, called Wylie Camp, was established that same year as a tent camp.[31] The Utah Parks Company, a subsidiary of the Union Pacific Railroad, acquired Wylie Camp in 1923, and offered ten-day rail/bus tours to Zion, nearby Bryce Canyon, the Kaibab Plateau, and the North Rim of the Grand Canyon.[40] The Zion Lodge complex was built in 1925 at the site of the Wylie tent camp.[31] Architect Gilbert Stanley Underwood designed the Zion Lodge in a rustic architectural style, while the Utah Parks Company funded the construction.[31]"

More than 200,000 board feet (470\u00a0m3) of lumber were lowered by 1906.[42] The auto road was extended to the Temple of Sinawava, and a trail built from there 1 mile (1.6\u00a0km) to the start of the Narrows.[43] Angel's Landing Trail was constructed in 1926 and two suspension bridges were built over the Virgin River.[36] Other trails were constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the 1930s.[36]"

Traffic congestion in the narrow canyon was recognized as a major problem in the 1990s and a public transportation system using propane-powered shuttle buses was instituted in the year 2000.[45] As part of its shuttle fleet, Zion has two electric trams each holding up to 36 passengers.[46] Usually from early April through late October, the scenic drive in Zion Canyon is closed to private vehicles and visitors ride the shuttle buses.[45] The National Park Service has contracted the management of the shuttle bus system to transit operator RATP Dev.[47] On April 12, 1995, heavy rains triggered a landslide that blocked the Virgin River in Zion Canyon.[48]  Over a period of two hours, the river carved away part of the only exit road from the canyon, trapping 450 guests and employees at the Zion Lodge.[48]  A one-lane, temporary road was constructed within 24\u00a0hours to allow evacuation of the Lodge.[48]  A more stable albeit temporary road was completed on May 25, 1995, to allow summer visitors to access the canyon.[48]  This road was replaced with a permanent road during the first half of 1996.[48] The Zion\u2013Mount Carmel Highway can be travelled year-round. Access for oversized vehicles requires a special permit, and is limited to daytime hours, as traffic through the tunnel must be one way to accommodate large vehicles. The 5-mile (8.0\u00a0km)-long Kolob Canyons Road was built to provide access to the Kolob Canyons section of the park.[49] This road often closes in the winter. In March 2009, President Barack Obama signed into law the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009, which designated and further protected 124,406 acres (50,345\u00a0ha) of park land, about 85% of the park, as the Zion Wilderness.[50] In 2011, Zion National Park was featured in the Honest Hearts downloadable content pack for the game Fallout: New Vegas. In September 2015, flooding trapped a party of seven in Keyhole Canyon, a slot canyon in the park. The flash flood killed all seven members of the group, whose remains were located after a search lasting several days.[51] In 2017, some scenes from the TV series Extinct were shot in the park.[52] On March 25, 2020, the park campgrounds were closed to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.[53]"

        "content": "The nine known exposed geologic formations in Zion National Park are part of a super-sequence of rock units called the Grand Staircase. Together, these formations represent about 150\u00a0million years of mostly Mesozoic-aged sedimentation in that part of North America. The formations exposed in the Zion area were deposited as sediment in very different environments: Uplift affected the entire region, known as the Colorado Plateaus, by slowly raising these formations more than 10,000 feet (3,000\u00a0m) higher than where they were deposited.[54] This steepened the stream gradient of the ancestral Virgin and other rivers on the plateau. The faster-moving streams took advantage of uplift-created joints in the rocks. Eventually, all Cenozoic-aged formations were removed and gorges were cut into the plateaus. Zion Canyon was cut by the North Fork of the Virgin River in this way. During the later part of this process, lava flows and cinder cones covered parts of the area.[55] High water volume in wet seasons does most of the downcutting in the main canyon. These flood events are responsible for transporting most of the 3\u00a0million short\u00a0tons (2.7\u00a0million metric\u00a0tons) of rock and sediment that the Virgin River transports yearly.[21] The Virgin cuts away its canyon faster than its tributaries can cut away their own streambeds, so tributaries end in waterfalls from hanging valleys where they meet the Virgin.[21] The valley between the peaks of the Twin Brothers is a notable example of a hanging valley in the canyon."

The park is home to 289 bird, 79 mammals, 28 reptiles, 7 fish, and 6 amphibian species.[58] These organisms make their homes in one or more of four life zones found in the park: desert, riparian, woodland, and coniferous forest.[59] Desert conditions persist on canyon bottoms and rocky ledges away from perennial streams. Sagebrush, prickly pear cactus, and rabbitbrush, along with sacred datura and Indian paintbrush, are common.[60] Utah penstemon and golden aster can also be found.[61] Milkvetch and prince's plume are found in pockets of selenium-rich soils.[59] Common daytime animals include mule deer, rock squirrels, pinyon jays, and whiptail and collared lizards. Desert cottontails,[62] jackrabbits, and Merriam's kangaroo rats come out at night. Cougars, bobcats, coyotes, badgers, gray foxes, and ring-tail cats are the top predators.[62] Cooler conditions persist at mid-elevation slopes, from 3,900 to 5,500 feet (1,200 to 1,700\u00a0m).[59] Stunted forests of pinyon pine and juniper coexist here with manzanita shrubs, cliffrose, serviceberry, scrub oak, and yucca.[59]  Stands of ponderosa pine, Gambel oak, Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, White fir, manzanita and aspen populate the mesas and cliffs above 6,000 feet (1,800\u00a0m).[59] Golden eagles, red-tailed hawks, peregrine falcons, and white-throated swifts can be seen in the area.[63] Desert bighorn sheep were reintroduced in the park in 1973.[64] California condors were reintroduced in the Arizona Strip and in 2014 the first successful breeding of condors in the park was confirmed.[65][66] Nineteen species of bat also live in the area.[67] Boxelder, Fremont cottonwood, maple, and willow dominate riparian plant communities.[59] Animals such as bank beavers, flannel-mouth suckers, gnatcatchers, dippers, canyon wrens, the virgin spinedace, and water striders all make their homes in the riparian zones.[68]"

Guided horseback riding trips, nature walks, and evening programs are available from late March to early November.[69] The Junior Ranger Program for children ages 4 and up is active year-round at the Nature Center, Human History Museum, and the visitor centers.[70] A bookstore attached to the Zion Canyon visitor center offers books, maps, and souvenirs.[71] The Grotto in Zion Canyon, the visitor center, and the viewpoint at the end of Kolob Canyons Road have the only designated picnic sites.[19] The visitor center also utilizes multiple types of environmental technology, including windcatchers for passive cooling and cross ventilation, which bring the center's temperature down during hot summer weather, a trombe wall to keep heat in during the winter, and solar panels for an electrical source (excess energy goes to the power grid).[72] Seven trails with round-trip times of half an hour (Weeping Rock) to 4 hours (Angels Landing) are found in Zion Canyon.[73] Two popular trails, Taylor Creek (4 hours round trip) and Kolob Arch (8 hours round trip), are in the Kolob Canyons section of the park, near Cedar City.[73] Hiking up into The Narrows from the Temple of Sinawava is popular in summer, but hiking beyond Big Springs requires a permit. The entire Narrows from Chamberlain's Ranch is a 16-mile one way trip that typically takes 12 hours of strenuous hiking.[74] A shorter alternative is to enter the Narrows via Orderville Canyon. Both Orderville and the full Narrows require a back country permit. Entrance to the Parunuweap Canyon section of the park downstream of Labyrinth Falls is prohibited. Other often-used backcountry trails include the West Rim and LaVerkin Creek.[75] The more primitive sections of Zion include the Kolob Terrace and the Kolob Canyons.[19] A network of trails totaling 50 miles in distance connect Zion's northwest corner of the park (Lee Pass Trailhead) to its southeast section (East Rim Trailhead). Popularly known as the Zion Traverse, the route offers backpackers a diverse experience of the park. Zion is a center for rock climbing, with short walls like Spaceshot, Moonlight Buttress, Prodigal Son, Ashtar Command, and Touchstone being the most popular, highly rated routes.[76][77] Lodging in the park is available at Zion Lodge, located halfway through Zion Canyon. Just outside the park more lodging is available in Springdale.[78] Zion has three campgrounds: South and Watchman at the far southern side of the park, and a primitive site at Lava Point in the middle of the park off Kolob Terrace Road.[79] Overnight camping in the backcountry requires permits.[80]"

It developed from Tropical Depression Twenty-Five in the eastern Caribbean Sea on October 22, 2005. As the 21\u00a0pre-designated storm names had been exhausted, it was given the first name on the auxiliary list, which utilized the letters of the Greek alphabet. This was the first hurricane season ever to trigger this naming protocol, and the only one until the 2020 season. During its brief life, Alpha moved west-northwestward and reached its peak intensity on October\u00a023, but weakened as it neared landfall in the Dominican Republic that same day. Crossing the island of Hispaniola it weakened to a tropical depression, and persisted until October\u00a024, when it dissipated. Its remnant low was absorbed by Hurricane Wilma's large circulation. Alpha dumped torrential rain on the island of Hispaniola, making it the eighth wettest storm to impact poverty-stricken Haiti. It caused 26\u00a0deaths, 17 of them in Haiti, and all of them caused by floods and rain-related landslides. Roads were blocked for weeks and hundreds of houses were destroyed."

        "content": "Alpha's origins were from a tropical wave that developed near the Windward Islands on October\u00a020.[1] Satellite images indicated that a low pressure center associated with the tropical wave formed near Barbados and moved west-northwest with increasing convective activity. In an area of light wind shear, the convection increased and Doppler weather radar data from Puerto Rico detected a well-defined cyclonic circulation.[1] On October\u00a022, the area of low pressure organized into Tropical Depression Twenty-five, southeast of Hispaniola.[2] Shortly thereafter, satellite imagery indicated that a closed circulation had developed, and the associated convection had started banding.[3] Later that same day, the depression had organized enough to be upgraded to Tropical Storm Alpha; this was the first time the National Hurricane Center had to use a Greek name for an Atlantic hurricane.[4] When Alpha came within the Doppler weather radar range of Puerto Rico, the radar suggested that an eyewall-like feature had developed.[5] Alpha was tracking along the southwest edge of a subtropical ridge.[5] With nearby Hurricane Wilma's large circulation, Alpha was experiencing strong southerly flow from Wilma.[5] Alpha, with its small circulation, was then faced with the mountainous terrain of Hispaniola, which led forecasters to believe Alpha was soon to dissipate.[6] Shortly after Alpha reached its peak intensity on October\u00a023 its wind decreased. While convection remained in bands, the low level circulation was disrupted by land. This left the center ill-defined and difficult to locate.[7] Late on October\u00a023, Alpha made landfall in Hispaniola, quickly decreasing in intensity as it did so.[8] After making landfall, the storm weakened, leaving it just between tropical storm and tropical depression status.[8] Because of the weakening, and the strong southerly flow from nearby Hurricane Wilma, it was hard to determine whether a low-level circulation was present.[8] However, satellite imagery suggested that a new center had developed over open waters to the north of Hispaniola.[8] It was downgraded to a tropical depression early the next day, now re-emerging over open waters.[9] The storm soon developed an elongated center of circulation which indicated that the system was weakening.[10] On October\u00a024 the low-level center had completely dissolved, and only a small area of convective activity persisted. Thus, the system had dissipated, and was a remnant low pressure system when the National Hurricane Center issued their last advisories of Alpha.[11] Shortly thereafter, the remnant low was absorbed into the circulation of Hurricane Wilma on October\u00a025.[1]"

On October\u00a022 and 23, the Haitian government ordered level 1 and then level 2 alerts for the county in anticipation of Tropical Storm Alpha's rainfall.[12] Haiti was already experiencing flooding from Hurricane Wilma's passage between October\u00a08 and 19, so the threat of more rainfall was particularly dire.[13] The country's Centre National de Meteorologie issued weather bulletins through existing media distribution channels with clear instructions on how residences should prepare for floods and landslides. The local government of Sud-Est ordered the evacuation of its capital city, Jacmel. The national government mobilized personnel and resources of the Direction of Civil Protection, the Secr\u00e9tariat Permanent de Gestion des Risques et des D\u00e9sastres (SPGRD), and the National Police to pre-arranged Emergency Operation Centres.[12]"

Surging rivers east of Marigot and west of Jacmel closed roads in that region, and the main road between J\u00e9r\u00e9mie and Les Cayes was also closed.[12][13] Elsewhere in the country, landslides temporarily blocked several other major roads. Gon\u00e2ve Island, which had been suffering a brutal drought, was stricken by floods which overwhelmed and washed away pipes of the water draining system\nin Nan Bar\u00e9.[12] Damages in Haiti were mostly confined to the Ouest, Sud-Est, and Grand'Anse departments.[15] In Haiti, 17\u00a0people died.[1][16] Two drowned when a river overflowed in Grande Anse and two more died after being electrocuted during flooding, one in the Port-au-Prince suburb of Carrefour and the other in the southern town of Jacmel.[17] The rest of the deaths were the results of landslides and flooding in various areas in the country.[17] Across the country, 243\u00a0houses were destroyed, and 191 more were damaged.[18] Nine people were killed in the Dominican Republic: two fishermen went missing at sea during the storm and the others were swept away by flood waters when rivers burst their banks in Guaricanos[19] and Puerto Plata.[16] Otherwise, the damage in the Dominican Republic was minimal.[1][12][13] The Haitian government did not request international assistance, although The United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Haitian Red-Cross, which were already working in Haiti, took on some supporting roles.[12] In response to local flooding, the Jacmel Regional branch of the Red Cross distributed an additional 400 water purification tablets, 11 boxes of high-energy biscuits, and 10 boxes of body soap.[13]"

However, 2005 was the first tropical or subtropical storm to be assigned a Greek-alphabet name from the auxiliary list.[1] The next one to be so named was Subtropical Storm Alpha in 2020.[20] At the time, it was thought that Alpha was the 22nd storm of the season, and so was the storm which broke the record for most storms in a single Atlantic hurricane season set in 1933.[21] However post-season analysis revealed that there was also a previously unnoticed subtropical storm on October\u00a04,[22] which made Alpha the 23rd storm of the season. Alpha's record-setting formation date as the season's 23rd tropical or subtropical storm would stand until 2020. It was broken by Tropical Storm Beta, which formed on September 18.[20]"

With a 2020 census population of 1,304,379, it is the ninth-most populous city in the U.S. and the third-most populous city in Texas after Houston and San Antonio.[12][13] Located in the North Texas region, the city of Dallas is the main core of the largest metropolitan area in the Southern United States and the largest inland metropolitan area in the U.S. that lacks any navigable link to the sea.[a] Dallas and nearby Fort Worth were initially developed as a product of the construction of major railroad lines through the area allowing access to cotton, cattle, and later oil in North and East Texas. The construction of the Interstate Highway System reinforced Dallas's prominence as a transportation hub, with four major interstate highways converging in the city and a fifth interstate loop around it. Dallas then developed as a strong industrial and financial center and a major inland port, due to the convergence of major railroad lines, interstate highways, and the construction of Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, one of the largest and busiest airports in the world.[14] In addition, Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) operates rail and bus transit services throughout the city and its surrounding suburbs.[15] Dominant sectors of its diverse economy include defense, financial services, information technology, telecommunications, and transportation.[16] The Dallas\u201a\u00c4\u00ecFort Worth metroplex hosts 23 Fortune 500 companies, the second-most in Texas and fourth-most in the United States,[17][18] and 11 of those companies are located within Dallas city limits.[19] Over 41 colleges and universities are located within its metropolitan area, which is the most of any metropolitan area in Texas. The city has a population from a myriad of ethnic and religious backgrounds and is one of the largest LGBT communities in the U.S.[20][21] WalletHub named Dallas the fifth-most diverse city in the United States in 2018.[22]"

        "content": "Indigenous tribes in North Texas included the Caddo, Tawakoni, Wichita, Kickapoo and Comanche.[23][24][25] Spanish colonists claimed the territory of Texas in the 18th century as a part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain. Later, France also claimed the area but never established much settlement. In all, six flags have flown over the area preceding and during the city's history: those of France, Spain, and Mexico, the flag of the Republic of Texas, the Confederate flag, and the flag of the United States of America.[26] In 1819, the Adams\u201a\u00c4\u00ecOn\u221a\u2260s Treaty between the United States and Spain defined the Red River as the northern boundary of New Spain, officially placing the future location of Dallas well within Spanish territory.[27][page\u00a0needed] The area remained under Spanish rule until 1821, when Mexico declared independence from Spain, and the area was considered part of the Mexican state of Coahuila y Tejas. In 1836, Texians, with a majority of Anglo-American settlers, gained independence from Mexico and formed the Republic of Texas.[28] Three years after Texas achieved independence, John Neely Bryan surveyed the area around present-day Dallas.[29] In 1839, accompanied by his dog and a Cherokee he called Ned, he planted a stake in the ground on a bluff located near three forks of the Trinity River and left.[30] Two years later, in 1841, he returned to establish a permanent settlement named Dallas.[31] The origin of the name is uncertain. The official historical marker states it was named after Vice President George M. Dallas of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. However, this is disputed. Other potential theories for the origin include his brother, Commodore Alexander James Dallas, as well as brothers Walter R. Dallas and James R. Dallas.[32][33] A further theory gives the ultimate origin as the village of Dallas, Moray, Scotland,[b] similar to the way Houston, Texas, was named after Sam Houston, whose ancestors came from the Scottish village of Houston, Renfrewshire. The Republic of Texas was annexed by the United States in 1845 and Dallas County was established the following year. Dallas was formally incorporated as a city on February 2, 1856.[14] In the mid-1800s, a group of French Socialists established La R\u221a\u00a9union, a short-lived community, along the Trinity River in what is now West Dallas.[34] With the construction of railroads, Dallas became a business and trading center and was booming by the end of the 19th century. It became an industrial city, attracting workers from Texas, the South, and the Midwest. The Praetorian Building in Dallas of 15 stories, built in 1909, was among the first skyscrapers west of the Mississippi and the tallest building in Texas for some time.[35] It marked the prominence of Dallas as a city. A racetrack for thoroughbreds was built and their owners established the Dallas Jockey Club. Trotters raced at a track in Fort Worth, where a similar drivers club was based. The rapid expansion of population increased competition for jobs and housing. In 1910, a white mob of hundreds of people lynched a black man, Allen Brooks, accused of raping a little girl. The mob tortured Brooks, then killed him at the downtown intersection of Main and Akard by hanging him from a decorative archway inscribed with the words \"Welcome Visitors\". Thousands of Dallasites came to gawk at the torture scene, collecting keepsakes and posing for photographs.[36][37] In 1921, the Mexican president \u221a\u00c5lvaro Obreg\u221a\u2265n along with the former revolutionary general visited Downtown Dallas's Mexican Park in Little Mexico; the small park was on the corner of Akard and Caruth Street, site of the current Fairmont Hotel.[38] The small neighborhood of Little Mexico was home to a Latin American population that had been drawn to Dallas by factors including the American Dream, better living conditions,[39] and the Mexican Revolution.[40] During World War II, Dallas was a major manufacturing center for military automobiles and aircraft for the United States and Allied forces. Over 94,000 jeeps and over 6,000 military trucks were produced at the Ford plant in East Dallas.[41] North American Aviation manufactured over 18,000 aircraft at their plant in Dallas, including the T-6 Texan trainer, P-51 Mustang fighter, and B-24 Liberator bomber.[42] On November 22, 1963, United States President John F. Kennedy was assassinated on Elm Street while his motorcade passed through Dealey Plaza in Downtown Dallas.[43] The upper two floors of the building from which the Warren Commission reported assassin Lee Harvey Oswald shot Kennedy have been converted into a historical museum covering the former president's life and accomplishments.[44] Kennedy was pronounced dead at Dallas Parkland Memorial Hospital just over 30 minutes after the shooting. On July 7, 2016, multiple shots were fired at a Black Lives Matter protest in Downtown Dallas, held against the police killings of two black men from other states. The gunman, later identified as Micah Xavier Johnson, began firing at police officers at 8:58\u00a0p.m., killing five officers and injuring nine. Two bystanders were also injured. This marked the deadliest day for U.S. law enforcement since the September 11 attacks. Johnson told police during a standoff that he was upset about recent police shootings of black men and wanted to kill whites, especially white officers.[45][46] After hours of negotiation failed, police resorted to a robot-delivered bomb, killing Johnson inside Dallas College El Centro Campus. The shooting occurred in an area of hotels, restaurants, businesses, and residential apartments only a few blocks away from Dealey Plaza."

Although some of Dallas's architecture dates from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, most of the notable architecture in the city is from the modernist and postmodernist eras. Iconic examples of modernist architecture include Reunion Tower, the John Fitzgerald Kennedy Memorial, I. M. Pei's Dallas City Hall and the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center.[49] Good examples of postmodernist skyscrapers are Fountain Place, Bank of America Plaza, Renaissance Tower, JPMorgan Chase Tower, and Comerica Bank Tower. Downtown Dallas also has residential offerings in downtown, some of which are signature skyline buildings. Several smaller structures are fashioned in the Gothic Revival style, such as the Kirby Building, and the neoclassical style, as seen in the Davis and Wilson Buildings. One architectural \"hotbed\" in the city is a stretch of historic houses along Swiss Avenue, which has all shades and variants of architecture from Victorian to neoclassical.[50] The Dallas Downtown Historic District protects a cross-section of Dallas commercial architecture from the 1880s to the 1940s."

        "content": "Dallas and its surrounding area are mostly flat. The city lies at elevations ranging from 450 to 550 feet (137 to 168\u00a0m) above sea level. The western edge of the Austin Chalk Formation, a limestone escarpment (also known as the \"White Rock Escarpment\"), rises 230 feet (70\u00a0m) and runs roughly north\u201a\u00c4\u00ecsouth through Dallas County. South of the Trinity River, the uplift is particularly noticeable in the neighborhoods of Oak Cliff and the adjacent cities of Cockrell Hill, Cedar Hill, Grand Prairie, and Irving. Marked variations in terrain are also found in cities immediately to the west in Tarrant County surrounding Fort Worth, as well as along Turtle Creek north of Downtown. Dallas, like many other cities, was founded along a river. The city was founded at the location of a \"white rock crossing\" of the Trinity River, where it was easier for wagons to cross the river in the days before ferries or bridges. The Trinity River, though not usefully navigable, is the major waterway through the city. Interstate 35E parallels its path through Dallas along the Stemmons Corridor, then south alongside the western portion of Downtown and past South Dallas and Pleasant Grove, where the river is paralleled by Interstate 45 until it exits the city and heads southeast towards Houston. The river is flanked on both sides by 50 feet (15\u00a0m) tall earthen levees to protect the city from frequent floods.[58] Since it was rerouted in the late 1920s, the river has been little more than a drainage ditch within a floodplain for several miles above and below Downtown, with a more normal course further upstream and downstream, but as Dallas began shifting towards postindustrial society, public outcry about the lack of aesthetic and recreational use of the river ultimately gave way to the Trinity River Project,[59] which was begun in the early 2000s. The project area reaches for over 20 miles (32\u00a0km) in length within the city, while the overall geographical land area addressed by the Land Use Plan is approximately 44,000 acres (180\u00a0km2) in size\u201a\u00c4\u00eeabout 20% of the land area in Dallas. Green space along the river encompasses approximately 10,000 acres (40\u00a0km2), making it one of the largest and diverse urban parks in the world.[60] White Rock Lake and Joe Pool Lake are reservoirs that comprise Dallas's other significant water features. Built at the beginning of the 20th century, White Rock Lake Park is a popular destination for boaters, rowers, joggers, and bikers, as well as visitors seeking peaceful respite from the city at the 66-acre (267,000\u00a0m2) Dallas Arboretum and Botanical Garden, on the lake's eastern shore. White Rock Creek feeds into White Rock Lake and then exits into the Trinity River southeast of Downtown Dallas. Trails along White Rock Creek are part of the extensive Dallas County Trails System. Bachman Lake, just northwest of Love Field Airport, is a smaller lake also popularly used for recreation. Northeast of the city is Lake Ray Hubbard, a vast 22,745-acre (92\u00a0km2) reservoir in an extension of Dallas surrounded by the suburbs of Garland, Rowlett, Rockwall, and Sunnyvale.[61] To the west of the city is Mountain Creek Lake, once home to the Naval Air Station Dallas (Hensley Field) and a number of defense aircraft manufacturers.[62][63]\nNorth Lake, a small body of water in an extension of the city limits surrounded by Irving and Coppell, initially served as a water source for a nearby power plant but is now being targeted for redevelopment as a recreational lake due to its proximity to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, a plan the lake's neighboring cities oppose.[64]"

It also has both continental and tropical characteristics, characterized by a relatively wide annual temperature range for the latitude. Located at the lower end of Tornado Alley, it is prone to extreme weather, tornadoes, and hailstorms. Summers in Dallas are very hot with high humidity, although extended periods of dry weather often occur. July and August are typically the hottest months, with an average high of 96.0\u00a0\u00ac\u221eF (36\u00a0\u00ac\u221eC) and an average low of 76.7\u00a0\u00ac\u221eF (25\u00a0\u00ac\u221eC). Heat indices regularly surpass 105\u00a0\u00ac\u221eF (41\u00a0\u00ac\u221eC) due to elevated humidity during the summer months, making the summer heat almost unbearable. The all-time record high is 113\u00a0\u00ac\u221eF (45\u00a0\u00ac\u221eC), set on June 26 and 27, 1980 during the Heat Wave of 1980 at nearby Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport.[66][67] Winters in Dallas are usually mild, with occasional cold spells. The average date of first frost is November 12, and the average date of last frost is March 12.[68] January is typically the coldest month, with an average daytime high of 56.8\u00a0\u00ac\u221eF (14\u00a0\u00ac\u221eC) and an average nighttime low of 37.3\u00a0\u00ac\u221eF (3\u00a0\u00ac\u221eC). The normal daily average temperature in January is 47.0\u00a0\u00ac\u221eF (8\u00a0\u00ac\u221eC) but sharp swings in temperature can occur, as strong cold fronts known as \"Blue Northers\" pass through the Dallas region, forcing temperatures below the 40\u00a0\u00ac\u221eF (4\u00a0\u00ac\u221eC) mark for several days at a time and often between days with high temperatures above 80\u00a0\u00ac\u221eF (27\u00a0\u00ac\u221eC). Snow accumulation is seen in the city in about 70% of winter seasons, and snowfall generally occurs 1\u201a\u00c4\u00ec2 days out of the year for a seasonal average of 1.5 inches (4\u00a0cm). Some areas in the region, however, receive more than that, while other areas receive negligible snowfall or none at all.[69] The all-time record low temperature within the city is \u201a\u00e0\u00ed3\u00a0\u00ac\u221eF (\u201a\u00e0\u00ed19\u00a0\u00ac\u221eC), set on January 18, 1930.  The temperature at nearby Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport reached \u201a\u00e0\u00ed2\u00a0\u00ac\u221eF (\u201a\u00e0\u00ed19\u00a0\u00ac\u221eC) on February 16, 2021, during the February 2021 North American winter storm. Spring and autumn are transitional seasons with moderate and pleasant weather. Vibrant wildflowers (such as the bluebonnet, Indian paintbrush and other flora) bloom in spring and are planted around the highways throughout Texas.[70] Springtime weather can be quite volatile, but temperatures themselves are mild. Late spring to early summer also tends to be the most humid, with humidity levels frequently exceeding 75%. The weather in Dallas is also generally pleasant from late September to early December and on many winter days. Autumn often brings more storms and tornado threats, but they are usually fewer and less severe than in spring. Each spring, cold fronts moving south from the North collide with warm, humid air streaming in from the Gulf Coast, leading to severe thunderstorms with lightning, torrents of rain, hail, and occasionally, tornadoes. Over time, tornadoes have probably been the most significant natural threat to the city, as it is near the heart of Tornado Alley. A few times each winter in Dallas, warm and humid air from the south will override cold, dry air, resulting in freezing rain or ice and causing disruptions in the city if the roads and highways become slick. Temperatures reaching 70\u00a0\u00ac\u221eF (21\u00a0\u00ac\u221eC) on average occur on at least four days each winter month. Dallas averages 26 annual nights at or below freezing,[66] with the winter of 1999\u201a\u00c4\u00ec2000 holding the record for the fewest freezing nights with 14. During this same span of 15 years,[specify] the temperature in the region has only twice dropped below 15\u00a0\u00ac\u221eF (\u201a\u00e0\u00ed9\u00a0\u00ac\u221eC), though it will generally fall below 20\u00a0\u00ac\u221eF (\u201a\u00e0\u00ed7\u00a0\u00ac\u221eC) in most (67%) years.[66] The U.S. Department of Agriculture places Dallas in Plant Hardiness Zone 8b.[71][72] However, mild winter temperatures in the past 15 to 20 years had encouraged the horticulture of more cold-sensitive plants such as Washingtonia filifera and Washingtonia robusta palms, nearly all of which died off during the February 2021 North American winter storm. According to the American Lung Association, Dallas has the 12th highest air pollution among U.S. cities, ranking it behind Los Angeles and Houston.[73] Much of the air pollution in Dallas and the surrounding area comes from a hazardous materials incineration plant in the small town of Midlothian and from cement plants in neighboring Ellis County.[74] The average daily low in Dallas is 57.4\u00a0\u00ac\u221eF (14\u00a0\u00ac\u221eC), and the average daily high is 76.9\u00a0\u00ac\u221eF (25\u00a0\u00ac\u221eC). Dallas receives approximately 39.1 inches (993\u00a0mm) of rain per year. The record snowfall for Dallas was 11.2 inches (28\u00a0cm) on February 11, 2010."

At the 2020 United States census the city of Dallas had 1,304,379 residents, an increase of 106,563 since the 2010 United States census.[81] However, as of July 1, 2022, the U.S. Census Bureau estimates that Dallas in first years since the 2020 census lost 4,835 people, leaving the city with a population of 1,299,544.[3] There were 524,498 households at the 2020 estimates,[82] up from 2010's 458,057 households, out of which 137,523 had children under the age of 18 living with them.[83] Approximately 36.2% of households were headed by married couples living together, 57.2% had a single householder male or female with no spouse present, and 35.6% were classified as non-family households with the householder living alone.[82] In 2010, 33.7% of all households had one or more people under 18 years of age, and 17.6% had one or more people who were 65 years of age or older. The average household size in 2020 was 2.52 and the average family size was 3.41.[83] In 2018, the owner-occupied housing rate was 40.2% and the renter-occupied housing rate was 59.8%.[84] At the 2010 census, the city's age distribution of the population showed 26.5% under the age of 18 and 8.8% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 31.8 years. In 2010, 50.0% of the population was male and 50.0% was female.[85] In 2020, the median age 32.9 years; for every 100 females, there were 98.4 males.[86] According to the 2020 American Community Survey, the median income for a household in the city was $54,747; families had a median household income of $60,895; married-couple families $81,761; and non-families $45,658.[87] In 2003\u201a\u00c4\u00ec2007's survey, male full-time workers had a median income of $32,265 versus $32,402 for female full-time workers. The per capita income for the city was $25,904. About 18.7% of families and 21.7% of the population were below the poverty line, including 33.6% of those under age 18 and 13.4% of those aged 65 or over. Per 2007's survey, the median price for a house was $129,600;[88] by 2020, the median price for a house was valued at $252,300, with 54.4% of owner-occupied units from $50,000 to $299,999.[89] The 2022 Point-In-Time Homeless Count found there were 4,410 homeless people in Dallas.[90][91] According to the Metro Dallas Homeless Alliance Continuum of Care 2022 Homeless Count & Survey Independent Analysis, \"approximately 1 of 3 (31%) those experiencing homelessness were found on the streets or in other places not meant for human habitation.\"[91] The region surrounding Dallas is a habitat for mosquitoes, creating a pest problem for humans.

Since then, the non-Hispanic White population has declined to less than one-third of the city's population.[97] According to the 2010 U.S. census, 50.7% of the population was White (28.8% non-Hispanic White), 24.8% was Black or African American, 0.7% American Indian and Alaska Native, 2.9% Asian, and 2.6% from two or more races; 42.4% of the total population was of Hispanic or Latino American origin (they may be of any race).[98] At the U.S. Census Bureau's 2019 estimates, 29.1% were non-Hispanic White 24.3% Black and African American, 0.3% American Indian or Alaska Native, 3.7% Asian, and 1.4% from two or more races.[99] Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islanders made up a total of 312 residents according to 2019's census estimates, down from 606 in 2017.[100] Hispanic or Latino Americans of any race made up 41.2% of the estimated population in 2019. Among the Hispanic or Latino American population in 2019, 34.6% of Dallas was Mexican, 0.4% Puerto Rican, 0.2% Cuban and 6.0% other Hispanic or Latino American. In 2017's American Community Survey estimates among the demographic 35.5% were Mexican, 0.6% Puerto Rican, 0.4% Cuban, and 5.4% other Hispanic or Latino.[101] By 2020, Hispanic or Latino Americans of any race continued to constitute the largest ethnic group in the city proper,[93] reflecting nationwide demographic trends.[102][103][104] The Dallas area is a major living destination for Mexican Americans and other Hispanic and Latino American immigrants. The southwestern portion of the city, particularly Oak Cliff is chiefly inhabited by Hispanic and Latino American residents.[105][106] The southeastern portion of the city Pleasant Grove is chiefly inhabited by African American and Hispanic or Latino American residents, while the southern portion of the city is predominantly black.[107][108] The west and east sides of the city are predominantly Hispanic or Latino American; Garland also has a large Spanish-speaking population. North Dallas has many enclaves of predominantly white, black and especially Hispanic or Latino American residents. The Dallas area is also a major living destination for Black and African Americans primarily due to its strong and diverse economy.[109][110] Between 2010 and 2020, the Dallas area had the second-most new Black and African American residents only behind the Atlanta area and slightly above the Houston area.[111] The notable influx of African Americans is partly due to the New Great Migration.[112] There is a significant number of people from the Horn of Africa, immigrants from Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia.[113] The Dallas\u201a\u00c4\u00ecFort-Worth metroplex had an estimated 70,000 Russian-speakers (as of November 6, 2012) mostly immigrants from the former Soviet Bloc.[114] Included in this population are Russians, Russian Jews, Ukrainians, Belarusians, Moldavians, Uzbek, Kirghiz, and others. The Russian-speaking population of Dallas has continued to grow in the sector of \"American husbands-Russian wives\". Russian DFW has its own newspaper, The Dallas Telegraph.[115][116] In addition, Dallas and its suburbs are home to a large number of Asian Americans including those of Indian, Vietnamese, Chinese, Korean, Filipino, Japanese, and other heritage.[117][118] Among large-sized cities in the United States, Plano, the northern suburb of Dallas, has the 6th largest Chinese American population as of 2016. The Plano-Richardson area in particular had an estimated 30,000 Iranian Americans in 2012.[119][120] With so many immigrant groups, there are often multilingual signs in the linguistic landscape. According to U.S. Census Bureau data released in December 2013, 23 percent of Dallas County residents were foreign-born, while 16 percent of Tarrant County residents were foreign-born.[121] The 2018 census estimates determined that the city of Dallas's foreign-born population consisted of 25.4% naturalized citizens and 74.6% non-citizens.[122]"

Dallas has been called the \"Prison Ministry Capital of the World\" by the prison ministry community.[132] It is a home for the International Network of Prison Ministries, the Coalition of Prison Evangelists, Bill Glass Champions for Life, Chaplain Ray's International Prison Ministry, and 60 other prison ministries.[133] Methodist, Baptist, and Presbyterian churches are prominent in many neighborhoods and anchor two of the city's major private universities (Southern Methodist University and Dallas Baptist University). Dallas is also home to two evangelical seminaries: the Dallas Theological Seminary and Criswell College. Many Bible schools including Christ For The Nations Institute are also headquartered in the city. The Christian creationist apologetics group Institute for Creation Research is headquartered in Dallas. According to the Pew Research Center, evangelical Protestantism constituted the largest form of Protestantism in the area as of 2014.[134] The largest single evangelical Protestant group were Baptists. The largest Baptist denomination was the Southern Baptist Convention, followed by the historically black National Baptist Convention USA.[134] African-initiated Protestant churches including Ethiopian Evangelical churches can be found throughout the metropolitan area.[135][136] The Catholic Church is also a significant religious organization in the Dallas area and operates the University of Dallas, a liberal-arts university in the Dallas suburb of Irving.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has twenty-three stakes throughout Dallas and surrounding suburbs.[140] The organization built the Dallas Texas Temple, the first temple in Texas, in the city in 1984.[141] Jehovah's Witnesses also have a large number of members throughout the Dallas metropolitan division. In addition, there are several Unitarian Universalist congregations, including First Unitarian Church of Dallas, founded in 1899.[142] A large community of the United Church of Christ exists in the city. The most prominent UCC-affiliated church is the Cathedral of Hope, a predominantly LGBT-affirming church.[143] Dallas's Jewish population of 50,000-75,000 is the largest of any city in Texas.[144] Since the establishment of the city's first Jewish cemetery in 1854 and its first congregation (which would eventually be known as Temple Emanu-El) in 1873, Dallasite Jews have been well represented among leaders in commerce, politics, and various professional fields in Dallas and elsewhere.[145][146] Furthermore, a large Muslim community exists in the north and northeastern portions of Dallas, as well as in the northern Dallas suburbs.[147] The oldest mosque in Dallas is Masjid Al-Islam just south of Downtown.[148][149] Dallas has a large Buddhist community. Immigrants from East Asia, Southeast Asia, Nepal, and Sri Lanka have all contributed to the Buddhist population, which is concentrated in the northern suburbs of Garland, Plano and Richardson. Numerous Buddhist temples dot the Metroplex including The Buddhist Center of Dallas, Lien Hoa Vietnamese Temple of Irving, and Kadampa Meditation Center Texas and Wat Buddhamahamunee of Arlington. A large and growing Hindu Community lives in the Dallas\u201a\u00c4\u00ecFort Worth metroplex. Most live in Collin County and the northern portions of Dallas County.

Dallas' key to growth came in 1873 with the construction of multiple rail lines through the city. As Dallas grew and technology developed, cotton became its boon and by 1900, Dallas was the largest inland cotton market in the world, becoming a leader in cotton gin machinery manufacturing. By the early 1900s, Dallas was a hub for economic activity all over the Southern United States and was selected in 1914 as the seat of the Eleventh Federal Reserve District. By 1925, Texas churned out more than 1\u20443 of the nation's cotton crop, with 31% of Texas cotton produced within a 100-mile (160\u00a0km) radius of Dallas. In the 1930s, petroleum was discovered east of Dallas, near Kilgore. Dallas' proximity to the discovery put it immediately at the center of the nation's petroleum market. Petroleum discoveries in the Permian Basin, the Panhandle, the Gulf Coast, and Oklahoma in the following years further solidified Dallas' position as the hub of the market.[163] The end of World War II left Dallas seeded with a nexus of communications, engineering, and production talent by companies such as Collins Radio Corporation. Decades later, the telecommunications and information revolutions still drive a large portion of the local economy. The city is sometimes referred to as the heart of \"Silicon Prairie\" because of a high concentration of telecommunications companies in the region, the epicenter of which lies along the Telecom Corridor in Richardson, a northern suburb of Dallas. The Telecom Corridor is home to more than 5,700 companies including Texas Instruments (headquartered in Dallas), Nortel Networks, Alcatel Lucent, AT&T, Ericsson, Fujitsu, Nokia, Rockwell Collins, Cisco Systems, T-Mobile, Verizon Communications, and CompUSA (which is now headquartered in Miami, Florida).[164] Texas Instruments, a major manufacturer, employs 10,400 people at its corporate headquarters and chip plants in Dallas.[165] In the 1980s Dallas was a real estate hotbed, with the increasing metropolitan population bringing with it a demand for new housing and office space. Several of Downtown Dallas' largest buildings are the fruit of this boom, but over-speculation, the savings and loan crisis and an oil bust brought the 1980s building boom to an end for Dallas as well as its sister city Houston. Between the late 1980s and the early 2000s, central Dallas went through a slow period of growth. However, since the early 2000s the central core of Dallas has been enjoying steady and significant growth encompassing both repurposing of older commercial buildings in Downtown Dallas into residential and hotel uses, as well as the construction of new office and residential towers. The opening of Klyde Warren Park, built across Woodall Rodgers Freeway seamlessly connecting the central Dallas CBD to Uptown/Victory Park, has acted synergistically with the highly successful Dallas Arts District, so both have become catalysts for significant new development in central Dallas. The residential real estate market in the Dallas\u201a\u00c4\u00ecFort Worth metroplex has not only been resilient but has once again returned to a boom status. Dallas and the greater metro area have been leading the nation in apartment construction and net leasing, with rents reaching all-time highs. Single family home sales, whether pre-owned or new construction, along with home price appreciation, were leading the nation since 2015.[166][167] A sudden drop in the price of oil, starting in mid-2014 and accelerating throughout 2015, has not significantly affected Dallas and its greater metro area due to the highly diversified nature of its economy. Dallas and the metropolitan region continue to see strong demand for housing, apartment and office leasing, shopping center space, warehouse and industrial space with overall job growth remaining very robust. Oil-dependent cities and regions have felt significant effects from the downturn, but Dallas's growth has continued unabated, strengthening in 2015. Significant national headquarters relocations to the area (as exemplified by Toyota's decision to leave California and establish its new North American headquarters in the Dallas area) coupled with significant expansions of regional offices for a variety of corporations and along with company relocations to Downtown Dallas helped drive the boom in the Dallas economy. The Dallas\u201a\u00c4\u00ecFort Worth area has one of the largest concentrations of corporate headquarters for publicly traded companies in the United States. Fortune Magazine's 2022 annual list of the Fortune 500 in America indicates the city of Dallas had 11 Fortune 500 companies,.[19] and the DFW region as a whole had 23.[18] As of 2022, Dallas\u201a\u00c4\u00ecFort Worth represents the second-largest concentration of Fortune 500 headquarters in Texas and fourth-largest in the United States, behind the metropolitan areas of Houston (24), Chicago (35) and New York (62).[18] In 2008, AT&T relocated their headquarters to Downtown Dallas;[168] AT&T is the largest telecommunications company in the world and was the ninth largest company in the nation by revenue for 2017.[169] Additional Fortune 500 companies headquartered in Dallas in order of ranking include Energy Transfer Equity, CBRE (which moved its headquarters from Los Angeles to Dallas in 2020),[170][171] Tenet Healthcare, Southwest Airlines, Texas Instruments, Jacobs Engineering, HollyFrontier, Dean Foods, and Builders FirstSource. In October 2016, Jacobs Engineering, one of the world's largest engineering companies, relocated from Pasadena, California to Downtown Dallas.[172] Nearby Irving is home to six Fortune 500 companies of its own, including McKesson, the country's largest pharmaceutical distributor and listed at number seven overall on the 2021 Fortune 500 list,[173][174][175] Fluor (engineering), Kimberly-Clark, Celanese, Michaels Companies, and Vistra Energy.[176] Plano is home to an additional four Fortune 500 companies, including J.C. Penney, Alliance Data Systems, Yum China, and Dr. Pepper Snapple.[176] Fort Worth is home to two Fortune 500 companies, including American Airlines, the largest airline in the world by revenue, fleet size, profit, passengers carried and revenue passenger mile and D.R. Horton, the largest homebuilder in America.[176] Westlake, TX, north of Fort Worth, now has two Fortune 500 companies: Financial services giant, Charles Schwab, and convenience store distributor, Core-Mark.[177][178] One Fortune 500 company, GameStop, is based in Grapevine. Additional major companies headquartered in Dallas and its metro area include Comerica, which relocated its national headquarters to Downtown Dallas from Detroit in 2007,[179] NTT DATA Services, Regency Energy Partners, Atmos Energy, Neiman Marcus, AECOM, Think Finance, 7-Eleven, Brinker International, Primoris Services, AMS Pictures, id Software, Mary Kay Cosmetics, Chuck E. Cheese's, Zale Corporation, and Fossil, Inc. Many of these companies\u201a\u00c4\u00eeand others throughout the DFW metroplex\u201a\u00c4\u00eecomprise the Dallas Regional Chamber. Susan G. Komen for the Cure, the world's largest breast cancer organization, was founded and is headquartered in Dallas.[180] In addition to its large number of businesses, Dallas has more shopping centers per capita than any other city in the United States and is also home to the second shopping center ever built in the United States, Highland Park Village, which opened in 1931.[181] Dallas is home of the two other major malls in North Texas, the Dallas Galleria and NorthPark Center, which is the second largest mall in Texas. Both malls feature high-end stores and are major tourist draws for the region.[182][183] According to Forbes magazine's annual list of \"The Richest People in America\" published September 21, 2011, the city is home to 17 billionaires, up from 14 in 2009. In 2009 (with 14 billionaires) the city placed sixth worldwide among cities with the most billionaires.[184][185] Dallas is the third most popular destination for business travel in the United States, and the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center is one of the largest and busiest convention centers in the country, at over 1,000,000 square feet (93,000\u00a0m2), and the world's single-largest column-free exhibit hall.[186] VisitDallas is the 501(c)(6) organization contracted to promote tourism and attract conventions but an audit released in January 2019 cast doubts on its effectiveness in achieving those goals.[187]"

Meyerson Symphony Center, home to the Dallas Symphony Orchestra and Dallas Wind Symphony; the Nasher Sculpture Center; and the Trammell & Margaret Crow Collection of Asian Art. The Perot Museum of Nature and Science, also in Downtown Dallas, is a natural history and science museum. Designed by 2005 Pritzker Architecture Prize Laureate Thom Mayne and his firm Morphosis Architects, the 180,000-square-foot (17,000\u00a0m2) facility has six floors and stands about 14 stories high. Venues that are part of the AT&T Dallas Center for the Performing Arts include Moody Performance Hall, home to the Dallas Chamber Symphony; the Dee and Charles Wyly Theatre, home to the Dallas Theater Center and the Dallas Black Dance Theater; and the Winspear Opera House, home to the Dallas Opera and Texas Ballet Theater.[189][190] Not far north of the area is the Meadows Museum at Southern Methodist University. In 2009, it joined up with Madrid's Prado Museum for a three-year partnership. The Prado focuses on Spanish visual art and has a collection of Spanish art in North America, with works by de Juanes, El Greco, Fortuny, Goya, Murillo, Picasso, Pkensa, Ribera, Rico, Velasquez, Zurbaran, and other Spaniards. These works, as well as non-Spanish highlights like sculptures by Rodin and Moore, have been so successful of a collaboration that the Prado and Meadows have agreed upon an extension of the partnership.[191] The Institute for Creation Research operates the ICR Discovery Center for Science & Earth History, a creationism museum, in Dallas.[192] The former Texas School Book Depository, from which, according to the Warren Commission Report, Lee Harvey Oswald shot and killed President John F. Kennedy in 1963, has served since the 1980s as a county government office building, except for its sixth and seventh floors, which house the Sixth Floor Museum. The American Museum of the Miniature Arts is at the Hall of State in Fair Park. The Arts District is also home to DISD's Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts, a magnet school that was recently expanded.[193] City Center District, next to the Arts District, is home to the Dallas Contemporary. Deep Ellum, immediately east of Downtown, originally became popular during the 1920s and 1930s as the prime jazz and blues hot spot in the South.[194] Artists such as Blind Lemon Jefferson, Robert Johnson, Huddie \"Lead Belly\" Ledbetter, and Bessie Smith played in original Deep Ellum clubs such as the Harlem and the Palace. Today, Deep Ellum is home to hundreds of artists who live in lofts and operate in studios throughout the district alongside bars, pubs, and concert venues.[195] A major art infusion in the area results from the city's lax stance on graffiti, and a number of public spaces, including tunnels, sides of buildings, sidewalks, and streets, are covered in murals. One major example, the Good-Latimer tunnel, was torn down in late 2006 to accommodate the construction of a light rail line through the site.[196] Like Deep Ellum before it, the Cedars neighborhood to the south of Downtown has also seen a growing population of studio artists and an expanding roster of entertainment venues. The area's art scene began to grow in the early 2000s with the opening of Southside on Lamar, an old Sears Roebuck and Company warehouse converted into lofts, studios, and retail.[197] Current attractions include Gilley's Dallas and Poor David's Pub.[198][199] Dallas Mavericks owner and local entrepreneur Mark Cuban purchased land along Lamar Street near Cedars Station in September 2005, and locals speculate he is planning an entertainment complex for the site.[200] South of the Trinity River, the Bishop Arts District in Oak Cliff is home to a number of studio artists living in converted warehouses. Walls of buildings along alleyways and streets are painted with murals, and the surrounding streets contain many eclectic restaurants and shops.[201] Dallas has an Office of Cultural Affairs as a department of the city government. The office is responsible for six cultural centers throughout the city, funding for local artists and theaters, initiating public art projects, and running the city-owned classical radio station WRR.[202] The Los Angeles-class submarine USS Dallas was planned to become a museum ship near the Trinity River after her decommissioning in September 2014, but this has since been delayed.[203] It will be taken apart into massive sections in Houston and be transported by trucks to the museum site and will be put back together."

The city also hosts the State Fair Classic and Heart of Dallas Bowl at the Cotton Bowl. Other festivals include several Cinco de Mayo celebrations hosted by the city's large Mexican American population and a Saint Patrick's Day parade along Lower Greenville Avenue, Juneteenth festivities, Taste of Dallas, the Deep Ellum Arts Festival, the Greek Food Festival of Dallas, the annual Halloween event \"The Wake\", and two annual events on Halloween, including a Halloween parade on Cedar Springs Road and a \"Zombie Walk\" held in Downtown Dallas in the Arts District. With the opening of Victory Park, WFAA began hosting an annual New Year's Eve celebration in AT&T Plaza that the television station hoped would be reminiscent of celebrations in New York's Times Square; New Year's Eve 2011 set a new record of 32,000 people in attendance.[209] After the discontinuance of the \"Big D NYE\" festivities a few years later, a new end-of-year event was started downtown, with a big fireworks show put on at Reunion Tower, which has since aired on KXAS and other TV stations around the state and region.

He ran and was elected as a Democrat.[g] However, the city is normally a Democratic stronghold, with over 69% of voters supporting Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election and 67% of voters supporting Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election (excluding write-ins).[252] Democratic voters dominate the majority of the city, especially the central urban core and southern sectors, with Republicans spreading a sliver of suburban neighborhoods in North Dallas. In the 2004 U.S. presidential election, 57% of Dallas voters voted for John Kerry over George W. Bush.[253] Dallas County was closely divided, with 50% of voters voting for Bush and 49% voting for Kerry.[254] Results in the 2008 and 2012 elections favored Barack Obama, with the 44th President receiving 57% of Dallas County voters in both years, with greater margins in the city of Dallas. In the 2016 U.S. presidential election, approximately 66% of Dallas voters voted for Hillary Clinton, with 28% of city voters voting for Donald Trump.[252] Dallas County as a whole saw 61% of voters voting for Clinton, with 35% support for Trump.[252] In 2004, Lupe Valdez was elected Dallas County Sheriff. An open lesbian, Valdez was the only female sheriff in the state of Texas until her resignation. Despite controversies in her handling of county jails, she won re-election in 2008 with a 10-point victory over Republican challenger Lowell Cannaday.[255]"

WHISD students started attending other Dallas ISD schools during that time. Following the close, the Texas Education Agency consolidated WHISD into Dallas ISD.[282] In 2003 Royce Hanson, author of Civic Culture and Urban Change: Governing Dallas, stated that the Plano, Richardson, and Wilmer-Hutchins school districts were the \"most significant\" of the public school students with students in Dallas who were not in Dallas ISD.[277] Many school districts in Dallas County, including Dallas ISD, were formerly served by a governmental agency called Dallas County Schools. The system provided busing and other transportation services, access to a massive media library, technology services, strong ties to local organizations for education/community integration, and staff development programs.[283]"

H. Belo and is A. H. Belo's flagship newspaper. The Dallas Times Herald, started in 1888, was the Morning News' major competitor until Belo purchased it on December 8, 1991, and closed the paper down the next day. Other daily newspapers are Al D\u221a\u2260a, a Spanish-language paper published by Belo, and a number of ethnic newspapers printed in languages such as Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese. Other publications include the Dallas Weekly and the Elite News, all weekly news publications. The Dallas Observer and the North Texas Journal are also alternative weekly newspapers. The Dallas Morning News formerly had a weekly publication, Neighborsgo, which came out every Friday and focused on community news. Readers could post stories and contribute content to the website. D Magazine is a notable monthly magazine about business, life, and entertainment in Dallas\u201a\u00c4\u00ecFort Worth. Local visitor magazines include \"WHERE Magazine\" and \"Travelhost\"\u201a\u00c4\u00ecavailable at hotel desks or in guest rooms. In addition, the park cities and suburbs such as Plano also have their own community newspapers. Also, THE Magazine covers the contemporary arts scene.[285] In terms of the larger metro area, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram is another major daily newspaper, covering Fort Worth's metropolitan division. It also publishes a major Spanish-language newspaper for the entire metro area known as La Estrella.[286] To the north of Dallas and Fort Worth, the Denton Record-Chronicle primarily covers news for the city of Denton and Denton County. Area television stations affiliated with the major broadcasting networks (network O&O's highlighted in bold) include KDFW 4 (Fox), KXAS 5 (NBC), WFAA 8 (ABC) (which for many years was owned by Belo alongside the Morning News), KTVT 11 (CBS), KERA 13 (PBS), KUVN 23 (UNI), KDFI 27 (MNTV), KDAF 33 (The CW), and KXTX 39 (TMD). KTXA 21 is an independent station formerly affiliated with the now-defunct UPN network. Over 101 radio stations operate within range of Dallas.[287] The city of Dallas operates WRR 101.1 FM, the area's main classical music station, from city offices in Fair Park.[288] Its original sister station, licensed as WRR-AM in 1921, is the oldest commercially operated radio station in Texas and the second-oldest in the United States, after KDKA (AM) in Pittsburgh.[289] KKDA, an urban contemporary station, and KRNB, an urban adult contemporary station, are owned independently by Service Broadcasting Corporation. Because of the city's central geographical position and lack of nearby mountainous terrain, high-power class A medium-wave stations KRLD and WBAP can broadcast as far as southern Canada at night and can be used for emergency messages when broadcasting is down in other major metropolitan areas in the United States. Slavic Voice of America media group serves Russian-speaking Americans out of Dallas. Hispanic Broadcasting Corporation (HBC), the largest company in the Spanish-language radio station business, is based in Dallas.[290] In 2003, HBC was acquired by Univision and became Univision Radio Inc., but the radio company remains headquartered in the city.[291]"

Starting from the center of the city, a small freeway loop surrounds Downtown, followed by the I-635 loop about 10 miles (16\u00a0km) outside Downtown, and ultimately the tolled President George Bush Turnpike. Inside these freeway loops are other boulevard- and parkway-style loops, including Loop 12 and Belt Line Road. Another beltway around the city upwards of 45 miles (72\u00a0km) from Downtown is under plan in Collin County. Radiating out of Downtown Dallas' freeway loop are the spokes of the area's highway system\u201a\u00c4\u00eeInterstates 30, 35E, and 45, US 75, US 77, US 175, SH Spur 366, the Dallas North Tollway, SH 114, US 80, and US 67.

Alliance Airport, in far North Fort Worth, is a cargo reliever airport to DFW Airport and general aviation facility. DFW Airport is in the suburbs slightly north of and equidistant to Downtown Fort Worth and Downtown Dallas. In terms of size, DFW International is the largest airport in the state, the second largest in the United States, and ninth largest in the world; DFW International Airport is larger than the island of Manhattan.[303] In terms of traffic, DFW Airport is the busiest airport in the state, fourth-busiest in the United States, and eleventh-busiest in the world. The headquarters of American Airlines, the largest air carrier in the world ahead of United Airlines and Delta Air Lines, is less than one mile (1.6\u00a0km) from DFW Airport within Fort Worth's city limits.

DART began operating the first light rail system in Texas in 1996, and it is now the largest operator of light rail in the US.[304] Today, the system is the seventh-busiest light rail system in the country with approximately 55 stations on 72 miles (116\u00a0km) of light rail, and 10 stations on 35 miles (56\u00a0km) of commuter rail.[305] It includes four light rail lines and a commuter line: the Red Line, the Blue Line, the Green Line, the Orange Line, and the Trinity Railway Express. The Red Line travels through Oak Cliff, South Dallas, Downtown, Uptown, North Dallas, Richardson and Plano, while the Blue Line goes through Oak Cliff, Downtown, Uptown, East Dallas, Lake Highlands, and Garland. The Red and Blue lines are conjoined between 8th & Corinth Station in Oak Cliff through Mockingbird Station in North Dallas. The two lines service Cityplace Station. The Green Line serves Carrollton, Farmers Branch, Love Field Airport, Stemmons Corridor, Victory Park, Downtown, Deep Ellum, Fair Park, South Dallas, and Pleasant Grove. The Orange Line initially operated as a peak-service line providing extra capacity on portions of the Green and Red Lines (Bachman Station on the Green Line, through the Downtown transit mall, to Parker Road Station on the Red Line making a \"U\"-shape). However, the first stage of the Orange Line opened on December 6, 2010, extending its west end from Bachman to Belt Line Station in Irving. The second and final phase opened in August 2014 and provided DFW Airport with rail service. DFW Airport Terminal A station is the terminus for the Orange Line and connects Skylink.[306] This provides passengers the convenience of disembarking the DART rail, proceeding to security check-in and immediately boarding Skylink to be quickly transported to their desired terminal. The Blue Line has also been extended by 4.5 miles (7.2\u00a0km) to serve Rowlett at the Rowlett Park & Ride facility.[307] In August 2009, the Regional Transportation Council agreed to seek $96\u00a0million in federal stimulus dollars for a trolley project in Dallas and Fort Worth. The Oak Cliff Transit Authority took the lead with leaders envisioning a streetcar line that would link Union Station and the Dallas Convention Center in Downtown to Oak Cliff, Methodist Medical Center, and the Bishop Arts District via the Houston Street Viaduct.[308] Dallas was awarded a $23\u00a0million TIGER grant towards the $58\u00a0million Dallas Streetcar Project in February 2010.[309] In addition to light rail, Amtrak's Texas Eagle also serves Union Station, providing daily service east to Chicago and west to San Antonio, and thrice-weekly service west to Los Angeles. The Trinity Rail Express terminates at Union Station and T&P Station."

The state of Kelantan had the most evacuees (20,468[9] to 24,765), followed by Terengganu (21,606), Pahang (10,825), Perak (1,030), Sabah (336) and Perlis (143).[10][11] The situation continues to worsen in Kelantan and Terengganu, due to heavy rain. Most roads in Kelantan have been closed.[12] The worst-hit district in Terengganu is Kemaman, followed by Dungun, Kuala Terengganu, Hulu Terengganu, Besut and Marang. In Pahang, the worst-hit areas are Kuantan, Maran, Jerantut, Lipis and Pekan.[12] Dozens of foreign tourists were stranded at a resort in a Malaysian national park in Pahang. Most were travellers from Canada, Britain, Australia and Romania.[13] All were rescued via boat and helicopter.[3] In Kedah, at least 51 people were evacuated.[14] A teenager in Perlis was the first victim to die in this flood.[15] In southern Malaysia, between 300 and 350 people have been displaced in both Johor and Negeri Sembilan.[16][17] The number of evacuees nationwide reached more than 200,000 by 28 December, with 10 people killed. The flooding is considered the country's worst in decades.[3][18][19] However, the exact numbers of evacuees, missing persons and deaths are unknown, as the Malaysian flood centre was unable to provide any accurate figures.[20] Some victim were found in miserable condition as the victim had to survive on one meal of rice a day after he was stranded in the floods.[21] On 31 December, a Royal Malaysia Police Ecureuill AS 355F2 helicopter crashed during a patrol in Kelantan, injuring four crews on board.[22] In Sabah, heavy rains since 21 December resulted in flooding throughout most areas in the district of Beaufort. As many as 30 villages were severely affected due to the water level of Padas River rising up to 9.26 metres above the danger level, with the floods caused mainly by the overflow of water from the river's upper reaches in the Tenom district.[23] About 292 people were evacuated as the flood situation worsened in Beaufort, while the condition improved in the interior districts of Tenom and Kemabong.[24] The number of victims increased to 300 overnight.[25] Most victims in Tenom were able to return home, with only one of the eleven flood relief centres still operational as water levels receded.[26] However, more relief centres are expected to be opened if the rain continues and the water from upper Tenom and Keningau flood the Padas River.[27] In Kudat, 9 families comprising 63 people were affected by floods and have sought shelter at relatives' and neighbours' houses.[26][27] In Sarawak, several villages in upper Baram hit by floods on 29 December.[28] As of 2 January 2015, floodwaters continued to recede and the number of evacuees in Kelantan, Terengganu, Pahang and Perak continued to reduce while the state of Sabah once again prepared for rising numbers of evacuees as floodwaters has started to rise in Kota Belud.[29] Over 1,000 people been evacuated in northern Sabah during the floods.[30] On 3 January, the area of south-western Sipitang district was flooded while floods in the northern Sabah including Kota Belud, Kota Marudu and Pitas had receded.[31] In Tawau, three primary schools were also affected by floods but the waters began to recede at the afternoon.[32]"

One mother was forced to feed her 6 months old infant with formula milk mixed with rainwater. However, flood victims still have rice, bread, canned sardines and egg for dinner at a relief centre.[46] Some unregistered flood victims claimed that they were denied help from NGOs when they tried to stop the NGOs at the side of the road. Tissue papers drenched in cooking oil was used to provide light when there was no electricity or candles supplies.[47] Some flood victims were worried of that their valuables were being stolen from their homes and they have to swim back to their homes every day to check on their items.[47] Prices of essential items were artificially raised. For example, one bottle of water costs MYR5, one large candle costs MYR14, l.5 litres of petrol costs MYR12, and one can of sardines costs MYR8. Some boat owners charged MYR5 for crossing Pahang River and MYR15 for longer journeys.[48] Nevertheless, some quarters argued that the flood has united all Malaysians together to help each other regardless of race, religion, or political stance.[49] Many flood victims in Kelantan, Malaysia, started to cross Golok River into Su-ngai Kolok town to buy essential items at Su-ngai Kolok Municipality Market.[50][51]"

This measure is recommended in order to mobilise all the machinery of the government to tackle the flood situation.[92] However, prime minister Najib decided that state of emergency is not needed because insurance companies will not be paying compensations to the victims as damages will be included in \"force majeure\" category.[93] However, the opposition dismissed such explanation by Najib[94] and insurance companies clarifies that as long as flood is covered in a policy, flood victims would be eligible for their claims.[95] Nik Muhammad Abduh, the son of PAS leader Nik Abdul Aziz Nik Mat, said that the flood is due to the wrath of Allah. Therefore, the Kelantan state government must enforce \"hudud\" law, despite widespread opposition against the law.[96] However, the state assembly building where the state government is supposed to table a hudud law has been waterlogged since 25 December.[97] This has caused the state government to postpone the special sitting to a later date.[98] However, the state government was told to help flood victims first instead of focusing on the hudud issue.[99] Muhammad V of Kelantan called for more environmentally friendly measures to prevent such flooding from happening again.[100] Rescue missions have been difficult, due to uncertain weather conditions and some residents' refusal to evacuate.[101][102] A village head at Kampung Jimah, Lukut, Negeri Sembilan, attempted to chase away opposition representatives who sought to provide aid to victims' families.[103] In another instance, opposition representatives were shooed away by local authorities when they attempted to provide aid at a relief centre in Kluang, Johor.[104]"

The cyclone was the second cyclone and only severe tropical cyclone of the relatively inactive 2000\u201301 South Pacific cyclone season. Cyclone Paula developed from an area of disturbed weather embedded within a monsoon trough on February 25, 2001, near Vanuatu. Situated in an area of favorable conditions, Paula steadily intensified as it moved in a general direction towards the southeast. On March 1, Paula reached peak intensity with winds of 175\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph), sustained for ten minutes. However, the cyclone began to accelerate further to the southeast into more unfavorable conditions. As a result, Paula quickly weakened, and thus degenerated into an extratropical cyclone on March 4."

        "content": "The low pressure area that would eventually develop into Cyclone Paula was first identified at 1800\u00a0UTC on February 25, embedded within a monsoon trough 340\u00a0km (210\u00a0mi) south of Espiritu Santo, Vanuatu.[1] At the time, the system was positioned under an upper-level outflow center and located in an area of warm sea surface temperatures (SSTs) of about 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F).[2][3] Early the next day, a sharp increase in oceanic heat content triggered a rapid burst of convection in the northern and eastern quadrants of the system. Associated rainbands also began to increasingly curve toward the circulation center of the low pressure area. An expanding circulation center and persistently deep convection allowed barometric pressures within the system to steadily fall. QuikSCAT and SSM/I data indicated that winds of gale force were persisting in northeastern areas of the system. As a result, the storm system was upgraded to cyclone status and was given the name Paula at 1200\u00a0UTC on February 26 by the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center in Nadi, Fiji (RSMC Nadi).[1] The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also began to track the system, issuing its first cyclone warning on the same day at 1500\u00a0UTC, noting at the cyclone's persistent deep convection.[4] At the time of its naming, Cyclone Paula was moving towards the southeast at 20\u00a0km/h (10\u00a0mph).[1] In an area of weak steering currents, Paula began to move in a small, clockwise loop.[3] Quickly intensifying under favorable conditions and an environment of low wind shear, the cyclone reached Category\u00a02 status on the Australian cyclone scale at 0000\u00a0UTC on February 27, with winds of 90\u00a0km/h (55\u00a0mph), sustained for ten minutes.[2] After completing its small cyclonic loop, the cyclone developed a small central dense overcast (CDO), containing a ragged eye. Throughout the day the eye became increasingly better defined as the cyclone accelerated towards the southeast. Still strengthening, Cyclone Paula moved across the Vanuatu island chain, making landfall just north of Port Vila, Vanuatu at 1200\u00a0UTC on February 28 with winds of 155\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph), sustained for ten minutes. After passing Vanuatu, Paula moved towards Fiji, quickly passing the island to the south.[1] The cyclone made its closest pass to Fiji at 1800\u00a0UTC on March 1, 145\u00a0km (90\u00a0mi) south-southwest of Kadavu Island. Operationally, it was believed that Paula peaked at intensity at this time according to RSMC Nadi with ten-minute sustained winds of 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph),[3]  but this was revised to 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 935\u00a0mbar (27.6\u00a0inHg) in post-season analysis.[1][3] After passing to the south of Fiji, Cyclone Paula quickly accelerated into an area of strong vertical wind shear, due to a strong northwesterly wind current. As a result, the cyclone promptly began to quickly weaken, with maximum ten-minute sustained winds dropping by 55\u00a0km/h (34\u00a0mph) in 30\u00a0hours. After passing 350\u00a0km (220\u00a0mi) south of Tonga,[2] Cyclone Paula moved into the Tropical Cyclone Warning Center in Wellington, New Zealand's (TCWC Wellington) area of responsibility. Still weakening, Paula transitioned into an extratropical cyclone at 0600\u00a0UTC on March 4,[3] 1,700\u00a0km (1,100\u00a0mi) east-northeast of the northern tip of New Zealand.[2] The JTWC subsequently issued their final warning on the system at 1200\u00a0UTC, later that day.[5]"

Areas in the western parts of Espiritu Santo experienced damage due to strong winds and flooding in low-lying areas due to Cyclone Paula, forcing the evacuation of communities to higher ground. Trees were also uprooted, causing damage to communication lines and resulting in power outages.[6] An estimated 45\u201350%\u00a0of all houses and gardens in Vanuatu were reported to have been damaged by the cyclone, as well as 25%\u00a0of other infrastructure.[7] A 19-year-old boy drowned in floodwaters caused by Paula after trying to get his canoe to safety.[6]"

Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina suffered the greatest damage, as the rain was the heaviest in 120 years of recorded weather measurements.[10][11] By 20 May, at least 62 people had died as a result of the flooding, and hundreds of thousands had been forced from their homes. Towns of Obrenovac in Serbia and Doboj in Bosnia and Herzegovina account for most victims, after being inundated by several-meter high waters from nearby rivers.[12] Floodwaters caused over 2,000 landslides across Southeast Europe, spreading damage across many towns and villages.[13] The rains activated torrents and mudslides, and subsequently several rivers in watersheds of Sava and Morava rose and flooded surrounding valleys. Official counts indicate that over 1.6 million people were affected in Serbia and Bosnia, after a week of flooding.[14] Assessments of the damage range up to \u20ac3.5 billion for Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina.[15] Damage in Serbia, jointly estimated by EU, World Bank group and UN officials, stands at 1,55 billion euros.[16] Officials in Bosnia stated that the damage could exceed that of the Bosnian War.[17] The events initiated a large international aid campaign, with numerous countries, organizations and individuals donating humanitarian, material and monetary support for the affected areas."

The cold polar air mass met with humid subtropical air, leading to very low pressure. On 14 May, the low moved over Southeast Europe, becoming stationary. As a result, extremely heavy rain fell within the region; Serbia (in the area around Belgrade) and Bosnia were most affected.[18] Serbian and Bosnian meteorologists named the formed cyclone \"Tamara\".[19][20] On 15 May, the daily amounts of rainfall broke historical records in Belgrade (107.9\u00a0mm), Valjevo (108.2\u00a0mm) and Loznica (110\u00a0mm).[21] By 15 May, the monthly rainfall in Belgrade had broken the historical record (175\u00a0L from 1897), reaching 205\u00a0L.[22] By Saturday, May 17, the rain had subsided, and the weather gradually became warmer and sunnier, somewhat easing relief and rescue efforts. On 18 May, the cyclone moved further northwest.[20] The main flooding region was the watershed of the Sava river, which forms a border between Bosnia and Croatia, flows into Serbia, and drains into the Danube in Belgrade. On Wednesday, 14 May, heavy rainfall caused torrential floods across mountainous regions, which destroyed bridges and infrastructure, and caused numerous landslides. The deadliest impact occurred on Thursday, 15 May, when water levels in several right-bank tributaries of the Sava suddenly and uncontrollably rose at an unprecedented rate, flooding towns in their valleys. The Bosna river in central Bosnia completely flooded the cities of Doboj, Maglaj, Zavidovi\u0107i and \u0160amac, while the Kolubara, near Belgrade, did the same to Obrenovac; those cities had the major share of victims. Subsequently, the Sava itself rose to record-high levels, threatening the cities of Slavonski Brod, \u0160abac and Sremska Mitrovica and numerous villages, but the damage was relatively contained as the population, helped by army and volunteers, strengthened flood defenses. Nonetheless, embankments gave way in several places. Heavy rainfall was also experienced in the region on 3 and 4 May, affecting Romania, Italy and Bosnia. The event produced limited damage but left a number of flooding incidents and high rivers.[23] A state of emergency was declared in parts of Bosnia by local government."

        "content": "Though heaviest affected areas were in the valleys of the Sava and Kolubara rivers, the center of the flood was the drainage basin of the Bosna river and its mouth into the Sava. Water in the Sava then broke through the newly constructed embankment on the left bank in Croatia and flooded the Lower Syrmia region. The water then uncontrollably rushed into the Bosut river which flows back into the Sava in Serbia. In Serbia, the heaviest floods were in the Kolubara river basin where the major rainfall caused extreme torrents in the mountains, causing the hydrological coincidence, a fact that high tidal waves appeared simultaneously on both the left and the right tributaries of the Kolubara. Rivers of Pe\u0161tan and Vrani\u010dina also spilled over, flooding the surface mine \"Tamnava-Zapadna Polje\", within the Kolubara mines (see Lake Paljuvi). The flooded mines captured 200 million m3 of the flood water.[24] Belgrade's Institute \"Jaroslav \u010cerni\", funded by UNDP, compiled a study \"Improvement of the water protection in the Kolubara drainage basin\". Hydrological section of the report concludes that the cyclone caused the \"continual rain of temperate intensity\", which however lasted for too long (over three days). In May, the measured 48-hours rainfall was higher than the millennial rains in Loznica while the return period in Belgrade and Valjevo was 400 years. Return periods of the flow in the Kolubara was 120\u2013520 and at the confluence into the Sava, when the Kolubara flooded Obrenovac and the mines, the discharge was 1,456\u00a0m3/s (51,400\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s). If the system against the floods was finished and functioning properly, and that mines and Obrenovac weren't flooded, the discharge would be 2,460\u00a0m3/s (87,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s).[24] In the drainage basin of the Bosna river in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the rains in some places were exceeding the return period of 5,000 years (Vidmar A., et al., \"The Bosna River floods in May 2014\", Journal on Flood Risk, p.\u00a01\u201325). At the same time, during the massive overspill in the basin, the return period of the maximal discharge (4,121\u00a0m3/s (145,500\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s), 15 May 2014) was only 152 years and of the wave volume (1,463,000,000\u00a0m3 (5.17\u00d71010\u00a0cu\u00a0ft)) was 189 years. After the reconstruction of the flood in the controlled environment, it was concluded that the discharge of the Bosna at Doboj would be 5,000\u00a0m3/s (180,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s) on 16 May 2014. A discharge of the Sava, right after the mouth of the Bosna, at the \u0160amac bridge, was 6,000\u00a0m3/s (210,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s) on 17 May (Abdulaj R., et al., Velike vode donjeg toka rijeke Save tijekom svibnja 2014, Hrvatska vodoprivreda, 207, 14\u201316, 2014). Downstream, in Sremska Mitrovica in Serbia, the discharge of the Sava was 6,420\u00a0m3/s (227,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s) (Hidrolo\u0161ki godi\u0161njak RHMZ Srbije za 2014).[24] If the entire flood control system in all three countries functioned, and that there were no overspills and floods, a hydrological coincidence of joining the highest Sava and Kolubara water levels would occur. That means that in Belgrade, downstream from the mouth of Kolubara into the Sava, the Sava would bring almost 9,000\u00a0m3/s (320,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s). The riparian zone along the Sava in Belgrade, called Savski Nasip and enhanced with the embankments, is designed for receiving 6,500\u00a0m3/s (230,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s), so the city would probably suffer a major damage. Additionally, due to the illegal construction of the houses in the Savski Nasip area, the riparian zone is being destroyed and its volume is reduced.[24]"

The entire city was evacuated.[27][28] During 18 May, the water level dropped, which enabled the evacuation of the citizens of Obrenovac to be carried out by trucks instead of boats.[29] As of 20 May the total number of evacuated persons exceeded 30,000.[30] In Krupanj in western Serbia (located in a valley of several small rivers) torrents, mudslides and landslides devastated the infrastructure and destroyed dozens of houses. Because of road damages, the town was completely inaccessible for three days, and the road to Loznica was blocked until 18 May. Electric power was cut for almost the whole municipality.[31] Around 500 houses were seriously damaged and at least 20 houses are completely uninhabitable[32] Part of the village of Rebelj in Valjevo municipality was annihilated by landslides.[33] In the Drina river valley, on the border with Bosnia, heavy rain activated landslides, cutting off several villages and closing roads. At Mali Zvornik, a giant hill threatened to slide into the river and cut its flow, endangering that town and Zvornik across the river.[27][34] Peak flood waters from Sava river hit \u0160abac on 18 May, but the embankments survived, strengthened by efforts of the army and several thousands volunteers. Flood waters on the river reached 6.3 metres (21\u00a0ft), the highest on record, endangering \u0160abac and Sremska Mitrovica on the left bank.[26] In anticipation of the floods, a 7.3-metre-tall (24\u00a0ft) temporary embankment was erected.[26] Further east, along the valleys of Morava and Mlava rivers, city centers of Para\u0107in, Petrovac na Mlavi, Svilajnac and Smederevska Palanka were flooded.[28][35] During the flooding period, an estimated 300,000 households were left without electric power.[36] Serbia's energy minister, Aleksandar Anti\u0107, has appealed to individuals to conserve power as best they can.[13] The largest thermoelectric power plant in Serbia, TPP Nikola Tesla, which supplies close to 50% of electricity in Serbia, lies in the vicinity of Obrenovac, but was saved from danger. However, flood waters filled the largest coal field of RB Kolubara with 210 million cubic meters of water, more than the volume of Vlasina lake, and its pumping out is expected to take months.[37] Further east, the thermoelectric power plant TPP Kostolac, which supplies 11% of electricity in Serbia, was threatened by floods from the Mlava river, but the water had not breached the innermost ring of defenses. During the floods, the hydro plants at Iron Gates reduced their production and opened the gates in order to lower the level of the Danube.[37] During the floods, transport across the country, particularly central and western parts, was interrupted or broken.[citation needed] 2,260 public, industrial and infrastructure facilities were flooded, and 3,500 roads were destroyed.[27] The Belgrade\u2013Bar railway was severed at several locations in western Serbia, and has been closed; basic reparations took about a month to complete, and afterwards the trains were forced to take a several-hours detour. Reconstruction of the section in the Gradac river canyon was finished in March 2015, allowing the trains to return to the original route.[38] Agricultural damage in affected areas was total, and the amount is yet to be determined. Thousands of cows, sheep, chicken and other domestic animals perished in the floods, and their corpses present a serious health risk for people who started returning and repairing their homes. On 20 May, the Government of Serbia proclaimed 3 days of mourning.[27][39] Serbian Prime Minister Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107 described the flooding as \"the worst natural catastrophe that has ever hit Serbia.\"[citation needed] In a July 2014 report by the Government of Serbia, the total amount of damage in the country was estimated at 1.53 billion Euro. Of those, 810 million was attributed to direct damage, and 662 million to losses. Two thirds of the damage was attributed to the production sector (500 million direct and 569 million indirect), of which 228 million in the agricultural sector. Total damage on the housing was 227.3 million, while the infrastructure damage (transportation, communications and water management) was assessed at 192 million.[40]"

A state of emergency was declared across the nation.[26] Herzegovina in the south and central regions were not hit by floods. The town of Maglaj experienced the average rainfall of two months in under 48 hours.[26] In the city of Zavidovi\u0107i, a footbridge was filmed being swept down the Bosna river and crashing into another bridge.[42] In Sarajevo, the Miljacka river swelled almost to the level of city bridges.[41] The entire hamlet of Pari\u0107i in Hrasno Donje, municipality of Kalesija, was swept away by landslides.[43] As of 20 May, there were 24 confirmed deaths in Bosnia and Herzegovina: 17 in Republika Srpska and 7 in the Federation.[44] At a press conference on 19 May, the Director of Police of Republika Srpska gave the names of 17 confirmed victims: 10 in Doboj, 2 in \u0160amac, 2 in Modri\u010da and one each in Bijeljina, Vlasenica and Donji \u017dabar; an additional 7 persons are still listed as missing.[45] Governments of the two entities jointly declared 20 May a day of mourning across the country.[44] It was speculated that the floodwaters might have disturbed land mines left over from the Bosnian War (1992\u201395) which could cause further danger if moved outside the marked areas.[13] The chief executive of \u017deljeznice Republike Srpske, the railway operator in Republika Srpska (one of two railway operators in Bosnia) appealed for help in repairing the enormous damage to the railways in the country, stating that they were independently unable to repair the damage, appealing for help from the international community in supplying materials, mechanisation and financial assistance.[46]"

At that point the embankments were under severe pressure caused by the huge amount of water coming from Bosnia. Several officials stated that if this embankment were breached, the entire region of southern Slavonia, with a population of over 300 000, would be flooded.[49] There were also floods in Banovina region, in the towns of Hrvatska Kostajnica and Dvor, mostly caused by the river Una, whose level had not been as high since 1955.[50]\nVideo: http://vimeo.com/96164094"

He has stated that the Tamnava pit is now an artificial lake. The Kolubara coal fields are open pits from which coal is supplied to the TPP Nikola Tesla.

The EU Solidarity Fund in 2014 is 500 million euros, while individual countries can expect around 10 million.[148] The aid can be transferred if the damage is assessed to be over 0.64% of the country's GDP.

The fourth tropical cyclone and third named storm of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season, Colin developed as a tropical depression from a low-pressure area in the central Atlantic on August\u00a02. After forming, the storm initially strengthened gradually, attaining tropical storm status early on August\u00a03. However, due to its acceleration to the west-northwest, Colin was unable to maintain a closed circulation and subsequently degenerated into a trough later that day. The National Hurricane Center noted the possibility of regeneration over subsequent days, and by August\u00a05, Colin had once again become a tropical cyclone. Despite moderate wind shear impacting the system, Colin reached a peak intensity of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) on August\u00a05. However, vertical wind shear prevented further intensification and eventually weakened the storm. By early on August\u00a08, Colin had weakened to a tropical depression, and dissipated near Bermuda shortly after. Though it remained well offshore, Colin produced rough seas along the East Coast of the United States. At least 205\u00a0ocean rescues were made. In Bermuda, effects were generally minimal. Less than 1 inch (25\u00a0mm) of rain fell and winds remained below tropical storm force."

        "content": "The origins of Tropical Storm Colin can be traced back to an elongated tropical wave that moved westward from Nigeria to Senegal on July\u00a028. A nearly stationary trough separated from the wave as it continued westward. A larger tropical wave emerged off the west coast of Africa a few days later. A broad area of low pressure resulted from the consolidation of the two waves on August\u00a01, when it was situated about 750\u00a0mi (1,210\u00a0km) west-southwest of the Cape Verde Islands. Over the course of the next 24 hours, shower and thunderstorm activity became increasingly consolidated with the low, but the system lacked a well-defined circulation to be considered a tropical cyclone at the time. However, on the next day, an Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) pass revealed that the circulation center had become sufficiently defined, and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) initiated advisories on Tropical Depression Four at 1200\u00a0UTC on August\u00a02.[1] Further organization occurred as the depression moved around the southern periphery of a strong subtropical ridge. Thunderstorm activity became increasingly well defined, and it is estimated that the depression became Tropical Storm Colin at 0600\u00a0UTC on August\u00a03 while centered 840\u00a0mi (1,350\u00a0km) east of the Lesser Antilles.[1] Early on August\u00a03, Colin's forward motion increased, and the cyclone was unable to maintain a closed circulation. The tropical storm degenerated into a trough at 1800\u00a0UTC, although tropical storm-force winds persisted.[1] As the remnants passed north of the northern Leeward Islands, a reconnaissance aircraft investigated the system on August\u00a04, but no closed circulation was found. As the remnants approached a weakness in the subtropical ridge across the western Atlantic on August\u00a05, its forward speed gradually slowed as well. A combination of microwave and satellite imagery during the morning hours of August\u00a05 revealed the reformation of a closed low, and Colin's remnants regained tropical storm status at this time while located 280\u00a0mi (450\u00a0km) north-northeast of San Juan, Puerto Rico.[1] Despite relatively unfavorable vertical wind shear impacting Colin, deep thunderstorm activity developed atop its center of circulation. Data from a reconnaissance aircraft during the afternoon hours of August\u00a05 revealed that the system reached a peak intensity with winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1,005\u00a0mbar (29.7\u00a0inHg). A few computer models, namely the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) and Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting model (HWRF), predicted that Colin would briefly attain hurricane status.\n[2] However, the surrounding moderate vertical wind shear prevented this. While turning towards the north on August\u00a06, the cyclone entered an area increasingly unfavorable wind shear and cooler sea surface temperatures, subsequently prompting the NHC to downgrade Colin to a tropical depression by 0000\u00a0UTC on August\u00a08. Further weakening occurred over the next few hours as the cyclone's center of circulation became elongated, and Colin once again degenerated into a trough of low pressure at 1200\u00a0UTC while located approximately 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km) southwest of Bermuda. The remnant trough persisted until early on August\u00a09, at which time it was situated 150\u00a0mi (240\u00a0km) northwest of the island.[1]"

Significant rainfall was also anticipated, with totals averaging 4 to 6\u00a0in (100 to 150\u00a0mm).[4] These values were later decreased after Colin weakened on August\u00a06, with only a minimal storm surge forecast and rainfall roughly 1\u00a0in (25\u00a0mm) less than previously stated.[5] By August\u00a07, all beaches were closed across the island due to rough seas and dangerous rip currents.[6] The Royal Caribbean cruise ship, MS Explorer of the Seas, arrived in Bermuda that same day and was scheduled to set sail again on August\u00a08; however, due to the threat of Colin, the vessel was forced leave later in the day instead of staying overnight.[7] On August\u00a08, the tropical storm warning in place for Bermuda was downgraded to a watch as Colin weakened to a tropical depression;[8] it was discontinued hours later as the storm quickly dissipated.[9] Due to Colin's weakening to a tropical depression prior to its closest pass to Bermuda, its effects were significantly less than initially anticipated. Winds from the storm reached 31\u00a0mph (50\u00a0km/h), with gusts to 37\u00a0mph (60\u00a0km/h). Rainfall was limited to isolated showers and thunderstorms; the Bermuda International Airport measured 0.16\u00a0in (4.1\u00a0mm) of rain in relation to Colin. Throughout the island, there were no reports of damage.[10] Although situated several hundred miles off the coast of the East Coast of the United States, the outer effects of Colin were expected to create dangerous rip currents along the North and South Carolina coastlines,[11] as well as waves as high as 3 to 4\u00a0ft (0.91 to 1.22\u00a0m).[12] On August\u00a07, a 51-year-old man drowned off the coast of Ocracoke, North Carolina after being caught in a rip current. Shortly after his death, officials issued rip current and undertow threats for the region.[13] Between August\u00a07 and 9, at least 205 ocean rescues were made along the North Carolina coastline due to rough seas produced by Colin.[14]"

It formed on October\u00a04 as a tropical depression from the remnants of a cold front. Early in its duration, the system interacted with a ridge over the central United States, which produced strong winds and high tides along the Texas coast. The outer rainbands caused flooding rainfall in southern Texas, and in Louisiana, high tides flooded roads and stranded residents on Grand Isle. Moving generally to the east due to a trough, the depression intensified into a tropical storm on October\u00a06, and the next day reached peak winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) while approaching the west coast of Florida. Josephine made landfall in Taylor County near peak intensity early on October\u00a08, and soon after became extratropical. While moving ashore, the storm produced a high storm surge reaching 9.3\u00a0ft (2.8\u00a0m) in Suwannee. High tides flooded about 3,600\u00a0houses along the west coast. Josephine also produced heavy rainfall, which flooded hundreds of homes, and high winds, which left 400,000\u00a0people without power. The storm also spawned at least 16\u00a0tornadoes, one of which damaged 130\u00a0homes. The extratropical remnants of Josephine moved along the eastern coast of the United States, producing wind gusts as strong as 77\u00a0mph (124\u00a0km/h) in St. Mary's County and in Ocean City, Maryland. The winds caused widespread power outages, including 26,000 in Virginia and 31,000 in New Jersey. Heavy rainfall flooded low-lying areas and rivers along the storm's path, including in North Carolina which had previously been affected by hurricanes Bertha and Fran earlier in the year. In the southeastern United States, the storm contributed to dozens of traffic accidents, which killed a person each in Georgia, North Carolina, and Virginia. Damage throughout the United States totaled about $130\u00a0million (1996\u00a0USD). Josephine later moved offshore, and after passing southeast of Cape Cod, moved through Atlantic Canada with moderate rainfall and gusty winds. The storm later restrengthened in the northern Atlantic Ocean before merging with another extratropical storm near Iceland on October\u00a016."

The thunderstorms were possibly related to the same tropical wave that spawned Hurricane Hernan in the eastern Pacific Ocean. A low pressure area formed in the Bay of Campeche by October\u00a02, although initially upper-level conditions did not favor tropical cyclogenesis. The convection became more persistent on October\u00a03 and gradually became better organized. On October\u00a04, classifications based on the Dvorak technique began, and later that day the Hurricane Hunters flew into the system. Based on the data from the flight, it is estimated that Tropical Depression Ten formed at 1800\u00a0UTC that day off the northeast coast of Mexico. During its formative stages, the depression interacted with a ridge near the Great Lakes to produce strong winds across the Gulf Coast of the United States. With weak steering currents, the depression moved slowly to the northeast, and initially, wind shear prevented further organization. On October\u00a06, a strong trough caused the system to accelerate to the east-northeast.[1] The storm's west to east motion across the Gulf of Mexico was unusual although not unprecedented.[2] On October\u00a06, the banding features became better defined, and the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Josephine. Further intensification followed, and Josephine attained peak winds of about 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) on October\u00a07. This was based on flight-level winds of 85\u00a0mph (137\u00a0km/h), and while near peak intensity, the storm developed a partial eyewall. Josephine accelerated to the northeast while maintaining peak winds, and it made landfall in Taylor County, Florida at 0330\u00a0UTC on October\u00a08. By that time, Josephine was losing tropical characteristics, and shortly thereafter the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone as it moved over Georgia. The remnants continued to accelerate to the northeast, having weakened quickly to winds of 50\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h). It moved along the East Coast of the United States, emerging from North Carolina into the western Atlantic, and later crossed Atlantic Canada. On October\u00a012, the remnants of Josephine turned to the north and later to the northwest within the general flow of the north Atlantic Ocean. The next day, the storm strengthened to again reach its peak winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h). On October\u00a016, the storm merged with another extratropical storm near Iceland.[1]"

        "content": "About 19\u00a0hours before landfall, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued a tropical storm warning from Apalachicola to Venice, Florida, which was preceded by a tropical storm watch six hours prior. As the storm intensified further, the NHC issued a hurricane warning from Apalachicola to Anclote Key, and extended the tropical storm warning westward to Fort Walton Beach. The agency later issued a tropical storm warning for the Atlantic coast from Cape Canaveral to Little River Inlet in South Carolina.[1] Officials ordered evacuations for barrier islands in nine Florida counties along the gulf coast, and about 3,000\u00a0people stayed in shelters.[3][4] Government offices closed along the storm's projected path in the state.[5] Later, the storm forced the cancellation of part of Bob Dole's bus tour through New York, and postponed a search for the wreck of TWA Flight 800.[6] Game one of the 1996 World Series was postponed by one day due to the storm.[7] While Josephine was forming, it produced high tides of 3 to 4\u00a0ft (0.91 to 1.22\u00a0m) above normal that flooded coastal regions and eroded beaches along the Texas coast. Coastal flooding covered portions of Texas State Highway 316 and John F. Kennedy Memorial Causeway.[8] The storm's outer periphery dropped locally heavy rainfall that reached 10.81\u00a0in (275\u00a0mm) at Brownsville International Airport,[9] which flooded homes in Brownsville and streets near San Benito.[8] Light rainfall also occurred elsewhere along the gulf coast.[9] In Louisiana, tides were 4\u00a0ft (1.2\u00a0m) above normal, which flooded portions of Louisiana Highway 1 and several houses. The floods damaged two houses in Mandeville, and damage statewide was estimated at $5.5\u00a0million.[8] After residents refused to evacuate Grand Isle, over 200\u00a0people were stranded when floodwaters rose.[10] Josephine made landfall in northwestern Florida along Apalachee Bay and produced a high storm surge of around 9.3\u00a0ft (2.8\u00a0m) in Suwannee,[1] causing minor to moderate beach erosion.[8] The storm produced widespread tropical storm force wind gusts in the state, and the highest sustained winds were 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h) along the Sunshine Skyway Bridge; the same location reported a peak gust of 72\u00a0mph (115\u00a0km/h).[1] Josephine dropped heavy rainfall in the state, peaking at 11.39\u00a0in (289\u00a0mm) in Fernandina Beach.[11] The storm also spawned at least 16\u00a0tornadoes in northern Florida, most of which caused minor tree damage.[1] One 400\u00a0yd (370\u00a0m) wide tornado, rated an F2, remained on the ground for 7\u00a0mi (11\u00a0km) in Edgewater, which damaged 130\u00a0houses, 30 of them severely. The tornado caused a woman to have a heart attack in Edgewater, and its damage was estimated at $2.4\u00a0million.[1][8] In western Florida, the high tides flooded roads and buildings along the coast. Between Levy to Lee county along the gulf coast, Josephine flooded about 3,600\u00a0homes, mostly west of U.S. Route 19. The heaviest storm surge damage was in Pinellas County, where about 1,400\u00a0homes were affected, causing $25\u00a0million in damage. One person was injured in the county when a man was surfing in rough seas.[8] The high tides damaged three fishing piers along the west coast.[12] In Clay County, flooding rains forced about a dozen families to seek shelter elsewhere, and a few roads were washed out. In Jacksonville, high rains flooded hundreds of roads and caused schools countywide to close. Street flooding occurred as far south as the Florida Keys. High winds caused sporadic wind damage across northern Florida,[8] and about 400,000\u00a0people lost power statewide.[13] Following the storm, President Bill Clinton declared 16\u00a0counties as disaster areas, which made them eligible for federal assistance in reconstructing.[14] When the remnants of Josephine moved into Georgia, rainfall of over 7\u00a0in (180\u00a0mm) flooded portions of Georgia State Route 40 and destroyed six houses along the St. Marys River.[8] A woman died after driving into a downed tree in the state.[15] In South Carolina, the storm caused flash flooding that covered roads and cars, after 6\u00a0in (150\u00a0mm) of precipitation fell. Wind gusts in the state reached 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) along the coast, while high tides caused minor beach erosion. The remnants of Josephine spawned a weak tornado in Horry County that downed trees and power lines.[8] Heavy rainfall, including reports of 4\u00a0in (100\u00a0mm) in three and a half hours, also affected North Carolina, which flooded low-lying areas, rivers, and portions of several roads including U.S. Route 70. A woman and her child required rescue from a flooded road in Chadbourn. In some areas of eastern North Carolina, the storm raised river levels only weeks after they receded following Hurricane Fran. High winds of up to 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) downed trees and power lines, causing power outages and dozens of traffic accidents;[8] one man died while driving amid heavy rainfall.[15] High tides flooded barrier islands and caused erosion in beaches, previously affected by hurricanes Bertha and Fran earlier in the year.[8] In conjunction with a cold front, Josephine spawned three tornadoes in the state along the state's central coastline. The tornadoes destroyed several mobile homes, uprooted trees, and brought down power lines.[16] After having tracked across the southeastern United States, Josephine emerged into the western Atlantic Ocean as a strong extratropical cyclone and remained near the coast. It continued to bring strong winds and heavy rainfall.[8] In southeastern Virginia, where wind gusts reached 63\u00a0mph (101\u00a0km/h) at the Chesapeake Bay Bridge\u2013Tunnel, the storm left about 26,000\u00a0people without power, while flooding contributed to over 70\u00a0traffic accidents.[17] A three car accident killed a man in the state.[15] In neighboring Maryland, the storm produced a peak wind gust of 77\u00a0mph (124\u00a0km/h) in St. Mary's County and in Ocean City, which knocked down trees onto houses and left about 7,000\u00a0people without power. In the Chesapeake Bay, waves of 6\u00a0ft (1.8\u00a0m) in height caused minor coastal damage and flooded portions of the coastline, including along Maryland Route 238.[8] In Ocean City, a 160\u00a0ft (49\u00a0m) barge broke from its moorings during the storm, which later washed ashore.[8][15] About 4,000\u00a0people lost power in Delaware, where winds reached 58\u00a0mph (93\u00a0km/h) and high tides, peaking at 7.6\u00a0ft (2.3\u00a0m) at Lewes, flooded oceanfront homes and a portion of Delaware Route 1. High rainfall caused the Christina River to crest at 10.6\u00a0ft (3.2\u00a0m), causing some people to require rescue from their cars. About 1,500\u00a0people lost power in southeastern Pennsylvania, when high winds knocked down some tree limbs onto power lines. In neighboring New Jersey, high winds of around 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) left about 31,000\u00a0homes without power, and 12\u00a0houses lost their roofs during the storm. In both New Jersey and New York, rainfall was around 1 to 3\u00a0in (25 to 76\u00a0mm), causing minor street flooding.[8]  While passing offshore New England, the remnants of Josephine produced gusts as high as 68\u00a0mph (109\u00a0km/h) at Blue Hill Meteorological Observatory in Massachusetts. Minor street flooding occurred in the state after the storm dropped up to 4.50\u00a0in (114\u00a0mm) of rainfall on Cape Cod. Throughout New England, the high winds downed trees and branches, causing scattered power outages in Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Maine.[8] Nationwide, damage was estimated at $130\u00a0million (1996\u00a0USD).[1] Later, the remnants of Josephine moved across Atlantic Canada, where rainfall peaked at 2.76\u00a0in (70\u00a0mm) in northern Newfoundland. The strongest winds in the region were 52\u00a0mph (83\u00a0km/h), strong enough to cause ferry service to be canceled or delayed. In Amherst and Fort Lawrence, the storm caused power outages and school closings.[18]"

The fifth cyclone of the 2002\u201303 South Pacific cyclone season, Cyclone Cilla developed from a monsoon trough on January 26 northwest of Fiji. Initially, Cilla moved east, and due to decreased wind shear, Cilla was able to intensify. On January 28, Cilla reached its peak intensity of 75\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph). After slightly weakening, Cilla briefly re-intensified the next day. However, Cilla transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on January 30. Along its path, Cilla dropped heavy rainfall over islands it passed. During its formative stages, the low dropped heavy rain over Fiji, which had already been affected by Cyclone Ami two weeks prior. Damage in Tonga was mostly limited to vegetation and fruit trees; infrastructural damage was also relatively minor. Cilla also brought moderate rain to American Samoa."

Shortly thereafter, Cilla turned southeast hours later in the general direction of Tonga[2] Early on January 26, RSMC Nadi designated the low as Tropical Depression 07F, after attaining 10-minute sustained winds of 35\u00a0mph (55\u00a0km/h).[3] At the time, the slow moving system had a poorly defined center of circulation that was hard to identify via radar and satellite imagery.[3] In addition, most of the deep thunderstorm activity was displaced to the north and southeast of the center.[3] Later that morning, the JTWC reported winds of 35\u00a0mph (55\u00a0km/h);[2] however, the depression did not become any better organized throughout the day.[4][5] Early the next day, RSMC Nadi upgraded the tropical depression to a Category\u00a01 tropical cyclone on the Australian intensity scale and named it Cilla.[6] By 0600\u00a0UTC January 27, the JTWC reported that Cilla had attained 1-minute sustained winds of 40\u00a0mph (65\u00a0km/h), which according to JTWC data, was its peak intensity. Subsequently, Cilla turned east-southeast.[2] Throughout the day, wind shear conditions lessened further; however, shower activity separated from the center, prompting the JTWC to issue its last warning on Tropical Cyclone Cilla later that day. At 2100\u00a0UTC January 27, RMSC Nadi remarked that the cyclone had become better organized.[7] Upon attaining peak intensity, the storm passed fairly closed to Tonga.[2] At 0600\u00a0UTC January 28, Cilla reached its peak intensity, with 10\u2013minute sustained winds of 45\u00a0mph (70\u00a0km/h) per RMSC Nadi. At this time, the tropical cyclone was located about 400\u00a0mi (645\u00a0km) south-southeast of Pago Pago. Rapidly moving, Cilla showed baroclinic characteristics, hinting that the system was a hybrid low, sustaining characteristics of both tropical and nontropical cyclones.[7] According to RMSC Nadi, Cilla weakened slightly[2] as the storm lost organization due to increased wind shear.[7] On January 29, thunderstorm activity once again increased in converge around the center, though at first, the convection was sheared at times. On 0000\u00a0UTC, Dvorak satellite intensity estimates yielded a 3.0, suggesting a tropical cyclone with 10\u2013minute winds of 45\u00a0mph (70\u00a0km/h), Cilla's secondary peak intensity. Satellite images indicated a banding pattern associated with the cyclone. The JTWC briefly watched this system for regeneration, noting it had a \"fair\" chance. However, continued wind shear began to weaken Cilla, and by 1200\u00a0UTC on January 29, Cilla was reduced to a tropical depression[7] just before the system turned south-southeast.[2] With the center exposed from the deep convection, Tropical Depression Cilla transitioned into an extratropical cyclone at 1100\u00a0UTC the next day, on January 30.[7] The extratropical cyclone completely dissipated two days later.[2]"

Supercells are often isolated from other thunderstorms, and can dominate the local weather up to 32 kilometres (20\u00a0mi) away. They tend to last 2\u20134 hours. Supercells are often put into three classification types: classic (normal precipitation level), low-precipitation (LP), and high-precipitation (HP). LP supercells are usually found in climates that are more arid, such as the high plains of the United States, and HP supercells are most often found in moist climates. Supercells can occur anywhere in the world under the right pre-existing weather conditions, but they are most common in the Great Plains of the United States in an area known as Tornado Alley. A high number of supercells are seen in many parts of Europe as well as in the Tornado Corridor (es) of Argentina, Uruguay and southern Brazil."

Typically, supercells are found in the warm sector of a low pressure system propagating generally in a north easterly direction[globalize] in line with the cold front of the low pressure system. Because they can last for hours, they are known as quasi-steady-state storms. Supercells have the capability to deviate from the mean wind. If they track to the right or left of the mean wind (relative to the vertical wind shear), they are said to be \"right-movers\" or \"left-movers,\" respectively. Supercells can sometimes develop two separate updrafts with opposing rotations, which splits the storm into two supercells: one left-mover and one right-mover. Supercells can be any size \u2013 large or small, low or high topped. They usually produce copious amounts of hail, torrential rainfall, strong winds, and substantial downbursts. Supercells are one of the few types of clouds that typically spawn tornadoes within the mesocyclone, although only 30% or fewer do so.[3]"

        "content": "The current conceptual model of a supercell was described in Severe Thunderstorm Evolution and Mesocyclone Structure as Related to Tornadogenesis by Leslie R. Lemon and Charles A. Doswell III (see Lemon technique). Moisture streams in from the side of the precipitation-free base and merges into a line of warm uplift region where the tower of the thundercloud is tipped by high-altitude shear winds. The high shear causes horizontal vorticity which is tilted within the updraft to become vertical vorticity, and the mass of clouds spins as it gains altitude up to the cap, which can be up to 55,000 feet (17,000\u00a0m)\u201370,000 feet (21,000\u00a0m) above ground for the largest storms, and trailing anvil. Supercells derive their rotation through the tilting of horizontal vorticity, which is caused by wind shear imparting rotation upon a rising air parcel by differential forces. Strong updrafts lift the air turning about a horizontal axis and cause this air to turn about a vertical axis. This forms a deep rotating updraft, the mesocyclone. A cap or capping inversion is usually required to form an updraft of sufficient strength. The moisture-laden air is then cooled enough to precipitate as it is rotated toward the cooler region, represented by the turbulent air of the mammatus clouds where the warm air is spilling over top of the cooler, invading air. The cap is formed where shear winds block further uplift for a time, until a relative weakness allows a breakthrough of the cap (an overshooting top); cooler air to the right in the image may or may not form a shelf cloud, but the precipitation zone will occur where the heat engine of the uplift intermingles with the invading, colder air. The cap puts an inverted (warm-above-cold) layer above a normal (cold-above-warm) boundary layer, and by preventing warm surface air from rising, allows one or both of the following: As the cooler but drier air circulates into the warm, moisture laden inflow, the cloud base will frequently form a wall, and the cloud base often experiences a lowering, which, in extreme cases, are where tornadoes are formed. This creates a warmer, moister layer below a cooler layer, which is increasingly unstable (because warm air is less dense and tends to rise). When the cap weakens or moves, explosive development follows. In North America, supercells usually show up on Doppler weather radar as starting at a point or hook shape on the southwestern side, fanning out to the northeast. The heaviest precipitation is usually on the southwest side, ending abruptly short of the rain-free updraft base or main updraft (not visible to radar). The rear flank downdraft, or RFD, carries precipitation counterclockwise around the north and northwest side of the updraft base, producing a \"hook echo\" that indicates the presence of a mesocyclone."

The anvil is very cold (-30\u00b0C) and virtually precipitation-free even though virga can be seen falling from the forward sheared anvil. Since there is so little moisture in the anvil, winds can move freely. The clouds take on their anvil shape when the rising air reaches 15,200\u201321,300 metres (50,000\u201370,000\u00a0ft) or more. The anvil's distinguishing feature is that it juts out in front of the storm like a shelf.

Wall clouds are common and are not exclusive to supercells; only a small percentage actually produce a tornado, but if a storm does produce a tornado, it usually exhibits wall clouds that persist for more than ten minutes. Wall clouds that seem to move violently up or down, and violent movements of cloud fragments (scud or fractus) near the wall cloud, are indications that a tornado could form."

The RFD of a supercell is believed to play a large part in tornadogenesis by tightening existing rotation within the surface mesocyclone. RFDs are caused by mid-level steering winds of a supercell colliding with the updraft tower and moving around it in all directions; specifically, the flow that is redirected downward is referred to as the RFD. This downward surge of relatively cool mid-level air, due to interactions between dew points, humidity, and condensation of the converging of air masses, can reach very high speeds and is known to cause widespread wind damage. The radar signature of an RFD is a hook-like structure where sinking air has brought with it precipitation."

        "header": "Low precipitation (LP)",
        "content": "LP supercells contain a small and relatively light precipitation (rain/hail) core that is well separated from the updraft. The updraft is intense, and LPs are inflow dominant storms. The updraft tower is typically more strongly tilted and the deviant rightward motion less than for other supercell types. The forward flank downdraft (FFD) is noticeably weaker than for other supercell types, and the rear-flank downdraft (RFD) is much weaker\u2014even visually absent in many cases. Like classic supercells, LP supercells tend to form within stronger mid-to-upper level storm-relative wind shear;[10] however, the atmospheric environment leading to their formation is not well understood. The moisture profile of the atmosphere, particularly the depth of the elevated dry layer, also appears to be important,[11] and the low-to-mid level shear may also be important.[12] This type of supercell may be easily identifiable with \"sculpted\" cloud striations in the updraft base or even a \"corkscrewed\" or \"barber pole\" appearance on the updraft, and sometimes an almost \"anorexic\" look compared to classic supercells. This is because they often form within drier moisture profiles (often initiated by dry lines) leaving LPs with little available moisture despite high mid-to-upper level environmental winds. They most often dissipate rather than turning into classic or HP supercells, although it is still not unusual for LPs to do the latter, especially when moving into a much moister air mass. LPs were first formally described by Howard Bluestein in the early 1980s[13] although storm-chasing scientists noticed them throughout the 1970s.[14] Classic supercells may wither yet maintain updraft rotation as they decay, becoming more like the LP type in a process known as \"downscale transition\" that also applies to LP storms, and this process is thought to be how many LPs dissipate.[15] LP supercells rarely spawn tornadoes, and those that form tend to be weak, small, and high-based tornadoes, but strong tornadoes have been observed. These storms, although generating lesser precipitation amounts and producing smaller precipitation cores, can generate huge hail. LPs may produce hail larger than baseballs in clear air where no rainfall is visible.[16] LPs are thus hazardous to people and animals caught outside as well as to storm chasers and spotters. Due to the lack of a heavy precipitation core, LP supercells often exhibit relatively weak radar reflectivity without clear evidence of a hook echo, when in fact they are producing a tornado at the time. LP supercells may not even be recognized as supercells in reflectivity data unless one is trained or experienced on their radar characteristics.[17] This is where observations by storm spotter and storm chasers may be of vital importance in addition to Doppler velocity (and polarimetric) radar data. LP supercells are quite sought after by storm chasers because the limited amount of precipitation makes sighting tornadoes at a safe distance much less difficult than with a classic or HP supercell and more so because of the unobscured storm structure unveiled. During spring and early summer, areas in which LP supercells are readily spotted include southwestern Oklahoma and northwestern Texas, among other parts of the western Great Plains.[citation needed]"

These are especially dangerous storms, since the mesocyclone is wrapped with rain and can hide a tornado (if present) from view. These storms also cause flooding due to heavy rain, damaging downbursts, and weak tornadoes, although they are also known to produce strong to violent tornadoes. They have a lower potential for damaging hail than Classic and LP supercells, although damaging hail is possible. It has been observed by some spotters that they tend to produce more cloud-to-ground and intracloud lightning than the other types. Also, unlike the LP and Classic types, severe events usually occur at the front (southeast) of the storm. The HP supercell is the most common type of supercell in the United States east of Interstate 35, in the southern parts of the provinces of Ontario and Quebec in Canada, in France, Germany and the Po Valley in north Italy and in the central portions of Argentina and Uruguay."

Many tornado outbreaks come from clusters of supercells. Large supercells may spawn multiple long-tracked and deadly tornadoes, with notable examples in the 2011 Super Outbreak. Severe events associated with a supercell almost always occur in the area of the updraft/downdraft interface. In the Northern Hemisphere, this is most often the rear flank (southwest side) of the precipitation area in LP and classic supercells, but sometimes the leading edge (southeast side) of HP supercells."

The classic type Supercell formed over the Blue Mountains, mid-morning hitting the lower CBD and eastern suburbs by mid-afternoon with the hail similar in size to a cricket ball. At the time, it was the most severe storm to strike the city since recorded observations began in 1792.[22] On April 14, 1999, a severe storm later classified as a supercell hit the east coast of New South Wales. It is estimated that the storm dropped 500,000 tonnes (490,000 long tons; 550,000 short tons) worth of hailstones during its course. At the time it was the most costly disaster in Australia's insurance history, causing an approximated A$2.3 billion worth of damage, of which A$1.7 billion was covered by insurance. On February 27, 2007, a supercell hit Canberra, dumping nearly thirty-nine centimetres (15 inches) of ice in Civic. The ice was so heavy that a newly built shopping center's roof collapsed, birds were killed in the hail produced from the supercell, and people were stranded. The following day many homes in Canberra were subjected to flash flooding, caused either by the city's infrastructure's inability to cope with storm water or through mud slides from cleared land.[23] On 6 March 2010, supercell storms hit Melbourne. The storms caused flash flooding in the center of the city and tennis ball-sized (10\u00a0cm or 4\u00a0in) hailstones hit cars and buildings, causing more than $220 million worth of damage and sparking 40,000-plus insurance claims. In just 18 minutes, 19\u00a0mm (0.75\u00a0in) of rain fell, causing havoc as streets were flooded and trains, planes, and cars were brought to a standstill.[24] That same month, on March 22, 2010 a supercell hit Perth. This storm was one of the worst in the city's history, causing hail stones of 6 centimetres (2.4\u00a0in) in size and torrential rain. The city had its average March rainfall in just seven minutes during the storm. Hail stones caused severe property damage, from dented cars to smashed windows.[25] The storm itself caused more than 100 million dollars in damage.[26] On November 27, 2014 a supercell hit the inner city suburbs including the CBD of Brisbane. Hailstones up to softball size cut power to 71,000 properties, injuring 39 people,[27] and causing a damage bill of $1 billion AUD.[28] A wind gust of 141\u00a0km/h was recorded at Archerfield Airport[29]"

One of the first known South American supercell thunderstorms to include tornadoes occurred on September 16, 1816, and destroyed the town of Rojas (240 kilometres (150\u00a0mi) west of the city of Buenos Aires).[citation needed] On September 20, 1926, an F4 tornado struck the city of Encarnaci\u00f3n (Paraguay), killing over 300 people and making it the second deadliest tornado in South America. On 21 April 1970, the town of Fray Marcos in the Department of Florida, Uruguay experienced an F4 tornado that killed 11, the strongest in the history of the nation. January 10, 1973, saw the most severe tornado in the history of South America: The San Justo tornado, 105\u00a0km north of the city of Santa Fe (Argentina), was rated F5, making it the strongest tornado ever recorded in the southern hemisphere, with winds exceeding 400\u00a0km/h. On April 13, 1993, in less than 24 hours in the province of Buenos Aires was given the largest tornado outbreak in the history of South America. There were more than 300 tornadoes recorded, with intensities between F1 and F3. The most affected towns were Henderson (EF3), Urdampilleta (EF3) and Mar del Plata (EF2). In December 2000, a series of twelve tornadoes (only registered) affected the Greater Buenos Aires and the province of Buenos Aires, causing serious damage. One of them struck the town of Guernica, and, just two weeks later, in January 2001, an F3 again devastated Guernica, killing 2 people. The December 26, 2003, Tornado F3 happened in Cordoba, with winds exceeding 300\u00a0km/h, which hit C\u00f3rdoba Capital, just 6\u00a0km from the city center, in the area known as CPC Route 20, especially neighborhoods of San Roque and Villa Fabric, killing 5 people and injuring hundreds. The tornado that hit the State of S\u00e3o Paulo in 2004 was one of the most destructive in the state, destroying several industrial buildings,  400 houses, killing one and wounding 11. The tornado was rated EF3, but many claim it was a tornado EF4.[citation needed] In November 2009, four tornadoes, rated F1 and F2 reached the town of Posadas (capital of the province of Misiones, Argentina), generating serious damage in the city. Three of the tornadoes affected the airport area, causing damage in Barrio Bel\u00e9n. On April 4, 2012, the Gran Buenos Aires was hit by the storm Buenos Aires, with intensities F1 and F2, which left nearly 30 dead in various locations. On February 21, 2014, in Berazategui (province of Buenos Aires), a tornado of intensity F1 caused material damage including a car was, with two occupants inside, which was elevated a few feet off the ground and flipped over asphalt, both the driver and his passenger were slightly injured. The tornado caused no fatalities. The severe weather that occurred on Tuesday 8/11 had features rarely seen in such magnitude in Argentina. In many towns of La Pampa, San Luis, Buenos Aires and Cordoba, intense hail stones fell up to 6\u00a0cm in diameter. On Sunday December 8, 2013, severe storms took place in the center and the coast.

Especially in the summer months damaging supercells occur frequently and parts of France, Germany and north Italy are experiencing a number of strong and violent tornadoes every decade. During the evening of August 3, 2008, a supercell formed over northern France. It spawned an F4 tornado in the Val de Sambre area, about 90 kilometers east of Lille, which impacted nearby cities such as Maubeuge and Hautmont. This same supercell later went on to generate other tornadoes in the Netherlands and Germany. In 2009, on the night of Monday May 25, a supercell formed over Belgium. It was described by Belgian meteorologist Frank Deboosere as \"one of the worst storms in recent years\" and caused much damage in Belgium \u2013 mainly in the provinces of East Flanders (around Ghent), Flemish Brabant (around Brussels) and Antwerp. The storm occurred between about 1:00\u00a0am and 4:00\u00a0am local time. An incredible 30,000 lightning flashes were recorded in 2 hours \u2013 including 10,000 cloud-to-ground strikes. Hailstones up to 6 centimetres (2.4\u00a0in) across were observed in some places and wind gusts over 90\u00a0km/h (56\u00a0mph); in Melle near Ghent a gust of 101\u00a0km/h (63\u00a0mph) was reported. Trees were uprooted and blown onto several motorways. In Lillo (east of Antwerp) a loaded goods train was blown from the rail tracks.[30][31] On May 24, 2010, an intense supercell left behind a trail of destruction spanning across three different states in eastern Germany. It produced multiple strong downbursts, damaging hail and at least four tornadoes, most notably an F3 wedge tornado which struck the town of Gro\u00dfenhain, killing one person.[32] On August 18, 2011, the rock festival Pukkelpop in Kiewit, Hasselt (Belgium) may have been impacted by a supercell with mesocyclone around 18:15. Tornado-like winds were reported, trees of over 30 centimetres (12\u00a0in) diameter were felled and tents came down. Severe hail scourged the campus. Six people reportedly died and over 140 people were injured. The event was suspended. Buses and trains were mobilised to bring people home. On June 28, 2012, three supercells affected England. Two of them formed over the Midlands, producing hailstones reported to be larger than golf balls, with conglomerate stones up to 10\u00a0cm across. Burbage in Leicestershire saw some of the most severe hail. Another supercell produced a tornado near Sleaford, in Lincolnshire. A third supercell affected the North East region of England. The storm struck the Tyneside area directly and without warning during evening rush hour causing widespread damage and travel chaos, with people abandoning cars and being trapped due to lack of public transport. Flooded shopping malls were evacuated, Newcastle station was shut, as was the Tyne & Wear Metro, and main road routes were flooded leading to massive tailbacks. 999 land line services were knocked out in some areas and the damage ran to huge amounts only visible the next day after water cleared. Many parts of County Durham and Northumberland were also affected, with thousands of homes across the North East left without power due to lightning strikes. On July 28, 2013, an exceptionally long-lived supercell tracked along an almost 400 km long path across parts of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and Bavaria in southern Germany, before falling apart in Czechia. The storm had a lifespan of around 7 hours and produced large hail of up to 8 cm in diameter. The city of Reutlingen was hit the hardest, houses and cars were severely damaged, dozens of people injured.[33] With roughly 3.6 billion euros worth of damage, it was by far the costliest thunderstorm event ever documented in Germany.[34] Throughout June 2014, an outbreak of severe supercells occurred in western Europe, producing a lot of damaging hail especially in France. In the Paris area, some hailstones  reached 8\u00a0cm of diameter but the biggest was found in the Loiret department with an exceptional diameter of 12\u00a0cm. On 25 July 2019 a supercell thunderstorm affected northern England and parts of Northumberland. Large hail, frequent lightning and rotation were reported by many people. On 24 September 2020 a similar event affected parts of West Yorkshire.[35] On the morning of June 19, 2021, a MCS developed over the French Atlantic coast. While progressing to the north, the system gained supercellular aspects and spawned a F2 tornado 60 kilometers west of Tours. It reached Paris and its surroundings in the late afternoon, causing flash floods in the area due to heavy rainfalls. The system continued its path towards the Belgian frontier, reaching peak intensity: in the way, one of the peripheral supercells evolved into HP status just before entering the city of Reims. The main mesocyclone suddenly expanded and turned into a massive shelf cloud, a typical structure of the Tornado Alley. It produced strong gust winds, rainfalls and hail and inflicted a lot of damage over the nearby areas. Only 5 days after that on June 24, 2021, a supercell produced an F4 tornado in south Moravia, Czech Republic. This tornado caused 6 deaths and left more than 200 people injured. With roughly $700 million of damage it was one of the costliest tornadoes to occur outside of the United States. In Europe, the mini-supercell, or low-topped supercell, is very common, especially when showers and thunderstorms develop in cooler polar air masses with a strong jet stream above, especially in the left exit-region of a jetstreak.

Seven tornadoes touched down in or near the city that night, killing 5 and injuring 200.[37] The Elie, Manitoba tornado was an F5 that struck the town of Elie, Manitoba on June 22, 2007. While several houses were leveled, no one was injured or killed by the tornado.[38][39][40] A massive tornado outbreak on May 3, 1999 spawned an F5 tornado in the area of Oklahoma City that had the highest recorded winds on Earth.[41] This outbreak spawned over 66 tornadoes in Oklahoma alone. On this day throughout the area of Oklahoma, Kansas, and Texas, over 141 tornadoes were produced. This outbreak resulted in 50 fatalities and 895 injuries.[citation needed] A series of tornadoes, which occurred in May 2013, caused severe devastation to Oklahoma City in general. The first tornado outbreaks occurred on May 18 to May 21 when a series of tornadoes hit. From one of the storms developed a tornado which was later rated EF5, which traveled across parts of the Oklahoma City area, causing a severe amount of damage. This tornado was first spotted in Newcastle. It touched the ground for 39 minutes, crossing through a heavily populated section of Moore.[citation needed] Winds with this tornado peaked at 210 miles per hour (340\u00a0km/h).[42] Twenty-three fatalities and 377 injuries were caused by the tornado.[43][44] Sixty-one other tornadoes were confirmed during the storm period. Later on in the same month, on the night of May 31, 2013, another eight deaths were confirmed from what became the widest tornado on record which hit El Reno, Oklahoma, one of a series of tornadoes and funnel clouds which hit nearby areas.[45]"

The Free State, Gauteng, and Kwazulu Natal are typically the provinces where these storms are most commonly experienced, though supercell activity is not limited to these provinces. On occasion, hail reaches sizes in excess of golf balls, and tornadoes, though rare, also occur. On 6 May 2009, a well-defined hook echo was noticed on local South African radars, along with satellite imagery this supported the presence of a strong supercell storm. Reports from the area indicated heavy rains, winds and large hail.[46] On October 2, 2011, two devastating tornadoes tore through two separate parts of South Africa on the same day, hours apart from each other. The first, classified as an EF2 hit Meqheleng, the informal settlement outside Ficksburg, Free State which devastated shacks and homes, uprooted trees, and killed one small child.

There, she beat Bouchard in straight sets to claim her 14th career title.[100] With this victory, Kvitov\u00e1 became the fourth player to qualify for the WTA Finals in Singapore.[101] It was also the first time since 2011 where she had won more than two titles in a season. Then, the following week at the China Open, Kvitov\u00e1 carried on her good form by reaching her fourth final of the year but lost to Sharapova in three sets.[102] At the WTA Finals, Kvitov\u00e1 was upset by Agnieszka Radwa\u0144ska in her opening match in straight sets. She then recorded a straight-set victory over Sharapova, ending a five-match losing streak against her, but then lost her bid to qualify for the semifinals when she succumbed to Caroline Wozniacki in her last round-robin match.[103] Nevertheless, Kvitov\u00e1 ended the year as world No. 4.[11] At the Fed Cup where Czech Republic faced Germany for the title, she saw off over Andrea Petkovic in straight sets, and Angelique Kerber in a thrilling three-setter, enabling the Czech team to clinch its third Fed Cup title in four years with the final score of the tie at 3\u20131.[104] Kvitov\u00e1 received two awards in 2014, the Karen Krantzcke Sportsmanship Award and the Diamond Aces Award.[105][106]"

Kvitov\u00e1 won both her rubbers in straight sets, defeating Kristina Mladenovic and Caroline Garcia. The Czech team subsequently advanced to the final for the fourth time in five years.[112] After dropping her opening match in Stuttgart to Madison Brengle,[113] Kvitov\u00e1 sailed into the quarterfinals in Madrid with wins over Olga Govortsova, Coco Vandeweghe and Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. She then advanced to the semifinals after dispatching Irina-Camelia Begu in straight sets, setting up a clash with world No. 1, Serena Williams.

She then defeated Kurumi Nara in the second round in straight sets to advance to the third round where she faced 28th seed Jelena Jankovi\u0107. There, Kvitov\u00e1 led by a set and a break, but was upset by the former world No. 1 in the end in a tight three-setter, thus ending her journey as the defending champion.[119] In August, it was revealed that Kvitov\u00e1 was diagnosed with mononucleosis (also known as glandular fever) and that she contracted the virus during spring earlier in the year but nevertheless, was cleared to compete.[120] During the US Open Series, Kvitov\u00e1 lost her openers in Toronto and Cincinnati.[121][122] As the defending champion at the Connecticut Open, second-seeded Kvitov\u00e1 received a bye in the opening round and safely advanced to the semifinals after defeating Keys and Agnieszka Radwa\u0144ska.

At the US Open, Kvitov\u00e1 was the fifth seed and reached the fourth round after defeating Laura Siegemund, wildcard Nicole Gibbs and 32nd seed Anna Karol\u00edna Schmiedlov\u00e1, all in straight sets. She then advanced to her maiden quarterfinal at the tournament after seeing off qualifier Johanna Konta, thus completing the feat of reaching at least the quarterfinals of all four Grand Slam tournaments in her career. There, she fell short to 26th seed and eventual champion Flavia Pennetta in three sets.[124] The Asian swing was not a successful one for Kvitov\u00e1 as she lost early in Wuhan and Beijing.[125][126] Nevertheless, she qualified for the WTA Finals on 14 October.[127] Seeded fourth, she lost her round-robin matches to Angelique Kerber and Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza but scored a win over \u0160af\u00e1\u0159ov\u00e1.

However, the Czech team ultimately cruised into the semifinals with the score 3\u20132.[134] At the Indian Wells Open where she was seeded eighth, Kvitov\u00e1 won consecutive matches for the first time in almost six months, reaching her first quarterfinal of the year in the process. There, she lost to Agnieszka Radwa\u0144ska in straight sets.[135] However, this was followed by an early loss in Miami in the hands of 30th seed Ekaterina Makarova.[136] Entering the clay court swing, Kvitov\u00e1 announced Czech doubles specialist Franti\u0161ek \u010cerm\u00e1k as her new coach.[137] Seeded fifth in Stuttgart, she made her first semifinal at the tournament since 2012 but there, she lost to eventual champion Angelique Kerber.[138] She then lost early in Madrid and Rome, the former in which she was the defending champion.

She came up short to eventual gold medallist Monica Puig in the semifinals, but then defeated Madison Keys in the bronze medal match to win her first ever Olympic medal.[145] Thus, she became the first Czech player of either gender to win an Olympic medal in the singles discipline since Jana Novotn\u00e1 in 1996.[146] Kvitov\u00e1 was the two-time defending champion in New Haven but saw her title defence come to an end in the semifinals in the hands of Radwa\u0144ska.[147] As the 14th seed at the US Open, where for the first time since the 2011 Australian Open, Kvitov\u00e1 was not a top 10 seed at a Grand Slam tournament, she reached the fourth round but lost to eventual champion Kerber in straight sets. The loss meant Kvitov\u00e1 has failed to make a single Grand Slam quarterfinal in a season for the first time since 2009.[148] After the US Open, Kvitov\u00e1 announced that she and coach \u010cerm\u00e1k have gone separate ways.[149] Kvitov\u00e1 began the Asian swing with a loss to Puig in the second round of Tokyo.[150] At the Wuhan Open, she sailed past Ostapenko and Svitolina in straight sets for a place in the third round. There, she scored her fourth win over a reigning world No. 1 when she defeated Kerber in three sets, in a match that lasted nearly three-and-a-half hours. In the quarterfinals, she beat Konta and then in the last four, she went on to score her first win over Simona Halep to reach her first final of the year. There, she dominated Dominika Cibulkov\u00e1 in straight sets for her 18th career title, thus putting an end to a 13-month title drought.[151] She then reached the quarterfinals of the China Open where she lost to Keys. The loss ended Kvitov\u00e1's hopes of qualifying for the WTA Finals, having recorded five straight appearances at the event dating back to 2011.[152] At the Luxembourg Open, top-seeded Kvitov\u00e1 reached the final but lost to Monica Niculescu in straight sets.[153] Despite not making the cut for the WTA Finals, Kvitov\u00e1 qualified for the WTA Elite Trophy. As the third seed, she was drawn into the same group as Roberta Vinci and Str\u00fdcov\u00e1, defeating both players in straight sets to advance to the semifinals where she sailed past wildcard Zhang Shuai. In the final, she beat Svitolina in straight sets to win the tournament on debut, thus lifting her 19th career title and her first title indoors since winning the WTA Finals in 2011.[154] Kvitov\u00e1 ended the season as world No. 11.[11] She then represented her nation in the Fed Cup final where they took on France. Despite losing her only singles rubber against Caroline Garcia, the Czechs went on to successfully defend their title by winning the tie 3\u20132 to lift their third successive trophy, their fifth in the last six years.[155] With that achievement, Kvitov\u00e1 claimed the record of most Fed Cup titles won by a Czech player, having been part of all of the teams that took home those five crowns.

In the quarterfinals, she moved past Barty in straight sets and then beat Collins in straight sets to advance to her first Grand Slam final since 2014, and her first outside Wimbledon. There, she faced fourth seed Naomi Osaka, with the world No. 1 ranking at stake. After losing the first-set tiebreak, Kvitov\u00e1 made a big comeback during the second set after facing three championship points on her own serve. She then won four consecutive games to claim the set. However, Osaka recovered from this turnaround, breaking Kvitov\u00e1 early in the decider en route to claiming victory.[202] Nevertheless, Kvitov\u00e1 returned to the world No. 2 ranking for the first time since June 2015 after the tournament's conclusion.[11] The following week, Kvitov\u00e1 competed in St. Petersburg where she was the defending champion, defeating Victoria Azarenka in her opener to reach the quarterfinals where she lost to Donna Veki\u0107.[203] At the Dubai Tennis Championships, Kvitov\u00e1 recorded consecutive wins here for the first time since 2013, beating both Kate\u0159ina Siniakov\u00e1 and Jennifer Brady in three sets to reach the quarterfinals, where saw off Vikt\u00f3ria Ku\u017emov\u00e1 in straight sets.

She also became the only player this decade to suffer multiple winless appearances at the tournament, the first since Elena Dementieva, in 2004, 2005 and 2006.[218] Kvitova maintained her year-end ranking from the previous year, world No. 7, tying Caroline Wozniacki and Serena Williams for most top-10 season finishes this decade, seven seasons.[11] Furthermore, she was awarded the Karen Krantzcke Sportsmanship Award for the seventh year running, her eighth overall, and ties Kim Clijsters for most Sportsmanship Award wins.[219]"

Seeded fifth, she scored back-to-back wins here for the first time in three appearances, and recorded her best result here since winning the title in 2011, by making the semifinals where she lost to eighth seed Madison Keys in three sets.[220] She then made the quarterfinals of the Australian Open with wins over Kate\u0159ina Siniakov\u00e1, Paula Badosa, 25th seed Ekaterina Alexandrova and 22nd seed Maria Sakkari. The result saw Kvitov\u00e1 record consecutive quarterfinal appearances at the same Grand Slam tournament for the first since the 2014 Wimbledon Championships. It also meant that for the first time since 2015, she has made a Grand Slam quarterfinal in a season in consecutive years. There, however, she succumbed to world No. 1, Ashleigh Barty, in straight sets, her fourth consecutive defeat to the Aussie, which also handed the top-ranked player her first win over a top-10 opponent at the Grand Slams.[221] Having failed to defend her runner-up result here from a year ago, Kvitov\u00e1 dropped out of the top 10, for the first time since February 2018.[11] Kvitov\u00e1 then made the quarterfinals at St. Petersburg, after overcoming Alison van Uytvanck in her opener in three sets, thus making at least the quarterfinal stage in her first three tournaments of the season for the first time since 2011. There, however, she conceded a walkover to Alexandrova due to illness.[222] Kvitov\u00e1's final tournament appearance, before the suspension of the tour in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic,[223] was in Doha where she was the eighth seed. There, she clinched a spot in her second final here after defeating the likes of Carla Su\u00e1rez Navarro, Je\u013cena Ostapenko, Ons Jabeur and world No. 1 Barty, ending a four-match losing streak against the latter. However, she succumbed to ninth seed Aryna Sabalenka in the championship match in straight sets, making it the tenth runner-up finish of her career, and the first time she lost consecutive finals at the Premier Mandatory/5 level.[224] Further suspensions to the 2020 season followed, the latest one lasting till end of July.[225][226][227] However, in spite of the suspensions, Kvitov\u00e1 made her unofficial return to the sport in May at an all-Czech exhibition event held in Prague, where she beat the likes of Barbora Krej\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1, Siniakov\u00e1 and Karol\u00edna Muchov\u00e1 to lift the title.[228] In July, she followed up with appearances in the final of both legs of another exhibition event in Berlin, one on grass and another on an indoor hardcourt. She lost both finals from a set up, to Elina Svitolina in the former and Anastasija Sevastova in the latter.[229][230] Returning to competition in August at the Cincinnati tournament, held in New York City this year due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Kvitov\u00e1 lost her opening match to compatriot Marie Bouzkov\u00e1 in three sets.[231] She then made the fourth round at the US Open, making it her 20th appearance in the second week at the Grand Slams. There, however, she succumbed in a tight three-setter to Shelby Rogers, despite having four match points.[232] She matched her best result at the French Open after that, defeating Oc\u00e9ane Dodin, Jasmine Paolini, Leylah Annie Fernandez, Zhang Shuai and Laura Siegemund, all in straight sets, to reach the last four where she fell to Sofia Kenin in straight sets.[233] Nevertheless, that run saw Kvitov\u00e1 reach multiple Grand Slam quarterfinals in a season for the first time since 2012, and it also guaranteed her return to the top 10 for the first time in nine months.[11] Kvitov\u00e1 would then shut down her 2020 season after the French Open,[234] and this meant that for the first time since 2010, she did not win a title during a season, her best showing this year being the runner-up finish to Sabalenka in Doha. Nevertheless, she finished the year ranked world No. 8, her eighth overall year-end ranking inside the top 10.[11]"

She kicked off her campaign with a win over Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova to make the last eight where she saw off Anett Kontaveit in three sets. She then beat Jessica Pegula to reach her third final here, a rematch of the 2018 final, against Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza. In huge contrast to the former encounter, Kvitov\u00e1 won easily this time, dropping just three games in windy conditions to sail to her 28th career title. This meant that Kvitov\u00e1 has now won titles across three decades, dating back to her maiden career title at Hobart in January 2009, also becoming the first player male or female born in the 1990s to achieve that feat.[237] The following week in Dubai, however, she was forced to retire in her opener against Jil Teichmann due to a thigh injury.[238] Later that month, Kvitov\u00e1 made the fourth round at the Miami Open after seeing off Aliz\u00e9 Cornet and 17th seed Johanna Konta before succumbing to fifth seed Elina Svitolina from a set up.[239] Opening her season's campaign on clay in Charleston, Kvitov\u00e1 scored her career's maiden win on green clay surface by defeating Aussie Storm Sanders, before falling to eventual runner-up Danka Kovini\u0107 in the next round, in straight sets.[240] Then, as the defending champion in Stuttgart, she saw off the likes of top-20 oppositions in Jennifer Brady and Maria Sakkari to reach the quarterfinals where she was stopped by Svitolina despite having led by a set, once again, and having two match points this time around.[241] She then advanced past Marie Bouzkov\u00e1, Angelique Kerber and Veronika Kudermetova to make her sixth quarterfinal in Madrid where she lost to world No. 1 Ashleigh Barty in three sets.[242] Then, in Rome, Kvitov\u00e1 was inflicted her first defeat to a player ranked outside the top 100 for the first time in more than three years when she lost to Vera Zvonareva in the second round.[243] At the French Open, 11th-seeded Kvitov\u00e1 saved a match point in the first round against Greet Minnen en route to a win from a set down but then was forced to withdraw from the tournament due to an ankle injury sustained during media duties there.[244][245] She would return to action three weeks later at the inaugural Bad Homburg Open, her first tournament on grass courts since Wimbledon two years ago. Seeded first, Kvitov\u00e1 made a semifinal run with wins over Katarzyna Piter, Ann Li and fifth seed Podoroska. She lost in the last four to fourth seed Kerber in three sets, despite having led by a set and a break.[246] At Wimbledon, however, Kvitov\u00e1 was sent packing in the opening round by fellow Grand Slam champion Sloane Stephens in straight sets, and it marked the 10th occasion in her career where she fell at the first hurdle at the Grand Slams.[247] On home soil, at the Prague Open, Kvitov\u00e1 rode a three-match losing streak for the first time since the tour suspension was lifted last summer, when she tumbled out in the opening round to Slovak Rebecca \u0160ramkov\u00e1 in three sets.[248] Kvitov\u00e1 then recorded her fourth appearance at the Summer Olympics, her third in the singles discipline, and was selected as co-flag bearer alongside basketball player Tom\u00e1\u0161 Satoransk\u00fd.[249] In tennis competition, she saw off Italy's Jasmine Paolini in her opener before taking her earliest loss at the event, in the hands of Belgian Alison van Uytvanck in the second round, besides being inflicted her first bagel set at the Games in the process.[250][251] The following month, Kvitov\u00e1 returned during the North American summer swing and opened with a loss to eventual champion Camila Giorgi in the third round of Montreal.[252] She then reached her third quarterfinal in Cincinnati, her most of such showings at a WTA 1000 event in North America, and best result in more than three months, where she faced Kerber but was forced to retire down a set due to a stomach issue.[253] At the US Open, 10th seed Kvitov\u00e1 recorded back-to-back wins at the Grand Slams for the first time this year, to reach the third round where she was beaten by 17th seed and eventual semifinalist Sakkari in straight sets. The loss marked the second time in her career she did not reach a second week at the Grand Slams, after 2018.[254] Kvitov\u00e1 made two more appearances before closing her 2021 season, in Ostrava and Indian Wells, and made the last four in the former where she lost to eventual champion Kontaveit before bowing out in the third round of the latter to eventual runner-up Victoria Azarenka, both defeats coming in straight sets.[255][256] She ended 2021 ranked world No. 17, her first top-20 finish since 2016 and second of her career in total.[11]"

There, she lost to incoming world No. 1 Iga \u015awi\u0105tek in straight sets.[266] Kvitov\u00e1 opened her season on clay with a couple of first-round exits, in Charleston and Stuttgart, the former via retirement \u2013 making it her first losing streak on this surface at the tour level since 2018 when she also lost her opening matches in the same two tournaments.[267][268] Her losing streak was extended to four, her first such since end of 2019, when she crashed out in the opening round of Madrid to Jil Teichmann, her earliest exit here since 2010.[269] Kvitov\u00e1's string of recent poor results saw her ranking fall to a 12-year low of world No. 34 after Madrid, which is also her equal-lowest ranking since January 2011.[11] At the French Open, 32nd seed Kvitov\u00e1 scored her season's maiden win on clay when she beat Hungary's Anna Bond\u00e1r in the first round, also making it her 30th victory of the tournament.[270] However, she lost in the next round to Daria Saville in straight sets.[271] Kvitov\u00e1 began her season on grass with a loss to an in-form Beatriz Haddad Maia in her opening match at Birmingham.[272] However, she bounced back from her third losing streak of the season by lifting her first title in Eastbourne the following week. En route to her second final here, 14th-seeded Kvitov\u00e1 saw off Donna Vekic and Katie Boulter in her first two matches,[273] before dispatching Harriet Dart to return to the last four here for the first time since 2011.[274] There, she avenged her Birmingham defeat to 15th seed Haddad Maia and in the championship round next, denied the eighth seed and defending champion Ostapenko a completed title defence \u2013 by winning the final in straight sets to collect her fifth title on the surface and also the 29th of her career.[275][276] At Wimbledon, 25th seed Kvitov\u00e1 prevailed over Jasmine Paolini and Ana Bogdan to reach the third round here for just the third time since she last won the title in 2014. There, however, she succumbed to fourth seed Paula Badosa in a tight straight-set defeat \u2013 making it the third consecutive edition of Wimbledon where she lost on Centre Court.[277] Nevertheless, Kvitov\u00e1 ended her 2022 grass exploits with seven wins on the surface, her highest such count since 2014. During the North American summer stretch, an unseeded Kvitov\u00e1 exited the Canadian Open at the first hurdle, her earliest defeat here since 2010, in the hands of Alison Riske-Amritraj.[278] The following week in Cincinnati, however, her form improved as she exacted revenge against the likes of Teichmann, Cirstea and fifth seed Jabeur to reach the last eight.[279] In her fourth quarterfinal showing here, also her fourth overall in 2022, Kvitov\u00e1 defeated Ajla Tomljanovi\u0107 on their debut encounter.[280] In the semifinals, she defeated former champion Madison Keys, in their ninth meeting in total and a rematch of their opening-round clash here last year, to move to her 40th career final and her first in North America since New Haven seven years ago.[281][282] In the final, she was swept aside by qualifier Caroline Garcia in straight sets, in what was their ninth overall meeting, and a rematch of their second-round encounter here seven years ago. The runner-up finish was the 11th of Kvitov\u00e1's career and she has now lost her last three WTA 1000 finals in succession.[283] At the US Open, 21st seed Kvitov\u00e1 scored her first win over a top 10 player at the Grand Slams in five years when she saved match points to beat ninth seed Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza in the third round \u2013 a rematch of their last 16 meeting here in 2017 which was also the aforementioned Kvitov\u00e1 win over a top 10 player at this level.[284] The victory earned herself the 600th win of her career across all levels, besides placing her in her first second week appearance at the Grand Slams in two years. In the next round, however, she lost to Jessica Pegula in straight sets. It meant that for the first time since 2009, Kvitov\u00e1 did not reach a quarterfinal at the Grand Slams in two consecutive years.[285] Nevertheless, owing to her strong results over the past three months, Kvitov\u00e1 saw her ranking return to the top 20 for the first time since January this year.[11] Kvitov\u00e1 returned from a month's break in October, firstly on home soil at the Ostrava Open where she returned to the quarterfinals here, for the second year running, her fifth such result of the season, and 99th of her career, but suffered defeat in the hands of fellow Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina.[286] In her last tournament of the year, seeded 16th in her debut at the Guadalajara Open, she bowed out in the second round to fellow Grand Slam champion Bianca Andreescu from a set up.[287] The result also meant that for the third year in a row, in her last tournament of the season, Kvitov\u00e1 lost to a fellow Grand Slam champion. Nevertheless, Kvitov\u00e1 would go on to rise to her best ranking of the season, also her year-end ranking, at world No. 16, effectively improving her ranking by more than a half, dating back to summer earlier in the season.[11] Amassing 27 wins out of 46 matches played, the 2022 season also marked the first time since 2010 where Kvitov\u00e1 recorded a season winning rate of less than 60%."

Firstly, she beat world No. 3 Jessica Pegula to open her season with her 30th career win over an opponent ranked in the top 5, and it was also the Czech Republic's sole win in its opening tie against the United States.[288][289] She next beat Laura Siegemund to give the Czechs an unassailable 3\u20130 advantage in its tie against Germany, effectively securing her nation its first tie win of the tournament.[290] She then recorded her maiden quarterfinal appearance in Adelaide, her 100th career quarterfinal result in main draws, but lost to Daria Kasatkina, also making it her first defeat in the quarterfinal stage of an Australian tournament outside the Australian Open.[291] Seeded 15th at the Australian Open, Kvitov\u00e1 exited in the second round to Anhelina Kalinina in a tight straight-setter, making it the 10th time in her career where she failed to reach the second week here.[292] In February, Kvitov\u00e1 suffered consecutive last-16 exits, coming in Doha and Dubai \u2013 the first time since 2016 where she failed to reach a quarterfinal in the Middle East.[293][294] The following month, in Indian Wells, 15th seed Kvitov\u00e1 claimed back-to-back wins here for the first time since 2016 by defeating Elizabeth Mandlik, before recovering from a first-set bagel to prevail over 24th seed Je\u013cena Ostapenko to reach the round of 16.[295][296] There, she scored her second win in three months over world No. 3 Pegula, needing to save four match points this time around.[297][298] She would fall to seventh seed Maria Sakkari in her third quarterfinal appearance here next \u2013 a rematch of their third-round encounter of the previous year which Sakkari also won.[299] At the Miami Open, 15th seed Kvitov\u00e1 carried on with her good form by defeating the likes of compatriot Linda Noskov\u00e1,[300] 22nd seed Donna Veki\u0107 (her third such meeting against Veki\u0107 to have come in the third round of Miami \u2013 all of which have been won by Kvitov\u00e1)[301] and Varvara Gracheva to make the last eight here for a second year in a row hence also reaching back-to-back quarterfinals in Indian Wells and Miami in the same season for the first time in her career.[302] Kvitov\u00e1 broke new ground next by advancing into her first semifinal at the tournament by defeating 18th seed Ekaterina Alexandrova.[303] It is also the milestone 20th semifinal overall of her career at WTA 1000 events.[304] In the semifinals, she beat Sorana Cirstea in straight sets to reach the final,[305] where she stopped 10th seed Elena Rybakina from completing the Sunshine Double, by winning the title match in straight sets \u2013 for the milestone 30th title of her career, her ninth to have come at WTA 1000 events and also her biggest one since Madrid 2018.[306] With the result, Kvitov\u00e1 returned to the top 10 for the first time since September 2021.[11][307] Kvitov\u00e1's clay season in 2023 marked the first time she failed to record a single win on the surface upon her exit from the French Open. She withdrew from two events Stuttgart and Rome injured, and went winless in her other two appearances on the surface, namely, Madrid and the French Open \u2013 falling to Jule Niemeier and Elisabetta Cocciaretto respectively.[308][309] The latter defeat was Kvitov\u00e1's first loss in the first hurdle in Paris since 2010 where she lost to Sophie Ferguson \u2013 and it also meant she had failed to reach a single quarterfinal in her last 10 appearances at the Grand Slams, dating back to the 2021 Australian Open. Nevertheless, Kvitov\u00e1 rose to world No. 9 following the French Open, her first single-digit ranking since the fortnight of the 2021 Australian Open.[11] She then turned her clay misfortunes around by starting the grass season with her first title on this surface outside the United Kingdom, capturing her 31st career title at the German Open. En route, seventh-seeded Kvitov\u00e1 saw off Karol\u00edna Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 and Nadia Podoroska, both in straight sets, to reach the quarterfinals.[310][311] Next, she claimed consecutive straight-set wins over third seed Caroline Garcia and Alexandrova, both coming on the same day, to reach the final.[312] There, Kvitov\u00e1 defeated Veki\u0107 in straight sets for the third time in the past 12 months, thus winning a title without the loss of a set for the first time since 2016.[313] Her win over Garcia also marked her first on grass coming over an opponent ranked in the top 10 since the 2011 Wimbledon final where she beat Maria Sharapova.[313][314] At Wimbledon, Kvitov\u00e1 was the ninth seed and went up against Jasmine Paolini in the opening round here for the second year in a row. Playing on the date of the ninth anniversary of her second title here this time, Kvitov\u00e1 won the match in three sets again, just like the year before. The win also marked Kvitov\u00e1's 10th at this event since winning her second title here in 2014, and the 10th of her career to have come on Centre Court here.[315] She then dispatched both Aliaksandra Sasnovich and Natalija Stevanovi\u0107 in straight sets to reach the second week.[316][317] There, Kvitov\u00e1 lost to sixth seed Ons Jabeur in the last 16 \u2013 making it her 10th overall defeat, both in this stage at the Grand Slams, and at all Grand Slams since the 2020 season.[318][319] Kvitov\u00e1 suffered a majority of dismal results in her remaining five tournament appearances of the year, failing to win consecutive matches in all instances. Firstly, in the American summer swing, she logged in just two wins, one in each of the Canadian and Cincinnati Opens.[320][321] Next, at the US Open, where 11th seed Kvitov\u00e1 recorded her 50th consecutive appearance at the Grand Slams as a seeded player \u2013 having never missed out on a seeding at this stage of competition since her first such at this same event in 2010, she lost in the second round in straight sets to familiar nemesis and now a returning mother in Caroline Wozniacki.[322] The loss also meant that Kvitov\u00e1 has failed to reach a single quarterfinal at the Grand Slams for the third season in a row, with her last such result being 2020 French Open where she was a semifinalist. At her next tournament, her first ever appearance in China since the pandemic, second seed Kvitov\u00e1 reached the last eight in 2023 Ningbo Open, having defeated Anna-Lena Friedsam at the first hurdle before receiving a walkover from Yulia Putintseva, but then lost to eventual finalist Diana Shnaider in three sets.[323] In her last tournament of 2023, at the China Open, Kvitov\u00e1 prevailed over Wang Xiyu in the first round in a late-night tussle lasting just over three hours.[324] However, the following day, she succumbed in straight sets to eventual finalist Liudmila Samsonova.[325] The loss made 2023 the third season in a row where Kvitov\u00e1's last tournament of the season saw her lost in the last 32 of a WTA 1000 event. She finished 2023 ranked world No. 14 \u2013 making it her third top-20 finish in succession as well as the first time since 2010 where she concluded more than two seasons in a row ranked outside the top 10.[11]"

        "content": "Kvitov\u00e1 uses the pinpoint service stance and is known for her fast and well-placed serves. As a left-handed player, she executes the shot well by serving out wide away from her opponent, especially on the advantage-side of the court to her opponent's backhand, and then coming forward to finish off the point with a winner down the line. She is also noted for her exceptional timing. On forehands, she prefers to take the ball early, thus allowing her to produce down-the-line winners effectively. On backhands, she utilizes all the important muscle groups to produce shots with exceptional amount of power. When returning, she uses a short compact motion which allows her to return aggressively regardless of the serve speed. She is also known to attack weak second serves by producing powerful winners. She also possesses notable amount of variety in her game. Her volleys tend to come more from her forehand, her stronger side, which she executes by moving her racket in a straight line, also allowing her to disguise the shot well enough from her opponents. In the slice department, she has the ability to keep the ball low and performs the shot better on her backhand wing. Due to her tall frame, she is known to make up for her lack of speed by playing close to the baseline. Her game suits the fast courts and she cites grass as her favourite surface.[326][327] However, due to her high-risk game and aggressive style of play she is known to produce a high number of unforced errors in matches. Movement is another weakness in her game though it has shown significant improvement over the last couple of years as she is now able to run down more balls than before. She is known for her inconsistencies, inability to maintain focus during matches as well as impatience mid-rally. Kvitov\u00e1 sometimes struggles against defensive players, including Angelique Kerber, Simona Halep and Elina Svitolina, who prolong points to the extent that Kvitov\u00e1 feels she must hit a winner, thus increasing the chances of producing an unforced error. Against such opponents, she has been shown to break down physically due to her opponent's use of court craft, consistency and patience on court.[328] However, when Kvitov\u00e1 is at her best, she is extremely dangerous, as seen in the final of the 2015 Madrid Open against Svetlana Kuznetsova where she hit 33 winners in the 66-minute contest, an average of a winner every two minutes, which is more than double her unforced error count of 14 too.[329] Another similar illustration was witnessed in the final of the 2014 Wimbledon Championships against Eugenie Bouchard where Kvitov\u00e1 fired 28 winners in 55 minutes, against just 12 unforced errors, to lift her second major title.[330]"

In their tenth clash, in the third round of Wuhan in 2016, Kvitov\u00e1 edged past Kerber in three sets in a match that lasted over three-and-a-half hours, which is also their longest match to date.[333] Then, in the semifinals of the Fed Cup in 2018, Kvitov\u00e1 saw off Kerber in straight sets, her first such win over the German since their first meeting, only for Kerber to exact revenge in their opening-round clash in Stuttgart a few days later. Kvitov\u00e1 has since won their next two meetings, firstly in the last eight of Sydney in 2019, and then in the second round of Madrid in 2021, both in straight sets, the latter being Kvitov\u00e1's first win over Kerber on clay outdoors.[334][335] Their fifteenth encounter came much later in 2021, on grass in Bad Homburg, their first meeting on the surface, and fifth to take place in Germany. This time, Kerber exacted revenge by coming back from a set and a break deficit to prevail over Kvitov\u00e1.[336] They next met in August 2021, in the quarterfinals of the Western & Southern Open, where Kvitov\u00e1 had to retire in the second set due to illness. Kerber subsequently went on maternity leave in August 2022, before returning to the sport in January 2024."

There, Wozniacki upset 11th seed Kvitov\u00e1 in straight sets, which was also the best win of Wozniacki's career in terms of ranking since their previous clash at the WTA Finals nearly five years ago.[343]"

Moreover, her local tennis club offered a reward amounting $3850 for information leading to the whereabouts of her attacker.[386] By March 2017, Kvitov\u00e1 had regained the use of her left hand, and could now use it for daily activities without any complications.

After three seasons, she was promoted to designer of leather goods. In 2002, Giannini joined Gucci as design director of handbags.[4] In 2004, she was appointed to head women's accessories when Tom Ford departed the company. At the time, Gucci stores focused its inventory on the \"GG\" monogram canvas bag. Giannini attempted to change Gucci's style from Tom Ford's designs by drawing from Gucci's heritage. Based on the 1960s Grace Kelly scarf, she developed the \"Flora\" collection of colorful bags. The collection was not well received by critics. In 2006, Women's Wear Daily commented: \"Trends do not start here.\" However, Flora proved to be Giannini's first commercial success, and she applied the style to other accessories, including ballet shoes.[5] In 2006, Giannini was promoted to Creative Director for the entire Gucci label. Giannini continues to design from heritage. For example, the 2010 Winter Men's line was noted for influences from Gucci's equestrian history. However, Giannini says, \"I don't think it is a nostalgic collection, but heritage is good for me\u2014going back to the archives, but looking forward to the future.\"[6] In 2011, she created, in collaboration with Lapo Elkann, the Fiat 500 by Gucci, a special edition of the Italian car.[citation needed] She was credited for softening Gucci's brand proposition from Tom Ford's porno-chic to sensual, with hints of Art Nouveau and fin de si\u00e8cle, and to have introduced the brand's androgynous stance that Alessandro Michele later fully developed.[7][8] On 12 December 2014 Kering SA announced Frida Giannini and Patrizio di Marco will be leaving the company.  Giannini plans to see the fall/winter collection through to the Milan Fashion Week and departed in early 2015.[9] Her successor is Alessandro Michele.[10]"

The U.S. based Radio Free Asia reported the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies as saying that in some locations \"whole villages have been swept away and essential public facilities (such as clinics) destroyed, while widespread damage to roads and bridges has displaced and stranded many people\", that over 7,000 homes were completely destroyed, with almost 13,000 families left homeless, and that South Pyongan, North Hwanghae, Kangwon, and South Hamgyong were the worst-affected provinces. North Korea cancelled its gymnastics show Arirang Festival in order to recover from the flooding. [1] Both the United Nations and the South Korean Red Cross offered food aid to the affected regions, though according to a report by Associated Press, Py\u014fngyang turned these offers down."

        "content": " The 1995 Atlantic hurricane season was a very active Atlantic hurricane season, and is considered to be the start of an ongoing era of high-activity tropical cyclone formation. The season produced twenty-one tropical cyclones, nineteen named storms, as well as eleven hurricanes and five major hurricanes.[nb 1] The season officially began on June\u00a01 and ended on November\u00a030, dates which conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones develop in the Atlantic basin. The first tropical cyclone, Hurricane Allison, developed on June\u00a02, while the season's final storm, Hurricane Tanya, transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on November\u00a01. The very active Atlantic hurricane activity in 1995 was caused by La Ni\u00f1a conditions, which also influenced an inactive Pacific hurricane season. It was tied with 1887 Atlantic hurricane season with 19 named storms, which was later equalled by the 2010, 2011, and 2012 seasons. There were four particularly destructive hurricanes during the season, including Luis, Marilyn, Opal and Roxanne. Hurricanes Luis and Marilyn both caused catastrophic damage in the Leeward Islands and Virgin Islands. The former storm was the first hurricane to affect the islands since Hugo in 1989, while the latter was the most devastating cyclone on the Virgin Islands since Hugo as well. Opal, the strongest and most intense storm of the season, caused devastation along portions of the Gulf Coast of the United States. Roxanne, a rare late-season major hurricane,[nb 2] caused significant damage when it made landfall in Quintana Roo. All four aforementioned names were retired following the season. Additionally, Erin produced moderate damage in Florida and into Alabama. Felix generated strong waves, causing heavy beach erosion in the Northeastern United States and drowning nine people. Iris caused flooding that left five deaths in the Lesser Antilles. Collectively, the tropical cyclones of the season caused about $12.74\u00a0billion (1995\u00a0USD)[nb 3] in damage and at least 182\u00a0deaths."

        "content": "Forecasts of hurricane activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane experts such as Dr. William M. Gray and his associates at Colorado State University (CSU) and the Weather Research Center (WRC). A normal season, as defined by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), has 12.1\u00a0named storms; of these, 6.4\u00a0reach hurricane strength; and 2.7\u00a0major hurricanes, which are Category\u00a03 or higher on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale.[6] Additionally, the 1950\u20132000 CSU average for a normal season is 9.6\u00a0named storms, of these 5.9\u00a0reach hurricane strength, and 2.3\u00a0become major hurricanes.[7] In December\u00a01994, CSU predicted that only 12\u00a0named storms would form and 8\u00a0of those would become hurricanes; 3\u00a0major hurricanes were projected. CSU noted an above average season due to expectations that the existing El Ni\u00f1o would dissipate, while a La Ni\u00f1a would develop by the summer of 1995. Additionally, the western areas of the Sahara Desert were predicted to have the fourth or fifth rainiest season since 1970. A year with heavier precipitation in this region usually correlates with an active Atlantic hurricane season.[8] In April\u00a01995, CSU revised their forecast, decreasing the number of named storms to 10, hurricanes to 6, and major hurricanes to 2. However, in June, CSU reverted to their December forecast, which called for 12\u00a0named storms, 8\u00a0hurricanes, and 3\u00a0major hurricanes.[3] The forecast by the WRC in early 1995 was 10\u00a0named storms and 6\u00a0hurricanes, with no prediction on the number of major hurricanes.[4]"

        "content": "The Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1,[11] and activity in 1995 began on the next day with the formation of Hurricane Allison on June 2. It was a well-above average season in which 21 tropical depressions formed, 19 of which attained tropical storm status, and 11 of these attained hurricane status. In addition, five tropical cyclones reached major hurricane status,[12] which was well above the 1950\u20132005 average of two per season.[7] At the time, only 1933 surpassed the season's total storms, making the season the second most active in recorded history tying with 1887. [13][14][15][12] The 1995 season would be the beginning of an active period in the Atlantic basin, which has lasted for nearly 30 years. Collectively, the tropical cyclones of this season caused 182 deaths and $12.02\u00a0billion in damage.[16] The last storm of the season, Hurricane Tanya, became extratropical on November 1,[12] over four weeks before the official end of the season on November 30.[11] Tropical cyclogenesis in the 1995 Atlantic hurricane season began with the development of Hurricane Allison on June 2. The month of July was very active, with four tropical cyclones forming. This record of storms in July stood until the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season when five storms formed in July. A total of seven storms formed in August \u2014 Felix, Gabrielle, Humberto, Iris, Jerry, Karen, and Luis \u2014 tying the 1933 record for most in the month; this record was broken in the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season when eight named storms formed during August. Although September is the climatological peak of hurricane season, it was much less active than August. Four tropical cyclones developed in September, with Marilyn, Noel, and Opal eventually strengthening into hurricanes. Four tropical cyclones also formed in October; notably, Hurricane Roxanne developed in that month. The last storm of the season, Hurricane Tanya, developed later in October and eventually became extratropical on November 1.[12]  This was the first time since forecasters began assigning given names to tropical storms in 1953 that names starting with the letters \"O\" through \"T\" were used. The season's activity was reflected with a very high accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 228, the fifth highest value on record,[13] and far above the 1981\u20132010\u00a0median of 92.[17] Broadly speaking, ACE is a measure of the power of a tropical or subtropical storm multiplied by the length of time it existed. Therefore, a storm with a longer duration or stronger intensity, such as Felix, Luis, Opal, or Roxanne will have high values of ACE. It is only calculated for full advisories on specific tropical and subtropical systems reaching or exceeding wind speeds of 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h). Accordingly, tropical depressions are not included here. After the storm has dissipated, typically after the end of the season, the NHC reexamines the data, and produces a final report on each storm. These revisions can lead to a revised ACE total either upward or downward compared to the operational value.[13]"

        "content": "A westward moving tropical wave reached the Caribbean Sea in late May and gradually organized over the next few days. Around 00:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a03, a tropical depression developed about 265 miles (426\u00a0km) east of Belize City, Belize. The depression initially moved northwestward before recurving to the north. The depression entered the Gulf of Mexico and strengthened into Tropical Storm Allison by 12:00\u00a0UTC. Despite unfavorable upper-level winds, the storm intensified into a hurricane about 24\u00a0hours later. Allison then peaked with maximum sustained winds of 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 987\u00a0mbar (29.1\u00a0inHg). Increasing wind shear weakened it to a tropical storm early on June\u00a05. At 14:00\u00a0UTC, Allison made landfall near Alligator Point, Florida, with winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h). After briefly emerging over Apalachee Bay, Allison struck near St. Marks with winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h). Early on June\u00a06, Allison weakened to a tropical depression, shortly before becoming extratropical. The remnants continued northeastward and later struck Newfoundland before dissipating near Greenland on June\u00a011.[18] While brushing Cuba, Allison produced wind gusts up to 64\u00a0mph (103\u00a0km/h) and as much as 18\u00a0in (460\u00a0mm) of rainfall. A total of 32\u00a0structures were damaged or destroyed, causing one death.[18] In Florida, storm surge heights of 6 to 8 feet (1.8 to 2.4\u00a0m) were observed in Dixie and Wakulla counties and 2 to 6\u00a0ft (0.61 to 1.83\u00a0m) to the east, causing significant beach erosion and damaging 65\u00a0homes, 3\u00a0hotels, and a restaurant.[19] Elsewhere in Florida, damage was generally minor, totaling only about $860,000. In Georgia, there was minor flooding and tornadoes, one of which caused $800,000 in damage in St. Marys.[18] Some locations in Atlantic Canada reported tropical storm force winds and heavy rainfall.[20]"

A nearby trough enhanced convection and caused strengthening, with maximum sustained winds reaching 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) later that day.[21] Later on July\u00a08, Barry weakened slightly, falling to winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h), an intensity it would retain until landfall.[21] An approaching mid-level trough accelerated the storm as it traveled roughly along the Gulf Stream.[23] Early on July\u00a09, convection began to shift away from the storm's center. While moving rapidly northeastward, Barry made landfall in Hart Island, Nova Scotia, late on July\u00a09.[21] It weakened slightly and made landfall on Cape Breton Island less than an hour later.[21] Cold water caused deep convection to diminish as it was making landfall, and the storm lost most remaining tropical characteristics as it tracked toward Newfoundland.[24] Barry was declared extratropical early on July\u00a010 near the west coast of Newfoundland. As a fast-moving and weakening extratropical cyclone, the system remained distinct until it passed across the east coast of Labrador, when it dissipated.[21] Tropical storm force winds were recorded at Fourchu, Nova Scotia, as well as wind gusts up to 62\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h) at Port aux Basques, Newfoundland. Barry dropped significant rainfall, peaking at 4.33\u00a0in (110\u00a0mm) in Nova Scotia, with lesser totals at several other locations.[25]"

        "content": "A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa on July\u00a05. During the next week, the wave improved on satellite imagery and developed into a tropical depression about 420\u00a0mi (680\u00a0km) east-northeast of Guadeloupe on July\u00a012. The depression quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Chantal. Initially, Chantal threatened the Bahamas, and the Government of the Bahamas issued tropical storm watches and warnings, which were in effect for the southeast and central islands as well as the Turks and Caicos Islands. However, Chantal re-curved to the north and did not directly affect the Bahamas. After the cyclone turned northward, it threatened Bermuda, which prompted a tropical storm watch for the island on July\u00a016. The watch was canceled on July\u00a018 as the storm passed well northwest of the island.[26] By early on July\u00a017, Chantal attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 991\u00a0mbar (29.3\u00a0inHg). Thereafter, the storm began weakening and slowly losing tropical characteristics. At 18:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a020, Chantal transitioned into an extratropical storm about 225\u00a0mi (362\u00a0km) east-southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland. The remnants continued rapidly northeastward and later east-northeastward, before dissipating west of the British Isles on July\u00a022.[26] Although Chantal remained well offshore, the storm dropped heavy rainfall in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, peaking at 3\u00a0in (76\u00a0mm) on the Burin Peninsula. Further west in Nova Scotia, heavier precipitation was reported, peaking at 4.84\u00a0in (123\u00a0mm) near Barrington.[27]"

        "content": "A stationary front in the Gulf of Mexico developed an upper-level circulation. By July\u00a028, the system organized enough to be classified as Tropical Depression Four. Despite favorable conditions, the depression tracked westward without significantly intensifying, due to the poor organization of the storm itself. As the depression curved west-northwestward, it began to strengthen and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Dean while located only 70\u00a0mi (110\u00a0km) from the Texas coastline on July 30. The system made landfall early on July\u00a031 near Freeport with winds of 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 999\u00a0mbar (999\u00a0hPa; 29.5\u00a0inHg). Shortly thereafter, Dean weakened back to a tropical depression. The storm continued to slowly weaken as it moved northwestward, dissipating on August\u00a02 near the Texas\u2013Oklahoma border.[28] Storm surge caused minor coastal flooding, especially on Galveston Island.[29] Dean produced a large swath of rainfall between 5 and 10\u00a0in (130 and 250\u00a0mm), while some areas received more than 17\u00a0in (430\u00a0mm).[30] Precipitation from the storm caused moderate localized flood damage. A total of 20\u00a0families in Chambers County evacuated,[28] while 38\u00a0houses in the southeastern portions of Texas were flooded.[29] Two tornadoes were also reported in the state, but neither caused significant damage.[29] In Oklahoma, heavy rainfall flooded more than 40\u00a0houses and left about 24\u00a0cars stranded. At least three highways suffered significant flooding, while other minor roads were closed for several days.[31] Outside of Oklahoma and Texas, the remnants of the storm dropped rainfall in several Midwestern states, though minimal damage occurred.[30] Despite the flooding, property damage estimates were only $500,000,[29] while one fatality occurred.[31]"

        "content": "A tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa on July\u00a022 and headed toward the Leeward Islands, where the system nearly developed into a tropical cyclone but was inhibited by vertical wind shear. By July\u00a031, the system was classified as Tropical Storm Erin while just west of the Turks and Caicos Islands. Despite effects from wind shear, Erin continued to strengthen as it moved northwestward and was upgraded to a hurricane later on July\u00a031. Further intensification occurred, and Erin reached winds of 85\u00a0mph (137\u00a0km/h) before making landfall near Vero Beach, Florida, on August\u00a01. The storm emerged over the Gulf of Mexico after weakening back to a tropical storm, though it quickly re-strengthened into a hurricane. Shortly before making landfall near Pensacola Beach, Florida on August 3, Erin briefly intensified into a Category\u00a02 hurricane. After moving inland, Erin slowly weakened as it tracked across the Southern United States and Midwestern United States. By August\u00a06, Erin merged with a frontal system over West Virginia.[32] Erin was the first hurricane to strike the United States since Hurricane Andrew in 1992.[12] In Jamaica, the outer bands of Erin produced heavy rainfall on the island, which caused a plane crash, killing five people; two other fatalities occurred when two people were struck by lightning. Although many islands in the Bahamas experienced high winds and heavy rainfall, damage associated with Erin was fairly minor. Offshore of Florida, nine people drowned, three of which occurred after a cruise ship sunk. Over land, high winds produced by Erin damaged over 2,000\u00a0houses, most of which were in the Florida Panhandle. In addition, strong winds left over one million people without electricity. Several tornadoes were spawned in the state, causing damage. In Alabama, more than 100\u00a0houses were damaged by Erin.[32] Between 50 and 75 percent of the pecan crop in Baldwin County was lost. Similar impact also occurred in Mississippi, although to a lesser degree.[33] Elsewhere, some areas of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern United States experienced heavy rainfall.[34] Overall, Erin caused 13\u00a0fatalities and $700\u00a0million in damage.[32]"

By August\u00a04, the system entered the Bay of Campeche and developed into Tropical Depression Six on August\u00a05. The depression moved slowly over Mexico and gradually intensified that day and August 6. Satellite intensity estimated showed the depression was likely just below the threshold of tropical storm status. However, late on August 6, the depression made landfall in Cabo Rojo, Veracruz. The depression slowly weakened inland and dissipated late on August 7.[35] The depression and the precursor tropical wave dropped heavy rainfall in some areas of Mexico. Precipitation from the precursor system peaked at 14.45\u00a0in (367\u00a0mm) in Escuintla, Chiapas, while rainfall from the depression itself peaked at 12\u00a0in (300\u00a0mm) in Tlaxco, Puebla.[36] Some localized flooding may have occurred near the path of the depression.[35]"

The depression moved west-northwestward due to a subtropical ridge and deepened into Tropical Storm Felix later that day. Further intensification was slower, with Felix reaching hurricane status on August\u00a011. Due to warm sea surface temperatures and light wind shear, Felix began to rapidly strengthen as it was curving northwestward. Late on August\u00a012, Felix peaked with maximum sustained winds of 140\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 929\u00a0mbar (27.4\u00a0inHg). Felix weakened over the next few days back to a Category 1 hurricane on August\u00a014, after an eyewall replacement cycle and an increase in wind shear.[37] The storm posed a significant threat to Bermuda, warranting a hurricane warning between August\u00a014 and August\u00a015. During the latter date, Felix passed only 75\u00a0mi (121\u00a0km) to the southwest of the island. Continuing on its northwest trek, the cyclone also temporarily prompted preparations along the East Coast of the United States. However, the storm curved northward and then east-northeastward while remaining offshore. Felix briefly threatened Bermuda again, but turned back to the northeast and weakened to a tropical storm on August\u00a020. It accelerated east-northeastward and passed a short distance offshore of Newfoundland, where it transitioned into an extratropical storm on August\u00a022. The remnants of Felix continued northeastward across the Atlantic until dissipating near Shetland on August\u00a025.[37] Large waves in Puerto Rico caused minor coastal flooding in Cata\u00f1o.[38] On Bermuda, the storm produced near-hurricane-force winds,[37] which downed trees and power lines, and left 20,000\u00a0people without power. Rough surf was also reported on Bermuda, which damaged a few boats and hotels.[39] In addition, the passage of Felix postponed Bermuda's 1995 independence referendum. In the United States, Felix generated large waves from northeast Florida to Maine.[37] In New York, two houses were washed away in The Hamptons, while 20 to 30\u00a0houses in North Carolina experienced minor damage from rough seas.[38] While passing southeast of Newfoundland, Felix produced moderate rainfall and large waves across the island, although damage was minimal.[40] Overall, Felix caused eight deaths due to drowning along the coasts of North Carolina and New Jersey, and $132,000 in damage.[37]"

The depression quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Gabrielle on August 10. Gabrielle continued to rapidly strengthen as it tracked toward the coast of Mexico, nearly becoming a hurricane late on August 11. However, Gabrielle made landfall near La Pesca, Tamaulipas, Mexico two hours later, which prevented further strengthening. Gabrielle rapidly weakened inland and dissipated early on August 12.[41] Gabrielle dropped heavy rainfall in Mexico, where some areas possibly experienced more than 24\u00a0in (610\u00a0mm) of precipitation. However, according to the Weather Prediction Center (WPC), rainfall peaked at 19.44\u00a0in (494\u00a0mm) in southern Tamaulipas.[41][42] Despite the large amounts of precipitation, it was considered beneficial due to drought conditions in some areas, especially in Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon.[41] However, in other nearby areas, the heavy rainfall flooded streets and destroyed roadways and bridges.[42] Further north, Gabrielle dropped light to moderate rainfall in Texas.[43] Gabrielle caused six fatalities in Mexico, while the damage figure is unknown.[41]"

The wave quickly organized once in the Atlantic and developed into Tropical Depression Nine on August\u00a022.[44] Due to low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Humberto six hours later.[45] It continued west-northwestward and then westward under the influence of a mid-level trough. Early on August\u00a023, Humberto intensified into a hurricane.[44] By early on August\u00a024 the storm developed a well-defined eye after becoming a Category\u00a02 hurricane.[46] After peaking with winds of 110\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h) on August\u00a024, Humberto began a fujiwhara interaction with Hurricane Iris.[44] This generated shear on Humberto, causing the storm to weaken back to a Category\u00a01 hurricane on August\u00a026.[47] Humberto continued to weaken until August\u00a028, when it was barely a hurricane.[44] Operationally, Humberto was erroneously downgraded to a tropical storm on that same day.[48] Thereafter, the storm began restrengthening and reached a secondary peak slightly below the threshold for a Category\u00a02 hurricane on August\u00a030.[44] While tracking northeastward, Humberto began weakening and acquiring extratropical characteristics starting on the following day.[49] Later on August\u00a031, Humberto weakened to a tropical storm. By 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a01, the storm was absorbed by an extratropical low while west of the Azores.[44] Humberto was the second of four tropical waves in quick succession in the tropical Atlantic that all eventually became tropical storms or hurricanes; it was preceded by the wave that became Iris, and followed by the waves that became Karen and Luis. It was also the first of three tropical cyclones to form within a 24-hour period on August 21 and 22; Iris formed 12\u00a0hours later and Jerry formed 18\u00a0hours later.

It rapidly developed a closed circulation, though convection diminished a few days after the wave entered the Atlantic. However, convection began to re-develop and by 12:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a022, the system developed into Tropical Depression Ten. Six hours later, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Iris. Thereafter, Iris continued to intensify and became a hurricane later on August\u00a023. After reaching winds of 85\u00a0mph (137\u00a0km/h), the storm began to weaken during a Fujiwhara interaction with Hurricane Humberto, causing Iris to be downgraded to a tropical storm on August\u00a024. Iris continued to steadily weaken as it approached the Lesser Antilles. After making a direct hit on Saint Lucia and Martinique on August\u00a026, steering currents produced by a trough forced Iris north-northwestward; this caused it to brush Dominica and Guadeloupe and make landfall in Antigua and Barbuda on August\u00a027. Around the time, Iris began restrengthening due to a decrease in wind shear and became a hurricane again on August\u00a028.[50] It is possible that the forward motion of the storm became slightly erratic after a Fujiwhara interaction began with Tropical Storm Karen. By September\u00a01, Iris peaked as a 110\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h) Category\u00a02 hurricane. After curving north-northeastward, Iris began to weaken after encountering increasing wind shear and decreasing sea surface temperatures. Nonetheless, it was still able to absorb Tropical Depression Karen on September\u00a03. By early on the following day, Iris weakened to a tropical storm, six hours before becoming extratropical, while centered southeast of Newfoundland.[50] While crossing through the Leeward Islands, Iris produced heavy rainfall. High waves in Trinidad caused coastal flooding and damage to boats.[51] In Martinique, significant amounts of precipitation led to flooding and landslides. Four fatalities were reported on that island,[50] two of which occurred after mudslides push a house off a cliff. Flooding was also reported in coastal areas, resulting in heavy damage in Le Vauclin.[52] On Guadeloupe, the only island to record tropical storm force winds, one fatality occurred after a person drowned in a flooded river. Rainfall in Antigua damaged banana trees and caused flooding in low-lying areas.[50]"

On August\u00a023, the system was declared Tropical Depression Eleven while located between Florida and Andros Island. The depression strengthened as it headed north-northwestward, despite only marginally favorable conditions. On the following day, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Jerry while located only 33\u00a0mi (53\u00a0km) offshore Florida. At 18:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a023, the storm made landfall later near Jupiter, Florida, as a minimal tropical storm with winds of 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h). Jerry slowly weakened and was downgraded to a tropical depression late on August\u00a024. After drifting across Florida, the cyclone briefly emerged over the Gulf of Mexico, but then headed northward and back inland. Jerry meandered over Georgia and eventually dissipated on August 28.[53] Jerry dropped heavy rainfall in Florida, especially in the southern portion of the state, where 16.8\u00a0in (430\u00a0mm) of precipitation fell in Golden Gate.[54] Although the storm struck the east coast of the state, much of the damage in Florida occurred in Collier County. In that county, 340\u00a0houses were damaged and 12\u00a0others were destroyed due to flooding. Other nearby counties also reported flood damage, albeit less severe. Agricultural damage was also reported in southwest Florida, primarily to citrus crops. The storm also spawned two tornadoes in West Central Florida, though neither caused any damage.[53] Heavy rainfall also occurred in Georgia, with some areas experiencing over 12 inches (300\u00a0mm) of rain. The remnants of Jerry produced heavy precipitation in North and South Carolina, with 18.51\u00a0in (470\u00a0mm) observed in Antreville, South Carolina.[54] In both states, many roads were flooded and numerous buildings and houses were damaged, especially in the Charlotte and Raleigh areas of North Carolina.

Shortly after entering the Atlantic, the tropical wave developed into a low-pressure area. Over the next few days, the cloud pattern associated with the system fluctuated in organization and a tropical depression may have developed as early as August\u00a024. Two days later, satellite imagery indicated a well-defined low-level cloud center. As a result, it is estimated that Tropical Depression Twelve developed at 12:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a026. The depression slowly intensified as it tracked west-northwestward under the influence of low- to mid-level flow.[55] Although sea surface temperatures were warm, outflow from Hurricane Humberto may have slowed further strengthening of the depression.[56] The depression finally began to develop bands north of the center on August\u00a027,[57] though overall, the deep convection remained disorganized; the circulation of the depression also became elongated.[58] Around 06:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a028, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Karen. Early on the following day, Karen peaked with maximum sustained winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h). By August\u00a031, Karen north-northwestward around the circulation of Hurricane Iris and thus, a Fujiwhara interaction began.[55] As the storm was approaching Iris, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began predicting on September\u00a01 that Karen would merge with the former.[59] On the following day, Karen weakened to a tropical depression. Early on September\u00a03, Karen lost its well-defined center and merged with Iris at 06:00\u00a0UTC, while centered near Bermuda.[55]"

        "content": "A westward-moving tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Thirteen at 18:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a028. Initially, strong vertical shear hindered the depression from strengthening significantly; by early on August\u00a029, however, it acquired sufficient organization to be named Tropical Storm Luis. The storm continued to strengthen slowly until wind shear decreased on August\u00a030, causing Luis to become a hurricane later that day. By September\u00a01, Luis became a major hurricane after it reached Category\u00a03 intensity. Later that day, Luis was further upgraded to a Category\u00a04 hurricane. Early on September\u00a03, maximum sustained winds reached 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h), though the lowest pressure in relation to Luis was not recorded until September\u00a08. After weakening slightly, Luis passed near Antigua and made landfall in Barbuda early on September\u00a05, before brushing Saint Barth\u00e9lemy, Saint Martin, and Anguilla. After remaining a major hurricane for a week, Luis weakened to a Category\u00a02 hurricane while northeast of the Bahamas on September\u00a08;[60] the weakening was possibly as a result of the storm crossing over decreasing ocean temperature due to upwelling from Hurricane Felix.[61][62] On September\u00a010, Luis rapidly accelerated northeastward and weakened to a Category\u00a01 hurricane. Luis made landfall on the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland early on September\u00a011.[60] While crossing the island, cold, dry air began impacting the storm, causing it to rapidly become extratropical and merge with a frontal zone shortly after reentering the Atlantic Ocean.[60][63] Strong winds and high waves wreaked havoc on several islands in the Lesser Antilles. In Antigua and Barbuda, winds reaching 141\u00a0mph (227\u00a0km/h) damaged numerous houses on Barbuda and destroyed nearly 45% of residences on Antigua.[60] An estimated 1,700\u00a0people were forced to flee to shelters and about 3,200\u00a0others were left homeless. Within Antigua and Barbuda alone, three fatalities occurred, 165\u00a0people were injured, and damage totaled to $350\u00a0million.[64] Strong winds in Guadeloupe caused moderate damage to homes and trees, especially in the Grande-Terre region. At Basse-Terre, nearly 100% of the banana crop was destroyed. Heavy rainfall in this portion of the island caused significant damage to roads. High waves also caused significant coastal flooding on the west coast of the island.[65] About $50\u00a0million in damage was reported and one fatality occurred.[60][66] The most significant effects occurred in the Netherlands Antilles, especially on Saint Martin \u2013 including both the French and Dutch side of the island. Approximately 60% of buildings were damaged to some degree.[60] Additionally, severe disruption to utility services was reported, including water, electricity, and telephone service.[67] Nine deaths and $1.8\u00a0billion in damage was reported on the island.[60] In Dominica, storm surge left 1,000\u00a0people homeless and $47\u00a0million in property losses.[68] Winds exceeding 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) caused severe impact in eastern Puerto Rico, especially Culebra. The area was left without electricity and 350\u00a0houses were extensively damaged or destroyed. On the main island, effects were primarily limited to downed trees and power lines on highways and electrical outages at about 200,000\u00a0houses. Throughout Puerto Rico, damaged reached $200\u00a0million and there were two deaths. Similarly strong winds lashed the United States Virgin Islands. Saint Thomas suffered the worst, where 75%\u201380% of houses were severely damaged or destroyed. The island's hospital was flooded. Damage in the United States Virgin Islands was estimated at $300\u00a0million.[69] Lesser effects occurred in the British Virgin Islands. Several homes were deroofed, especially on Anegada and Virgin Gorda. There were a number of telephone and electrical outages after a number of poles were toppled.[70] In the United States, storm surge and high tides were reported along the East Coast, leading to two drowning deaths\u2014one in North Carolina and the other in New York. In the former state, eight homes were swept into the ocean and damage reached $1.9\u00a0million.[71] The storm also brought minor flooding to Newfoundland, with one death and $500,000 in damage.[72] In addition, Luis was the earliest twelfth-named storm on record at the time. However, this record has since been broken by Hurricane Laura in 2020.[73]"

Later that day, Marilyn made landfall near Jenny Point, Dominica, with winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) at 21:00\u00a0UTC. Shortly thereafter, Marilyn entered the Caribbean Sea. While approaching the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, the storm became a Category\u00a02 hurricane. After avoiding landfall, Marilyn re-entered into the Atlantic Ocean on September\u00a016. The storm continued to intensify and early on September\u00a017, it peaked as a minimal Category\u00a03 hurricane. While curving northward, Marilyn fluctuated in intensity until beginning a weakening trend on September\u00a020. The storm turned east-northeastward, and by the following day, it weakened to a tropical storm.

In addition, a roof was torn off an emergency shelter.[78] On Martinique, moderate rainfall and tropical storm force winds were recorded, though no damage or fatalities occurred. Effects in Guadeloupe were similar, but more intense. In Saint-Claude, 20\u00a0in (510\u00a0mm) of rain fell, which was the highest precipitation total associated with Marilyn. Wind speeds measured on Guadeloupe were also tropical storm force, with sustained winds of 59\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h) in Marie-Galante. Similar but lesser winds and rain occurred in Saint Barth\u00e9lemy and Sint Maarten. However, the United States possessions, were, by far, suffered the most damage. Strong winds damaged or destroyed at least 80% of buildings on St. Thomas, which left 10,000\u00a0people homeless.[77] Storm surge in the Charlotte Amalie harbor beached the USCGC Point Ledge and damaged many smaller boats.[79] Moderate to severe damage was also reported on St. Croix and St. John,[77] where 20\u201330% of houses were damaged.[80] On Culebra, an offshore island of Puerto Rico, wind gusts as high as 125\u00a0mph (201\u00a0km/h) were reported.[77] As a result, light planes were overturned and 250\u00a0homes were either damaged or destroyed. Large waves also caused street flooding on the island. Flash floods on the main island of Puerto Rico sent rivers above their banks.[80] Moderate winds and rainfall on Antigua caused extensive damage to banana crops. While the storm bypassed Bermuda, tropical storm force winds were reported but no damage occurred.[77] Overall, Marilyn caused at least 13\u00a0fatalities and $2.1\u00a0billion in damage.[66][77][81]"

The depression slowly moved over the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula for a few days, eventually emerging off the north coast, where it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Opal on September\u00a030. After becoming a hurricane on October\u00a02, the cyclone rapidly intensified and began moving north across the Gulf of Mexico. At 10:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a04, Opal peaked as a Category\u00a04 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 916\u00a0mbar (27.0\u00a0inHg). Shortly thereafter, the storm began weakening. Upon making landfall in Pensacola Beach, Florida, around 22:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a04, winds had decreased to 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h), which is Category\u00a03 intensity. Opal weakened rapidly after moving inland, deteriorating to a tropical storm early on October\u00a05 and then to a tropical depression about six hours later. At 18:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a05, Opal became extratropical over Kentucky. The extratropical storm dissipated over Ontario on October\u00a06.[87] The precursor and initial stages of Opal brought heavy rainfall and flooding to Guatemala and Mexico. In the former, rivers near the border with Mexico overflowed, resulting in the evacuation of 110 families in Tec\u00fan Um\u00e1n. Approximately 34,000\u00a0people were left homeless. Landslides left damage to infrastructure and agriculture, with about $17\u00a0million in crop damage alone. Thirty-one deaths occurred in Guatemala.[88] In Mexico, more than 42,000 people were forced to evacuate as rivers overtopped their banks in Campeche and Tabasco,[89] while an estimated 100,000\u00a0people evacuated due to the storm.[90] Around 500,000\u00a0acres of crops had been destroyed by the floods.[89] Agricultural losses in Campeche alone were estimated in the hundreds of millions of dollars.[91] Nineteen fatalities were reported in Mexico.[87] In Florida, strong winds and storm surge left severe damage in the panhandle. From Wakulla County westward, many structures including homes and buildings were swept away or suffered some degree of damage. In Escambia, Okaloosa, and Santa Rosa counties, nearly 300\u00a0homes were destroyed and 1,000\u00a0others suffered major damage. The storm left at least $2.1\u00a0billion in damage in Florida.[92] In Alabama, storm surge ranging from 4 to 7\u00a0ft (1.2 to 2.1\u00a0m) left significant damage in coastal counties. Inland, tropical storm force winds gusts were observed as far north as Huntsville. Numerous trees and power lines were downed in several counties, leaving 2.6\u00a0million people across the state without electricity at the height of the storm. Downed trees also damaged some dwellings, primarily mobile homes. Several short-lived tornadoes destroyed over 125\u00a0homes, while 150\u00a0others suffered major damage. It was estimated that the storm caused over $182\u00a0million in damage in Alabama.[92] Strong wind gusts were reported in northern Georgia, with a gust of 69\u00a0mph (111\u00a0km/h) at Marietta.[93] There were more than 1,200\u00a0telephone poles knocked down and almost 5,000\u00a0power lines snapped. Wind damage in Rabun County alone reached about $5\u00a0million, while the pecan crop suffered around $50\u00a0million in damage.

Roxanne posed a threat to Cuba and the Cayman Islands, which briefly prompted the issuance of a tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch. However, a high pressure system forced Roxanne to tracked generally westward, which prevented it from significantly affecting the aforementioned islands. After becoming a hurricane on October\u00a010, Roxanne began to rapidly strengthen. Later that day, the storm peaked as a minimal Category\u00a03 hurricane, with winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h).[101] By 02:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a011, Roxanne made landfall just north of Tulum, Quintana Roo, on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula with winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h). The storm significantly weakened inland and emerged into the Bay of Campeche as a tropical storm. Several shortwave troughs and ridges caused Roxanne to track aimlessly through the southern Gulf of Mexico. By October\u00a014, it re-strengthened into a hurricane. After making a close approach to the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula while heading southeastward, Roxanne weakened to a tropical storm on October\u00a017 as it doubled back to the northwest. A cold front forced Roxanne westward on October\u00a019, and it simultaneously weakened to a tropical depression. The cyclone curved abruptly southward and dissipated just offshore of Veracruz on October\u00a021.[101] In the Gulf of Mexico, a petroleum work barge with 245\u00a0people on board capsized, causing five people to drown. Due to its erratic movement, Roxanne dropped heavy rainfall in many areas of southern Mexico, and some areas reported over 25 inches (640\u00a0mm) of precipitation.[102] Extensive flooding occurred as a result, which destroyed crops, washed out roads, and damaged at least 40,000\u00a0homes. In addition, significant coastal flooding also occurred, as storm surge for nearly a week caused water to travel inland for hundreds of yards. High winds also occurred over the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, with one station reporting hurricane-force winds on October\u00a011. Unconfirmed reports also indicated that many hotel lobbies in Cancun and Cozumel were damaged from pounding waves. Overall, Roxanne caused $1.5\u00a0billion in damage and 29\u00a0fatalities.

        "content": " The 1897 Atlantic hurricane season was an inactive season, featuring only six known tropical cyclones, four of which made landfall. There were three hurricanes, none of which strengthened into major hurricanes, which are Category\u00a03 or higher on the modern-day Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale.[1] The first system was initially observed south of Cape Verde on August\u00a031, an unusually late date. The storm was the strongest of the season, peaking as a Category\u00a02 hurricane with winds of 100\u00a0mph (155\u00a0km/h). While located well north of the Azores, rough seas by the storm sunk a ship, killing all 45\u00a0crewmen. A second storm was first spotted in the Straits of Florida on September\u00a010. It strengthened into a hurricane and tracked northwestward across the Gulf of Mexico, striking Louisiana shortly before dissipating on September\u00a013. This storm caused 29\u00a0deaths and $150,000 (1897\u00a0USD) in damage. The third storm developed in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico on September\u00a020. It tracked along the East Coast of the United States, causing widespread damage, particularly in Florida. A fourth storm was first observed in the northwestern Caribbean Sea on September\u00a025. This storm moved in a semicircular path around Cuba and was last noted offshore Florida four days later. Minor wind and flood damage was reported in Cuba. On October\u00a09, the fifth hurricane of the season was located near the Windward Islands. Moving westward, the storm eventually curved northeastward while crossing the Caribbean Sea, causing it to strike Cuba. Minor damage was reported on the island, though a ship sank with 230\u00a0people aboard; 42\u00a0of them were rescued, while the remaining 188\u00a0were presumed dead. The final observed system developed in the vicinity of the Bahamas on October\u00a023. It later struck the Outer Banks of North Carolina; the storm caused severe flooding in southeastern Virginia, with six deaths reported. It was last noted on October\u00a029."

Initially a tropical storm, it slowly strengthened while heading west-northwestward, reaching hurricane status on September\u00a01. Curving northwestward, the storm intensified further into a Category\u00a02 hurricane on September\u00a03. It continued heading northwestward until curving to the northeast late on September\u00a06. Around 1130\u00a0UTC on the following day, the storm attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 100\u00a0mph (155\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 972\u00a0mbar (28.7\u00a0inHg). Early on September\u00a09, the system weakened to a Category\u00a01, before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone well north of the Azores later that day. The extratropical remnants continued weaken, before dissipating west of Ireland on September\u00a010.[2] The crew of the barkentine St. Peter reported that another ship capsized with 45\u00a0men aboard; all of them drowned.[3][4]"

Intensifying slightly further, the storm peaked with maximum sustained winds of 85\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) shortly thereafter. The hurricane maintained this intensity while moving west-northwestward across the Gulf of Mexico and struck extreme southwestern Cameron Parish, Louisiana early on September\u00a013. Shortly thereafter, it weakened to a tropical storm over Texas, before dissipating several hours later.[2] No impact was reported in the Florida Keys.[3] Strong winds in southwestern Louisiana damaged crops and toppled windmills. Offshore, boats and schooners suffered severe damage from wind-driven waves.[5] Severe damage occurred in eastern Texas, with strong winds and storm surge damaging or destroying numerous buildings, houses, and crops in several cities, including Beaumont, New Sabine Pass, Orange, Sabine Pass, and Port Arthur. The storm was considered the worst in Orange since 1875. Overall, the storm caused at least 29\u00a0fatalities in Texas, with six died at Port Arthur, three offshore, four in Sabine Pass, and sixteen others at Beaumont. Damage in the state reached approximately $150,000.[6]"

Strengthening while heading northeastward, the system made landfall near Boca Grande, Florida with winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) early on the following day.[2] Heavy rainfall in Tampa caused the streets and sideways to become inundated, leaving portions of the city impassable, especially areas adjacent to the DeSoto Hotel. Two fire stations were severely damaged. On the east coast of Florida, the worst impact occurred in Cocoa, where some buildings were destroyed and others were deroofed. Further north in Fernandina Beach, ships in the harbor broke loose and tossed about, leaving considerable damage.[3] Although the storm weakened while crossing Florida, it later re-strengthened after emerging into the Atlantic Ocean later on September\u00a021. The system moved northeastward and made landfall near Hatteras, North Carolina at 1000\u00a0UTC on September\u00a023, with winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h).[2] In eastern North Carolina, strong winds and high tides were observed in New Bern.[7] Shortly thereafter, it re-emerged into the Atlantic Ocean. The system began weakening, while making two landfalls on September\u00a024, the first on Long Island, New York, and the second near New London, Connecticut. Thereafter, the storm accelerated to the northeast and weakened to a tropical depression over New Brunswick early on September\u00a025.

The storm curved in a northwesterly direction by October\u00a014 while located over the northwestern Caribbean Sea, and then northeastward on the following day. Eventually, it began to strengthen and reached hurricane intensity early on October\u00a018. Several hours later, the hurricane made landfall in modern-day Sancti Sp\u00edritus Province, Cuba with winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h).[2] Minimal damage was reported in Cuba. However, the ship Triton sank offshore Pinar del R\u00edo Province with 230\u00a0men aboard.[3] Forty-two people were rescued by passing ships, while the remaining 188\u00a0died,[9] including the captain, who committed suicide.[10] The system weakened while crossing Cuba and fell to tropical storm intensity early on October\u00a019. Around that time, the storm emerged into the Atlantic Ocean near the central Bahamas. Crossing through the islands, the system curved north-northeastward and began to accelerate. It did not re-strengthen and made landfall near Cape Hatteras, North Carolina with winds of 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h).[2] Strong winds and rainfall totals ranging from 1 to 7 inches (25 to 178\u00a0mm) were observed along the coast of North Carolina.[7] Strong winds were reported in portions of the Northeastern United States, with highest wind speed being 56\u00a0mph (90\u00a0km/h), observed in Block Island, Rhode Island.[11] Reemerging into the Atlantic Ocean, this system continued rapidly northeastward, before becoming extratropical offshore New England on October\u00a021.[2]"

Early on October\u00a026, the system curved southeastward and quickly moved offshore. It then moved eastward and later to the northeast, before becoming extratropical on October\u00a029.[2] Chenoweth also proposed the removing of this storm from HURDAT, arguing that weather maps indicate that it never acquired tropical characteristics.[8] Along much of the East Coast of the United States, the Weather Bureau warned about gales and rough seas. From Cape Hatteras, North Carolina to Maine, storm surge and tides resulted in considerable damage to boardwalks and beach cottages.[11] In Virginia, storm surge caused a number of small crafts and a few ships to be washed ashore or destroyed. The James River rose to 5 feet (1.5\u00a0m) above high tide. A few cities experienced coastal flooding, including Chincoteague and Norfolk. The Willoughby Spit was split by the tides, washing away the Old Point Comfort railroad tracks. Cedar Island was \"leveled to a mere flat breath of sand\". Six fatalities were reported in Virginia, four of them from drowning in Newport News, while the other two were caused by electrocution.[12]"

Moving southwestward and later westward, the depression remained weak for several days, until strengthening into a tropical storm while approaching the Bahamas early on August\u00a09. It then crossed through the islands and intensified only slightly. Late on August\u00a010, the storm made landfall near Deerfield Beach, Florida. After reaching the Gulf of Mexico the next day, continuous intensifying occurred and by August\u00a012, the storm reached hurricane status. Peaking with winds of 90\u00a0mph (145\u00a0km/h), it struck Louisiana late on August\u00a014 and then Mississippi less than 24\u00a0hours later. The system weakened to a tropical storm early on August\u00a016 and became extratropical several hours later. Along portions of the east coast of Florida, \"considerable damage\" was reported due to strong winds. In Alabama, trees were uprooted, houses were de-roofed, and chimneys collapsed in Mobile. Some areas of the city were also inundated with up to 18 inches (460\u00a0mm) of water due to storm tide. Several yachts, schooners, and ships were wrecked or sunk, resulting in at least $70,000 (1901\u00a0USD) in damage.[nb 1] However, due to warnings by the Weather Bureau, the Mobile Chamber of Commerce estimated that several millions of dollars in damage was evaded. All towns along the coast of Mississippi \"suffered seriously\". In Louisiana, severe damage was reported at some towns due to strong winds and high tides. The community of Port Eads reported that only the lighthouse was not destroyed, while other sources state that an office building also remained standing. In New Orleans, overflowing levees inundated numerous streets. Outside the city, crops suffered severely, particularly rice.

The next day, the system curved west-northwestward and briefly to the west on August\u00a08. Finally, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm at 0000\u00a0UTC on August\u00a09, while located about 50 miles (80\u00a0km) northeast of Cat Island, Bahamas.[2] Around that time, the Weather Bureau first observed a \"feeble disturbance in the subtropical north of Cuba.\"[3] Between August\u00a09 and August\u00a010, the storm strengthened slightly further and moved through the Bahamas, passing over Cat Island and the Berry Islands.[2] Around 2200\u00a0UTC on August\u00a010, the system made landfall near Deerfield Beach, Florida with winds of 45\u00a0mph (70\u00a0km/h).[2] Early on August\u00a011, the storm weakened slightly while crossing Florida.

The next day, as the storm was moving across Florida, another message sent to Weather Bureau stations from New Orleans to Charleston warned of the potential for severe squalls along the west coast of Florida. While approaching the Gulf Coast of the United States on August\u00a013, storm warnings were ordered for Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana, as well as for the west coast of Florida. At the National Weather Service office in New Orleans, hurricane warnings were ordered in Louisiana from mouth of the Mississippi River westward on August\u00a015 and expanded to eastern Texas later that day. In New Orleans, 500\u00a0men, who were city authorities or levee board members, worked to strengthen the levees along canals in the city. Throughout much of the Gulf Coast of the United States, vessels and ships were warned to take precautions and remain in port.[3] In Florida, \"considerable damage\" due to strong winds was reported along portions of the east coast. Wind gusts reached 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) in Pensacola.[4] Offshore, the Portuguese bark Propheta, with a cargo of timber worth $5,000, was badly damaged.[5] Strong winds up to 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) were observed in the Mobile area of Alabama,[3] uprooting trees, unroofing houses, and toppling chimneys. Tides inundated the cotton exchange with up to 18 inches (460\u00a0mm) of water, while the Western Union, post office, and electrical house for railroads were also flooded. The pleasure yacht Ariel, which was bound for the Fish River, was smashed into pieces at a wharf along the eastern end of Mobile Bay. Between 12 and 15 schooners from the F. F. Saunders company fishing fleet were badly damaged; four of which sank, resulting in $70,000 in damage.[5] However, due to warnings by the Weather Bureau, the Chamber of Commerce estimated that several millions of dollars in damage was evaded. All towns along the coast of Mississippi \"suffered seriously\".[3] High winds and rough seas were observed in Louisiana. In Port Eads, five-minute sustained winds reached 56\u00a0mph (90\u00a0km/h), before the anemometer blew away. At the same location, a 24-hour rainfall record was set for the month of August, with 7.64 inches (194\u00a0mm) of precipitation observed.[1] According to a contemporaneous report, the weather instrument shelter was swept away due to storm tides and the flag staff was broken. While the office building did weather the storm intact, documents in it were soaked.[3] However, a report written in 2010 states that in Port Eads only the lighthouse remained standing in the aftermath of the devastation.[1] Fifteen fatalities were reported after a house was swept away by storm tides.[4] The 2010 report, however, states that a total of ten deaths were caused by the storm over its entire existence.[1] In Pilottown, the large \"lookout\" tower was toppled and destroyed. The outhouse that displaymen used and slept in was blown over and then rapidly filled with water, due to tides rising to 4 feet (1.2\u00a0m) in only 10\u00a0minutes. Additionally, property of the Weather Bureau was also damaged.[3] Buras reported 4 feet (1.2\u00a0m) of water in town.[1] River stages along the Mississippi River at New Orleans rose to a level of 7 feet (2.1\u00a0m) during the storm, producing much flooding. The Carondelet Canal also overflowed, inundating streets in the neighborhood of Trem\u00e9 with 1 to 3 feet (0.30 to 0.91\u00a0m) of water. Levee breaks around New Orleans flooded the city. Additionally, strong winds littered the streets with tree branches. The worst hit areas of New Orleans were the neighborhoods of Bucktown, Milneburg, West End, all of which are located on the shore of Lake Pontchartrain.[3] In the New Orleans suburb of Shell Beach, severe crop damage was reported, particularly to rice. While sailing the Mississippi River just outside New Orleans, Dr. J. N. Thomas reported that a schooner and a small boat were wrecked, resulting in 60\u00a0deaths.[5] However, this was not confirmed. Overall, damage in Louisiana reached $1\u00a0million, which excluded losses to crops.[3]"

In addition, significant flooding which was already underway due to heavy rain from the front to the north was worsened by rainfall brought on by Ike in parts of Missouri, Illinois and Indiana to the west of the center.[2] The severe winds reported across the Midwest to the east of the center (although little or no rain fell in many of those areas) were as a result of a combination of factors, including the strength and size of Ike itself allowing for a strong pressure gradient and a well-defined structure, the location on the east side of the storm where the winds are usually stronger in a northward-moving system due to its forward motion, its fast forward motion of about 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h), and the warm air ahead of the storm allowed the high winds aloft to reach the surface easier. Many areas reported wind gusts up to hurricane force.[3] It was one of the largest power outages caused by a natural disaster in the history of the Midwest, with around 3.7 million customers losing power (well over 8 million people), including 2.6 million outages in the state of Ohio alone[4] 26 people were killed in the interior states. Ohio alone sustained over $560 million in damage.[5]"

One of the hardest-hit communities was Munster, where 5,000 residents had to be evacuated as a result of the Little Calumet River overflowing in many spots and breaking through the levee near the Calumet Avenue bridge. Several people had to be rescued by boat and there was a garage fire and a massive house explosion in the flooded area that leveled one house and damaged others.

A Duke Energy spokesperson said \"We have never seen anything like this. Never. We're talking about 90 percent of our customers without power\".[31] On September 15, 16 and 17, most of the schools in Hamilton County and Butler County had classes cancelled because of power outages.[32][33] In Cincinnati, the effects of this storm have become known as The Cincinnati Blackout. A water emergency was also declared in Butler County as the water supply diminished due to the lack of power, and a \"Level One\" emergency was declared in the county to encourage people to remain at home, although stopping short of a curfew.[34] In the Dayton, Ohio area 300,000 of 515,000 Dayton Power & Light Co. customers lost power at some point following severe wind storms on the afternoon of September 14, according to a company spokesperson. As of Thursday morning, September 18, 90,000 DP&L customers remained without power.[35] Also hard hit were central Ohio (with over 350,000 customers losing power) and northeastern Ohio (with over 310,000 customers losing power).[36] A curfew was implemented on September 17 in Carlisle due to increased looting activity as a result of the lengthy power outage and damage.[37] There were 370,000 outages in the state capital of Columbus.[38] Many of the citizens in Columbus were without power for close to a week, because 25 percent of the AEP company's workers were in Texas helping crews there restore electricity to the millions who lost power because of Hurricane Ike. All the major school districts in Columbus were closed for at least two days. Agricultural damage was severe, with as much as 20% of the state's total corn crop lost as a result of winds blowing down corn stalks. Some fields were nearly flattened by the hurricane-force wind gusts.[12] Tens of thousands of people also lost power in northwest Ohio where widespread outages and damage were reported in the Lima and Findlay areas as the center of the storm tracked just to the north and west. Some of the most significant damage there included a radio tower that collapsed and a church that was heavily damaged.[39] In Mount Healthy, a tree crushing a house resulted in one fatality, and two others died when a tree crashed onto a motorcycle parade in Hueston Woods State Park near Oxford.[31] A similar incident in Lorain County also resulted in the death of a young boy who was hit by a fallen tree limb.[40] An indirect death in Hilliard was caused by electrocution while working on a generator,[41] and another in St. Bernard was caused by a candle fire while power was out.[42] The southern part of Michigan sustained heavy rainfall resulting in many houses being flooded, partially due to Ike and partially due to the frontal boundary.[43] Two deaths were reported in Michigan - both drownings, one in a ditch and one in a vehicle. Tornado warnings were also issued across Southern Michigan, for Van Buren, Kalamazoo, and Calhoun counties.[27] A tornado was confirmed in Wayne County, resulting in localized damage associated with EF-2 force winds.[44]"

Most damage in the Windsor area with Ike was confined to downed power lines and toppled tree branches with the wind gusts reaching 80\u00a0km/h (50\u00a0mph), with spotty street flooding that made driving completely treacherous in some areas.[50] Highways were washed out in the Bruce Peninsula, and trees were uprooted in London, Ontario. The storm continued to cause wind and rain damage as it continues east along the St. Lawrence River leaving around 25,000 customers without electricity, especially in Belleville, Brockville, Bancroft, Peterborough, Bowmanville, Huntsville and Timmins.[51] In the province of Quebec, regions to the north of the Saint Lawrence River received 50 to 70\u00a0mm (1.97 to 2.76\u00a0in) of rainfall (Hautes-Laurentides, Haute-Mauricie, R\u00e9serve faunique des Laurentides, Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, Charlevoix and C\u00f4te-Nord). Maximum rainfall was recorded between Lac-St-Jean and the R\u00e9serve faunique des Laurentides with a station recording more than 90\u00a0mm (3.54\u00a0in) of rain[52] Along the river, the amount was more in the 10 and 30\u00a0mm (0.39 and 1.18\u00a0in)  range, except in Quebec City area which received almost 50\u00a0mm (1.97\u00a0in), most of it between 7:00\u00a0p.m. and 8:00\u00a0p.m.[52] This rain caused small inundations, storm drain overflows, and caused one major highway to close.[53] In Montreal, high humidity levels pushed by the system caused electrical malfunction one of the lines of the subway, stranding commuters.[54] High winds up to 78\u00a0km/h (48.47\u00a0mph) caused, at their worst, over 25,000 households to lose electricity in Montreal, Laval, Estrie and Mont\u00e9r\u00e9gie[55] and when it reached the Magdalen Islands, it had enough strength to cause a sail boat, the Oc\u00e9an, to sink. Its six passengers were rescued by a helicopter of the Canadian Coast Guard.[52][55] The \"Ike Spike\" in gasoline prices was quite severe in Canada, with gas prices rising anywhere from 15 to 20 cents per liter.[56][57]"

Without the use of the Portage Diversion catastrophic damages would occur downstream. However, even with the restriction of flows on the lower Assiniboine River to about 18,000 cfs property damage occurred.  Numerous properties along the Assiniboine River east of Portage la Prairie suffered significant property damage as well as bank erosion and loss of mature stands of trees.

At the time, there were two earthen dams holding the water back at Sunset Lake and Mary Elmer Lake. Eventually the pressure was too much and the dams gave way sending a torrent of water down the Cohansey River as well as tributaries connected to the Lakes. The wall of water surged down through the banks of the Cohansey, emptying the lakes and the Raceway and flowing into and through downtown Bridgeton, which straddles the river. All the bridges that connected the east and west sides of the town were destroyed.[1] Also damaged was Tumbling Dam Park, where the dam that held the water of Sunset Lake was located.[2] An estimated $1\u00a0million (equivalent to $22.8\u00a0million in 2023) in damage was caused by the flooding.[3]"

In the photographs taken at the time, the pontoon bridge appears to be very flimsy. In fact it was very stable, and one could drive a car across it. Due to the surge of water during the flood, much debris was deposited in the Cohansey River, making navigation of the waterway dangerous.

The capital, Canberra, experienced the dust storm on 22 September,[1][2] and on 23 September the storm reached Sydney and Brisbane. Some of the thousands of tons of dirt and soil lifted in the dust storm were dumped in Sydney Harbour and the Tasman Sea. On 23 September, the dust plume measured more than 500 kilometres (310\u00a0mi) in width and 1,000 kilometres (620\u00a0mi) in length and covered dozens of towns and cities in two states.[3] By 24 September, analysis using MODIS at NASA measured the distance from the northern edge at Cape York to the southern edge of the plume to be 3,450\u00a0km.[4] While the cloud was visible from space, on the ground the intense red-orange colour and drop in temperature drew comparisons with nuclear winter, Armageddon, and the planet Mars.[5][6][7] The dust storm was described by the Bureau of Meteorology as a \"pretty incredible event\" that was the worst in the state of New South Wales in nearly 70 years.[5][6][8][9] The phenomenon was reported around the world. The Weather Channel's Richard Whitaker said: \"This is unprecedented. We are seeing earth, wind and fire together\". It was later referred to as \"The mother of all dust storms.\"[10]"

Normal days register up to 20 micrograms and bushfires generate 500 micrograms. This concentration of dust broke records in many towns and cities.[13] The CSIRO estimated that the storm carried some 16 million tonnes of dust from the deserts of Central Australia,[14] and during the peak of the storm, the Australian continent was estimated to be losing 75,000 tonnes of dust per hour off the NSW coast north of Sydney.[15] The dust storm coincided with other extreme weather conditions which affected the cities of Adelaide and Melbourne. The dust is believed to have originated from far-western New South Wales and north-east South Australia. This includes an area known as the 'Corner Country',[16] a dry, remote area of far-western New South Wales. In South Australia the dust may also have come from Lake Eyre Basin or the Woomera area, the latter raising concerns that it was radioactive and dangerous since the area contains the Olympic Dam uranium mine.[13]"

The area of low pressure that eventually became Zelda formed near the International Date Line, and strengthened into a tropical depression on November\u00a027.  The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) reported that the depression had reached tropical storm intensity near the Marshall Islands on November 28, thus naming it Zelda. On November\u00a029, the storm quickly strengthened to 65 knots (120\u00a0km/h; 75\u00a0mph) according to the JTWC, equivalent to a Category\u00a01 typhoon on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale.  It reached a peak of 80\u00a0kn (150\u00a0km/h; 90\u00a0mph) according to the JTWC, and 60\u00a0kn (110\u00a0km/h; 70\u00a0mph) according to the Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA), with a barometric pressure of 975 hectopascals (28.8\u00a0inHg).  Zelda weakened into a tropical storm on December 2, and then a tropical depression two days later.  The JTWC discontinued warnings late on December\u00a04, while the JMA declared the storm to be extratropical the next day and continued to track until it crossed the International Date Line again on December 7. Zelda caused significant damage in the Marshall Islands, and operations at Kwajalein Missile Range were disrupted severely.  No deaths or injuries were reported. About 60\u00a0percent of homes were destroyed in Ebeye Island, leaving 6,000\u00a0people without residence.  Nearly all crops on the islands were destroyed, and food and other supplies were contaminated by salt.  Later in December, the president of the United States, George H. W. Bush declared the storm to be a major disaster, allowing the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to assist with funding and repairs.  The Marshall Islands also requested funds from other countries."

        "content": "Westerly winds near the equator \u2013 associated with an ongoing El Ni\u00f1o event \u2013 assisted in spawning a weak area of low pressure in late November 1991 near the International Date Line. The JTWC began tracking the area on the Significant Tropical Weather Advisory at 06:00\u00a0UTC on November\u00a025. Vertical wind shear prevented strengthening at first, but the disturbance continued to develop. A tropical cyclone formation alert from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) soon followed.[1] The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started tracking the disturbance at 06:00\u00a0UTC on November\u00a027,[2][nb 1] and the JTWC issued their first warning 18 hours later on the depression, naming it 31W. The depression quickly intensified, and it was designated a tropical storm at 00:00\u00a0UTC on November\u00a028 by the JTWC, with winds of 35 knots (65\u00a0km/h; 40\u00a0mph).[nb 2] Operationally, the storm was upgraded twenty-four hours later and given the name Zelda, after Kwajalein received stronger winds than expected. The JTWC attributed the delay to the small size of the storm, the poorly organized outflow, and the lack of visible and infrared image pairs for analysis.[1] The JMA upgraded the storm at 03:00\u00a0UTC on November\u00a029,[2] then to a severe tropical storm eighteen hours later.[2] The JTWC reported that Zelda intensified into a typhoon at 12:00\u00a0UTC near the Marshall Islands, with winds of 65\u00a0kn (120\u00a0km/h; 75\u00a0mph), equivalent to a Category 1 on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale.[1] At that time, the JMA kept it as a tropical storm with winds of 45\u00a0kn (85\u00a0km/h; 50\u00a0mph), with a pressure reading of 990 hectopascals (29\u00a0inHg).[2] Around 06:00\u00a0UTC on November 30, the JMA estimated Zelda had reached its peak at 60\u00a0kn (110\u00a0km/h; 70\u00a0mph), with a barometric pressure of 975\u00a0hPa (28.8\u00a0inHg).[2] Six hours later, the JTWC reported the storm had strengthened to maximum sustained winds of 80\u00a0kn (150\u00a0km/h; 90\u00a0mph), west of Enewetak. Later, a trough created by Typhoon Yuri caused the subtropical ridge to weaken, allowing Zelda to move northward.[1] By December 1, the storm began to weaken and turned northeast. On December 2, the JMA reported the storm's winds had decreased to 50\u00a0kn (95\u00a0km/h; 60\u00a0mph).[2] The JTWC reported the storm weakened below typhoon strength on 18:00\u00a0UTC of the same day, with winds of 60\u00a0kn (110\u00a0km/h; 70\u00a0mph).[5] Upper-level winds and westerlies soon increased,[1][6] and Zelda's central convection became sheared.[1] The JMA downgraded Zelda to a tropical storm on December 3, and to a tropical depression later that day.[2] A few hours later, the JTWC downgraded the storm to a tropical depression, as it unexpectedly turned to the northwest.[5] The low-level circulation of the storm detached from the cold front, and the JTWC issued the last warning of the year.[1] The depression turned back northeast, the JMA declared the storm to be extratropical on December 5, and the agency stopped tracking it just past the International Date Line on December 7.[2][7] Remnants of the storm moved inland into northern British Columbia by December 8.[8]"

The storm impacted islands of Kwajalein, Majuro, Lae, Wotho, and Eniwetok.[10] Kwajalein Missile Range, which was used in Strategic Defense Initiative testing,[11] caught stronger winds than expected from the storm, affecting operations at the missile range.[1]  A pressure of 990.1\u00a0hPa (29.24\u00a0inHg) was recorded on Kwajalein, which was the lowest pressure recorded on the atoll at that time.[12] On Ebeye Island, 60\u00a0percent of homes made of plywood and sheet-iron roofs were destroyed by the storm,[1][10] and 6,000\u00a0people were left homeless. Food and water supplies were contaminated from salt in storm surge, and the water desalination plant became inoperable.[10] Power lines were cut across the island. There were no deaths or significant injuries. Other islands in the nation had their water contaminated by saltwater, and 95\u00a0percent of the crops were destroyed by the storm surge.[10] Coral reefs were also heavily damaged when the storm came nearby.[13] As an extratropical cyclone, Zelda bought heavy rain and 110\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph) winds to Southeast Alaska.[14] Heavy snow was reported in northern British Columbia, and lesser amounts inland British Columbia and southern Yukon.[8] The United States Army engaged in clean up and repairing in the country. On December\u00a06, the 834th Airlift Division sent six C-130s to Kwajalein with supplies.[15] On the same day, President of the United States George H. W. Bush, through the Compact of Free Association,[10] declared a major disaster in the Marshall Islands,[16] allowing federal funding to be sent to the Arno, Aur, Kwajalein, Lae, Lib, Namu and Ujae islands.[17][18] United States Senator Daniel Akaka visited Ebeye after the storm, and he criticized the response of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), as the funding did not cover repairing of structures regarded as substandard.[19] The Government of the Marshall Islands requested for aid via United Nations Disaster Relief Organization (UNDRO) on December\u00a018.[10] By December 19, 1,380 people were still living in temporary shelters.[19] By March\u00a026, 1992, about $98,000 (1992\u00a0USD, equivalent to $212,779 in 2023) worth of relief goods were sent to the Marshall Islands from UNDRO, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and Government of Australia. FEMA sent $1.518\u00a0million (1992\u00a0USD, equivalent to $3,295,899 in 2023) to affected families.[10] Critical infrastructure in Ebeye were repaired by the Kwajalein Atoll Development Authority by November 1992.[20]"

The previous year, the country also experienced massive flooding when torrential rains in July left hundreds if not thousands dead.  The difference is this time Pyongyang reacted quickly to the disaster, requesting help while the waters were still high, rather than keeping silent as long as possible, as it has done in the past. Television footage from North Korea showed citizens in Pyongyang wading in knee- and waist-deep waters along the capital's grand boulevards. Government officials invited foreign diplomats in Pyongyang to venture out to the countryside to view first-hand the devastation wrought by the relentless rains.[2] On August 27, North Korea said it had suspended its yearly showcase Arirang mass games. The performance resumed after the flood damage was cleared away.[3] By August 31, North Korea reported recovering from devastating floods thanks to vigorous work by its citizens and officials. Railway services had resumed with many sections of broken track restored.  Telecommunications workers were reported restoring destroyed or submerged electrical cables. Yet, the dispatch made no mention of foreign assistance.[4] The country's leader Kim Jong-Il thanked the leaders of 11 countries on September 11 for their help in flood relief, except South Korea even though they sent 37.4 billion won (39.8 million dollars) of relief aid.[5]"

Seoul has pledged to provide 7.1 billion won ($7.6 million) in aid.[10] NGOs such as the Red Cross also asked people to raise funds because they feared a humanitarian catastrophe.[11] On August 29, Japan considered sending humanitarian aid to North Korea to help it recover from devastating floods. Sending aid would be a reversal for Japan, which has previously linked aid to resolving a row over North Korea's abduction of Japanese citizens.  Japan has not sent any humanitarian aid to North Korea since late 2004, in protest at a lack of progress over Japanese nationals kidnapped by Pyongyang in the late 1970s and early 1980s.[12] The United Nations requested US$14 million to provide North Korea with food, medicine, drinking water and other emergency goods.

An upper-level low moved across the area on April 13, generating a mesoscale convective system that moved over eastern Oahu, producing localized heavy rainfall that reached 5.55\u00a0in (141\u00a0mm). The heaviest rainfall occurred on northern Kaua\u02bbi. There, a rain gauge owned by the Waip\u0101 Foundation, just west of Hanalei, recorded 49.69\u00a0in (1,262\u00a0mm) of rainfall in the 24 hours between 12:45 p.m. on April 14 and 15.[nb 2] This was the greatest 24-hour rainfall total on record in the United States, surpassing the previous record of 43\u00a0in (1,100\u00a0mm) in Alvin, Texas on July 25\u201326, 1979, set during Tropical Storm Claudette. Through the event, the same gauge recorded a total of 54.37\u00a0in (1,381\u00a0mm) of rain. The heavy rainfall produced flash flooding and landslides that covered roads and washed away several vacant houses. The floods damaged or destroyed 532 houses. Public damage totaled $19.7 million and overall damage was estimated at over $125 million. Damage on Kauai was the worst from a natural disaster since Hurricane Iniki in 1992. Landslides and flooding covered parts of Kuhio Highway."

The low eventually opened into a trough, which crossed over the Hawaiian islands on April 13. That day, a mesoscale convective system (MCS) developed northwest of Molokai and intensified while moving westward through the trade winds. The MCS moved over eastern Oahu, dissipating after moving ashore. Another upper-level low developed on April 14, fueling additional rainfall through April 16, which caused record rainfall on Kaua\u02bbi. The first of a series of thunderstorms moved over northern Kaua\u02bbi around midnight on April 14. After a five-hour break in rainfall, another set of thunderstorms hit northern Kaua\u02bbi around midnight on April 15 and lasted about eight hours. The third set of thunderstorms began around 10 AM on April 15 and continued until around 7 PM.[1]"

Over a 15-minute period, a rain gauge in Niu Valley recorded 1.42\u00a0in (36\u00a0mm) of precipitation, which has a 4\u201310% annual return period. The same station recorded 5.52\u00a0in (140\u00a0mm) of rainfall over a two-hour period, which has a 0.5\u20131% annual return period. The rainfall on Oahu was largely limited to the eastern one-third of the island. A station at Daniel K. Inouye International Airport recorded 0.01\u00a0in (0.25\u00a0mm) of rainfall, just 14\u00a0mi (23\u00a0km) west of Niu Valley, which recorded 5.55\u00a0in (141\u00a0mm) during the same 24-hour period.[1] At Waimanalo Stream north of Niu Valley, the rains caused the waters to rise 3\u00a0ft (0.91\u00a0m) in 30\u00a0minutes, and 5\u00a0ft (1.5\u00a0m) in an hour. During the rain event, Wailupe Gulch reported an 8\u00a0ft (2.4\u00a0m) rise in floodwaters.[1] Flooding entered cars and hundreds of houses on Oahu.[1][6] The floods also caused significant runoff, leaving a layer of debris on roads.[1] A portion of Kalanianaole Highway was covered with nearly 1\u00a0ft (300\u00a0mm) of water, closing a stretch of the highway from Aina Haina to Makapu\u02bbu.[7] A mudslide covered a portion of the same highway near Kailua.[8] Downed trees closed one block of Maunaloa Avenue in Kaimuki.[9]"

        "content": "On Kaua\u02bbi, the rainfall event occurred at low elevations near the northern coast. This was unusual, as previous rain events on the island usually occurred over higher elevations. The heaviest rainfall was early on April 15.[1] A rain gauge owned by the Waip\u0101 Foundation, just west of Hanalei on Kaua\u02bbi's northern coast, recorded 49.69\u00a0in (1,262\u00a0mm) of rainfall in the 24 hours ending at 12:45 p.m. local time. The total greatly surpassed the Hawai\u02bbi 24-hour rainfall record of 38\u00a0in (970\u00a0mm) set on January 25, 1956, at K\u012blauea.[1] The total also broke the national 24-hour rainfall record of 43\u00a0in (1,100\u00a0mm) set during Tropical Storm Claudette on July 25\u201326, 1979 in Alvin, Texas, a record confirmed in December 2018.[10][11] The Waip\u0101 rain gauge also recorded 1.77\u00a0in (45\u00a0mm) over 15 minutes, 5.51\u00a0in (140\u00a0mm) over an hour, 19.52\u00a0in (496\u00a0mm) over six hours, 33.33\u00a0in (847\u00a0mm) over 12 hours,[1] and 54.37\u00a0in (1,381\u00a0mm) over 48 hours.[10] Elsewhere on northern Kaua\u02bbi, a rain gauge in Wainiha recorded 32.35\u00a0in (822\u00a0mm), and a gauge in Hanalei recorded 28.41\u00a0in (722\u00a0mm) before it failed. Minimal rainfall occurred on the southern and western coasts of Kaua\u02bbi. The intense rainfall washed out several river gauges. Along the Hanalei River, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) estimated that floodwaters rose 15\u00a0ft (4.6\u00a0m), representing a peak flow rate of 32,700 cubic feet per second (ft3/s, 926 m3/s) before the station failed. The Wainiha River reported a record flow rate during the event.[1] The rain event caused the worst natural disaster in Kauai since Hurricane Iniki in 1992.[12] The sudden rains caused landslides, mostly in isolated areas, as well as flash flooding, causing power outages in Hanalei and Wainiha. Rising waters washed out four vacant homes and entered dozens of others. The rising waters forced guests at the Hanalei Colony Resort to move to the second floor. The floodwaters reached 8\u00a0ft (2.4\u00a0m) deep near Hanalei, closing parts of Kuhio Highway. Landslides occurred at 15 locations along the highway, leaving residents in Wainiha and Haena without regional road access, disrupting relief efforts.[1][2][13][14][15][16] Three bridges along the route were damaged, which delayed repairs, leaving the Kuhio Highway closed as of November 2018.[17] Residents used a 1\u00a0mi (1.6\u00a0km) detour on a dirt road.[18] The flooding forced the temporary closure of three beaches \u2013 Kalapaki Beach, Koloa Landing, and Moloaa Bay \u2013 as well as two parks, N\u0101 Pali Coast State Park and Ha\u02bbena State Park. Wainiha and Haena residents were urged to limit their water use due to contaminated water supply.[2][19]"

He extended the emergency four more times, effective through January 4, 2019.[20][16][21] After the floods, Hawaiian Governor David Ige also declared a State of Emergency. On April 18, the Hawaii legislature approved $125 million in disaster funding, including $100 million for Kaua\u02bbi.[13] On May 8, President Donald Trump declared a federal disaster area for Kaua\u02bbi and Honolulu counties. Initially, the declaration was limited to federal reimbursement for repairs to public infrastructure, but on June 27 it was expanded to include individual assistance. Ultimately, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) approved 250 individual assistance applications, totaling about $1.5 million, with another $2.6 million in public assistance grants. FEMA opened three disaster recovery centers, which provided resources for the application process; these centers closed by July 20.[22] On November 30, Carvalho granted $500,000 to six nonprofits for counselors, meals, emergency supplies, and rebuilding parts of the Limahuli Garden and Preserve.[23] Local and national emergency crews rescued people from their flooded homes by helicopter, boat, and bus,[24] including 475 by helicopter; more than 40% of those rescued by helicopter were tourists.[25] The Hawaii Department of Transportation ran convoys throughout the day along the damaged portions of Kuhio Highway while it was being repaired.[26] The cost of reconstructing the highway was estimated at around $100 million; much of it was covered by the federal government.[17] In August 2018, Hurricane Lane dropped heavy rainfall in the same area, causing further flooding damage to houses and the Kuhio Highway.[27][28] The Hanalei post office, damaged by the floods, reopened on July 30.[29] A Red Cross shelter in Kilauea housed 13 people after the event.[24] Some of the displaced stayed with family or friends.[30] The Hanalei Colony Resort evacuated its guests on April 16 and remained closed through October. It temporarily housed National Guardsmen and families displaced by the floods. At least two dozen students used the resort as a temporary school.[20][26] The resort's staff won the Excellence in Community Service Award at the 29th Annual Na Po\u2018e Pa\u2018ahana Awards, a ceremony for excellence in the hospitality industry.[31] On August 2, 2018, National Weather Service Senior Hydrologist Kevin Kodama inspected and calibrated record-breaking rain gauge at Waip\u0101 Garden, confirming that the instrument was functioning normally. On December 4, 2018, the National Climate Extremes Committee verified that the 49.69\u00a0in (1,262\u00a0mm) accumulation was the highest 24-hour rainfall total in the U.S.[10]"

The systems affected areas from Oklahoma to Newfoundland and Labrador with freezing rain, thunderstorms, sleet, snow, damaging winds, and blizzard-like conditions in various areas. The first two storms produced copious amounts of ice across the Midwestern United States and Great Plains from December 8 to December 11, knocking out power to approximately 1.5\u00a0million customers from Oklahoma north to Iowa. The second storm moved northeast, producing heavy snow across New York and New England. A third storm was responsible for a major winter storm from Kansas to the Canadian Maritimes, bringing locally record-breaking snowfalls to Ontario, an icestorm across the Appalachians, and thunderstorms and 9 tornadoes to the Southeastern United States. The ice storms were responsible for at least 22 deaths across three states.[2][3]  At least 25 additional deaths were blamed on the December 15\u201316 Midwest and Eastern snowstorm, and its aftermath across six US States and three Canadian provinces; 1 additional death was caused by the severe weather outbreak in the Southeast."

Many areas had received close to three-quarters of an inch of ice from Nebraska to Illinois, causing tens of thousands of power outages and at least 16 deaths across nine states and the Canadian province of Quebec, the latter receiving a major snow storm. Following that winter storm, a large dome of cold air penetrated the Midwest, following an Alberta clipper, which was responsible for major flooding across the Pacific Northwest and moderate snows from Alberta to Maryland. The first low-pressure system, which developed across the Southwest on December 8, produced light freezing rain throughout much of the Midwest and southern Ontario on December 9. A second stronger storm developed across the southwest on December 10 and produced significant snowfall in the higher elevations of Arizona near Flagstaff, as well as in Colorado. The storm then proceeded to produce a significant swath of ice across much of the Central Plains. Both storms in total produced between a half-inch to an inch of ice from Oklahoma to Wisconsin, while 8 to 24\u00a0inches of snow (20\u201360\u00a0cm) fell over the mountains of Utah, the highest amount being reported in northern Park City; 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 centimetres) fell over Colorado and New Mexico, while generally less than 6\u00a0inches fell on the northern side of the system from Nebraska to Quebec, although 10 inches (25\u00a0cm) fell in the Saguenay region of Quebec due to the orographic effect and Lake Saint-Jean.[5] A mixture of snow, sleet, ice, and rain also fell across many of the affected areas.[4] The main energy of the system responsible for the ice storm later moved east and affected portions of the Northeast and Middle Atlantic States with snow and rain on December 13, with the heaviest snow falling across southern and central New York and central New England. Portions of Massachusetts, Connecticut and New York received as much as 12 inches (30\u00a0cm) of snow from the storm, including 7 inches (18\u00a0cm) in Boston.[6][7] Another major winter storm developed on December 14, east of the Rockies and across the Southern States, and traveled across many of the same areas, bringing significant snows to areas that were affected by both ice storms. Portions of Kansas received over a foot (30\u00a0cm) of snow on top of the accumulated ice.[8] The system moved across the Great Lakes region on December 15 and 16 and intensified while adding moisture from a developing coastal low as well as residual moisture from what was Tropical Storm Olga that affected most of the Antilles and Caribbean. Several areas in the Midwest and eastern North America received close to a foot of snow including Chicago, some areas of the Toronto and Detroit areas, Montreal, and Ottawa. Accumulations of as much as 20 inches (51\u00a0cm) fell across northern New England, northern New York, eastern Ontario from rural eastern Ottawa to Cornwall, and north of the Saint Lawrence River in the province of Quebec into the Charlevoix region.[9][10][11] Thundersnow was even reported across portions of southern Ontario and Quebec. Widespread amounts of snow between 8 and 14 inches (20 and 36 centimetres) were reported across Ontario, Quebec, most of New England and the Canadian Maritimes as well as in several areas of the Midwest including Kansas and Missouri, while between a half-inch to an inch (13\u201325\u00a0mm) of ice fell across higher elevations in Maryland and Virginia with significant icing as well over West Virginia and Pennsylvania. This was accompanied by heavy rain between 2 and 4 inches (51 and 102 millimetres) south of the Mason\u2013Dixon line towards the Carolinas and the Southeast, with significant rainfall across the Middle Atlantic Coast, coastal sections of Nova Scotia, and the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland and Labrador. Additionally, heavy thunderstorms developed across the Southern states near the Gulf of Mexico coast, where tornado watches were issued for portions of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina on December 15 with several tornadoes later confirmed. The storm finally exited off the coast into the Atlantic Ocean on December 18. The series of storms that affected the Midwest and East are similar to those that took place during January 2007 as several storms traveled across the same areas, killing at least 85 across several states and Canadian provinces. It was also similar to (but much less severe than) the historic Ice Storm of 1998 which blanketed much of eastern Canada from Ontario to New Brunswick."

Heavy rainfall during the 2017 California floods damaged the main spillway on February 7, so the California Department of Water Resources stopped the spillway flow to assess the damage and contemplate its next steps. The rain eventually raised the lake level until it flowed over the emergency spillway, even after the damaged main spillway was reopened. As water flowed over the emergency spillway, headward erosion threatened to undermine and collapse the concrete weir, which could have sent a 30-foot (10 m) wall of water into the Feather River below and flooded communities downstream. No collapse occurred, but the water further damaged the main spillway and eroded the bare slope of the emergency spillway."

        "content": "Oroville Dam, an important part of the California State Water Project, is an earthen embankment dam on the Feather River, east of the city of Oroville in Northern California. The dam is used for flood control, water storage, hydroelectric power generation, and water quality improvement in the Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin River Delta.[1]:\u200aA1,\u200aA5\u200a Completed in 1968, it is the tallest dam in the United States, at 770 feet (230\u00a0m).[2][1]:\u200aA1,\u200aA5\u2013A6\u200a It impounds Lake Oroville, the second largest man-made lake in the state of California, capable of storing more than 3.5\u00a0million acre-feet (4.3\u00a0billion cubic meters).[3][4] The adjacent Edward Hyatt Powerplant has six power-generating turbines with a total installed capacity of 819 megawatts (MW) of electricity.[5] For flood control purposes, some space in Oroville Reservoir has to be kept dry to capture floodwaters, a practice that has caused controversy at other dams of California over the amounts of water wasted.[6] Dam operators were required to discharge water based on charts contained in the Oroville Dam Reservoir Regulation Manual, a flood-control manual developed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.[7][8]:\u200a6\u20139\u200a At the time of the incident, the Oroville Dam Reservoir Regulation Manual had last been updated in 1970 and the discharge charts were based on climatological data and runoff projections that did not account for climate change or significant floods in 1986 and 1997. In the immediate aftermath of the incident, it was not clear if the outdated manual was a significant factor in the February 2017 crisis.[7][9] The Final Report of the Independent Review Board, released 11 months after the crisis, did not cite the outdated manual as a significant factor.[10] The dam complex was designed with four routes for water to pass from Lake Oroville: In 2005, the dam underwent re-licensing by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, during which three environmental advocacy groups filed a motion with the FERC raising concerns about use of the emergency spillway.[2][13] The environmental advocacy groups stated a 2002 technical memorandum by the Yuba County Water Agency that noted that significant erosion of the hillside would occur if the emergency spillway is used, which could cause significant downstream damage and impair operation of the Edward Hyatt Powerplant.[8]:\u200a13\u200a The groups urged the FERC to condition renewal of the Oroville Dam's license on the lining of the slope of the emergency spillway with concrete and to update the Oroville Dam Reservoir Regulation Manual.[13][2][8]:\u200a24\u201328 According to FERC engineering guidelines, \"Emergency spillways may be used to obtain a high degree of hydrologic safety with minimal additional cost. Because of their infrequent use it is acceptable for them to sustain significant damage when used and they may be designed with lower structural standards than used for auxiliary spillways.\"[8]:\u200a18\u201319\u200a The FERC determined that the emergency spillway structure was compliant with its engineering standards and that the erosion concerns raised by the environmental advocacy groups were overblown.[13] The commission also determined that the emergency spillway could handle 300,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s (8,500\u00a0m3/s) of discharge and renewed the dam's license without requiring the concrete lining of the emergency spillway, estimated to cost over $100\u00a0million.[13][2] A 2018 study by the Association of State Dam Safety Officials discovered that the commission relied on original geology reports from the 1960s, stating that the hillside below the emergency spillway was bedrock; it was actually weathered rock subject to deep erosion if the spillway were to be put into use.[14] Prior to February 2017, the main spillway had been last inspected in August 2016. During that inspection, the spillway was visually inspected without inspectors entering the spillway chute. Inspectors entered the spillway chute for inspections in 2014 and 2015 without finding any concerns. Cracks in the concrete spillway chute were repaired in 2009 and 2013.[15]"

        "content": "In early February 2017, high inflows to Lake Oroville caused dam operators to start using the concrete main spillway to control the lake level.[16] Between February 6\u201310, 2017, 12.8\u00a0in (330\u00a0mm) of rain fell on the Feather River Basin. Inflow of water into Lake Oroville rose from 30,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s (850\u00a0m3/s) on February 6 to over 130,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s (3,700\u00a0m3/s) at mid-day on February 7, before subsiding to about 75,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s (2,100\u00a0m3/s) the following day.[17] Dam operators began increasing the flow down the main spillway to 54,500\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s (1,540\u00a0m3/s) on February 7 but soon noticed an unusual flow pattern.[17] The flow of water down the spillway was stopped for investigation, revealing a crater about halfway down the spillway where the concrete lining was eroded through and water was escaping the concrete chute.[17][18] The DWR consulted with FERC and other dam safety agencies about the issue and prepared for the possibility of using the emergency spillway.[17] During two test flows down the spillway on February 8\u20139, the length of the crater increased from 250\u00a0ft (76\u00a0m) to 300\u00a0ft (91\u00a0m).[18] Meanwhile, the level of Lake Oroville was rising as inflow into Lake Oroville skyrocketed from about 130,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s (3,700\u00a0m3/s) on February 7 to a peak of 190,435\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s (5,395\u00a0m3/s) late on February 9.[17] The DWR was then confronted with two choices: use the main spillway, knowing it would likely be further damaged, or allow Lake Oroville to rise until it overtopped the emergency spillway.[18] On February 9, the main spillway was reopened. DWR hoped that using the damaged spillway with a limited flow could drain the lake enough to avoid use of the emergency spillway, which would potentially damage powerlines servicing the hydroelectric plant.[19] The following day, discharge on the main spillway was reduced from 65,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s (1,800\u00a0m3/s) to 55,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s (1,600\u00a0m3/s), but this flow was not enough to prevent the lake from rising.[20][21][17]\nOn February 11, the lake level reached 901\u00a0ft (275\u00a0m) above mean sea level and water began flowing\u2014as designed\u2014over the concrete weir along the top of the emergency spillway, cascading onto the emergency spillway for the first time in the dam's history.[12]"

        "content": "As the lake level rose, measures were taken to prepare the emergency spillway for use. On February 10, 2017, workers began clear-cutting trees on the hillside below the emergency spillway.[22] Shortly after 8:00\u00a0am on February 11, 2017, the emergency spillway began carrying water for the first time since the dam's construction in 1968.[23] Because the spillway was a separate structure from the dam, officials stated that there was no danger of the main embankment being breached, and evacuation of Oroville was not considered at that time, as officials stated that there was no threat to public safety. The uncontrolled flow over the weir topped out at 12,600\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s (360\u00a0m3/s).[24][25] Erosion at the base of the weir\u2014which was expected\u2014progressed much faster than anticipated.[17] The headward erosion of the emergency spillway threatened to undermine and collapse the concrete weir, in which case a 30-foot (9\u00a0m) wall of water would be sent into the Feather River below and flood communities downstream.[12]  Fearing a collapse, the Butte County Sheriff's Office issued an evacuation order of the Oroville area.[12][17] To ease pressure on the emergency spillway and prevent a possible collapse of the weir, the DWR nearly doubled the discharge volume of the main spillway from 55,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s (1,600\u00a0m3/s) to 100,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s (2,800\u00a0m3/s).[17] Several hours later, water stopped flowing over the weir onto the emergency spillway and officials began assessing the state of the emergency spillway.[17]"

        "content": "On February 12, 2017, evacuation was ordered for those in low-lying areas along the Feather River Basin in Butte, Yuba and Sutter counties, because of an anticipated failure of the emergency spillway.[26] Specifically, erosion on the hillside was growing uphill toward the concrete lip of the emergency spillway, leading to the fear that it would collapse.  A failure of the concrete top of the spillway would allow up to 30 feet (9\u00a0m) vertical of Lake Oroville through the gap in an uncontrolled deluge.[27] The flow over the main spillway was increased to 100,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s (2,800\u00a0m3/s) to try to slow the erosion of the emergency spillway.[28] By 9\u00a0p.m. on the evening of February 12, the increased flow had successfully lowered the water level to below the emergency spillway top, causing the emergency spillway to stop overflowing. The stop in water flow allowed the erosion there to be hastily inspected and stabilized with boulders.[27]  Engineers worried that the damage would be transferred to the main spillway, not only making future repairs more expensive, but also that the damage to the main spillway could grow uphill to the point that it endangered the main spillway gates, leaving no safe way to release water. The extent of such damage was unknown; it was expected to be assessed on the morning of February 13.[27] On February 13 helicopters began to drop sandbags and large rocks in the area of the now-dry emergency spillway, in order to protect the base from erosion.[29][30] By February 13, 188,000 people in the vicinity were reported evacuated.[31] About 23,000 National Guardsmen were ordered to be ready for \"immediate deployment if the dam spillway should fail\" to help with evacuation and relief efforts.[29] On February 14, at 2:45PM local time, the evacuation order above was reduced to an evacuation watch by emergency management officials and the State of California Department of Water Resources, and people were allowed to return to the evacuated areas.[32]"

        "content": "The immediate harm from the damage is limited to the area downstream of the breach, eroding the hillside to form a canyon. However, a major danger is that the spillway can erode back up toward the gate because of being undercut by the water falling into the crater. Eventually, this would threaten the spillway gate, in close proximity to the actual abutment of the dam.[20] About 150,000 cubic yards (110,000\u00a0m3)[33] of erosion debris clogged the channel of the Feather River below the dam, preventing release of water from the hydroelectric plant, thus reducing the overall capacity of the dam to release water.[20]  Debris was carried downstream and caused damage to the Feather River Fish Hatchery due to high turbidity.[34] State workers began evacuating fish and eggs from the hatchery in an attempt to mitigate the damage and evacuated over nine million fish downstream to a satellite hatchery adjacent to Thermalito Afterbay.[35][36] On February 27, the flow to the spillway was temporarily shut off, allowing crews to begin removing debris in the river in preparation to restart the power plant.[37] After the spillway was shut off, it appeared that headward erosion along the spillway channel had mostly stabilized, reducing the immediate threat of a gate failure and uncontrolled water release.[38] The bedrock under the upper half of the spillway appears to be much stronger than the rock which was washed out under the midsection of the spillway. In addition, the force of the falling water had excavated the original crater into a deep plunge pool which acts as a hydraulic cushion, dissipating much of the energy that otherwise might have caused additional damage to the spillway.[39]"

Meanwhile, a strong southwesterly jet stream began transporting a large surge of moist air with connections to the tropical Pacific. A strong temperature boundary developed, separating the warm, moist airmass across the southern U.S. from the colder, drier airmass to the north. As surface impulses moved along the frontal boundary, the stage was set for a widespread variety of winter weather. An upper level low progressing eastward across the central Pacific provided the added ingredients for a prolonged precipitation event."

        "content": "The storm left up to 2\u00a0inches of ice over the affected regions on the evening of January 30. Affected infrastructure initially held, but began to crumble as the night wore on. Electric transformers were prone to explosion and in some cases created small fires, and trees shattered under the weight of hundreds of pounds of ice. Larger trees were actually more susceptible to cracking and falling than smaller trees, with mature pin oak trees falling, while saplings remained undamaged. After the 31st, more than 650,000 residents were without power, including 350,000 in the Kansas City metropolitan area alone and 250,000 in Oklahoma. In some cases, power didn't return to residents for nearly 14\u00a0days. Approximately 500,000 trees were affected in Kansas City alone, including two \"Bicentennial Trees\" which were estimated at being over 200 years old. States of emergency were announced by the governors of all three states. Then on the tail end of the storm, some places got snow on top of the ice that had fallen, only worsening the problem."

        "content": "Tropical Storm Charley was the third named storm of the 1998 Atlantic hurricane season. Charley was the first of two tropical storms to make landfall in Texas during that season (Frances being the other).[1] The storm originated with a tropical wave that moved off the West African coast on August 9.[2] The wave moved generally west-northwestward, producing occasional bursts of convection, finally arriving in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico by August 19, when animated satellite images began to indicate it had possibly developed a low pressure centre.[2] Hurricane Hunter investigations into the system the next day revealed that this was not the case. The system lingered for two days, lacking an organized low level centre of circulation until early on the morning of August 21, when advisories were initiated on the tropical depression, 185 miles (298\u00a0km) east of Brownsville, Texas.[3] The depression became a tropical storm later that day, as it moved steadily west-northwestward, strengthening, and then weakening again before making landfall the next morning around Port Aransas, Texas.[4] The storm moved slowly inland and finally dissipated on the morning of the August 24 near the town of Del Rio, Texas. Charley's impacts in Texas and Mexico were locally severe. In Texas, over 2000 homes were destroyed by the locally severe flooding, and 13\u00a0people died. In Mexico, over 12 inches (300\u00a0mm) of rain fell in northern areas near the Texas-Mexico border, and seven people were killed.[2]"

        "content": "Charley originated with a large swirl of clouds which parted off of the west coast of Africa on August 9. Lacking deep convection or a well defined centre, the wave continued west-northwestward without developing. Ten days later, on August 19, satellite images indicated the disturbance was beginning to rotate cyclonically over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico. A reconnaissance aircraft flew into the system the next day. While strong winds were recorded, no circulation centre was present.[2] The following morning, a second flight reported that a centre had formed, and the disturbance was designated a tropical depression.[2] Initially, the centre was disorganized. However, convection over the depression blossomed, mostly concentrated over the northern semicircle. During the evening of August 21, the system was named Tropical Storm Charley.[5] As the system continued west-northwestward, more organized banding features developed, and the storm began to intensify.[2] On August 22, it reached its peak intensity of 70 miles per hour (110\u00a0km/h).[6] Subsequent reconnaissance reports indicated that winds had decreased, and the storm made landfall near Corpus Christi, Texas early on August 23, with maximum sustained winds of 45 miles per hour (72\u00a0km/h). Within hours, Charley was downgraded to tropical depression status as it continued to weaken.[7] By August 24, Charley had dissipated over the Rio Grande near Del Rio, Texas. Although surface winds had diminished and a closed surface circulation no longer existed, a slow-moving remnant circulation aloft persisted in the Del Rio area and generated flooding rains that were most devastating in that area on August 23 and 24.[2]"

Charley produced 17 inches (430\u00a0mm) of rain in Del Rio in a 24-hour period, a new record daily rainfall for the city.[2] Refugio, Texas received 7.2 inches (180\u00a0mm) of rain, and Woodsboro, Texas recorded 5 inches (130\u00a0mm).[2] The storm surge on areas of the Texas coast was small. Port O'Connor recorded a storm surge of 2.3 feet (0.70\u00a0m), while Pleasure Pier was subjected to a 4.5 feet (1.4\u00a0m) surge.[2] There were two reports of sustained tropical storm force winds, 41\u00a0miles\u00a0per\u00a0hour (66\u00a0km/h) and 39 miles per hour (63\u00a0km/h) from Rockport, Texas and Galveston, Texas respectively. The maximum wind gust was 63 miles per hour (101\u00a0km/h) at Port O'Connor, Texas.[2] No tornadoes were confirmed by any NWS offices, although one suspected tornado did prompt a tornado warning.[11] Damage from the storm, while generally light, was severe locally. In Val Verde County, Texas, which took the vast majority of the damage, roughly 2000\u00a0houses, mobile homes, and apartments combined were destroyed by flooding.[2] At one point, two-thirds of Del Rio was underwater after a natural dam broke in the San Felipe Creek, flooding the city with a sudden surge of water.[13] The coastal storm surge destroyed several of the dunes on San Jose and Mustang Islands.[14] There was also slight damage on Matagorda Island, where two shelters were destroyed by the surge flooding.[11] Four people, including two toddlers, died when their truck was swept away by floodwaters and nine more drowned in flooding along the San Felipe Creek. Thirteen people died in Texas, all drownings.[2] Charley left $50\u00a0million (1998\u00a0USD; US$64\u00a0million in 2007) in flood damage across southern Texas.[2] Eight counties in Texas were declared disaster areas.[15]"

The seventh named storm of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season, Gabrielle developed as a subtropical cyclone on September 8 about 385 miles (620\u00a0km) southeast of Cape Lookout, North Carolina. Unfavorable wind shear impacted the storm for much of its duration, although a temporary decrease in the shear allowed the cyclone to become a tropical storm. On September 9, Gabrielle made landfall at Cape Lookout National Seashore in the Outer Banks of North Carolina with winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h). Turning to the northeast, the storm quickly weakened and dissipated on September 11. In advance of the storm, tropical cyclone watches and warnings were issued for coastal areas, while rescue teams and the U.S. Coast Guard were put on standby. The storm dropped heavy rainfall near its immediate landfall location but little precipitation elsewhere. Along the coast of North Carolina, high waves, rip currents, and storm surge were reported.

        "content": "A cold front moved off the southeast coast of the United States on September 1.[1] Gradually decaying, the front degenerated into an area of cloudiness and showers just east of the Georgia coast on September 2.[2] Tracking eastward, a weak low-pressure area developed the next day.[1] It slowly became better organized as its motion became erratic,[3] and by late on September 4 the convection had become concentrated to the east of the center.[4] On September 5, a Hurricane Hunters flight indicated the system had not acquired the characteristics of a tropical or subtropical cyclone. Interaction with an upper-level trough resulted in moderate wind shear which suppressed further development,[5] and by September 6 the thunderstorm activity lost much organization.[6] Then, upper-level winds became increasingly favorable, allowing the convection to concentrate about halfway between North Carolina and Bermuda.[7] With a deep-layer ridge to its north, the system turned to a steady west-northwest track. A reconnaissance aircraft flight late on September 7 reported a very elongated center, with peak flight winds of 55\u00a0mph (89\u00a0km/h) about 100 miles (160\u00a0km) northeast of the center. Subsequent to the flight, the center became slightly better organized, and based on the large wind field and the presence of an upper-level low to its west-southwest, the National Hurricane Center classified the system as Subtropical Storm Gabrielle early on September 8 while located about 385 miles (620\u00a0km) southeast of Cape Lookout, North Carolina.[8] Upon becoming a subtropical cyclone, Gabrielle was located in an area of cooler air to its north, dry air to its south and west, southerly wind shear, and cooler water temperatures along its path.[8] Despite these unfavorable conditions, a curved convective band developed in its northern and western quadrants,[9] and the circulation became better defined.[10] Subsequently, the rainbands in its northeastern quadrant dissipated, leaving the well-defined center far removed from the convection. By later that day, the circulation began to become more involved with the remaining convection. Based on evidence of a weak warm-core, the system was re-designated as Tropical Storm Gabrielle late on September 8 about 185 miles (298\u00a0km) southeast of Cape Lookout, North Carolina.[11] Vertical wind shear decreased as the storm passed over the Gulf Stream, allowing a strong convective burst to develop near the center.[12] As it approached the coast of North Carolina, the center re-developed within the deep convection underneath the mid-level circulation,[13] although increased northerly wind shear displaced the center of Gabrielle to the north of the thunderstorm activity.[14] Based on reports from Hurricane Hunters, it is estimated Gabrielle moved ashore at Cape Lookout National Seashore at 1530\u00a0UTC on September 9 with winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h), though due to the shear the strongest winds remained offshore.[1] Tracking around the ridge over the western Atlantic, the storm turned to the north and north-northeast,[15] emerging into the ocean near Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina early on September 10 as a poorly organized system with convection far to the south of the center.[16] Gabrielle weakened to a tropical depression shortly thereafter,[17] and maintained scattered convection despite unfavorable wind shear as it tracked along the northern portion of the Gulf Stream.[18] By midday on September 11, the circulation had become ill-defined and elongated; failing to meet the criteria of a tropical cyclone, the National Hurricane Center declared Gabrielle dissipating well to the south of Nova Scotia.[19] By early the next day, the remnants of Gabrielle were absorbed by an approaching cold front.[20]"

On Cape Cod, Massachusetts, an HU-25 Falcon jet flew along the coastline, broadcasting storm advisories to offshore vessels. A Coast Guard patrol boat was deployed offshore for search and rescue. Boaters and mariners were advised to exercise caution, and were told to \"make safe decisions\".[32] However, the storm passed well to the south with little effect.[1]"

Wind gusts were stronger, unofficially reaching 61 miles per hour (98\u00a0km/h) at Ocracoke. Along the coast, rough surf was reported,[26] and waves reached 10 to 12 feet (3.0 to 3.7\u00a0m).[35] Rip currents caused numerous swimmers to be rescued by lifeguards.[36] Heavy rainfall from the storm was confined to near its immediate landfall location, peaking at 9.03 inches (229\u00a0mm) at a station 7.2 miles (11.6\u00a0km) to the east-northeast of Newport; other areas reported 4 to 8 inches (0.10 to 0.20\u00a0m). Two offshore ships observed tropical storm-force winds, though the reports were considered to be overestimated.[1] In some locations, the rainfall led to flooding, which prevented farmers from harvesting crops. Elsewhere throughout the state, the storm failed to relieve severe drought conditions as it was initially hoped to.[37] The passage of the storm left a portion of NC 12 on Hatteras Island closed for three hours, briefly flooding part of the road.[25] Streets in Morehead City and Beaufort were closed, and several homes and businesses suffered minor flood damage.[1] In Carteret County, the flooding inflicted $5,000 (2007 USD) in property damage. Storm surge was fairly light along the coast, peaking at 3 feet (0.91\u00a0m) above normal at Hatteras Island.[38] Overall damage in the state was minor, including minor beach erosion and some flooded streets.

Heavy rainfall was reported across the region, including over 6.30\u00a0in (160\u00a0mm) of precipitation in Nova Scotia.[2] Cape Breton Island reported 19\u00a0days of rainfall and cloudy skies. Several cities in the region reported a record duration of continuously cloudy skies, as well as daily rainfall records. This prompted Environment Canada to list the storm as one of the top ten weather events in 2000.[4] In addition, the storm produced record storm surges in eastern New Brunswick and northern Prince Edward Island, which caused significant flooding. Wave heights reached 46\u00a0ft (14\u00a0m) in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The storm was the most damaging in the year in Atlantic Canada,[2] with a damage total of $3\u00a0million (2000\u00a0CAD).[4] In Prince Edward Island, fishermen considered the storm the worst in over 30\u00a0years.[2] In Nova Scotia, the high storm surge flooded the Cabot Trail in several locations, and in two cities coastal roads were washed out.[2] Several days of persistent rainfall resulted in house flooding, sinkholes, and sewer backups.[4] In neighboring New Brunswick, high winds left about 7,000\u00a0people without power along a 60\u00a0mi (100\u00a0km) portion of the coastline. High seas damaged wharves in Miramichi Bay.[2] In Escuminac, New Brunswick, the surge reached 7.94\u00a0ft (2.43\u00a0m), just shy of the record set in November 1988.[6] The nor'easter occurred ten months after a similarly powerful storm struck the region. The October storm produced record river flooding from the combination of strong waves and winds, and likewise damaged coastal structures. The provincial government paid about $2.4\u00a0million in insurance claims due to the storm.[7] Strong wind gusts in Prince Edward Island, reaching 73\u00a0mph (118\u00a0km/h), downed trees and damaged houses, causing power outages. Roads and bridges were closed across the island, while waves of 36\u00a0ft (11\u00a0m) in height capsized boats. The waves also caused beach erosion in the island which damaged at least eight highways. In Newfoundland, high winds caused a brief power outage in Corner Brook, and removed a house from its foundation in Stephenville.[2]"

The floods can be split into three general stages, beginning when one of the strongest subtropical highs in history arrived in the Yangtze River Basin during mid-June and lingered, providing sustained heavy rainfall for a period of roughly two weeks.[6][7] As much as 1000\u00a0mm of precipitation was seen in some locations.[7] After briefly shifting north, the same system eventually returned to the region in mid-July. [7] Although the system had weakened, rainfall during this period was more intense and localized. [7] During this second period of rain, many surrounding lakes and rivers broke record high water levels and overflowed into the Yangtze River, causing a sudden sharp rise in water levels. [7] Another 300-500\u00a0mm of rain was seen across several areas during this second phase, causing significant damage as it flowed into villages and towns.[7] The final period of rainfall occurred in August, with an average of 150-200\u00a0mm of rainfall seen in most regions. [7] Although the water had begun to subside at this point, this extra rainfall caused further damage to homes and farmland in the surrounding areas. [6][7] It was also during this period that the dikes began to break, causing further death and widespread damage to property.[7]"

The wave moved westward, but was difficult to track due to its proximity to Hurricane Lisa and another large tropical wave. It passed through the Lesser Antilles, and slowly organized as convection increased due to an upper-level low. On October 5, it entered the Gulf of Mexico, and developed an area of low pressure two days later. The system continued to organize, and on October 8, after developing a circulation, it developed into Tropical Depression Fourteen while located 205 miles (330\u00a0km) to the southeast of Brownsville, Texas.[1] The depression moved to the east-northeast, and quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Matthew. Operationally, Matthew fluctuated between tropical depression and tropical storm status, but in post-season analysis, the storm remained a tropical storm. The storm turned to the northeast while moving around the periphery of a high pressure system over Texas, and attained a peak intensity of 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h) on October 9. Strong wind shear limited further strengthening, and on October 10, Matthew struck Cocodrie, Louisiana as a minimal tropical storm.[1] It became an extratropical cyclone, occluding near the time of landfall.[2] After it merged with the system, the storm moved inland over Arkansas, Tennessee and the Ohio Valley. While moving inland, Matthew spun off another low pressure system that formed over North Carolina on October 13. The low moved off the Mid-Atlantic coast before hitting Massachusetts two days later, and later merged with the original low pressure system of Matthew.[2]"

Storm surge ranged from 2 to 4 feet (0.61 to 1.22\u00a0m) along much of the coastline, though Waveland reported a peak of 5.13 feet (1.56\u00a0m). Rainfall totals were mainly between 2 and 4 inches (51 and 102 millimetres). Damage in Mississippi totaled to $50,000 (2004\u00a0USD).[6] Matthew produced moderate rainfall on its west side, as well. Portions of Texas and Oklahoma experienced over 5 inches (130\u00a0mm) of rain, while southern Arkansas received over 10 inches (250\u00a0mm) of rainfall.[2] The rainfall was well-received due to a period of dry weather in the area.

The second storm of the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season, Bonnie developed from a tropical wave on August 3 to the east of the Lesser Antilles. After moving through the islands, its fast forward motion caused it to dissipate. However, Bonnie later regenerated into a tropical storm near the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. Bonnie attained its peak intensity with maximum 1-minute sustained winds of 65 miles per hour (105\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 1,001\u00a0mbar (29.56 inHg) on August\u00a011 while located over the Gulf of Mexico. Afterwards, the storm turned to the northeast and hit Florida with winds of 45 miles per hour (72\u00a0km/h). The storm accelerated to the northeast and became an extratropical cyclone to the east of New Jersey. Bonnie was the first of five tropical systems in the 2004 season to make landfall in Florida, coming ashore the day before Hurricane Charley struck. Bonnie was also the second of a record eight storms to reach tropical storm strength during the month of August. Bonnie's impact was minimal. Throughout the Caribbean Sea, the storm's effects consisted primarily of light rainfall, and in Florida, heavy rainfall caused flooding and minor damage. The tropical storm caused a tornado outbreak across the Southeastern United States which killed three people and inflicted over $1\u00a0million (2004\u00a0USD) in damage."

It moved westward, attaining convection and a mid-level circulation. Convection steadily increased, and, upon the development of a low-level circulation center, the system organized into Tropical Depression Two on August 3 while 415 miles (668\u00a0km) east of Barbados. It moved rapidly westward at speeds of up to 23\u00a0mph (37\u00a0km/h); after crossing through the Lesser Antilles on August 4, it degenerated back into a tropical wave.[1]\nThe tropical wave continued to move rapidly to the west-northwest, until it reached the western Caribbean Sea. While south of Cuba and through the Cayman Islands, the system slowed down to regenerate convection, and it re-developed into a tropical depression on August 8.[1] Operationally, the system was classified a tropical wave until a day later.[2] The depression moved through the Yucat\u00e1n Channel, and intensified into Tropical Storm Bonnie on August 9 while 70 miles (110\u00a0km) north of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.[1] Bonnie continued to the west-northwest; late on August 9, the storm presented a 9-mile (15-km) wide eyewall, a very unusual occurrence in a small and weak tropical storm.[3] Bonnie quickly strengthened while turning to the north, a directional shift caused by a break in the mid-level ridge.[4] The storm briefly weakened late on August 10; it re-strengthened again the following day to attain a peak intensity of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h). Soon after, strong southwesterly wind shear disrupted the storm, causing Bonnie to weaken again. On August 12, Bonnie made landfall just south of Apalachicola as a 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h) tropical storm. It quickly weakened to a tropical depression, and accelerated northeastward through the southeastern United States. After paralleling the Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina coastlines, Bonnie lost its tropical characteristics on August 14 to the east of New Jersey.[1] Its remnant low continued northeastward, making landfall in Massachusetts and Maine and continuing into Atlantic Canada.[5]"

The cease in production was equivalent to over 1.2\u00a0million barrels of loss in crude oil, or 0.2% of the annual oil production in the Gulf of Mexico. Natural gas reserves were also limited.

The rainfall blocked storm drains, including those near the airport, which was forced to shut down. The rainfall caused debris to collect on roads throughout the island.[11] Although the storm passed just 70 miles (110\u00a0km) north of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, the storm dropped only 0.6 inches (15\u00a0mm) of rain due to its small size.[12]"

Bonnie was accompanied by a 4\u00a0ft (1.2\u00a0m) storm surge; moderate wave action caused slight beach erosion. Rainfall and storm surge flooded roads, forcing the evacuation of 2,000 residents in Taylor County. The winds downed trees and caused scattered power outages.[13] A tornado in Jacksonville damaged several businesses and houses.[14][15] Bonnie triggered a tornado outbreak throughout portions of the Mid-Atlantic states. One tornado in Pender County, North Carolina destroyed 17\u00a0homes and damaged 59\u00a0houses, causing three deaths and $1.27\u00a0million in damage (2004\u00a0USD).[16] In Stella, Bonnie generated a waterspout that struck a campground, damaged nine trailers, and wrecked small boats.[17] A tornado in Richlands damaged several houses as well.[18] A suspected tornado in Danville, Virginia destroyed the roofs of several businesses.[14] In South Carolina, tornadoes across the state damaged nine homes. Also, rainfall peaking at 6.07 inches (154\u00a0mm) in Loris[5] caused flooding across the state. The flooding, including a one-foot depth along U.S. Route 501, washed away a road and a bridge in Greenville County. In addition, 600\u00a0people across the state were left without electricity.[19] In Pennsylvania, the remnants of the storm dropped up to 8 inches (200\u00a0mm) of rain in Tannersville. The rainfall caused the Schuylkill River to reach a crest peak of 12.89\u00a0ft (3.93\u00a0m) at Berne. The flooding blocked several roads across eastern Pennsylvania. In addition, Bonnie produced gusty winds, leaving thousands without power.[20] In Delaware, the storm dropped up to 4 inches (100\u00a0mm) of rain, forcing 100 to evacuate from the floodwaters. The flooding closed part of U.S. Route 13, and an overflown creek in New Castle County caused moderate flooding damage to stores.[13] In Maine, moisture from the remnants of Bonnie produced heavy rainfall, with localized totals of up to 10 inches (250\u00a0mm). The rainfall flooded or washed out roads across the eastern portion of the state. In Aroostook County, near the town of St. Francis, the rainfall caused a mudslide which narrowed a county road to one lane.[21] As an extratropical low combined with a frontal system, Bonnie continued to produce moderate rainfall in Canada, peaking at 3.5 inches (89\u00a0mm) in Edmundston, New Brunswick. The rainfall caused basement flooding and road washouts; slick roads caused a traffic fatality in Edmundston.[22]"

Originally, it was thought that two storms in the 1906 season hit the state within 12\u00a0hours;[23] however, the suspected tropical storm was determined to be a tropical depression in a more recent analysis.[24] Bonnie was the first of five tropical systems to make landfall in Florida during the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season, and the second of a record eight disturbances to reach tropical storm strength during the month of August.[25] Because Bonnie hit Florida immediately before Charley, damage between the two storms was often difficult to differentiate. President George W. Bush responded to the storm by declaring much of Florida a Federal Disaster Area on August 13, 2004.[26]"

Military Bridge, which, at the time, was the only bridge that connected the north and south shores, was washed away. Chattanooga's telegraph lines were also destroyed or washed away, leaving the Chattanooga residents unable to communicate with neighboring cities.[6] Low lying croplands and livestock fields were washed away, leaving local farmers devastated, and businesses and homes along the shores of the river were completely destroyed.[7] At night, the city fell victim to looting and violence while the Tennessee River continuously rose sometimes at a rate of one foot every hour. On March 10, the Chattanooga American Union wrote that \"the losses of our merchants, businessmen, and citizens cannot be estimated.\"[8] Though the exact death toll is unknown, many residents in Chattanooga and the surrounding areas were killed.

Paulo Zucula, head of Mozambique's national relief agency, said \"We expect more water than we had in 2001.

The season officially began on June\u00a01, 1996 and ended on November\u00a030, 1996, dates which conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. The season's first tropical cyclone, Tropical Storm Arthur, developed on June\u00a017, while the final cyclone, Hurricane Marco dissipated on November\u00a026. The most intense hurricane, Edouard, was a powerful Cape Verde-type hurricane that affected portions of the Mid-Atlantic states and New England. The season featured nine tropical cyclone landfalls, including six hurricanes, one of which was a major hurricane. In total, six major hurricanes formed during the 1996\u00a0Atlantic hurricane season\u2014the highest number produced in a single season since 1950. The four most notable tropical cyclones of the season were hurricanes Bertha, Cesar, Fran, and Hortense. Bertha made landfall as a Category\u00a02 hurricane on the coast of North Carolina, causing a total of 12\u00a0deaths and $335\u00a0million (1996\u00a0USD) in damage. Hurricane Fran made landfall in the same general area a little over a month later as a Category\u00a03 hurricane, causing 37\u00a0deaths and $5\u00a0billion in damage. Hurricane Cesar developed in the east Caribbean during late-July, struck Nicaragua, then crossed into the Pacific as a tropical storm, at which time it was given the name Douglas. The system produced strong winds and flooding, leading to 113\u00a0deaths and $202.96\u00a0million in damage. Finally, Hurricane Hortense formed in the east Atlantic during the month of September and crossed Hispaniola and Puerto Rico, causing 39\u00a0direct deaths and $158\u00a0million in damage. Collectively, the tropical cyclones of the 1996\u00a0Atlantic hurricane season caused $6.52\u00a0billion in damage and 256\u00a0deaths."

However, in April\u00a01996, CSU revised their forecast, stating that 11\u00a0named storms would develop, with seven of those intensifying into a hurricane, and three reaching major hurricane intensity. In June, CSU predicted 10\u00a0named storms, 6\u00a0hurricanes, and 2\u00a0major hurricanes.[2] The forecast by the WRC in early 1996 was 10\u00a0named storms and 6\u00a0hurricanes, though there was no prediction on the number of major hurricanes.[3]"

        "content": "The 1996 Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June\u00a01,[7] but the first named storm did not form until seventeen days later. It was an above average season in which 13 tropical cyclones formed, with all cyclones attaining tropical storm status. Nine of these sixteen attained hurricane status and six of those reached major hurricane status,[8] which was well above the 1980\u20132010 average of 2.7\u00a0per season.[5] Although there was neither an El Ni\u00f1o or a La Ni\u00f1a,[9] the above average activity in the season was likely due to abnormally warm sea surface temperatures.[8] Six hurricanes and three tropical storms made landfall during the season, causing 256\u00a0deaths and $6.52\u00a0billion in damage.[10] Hurricane Edouard and Hurricane Marco also caused damage and fatalities, but neither storm made an official landfall.[11][12] Additionally, the 1996 season was only the second on record in which more than one storm crossed between the Atlantic Pacific basins (Cesar and Dolly). This record would be tied again 26 years later in 2022.[13] Tropical cyclogenesis in the 1996 Atlantic hurricane season began with the development of Tropical Storm Arthur on June\u00a017. In the month of July, two tropical cyclones formed, both of which later attained hurricane status. August was the most active month of the season, with a total of four storms developing in that period of time. The month of August also featured the strongest and costliest tropical cyclones of the season, Hurricane Edouard and Hurricane Fran, respectively.[8] Although September is the climatological peak of hurricane season,[14] only two tropical cyclones developed in that month. Despite this, both reached major hurricane status. Three tropical cyclones formed in October, with one attaining hurricane status. Finally, one tropical cyclone developed in November, Hurricane Marco. The storm lasted 10\u00a0days before dissipating on November\u00a026.[8] The season's activity was reflected with an Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) index of 166.[1] ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h), which is the threshold for tropical storm strength.[15]"

At 0600\u00a0UTC on August\u00a025, Edouard attained its maximum sustained winds of 145\u00a0mph (233\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 933\u00a0mbar (27.6\u00a0inHg); it was the most intense tropical cyclone of the season. The storm remained a major hurricane for nearly eight days. Edouard passed well north of the Lesser Antilles and then began re-curving northward on August\u00a029. Later, the storm passed midway between Cape Hatteras and Bermuda on September\u00a01.[11] Edouard approached Nantucket, Massachusetts, but turned to the east before reaching land. On September\u00a03, the storm weakened and became extratropical. It was absorbed by a larger system on September\u00a07.[11] Edouard brought rough seas and gusty winds along the East Coast of the United States from South Carolina northward. Strong waves in New Jersey drowned 2\u00a0people. Minor erosion and coastal flooding also occurred in several states, especially in New York and Massachusetts.[37] In the latter, wind gusts up to 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) left two-thirds of Nantucket, most of Cape Cod, and all of Martha's Vineyard without electricity. Gusty winds in Maine left about 1,900\u00a0without power in Portland.[38] Damage in the United States totaled about $20\u00a0million.[39] In Canada, the storm brought rainfall up to 5.35 inches (136\u00a0mm) and gusts to 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h). Rough seas disrupted ferry service and caused the closure of several beaches.[40]"

The depression moved westward for several days and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Fran on August\u00a027 while 1,035 miles (1,666\u00a0km) east of the Lesser Antilles. Fran tracked west-northwestward and intensified into a hurricane on August\u00a029. However, Fran became less organized after a disruption to inflow due to Hurricane Edouard and weakened back to a tropical storm. Fran quickly re-intensified into a hurricane by August\u00a031. While moving west-northwestward and then north-northwestward, the storm slowly strengthened. At 0000\u00a0UTC on September\u00a05, Fran peaked as a Category\u00a03 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 120\u00a0mph (190\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 946\u00a0mbar (27.9\u00a0inHg). Early on the following day, the storm made landfall near Cape Fear, North Carolina at the same intensity. Fran weakened and moved inland, becoming extratropical over Ontario on September\u00a08. Its remnants moved over the Great Lakes and were absorbed by a front on September\u00a010.[41] In South Carolina, the outer bands of Fran produced high winds and light to moderate rainfall, downing numerous trees and power lines. As a result, a number of cars were damaged and over 63,000\u00a0people were left without electricity.[38] Damage in South Carolina reached about $40\u00a0million. The state of North Carolina bore the brunt of the storm. Wind gusts as strong as 137\u00a0mph (220\u00a0km/h) were reported. Additionally, storm tide heights ranging from 8 to 12 feet (2.4 to 3.7\u00a0m) lashed the coast.[41] Damage was most severe in the Raleigh area, exceeding $2\u00a0billion. Several hundred thousand falling trees damaged at least 10,000\u00a0homes. Throughout the state, approximately 1.7\u00a0million people were left without electricity. Damage in North Carolina reached about $5.1\u00a0billion, with about $2.3\u00a0billion to homes and businesses, $1.1\u00a0billion to public property, $1\u00a0billion to forestry and timber, and $700\u00a0million to agriculture.[42] Elsewhere, Fran brought flooding to several states, including Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, as well as Washington, D.C. Outside North Carolina, effects were worst in Virginia, where flooding and winds left 400,000\u00a0people without electricity and caused about $350\u00a0million in damage.[38][41] Hurricane Fran was responsible for 37\u00a0deaths, with 24\u00a0of them in North Carolina.[43] Property damage in the United States was estimated at $5\u00a0billion.[44]"

It soon moved back offshore and brushed Dominican Republic while crossing the Mona Passage. After re-entering the Atlantic, Hortense substantially strengthened and peaked as a 140\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h) Category\u00a04 hurricane early on September\u00a013. Thereafter, the storm weakened as it tracked rapidly north-northeastward. Early on September\u00a015, Hortense made landfall in Nova Scotia as a minimal Category\u00a01 hurricane. It quickly weakened further to a tropical storm before re-entering the Atlantic and became extratropical later that day.[46] The storm produced heavy rainfall and gusty winds as it passed through the Lesser Antilles.[46] On Guadeloupe, damage was most significant to crops, with over 50% of banana plantains destroyed.[47][48] Localized flooding was reported on Martinique.[49] Impact was most significant in Puerto Rico. Across the island, 11,463\u00a0houses were severely damaged.[46] About 1.4\u00a0million people on Puerto Rico were left without electricity \u2013 equivalent to about 40% of the island's population.[50] Damage in Puerto Rico was estimated at $153.4\u00a0million. There were also 19\u00a0deaths, most of which due to drowning during flash floods.[38] In the Dominican Republic, strong winds damaged a number of buildings and houses, and downed several power lines. Flooding also forced the closure of several roads and impacted 80% of crops in Saman\u00e1 Province. At least 3\u00a0fatalities were confirmed in that country.[46] The storm brought strong winds to the Bahamas and Turks and Caicos Islands,[46][50] and lesser winds to Bermuda.[51][52] Later in its duration, Hortense struck Nova Scotia, bringing heavy rainfall and hurricane-force winds to isolated locations. There were many power outages, trees blown down, roofs torn away, and roads damaged in the province. New Brunswick, Newfoundland, and Prince Edward Island were also impacted, though not as severely as in Nova Scotia. Damage in Atlantic Canada reached approximately $3.64\u00a0million.[53]"

Due to an anticyclone to its north, the depression initially moved west-northwestward. After convection wrapped around the circulation and banding features increased, the National Hurricane Center upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Isidore on September\u00a025. Isidore deepened further and began developing an eye feature. Early on September\u00a026, the storm was upgraded to a hurricane. About 24\u00a0hours later, it reached Category\u00a02 intensity.

The nineteenth tropical depression and eleventh named storm of the 1988 Atlantic hurricane season, Keith developed out of a tropical wave in the Caribbean Sea on November\u00a017. It tracked northwestward, and under generally favorable conditions, Keith reached a peak intensity of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) shortly before striking the northeastern tip of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. It turned northeastward in the Gulf of Mexico, and made landfall near Sarasota, Florida, on November\u00a023. Keith accelerated its forward motion under the influence of a cold front, and became extratropical near Bermuda on November\u00a024. The extratropical remnant persisted for two more days. Early in its duration, Keith produced moderate to heavy rainfall in Honduras, Jamaica, and Cuba. Minimal damage was reported in Mexico, which was still recovering from the effects of Hurricane Gilbert two months prior. Keith, the last of four named tropical cyclones to hit the United States during the season, produced moderate rainfall, rough storm surge, and gusty winds across central Florida. Overall damage was fairly minor but widespread, totaling $7.3\u00a0million (1988\u00a0USD; $18.8\u00a0million 2024\u00a0USD).

Its forward motion slowed after it passed the Lesser Antilles on November\u00a012. A large well-defined anticyclone persisted across much of the Caribbean Sea, providing a favorable environment for the system. A low-level circulation gradually became evident on satellite imagery within the disturbance. Based on ship observations, the National Hurricane Center estimated that the system organized into a tropical depression on November\u00a017, about 280 miles (450\u00a0km) south of the western tip of Haiti.[1] Initially, the depression was disorganized as it continued west; on November\u00a018 the center became exposed from the area of deep convection. However, the upper-level environment gradually became more favorable for further development, and deep convection, or thunderstorm activity, developed closer to the center. An eastward-moving upper-level trough in the Gulf of Mexico turned the depression northwest. The next day, the depression intensified into a tropical storm while a short distance north of Honduras, receiving the name Keith. It quickly intensified, and on November\u00a021 the storm reached its peak strength of 985\u00a0mbar (29.1\u00a0inHg) with winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h). The trough, which turned Keith northwestward, rapidly accelerated northeastward; as a result, the storm moved slowly northwest until making landfall on the northeast tip of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula at 0800\u00a0UTC on November\u00a021, at an intensity slightly below hurricane status.[1] After briefly moving over land, Keith turned north under the influence of a trailing frontal trough.[1] The storm became disorganized while recurving northeast because of increased vertical wind shear and the presence of cool dry air from its north. On November\u00a023, Keith made landfall near Sarasota, Florida, with winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h), while most of its convection was well to the north of the center.[2] Its landfall was the second latest on record for the Continental United States, only behind a hurricane in the 1925 season.[3] The storm quickly weakened as it crossed Florida, and within hours the winds dropped to 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h). Reaching the Atlantic Ocean eight hours after moving ashore, Keith began to gradually re-intensify, and under the influence of a very large upper-level low pressure area over Newfoundland, the storm accelerated northeast. On November\u00a024, the storm again reached its peak intensity of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h), shortly before becoming an extratropical cyclone near Bermuda. Keith restrengthened and deepened into a powerful extratropical cyclone, attaining hurricane-force winds and a minimum pressure of 945 millibars (27.9\u00a0inHg). The extratropical storm turned westward and was last observed on November\u00a026 northeast of Newfoundland.[2]"

The advisories were discontinued within 10\u00a0hours of Keith's passage through the region.[4] The government of Belize briefly declared a tropical storm watch for the whole coastline of the country, but when it became clear that Keith posed little threat, the watch was canceled. About 16\u00a0hours before the storm made landfall on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm watch for much of the coastline of Quintana Roo. Six hours later, a tropical storm warning replaced the watch, and it was extended west to Progreso, Yucat\u00e1n; a hurricane watch was also posted.[4] Cuban officials issued a bulletin on the night of November\u00a020, advising that tropical storm conditions would spread over the west part of Cuba. A subsequent bulletin indicated the possibility for hurricane conditions, but as the storm continued further to the northwest, the threat diminished.[4] Two days before the storm struck Florida, emergency management workers began working to prepare for its onslaught.[5] The next day, the water levels in five lakes in Hillsborough County were decreased as a precaution.[6] Residents prepared sandbags to prevent flooding along coastal areas, while boat owners worked to secure their boats. Some tourists near the southwest Florida coast left for areas further inland, though many stayed despite the storm.[7] Red Cross officials opened six emergency shelters.[8] Additionally, police departments in Clearwater, Indian Shores, and Largo expanded their workforce to handle storm-related problems.[9] The storm resulted in the closure of some private schools as well as the Hillsborough Community College.[8] About 21\u00a0hours before Keith made its final landfall, the National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm warning along the Florida west coast from Cape Sable to Cedar Key. The next day, a tropical storm warning was posted from Jupiter, Florida, north to Savannah, Georgia. A tropical storm warning was briefly issued for Bermuda, as well.[10]"

Reports from Cozumel indicated torrential rainfall and a large number of lightning strikes during the period of highest winds.[2] Rainfall peaked at 7.69 inches (195\u00a0mm) just south of Canc\u00fan.[12] Still recovering from the effects of Hurricane Gilbert two months prior, the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula received only minor damage as a result of Keith.[13] The storm triggered flooding in western Cuba that severely damaged tobacco and vegetable crops.[14] Officials forced 2,500\u00a0residents to evacuate their homes due to the flooding.[15] The storm also dropped nearly 4 inches (100\u00a0mm) of precipitation in Kingston, Jamaica.[16] Off the coast of Florida, a freighter and its crew of ten were stranded after the storm flooded its engine room.[17] The cyclone produced a moderately strong storm surge in isolated locations along the southwest coast of Florida, peaking at 5.94 feet (1.81\u00a0m) at Bradenton and Fort Myers Beach.[18] The combination of storm surge and waves severely eroded beaches along Charlotte Harbor and Estero Bay.[19] In Naples, strong waves destroyed the western end of the Naples Pier[20] where several boats were washed ashore.[21] Heavy precipitation fell to the north of the center, peaking at 10.27 inches (261\u00a0mm) in Saint Leo.[12] Sustained winds peaked at 63\u00a0mph (101\u00a0km/h) at the MacDill Air Force Base, with stronger gusts.[18] Inland from the immediate coastline, damage was mostly limited to isolated fresh-water flooding, downed trees, and power outages;[14] overall damage was widespread but fairly light,[22] and six structures were destroyed across the state.[23] Before moving ashore, Keith spawned two tornadoes,[2] one of which damaged approximately 30\u00a0mobile homes in Clermont.[17] In Lakeland, a washed out track derailed a 34-car train, which broke a natural gas line and forced 450\u00a0people to evacuate.[24] In Lee County, damage totaled $1.5\u00a0million (1988\u00a0USD; $3.86\u00a0million 2024\u00a0USD),[14] and in Pinellas County the storm caused about $5.8\u00a0million in damage (1988\u00a0USD; $14.9\u00a0million 2024\u00a0USD).[25] A light storm surge of 1 to 2 feet (0.30 to 0.61\u00a0m) was reported along the northeast Florida coast into southeastern Georgia.[14] The storm's outer rainbands dropped light rainfall of around 1 inch (25\u00a0mm) across coastal Florida, northward to North Carolina.[12] A station on Bermuda reported sustained winds of 47\u00a0mph (76\u00a0km/h), with gusts to 78\u00a0mph (126\u00a0km/h).[18] Only light damage occurred on the island.[26]"

The region of Western Pomerania was particularly badly affected by the flooding. 271 people died as a result of the flood. The dating of the disaster to All Saints' Day in 1304, which gave the flood its name, goes back to the Stralsundische Chronik by Johann Berckmann (died 1560).[2] This date is, however, not confirmed, although it is probable that the year was 1304."

        "content": "To the east of R\u00fcgen is the M\u00f6nchgut Peninsula, 8 km southeast of which is the island of Ruden, is the Greifswald Bodden threshold, which separates the Greifswald Bodden from the Baltic Sea. Some chronicles claim that there was a land connection here, which was destroyed by the All Saints Day flood, so that a new channel, 3 to 4 metres deep, was formed through the so-called Greifswald Bodden threshold and described as a new shipping lane or significant opening. The All Saints Day flood resulted in substantial losses of land between the islands of R\u00fcgen and Usedom: for example, until 1304 there was a land bridge between the peninsula of M\u00f6nchgut on R\u00fcgen and the island of Ruden off Usedom. The Bay of Greifswald was probably still an inland lake and the present-day branch of the River Oder, the Peenestrom, flowed on through the Strelasund and did not discharge into the Baltic until the western end of the sound. In the 1304 storm flood, the southern part of the M\u00f6nchgut and most of Ruden was flooded. Whether further storm flooding was needed to finally drown the land under the water, is not known. The only losses recorded are those of two villages on Ruden that were drowned. The Bay of Greifswald was henceforth known as the \"low country\" (Landtief) or the \"New Deep\" (Neue Tief). 300 years later, only the ever-shrinking island of Ruden remained, along with the small island of North Ruden, which presumably sank beneath the waves in the 17th century. The remaining island is still less than 2 metres above the water for long stretches; the channel for the eastern approach to Stralsund has to be dredged to be kept free. Other consequences of the All Saints Day flood have not been handed down, but it is also possible that it led to breaches to the Baltic Sea at Damerow on Usedom, at the Swine estuary and on the shores of the Prorer Wiek. These areas were almost uninhabited at the end of Middle Ages because of their infertility. Due to questionable and partly contradictory traditions, the scientific literature does not agree on the facts. However, taking into account geomorphological coastal changes in recent earth history, from c. 2000 B.C. until the Middle Ages, and the location of the M\u00f6nchgraben, a border fortification, there was almost certainly a land bridge.[3]"

Chronicles by Johannes Bugenhagen, Johannes Berckmann, Thomas Kantzow and Nicolaus von Klemptzen all reported the event. In many chronicles the descriptions of the effects of the flood are mostly exaggerated and untrue. For example, Albert Georg Schwartz, wanted to establish the loss of land on Ruden and reported the demise of two villages on the island in a document by Gottlieb Samuel Pristaff, which was revealed as a forgery after 1850. The data invented by him were disseminated by various authors and were found primarily in local literature."

The 40 feet (12\u00a0m) sea-stack at Chit Rock was destroyed.[3] It destroyed the esplanade at Weymouth; it broke across Chesil Beach and the Fleet Lagoon, almost destroying the villages of Fleet and Chiswell.[4][5] Many buildings in Melcombe Regis were destroyed.[6] In Lyme Regis it topped the Cobb, and destroyed about 90m of its length.[1] The According to the book Heroine of Lyme Regis by Harriot Forde the house and fossil shop belonging to Mary Anning was flooded.[7] The ferry between the Isle of Portland and the mainland was washed away.[5] Though coastal communities bore the brunt of the storm, inland areas were also damaged including Dorchester.[8] The quays at Weymouth were overcome and most properties on the seafront and much of the lower part of the town were flooded by the deluge. The pier at the entrance of the harbour also sustained considerable damage, whilst boats and vessels were carried into the streets by the waves, where they drifted helplessly.[9] 2024 marks the bicentennial anniversary of the storm, and will be marked by events held in the area.[10]"

It started on May 11, 2006 as a result of an unusually strong low pressure system that stalled over the central United States, drawing copious amounts of moisture from the Atlantic Ocean.  Most of this moisture was drawn directly over New England, producing continuous heavy rain that led to record flooding near several rivers. It was described as the worst flooding since the New England Hurricane of 1938.[1] There were at least two fatalities, both in Topsfield, Massachusetts.[2][3] Some called it the Mother's Day Flood, since it occurred on that holiday."

The Merrimack in Lowell was expected to reach more than 8 feet (2.4\u00a0m) above flood stage combined with 15 inches (380\u00a0mm) of rain. The flooding also led to drowned waste water treatment plants, which overwhelmed sewage systems. Burst pipes in Haverhill dumped 35 million gallons (132,000\u00a0m\u00b3) of waste a day into the Merrimack River. In addition, the flooding at another regional treatment plant in Lawrence was also very close to shutting down the power there, which would have sent sewage into the Merrimack at a rate of 115 million gallons (435,000\u00a0m\u00b3) a day.[6]  For only the third time in a 150-year history, Lowell dropped its flood-controlling Francis Gate. Also, most notably in downtown Peabody, people could even be seen sailing in boats atop flooded areas. Governor Mitt Romney toured the hard-hit community of Peabody on May 15 and described the situation as historic. \"This is a level of crisis which is beyond anything these communities have ever experienced from water in their history\". On Good Morning America the next day, Romney described the flooding as \"almost Biblical\" and said \"We're sort of making jokes about Noah and taking two of each kind of animal because we haven't ever seen rain like this.\"[8] Numerous roads, including a busy section of US 1, were closed due to flooding.  The Route 495 exit at Route 114 was also closed, the entire area under several feet of water.  At that area, several businesses were damaged, including a Friendlys, a 7\u201311 and the first floor of a hotel.[6]"

At least 600 roads were closed due to flooding. Flooding of the Turkey River also caused St. Paul's School in Concord to be closed.[9][10][11] There were serious concerns along the Salmon Falls River in Milton, where a dam was dangerously close to failing and causing extreme flooding downstream. Several other dams, including the Newmarket Dam on the Lamprey River, were also being watched, with local residents being evacuated downstream.[12] The Suncook River, responding to the highest rainfall amounts in at least 70 years (more than 8 inches (200\u00a0mm) dropped by the system in three days on Concord), rose to flood level and backed up behind an old mill dam, which produced a shallowly-sloping pool that overtopped a sand and gravel quarry, connected with a downstream section of channel, and cut a new shorter channel at 25\u201350 meters per hour in the town of Epsom.[13] Two previous channels, around Bear Island, were left dry. The new river course, approximately a mile long, is the largest channel change in a river in New Hampshire since systematic topographic mapping began in the state in the early 20th century.[14] In addition, at least 550 National Guard troops were deployed in the state. Damage in New Hampshire was estimated to be well into the tens of millions of dollars.[15]"

In particular Innisfail is reputed as being among the wettest towns in Australia.[15] Babinda, 30 kilometres (19\u00a0mi) north of Innisfail is generally considered to be the wettest. Unlike most of tropical Australia,[16] the southern so-called \"winter\" or \"dry\" season is not completely dry as moist easterly winds bring frequent showers;[17] rainfall is, however, still far lower than during the southern summer. Monthly totals of over 1,000\u00a0mm (39\u00a0in) are common in the region between January and April and some months will not experience a day without rain if the monsoon is unusually heavy. The town gets around 63.5 clear days per year.[5] During the summer \"cyclone season\", Innisfail is frequently under threat from tropical cyclones developing in the Coral Sea.[18] High rainfall associated with these storms, combined with Innisfail's riverside location often causes flooding.[19] Climate data is taken from Innisfail weather station, which has recorded rainfall since 1881 and temperature since 1908. Meanwhile, sun data was borrowed from the South Johnstone EXP weather station, 9.7 km SW of Innisfail."

        "content": "Prior to European settlement the Innisfail area was occupied by five separate societies of the Mamu people. These Aboriginal people followed migratory lifestyles in the rainforest and traversed rivers in string-bark canoes.[citation needed] The first arrival of European people came in January 1872 when survivors of the shipwreck, the \"Maria\" arrived on the coastal areas surrounding what is now the Johnstone River. Sub-Inspector Robert Arthur Johnstone of the Native Police came with the intention of rescuing remaining survivors and collectively punishing Aboriginals thought to have killed a number of the shipwrecked crew. In mid 1873, Johnstone returned to the area as part of another punitive mission and ventured further upriver between what is today Flying Fish Point and Coquette Point.[22] Johnstone wrote very highly of the area, stating: A most glorious view appeared \u2013 a noble reach of fresh water, studded with blacks with their canoes and catamarans, others on the sandy beaches; deep blue fresh water expanding to an imposing breadth. In October 1873, Johnstone again returned as part of the Northeast Coast Expedition led by the explorer George Elphinstone Dalrymple. British settlement was first established at the junction of the north and south branches of the Johnstone River by this expedition on 5 October 1873. It was named Nind's Camp after Philip Henry Nind who accompanied the party.[23] Later in 1879, Irishman Thomas Henry Fitzgerald arrived in the area to establish a sugar industry at his Innisfail Estate (now the locality of that name).[24] He was accompanied by large numbers of Kanaka South Sea Islanders workers accompanied by smaller numbers of Irish labourers.  The house built by Fitzgerald and thus the first establishment in the area was called Innisfallen, after the largest island in the Lakes of Killarney, Ireland. Inis F\u00e1il (Island of Destiny) is an ancient Irish name for Ireland itself.[6] The name is used in the rarely sung third verse of \"The Soldier's Song\", the Irish national anthem. The stone mentioned may be the stone at Tara, Co Meath, at which high kings of Ireland were crowned. From 1879, the settlement was named Geraldton (officially in July 1883) by Fitzgerald, but on 20 August 1910 it was renamed \"Innisfail\" to avoid confusion with the town of the same name in Western Australia.[4][25] It was Margaret-Mary Noone a long time resident of the area who suggested the name Innisfail as a way to honour T.H Fitzgerald's pioneering efforts and Ireland[26][27] Johnstone River Post Office opened on 1 November 1882 (a receiving office had been open from 1880), was renamed Geraldton two months later and Innisfail in 1910.[28][29] The settlers who moved into this region from 1889 were exceptionally diverse. The first influential group were Anglo-Celtic, but they were outnumbered by \"Kanaka \" South Sea Islanders. Aboriginal and Torres Strait workers, Chinese miners who developed the banana industry and retail businesses. French merchants, and German timber and sugar producers.[30] In May 1885, the Queensland Government called for tenders to build the Geraldton Hospital to replace the existing tent hospital;[31] however, the tenders submitted were more expensive than the government was willing to pay, so they called again for tenders in September 1885 resulting in a contract with E. Couchman for \u00a31527.[32][33] Geraldton Provisional School opened on 18 July 1887 in the present-day Anzac Memorial Park on the corner of the Bruce Highway and Ernest Street (17\u00b031\u203226\u2033S 146\u00b001\u203240\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff17.5239\u00b0S 146.0278\u00b0E\ufeff / -17.5239; 146.0278\ufeff (Geraldton / Innisfail State School (original site))) with an initial enrolment of 15 boys and 13 girls under head teacher Thomas Edward White. On 1 August 1894, it became Geraldton State School. On 21 January 1908, the school relocated to Emily Street. On 8 April 1913, the name was changed to Innisfail State School to reflect the renaming of the town. The original school site is commemorated with a plaque laid on 4 July 1987.[34][35][36][37] The Innisfail Parish within the Roman Catholic Vicariate Apostolic of Cooktown (now the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cairns) was established in 1898.[38] It is now merged with the Mourilyian and South Johnstone parishes.[38] Sacred Heart Catholic School opened on 2 November 1902 with an enrolment of 42 students. It was operated by the Sisters of the Good Samaritan. It was renamed Good Counsel Catholic Primary School in 1975. When the Sisters were no longer able to lead the school, it was briefly led by the Marist Brothers until the first lay principal was appointed in 1982. The Sisters withdrew from teaching in the school in 1990.[39] In 1906, Patrick Leahy established the Johnstone River Advocate newspaper, with the first issue published in December that year.[40] Later it was renamed the Johnstone River Advocate and Innisfail News, the Evening Advocate, and the Innisfail Chronicle. The newspaper continues to be published as the Innisfail Advocate.[41] In June 1912 there was a meeting that resulted in the creation of the Johnstone River Agricultural Association with the intention to hold their first agricultural show that same year.[42] The first show was held on Friday 11 and Saturday 12 October 1912 in recreation ground (now Callender Park) with exhibits in the Shire Hall and the Oddfellows Hall. In 1935 the show needed more space and the present showgrounds were established (in present-day Goondi Hill) with purpose-built buildings and a show ring. The show was held annually apart from 1942 and 1942 when, due to World War II, the army was using the showground. In 1986 many of the showgound's buildings were badly damaged by Cyclone Winifred with further damage sustained during Cyclone Larry in 2006. In 2002 the show introduced a banana packing competition which was very popular.[43] The first Methodist church in Innisfail was completed about October 1913; a Methodist  home missionary had been stationed from 1911.

As Art Deco architecture was popular at that time, many of the new buildings were built in the Art Deco style.[46] As a result, Innisfail is now considered one of the best Australian towns for Art Deco and Streamline Moderne architecture.[48] The 1920s and 1930s saw the beginning of a major period of settlement by Italian immigrants and noteworthy populations from Greece and Malta. Later in this period populations from Yugoslavia, India and the Philippines would also settle in the area.[3][30] On Sunday 1 July 1928, Bishop John Heavey officially opened and blessed the new Catholic presbytery, built of reinforced concrete to protect it from cyclones, after the Catholic church and associated buildings were all destroyed in the cyclone of 1918.[49] Heavey returned some week later to officially open and bless the new Mother of Good Counsel Catholic Church which cost \u00a320,000 and was described as the largest Catholic church in Queensland outside of its capital Brisbane.[50] On 31 March 1931, a civic reception was held for an international Cricket Team which was followed by a tree planting ceremony where a number of palm trees were planted commemorate the visit to Innisfail by the team.  Among the team was cricketer, Sir Donald Bradman. Donald Bradman was part of the international team, led by New South Wales Captain, Alan Kippax in 1931.  These palms still stand in the town centre. On Sunday 10 November 1935, a Greek Orthodox Church was opened and dedicated to the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin (also known as the Dormition of Our Lady) by Archbishop Timotheos, the Greek Orthodox Archbishop for Australia and Oceania, in the presence of 300 people. It was the second Greek Orthodox Church to be built in Queensland and the sixth to be built in Australia, but the first to be built outside of an Australian capital city. The brick church cost \u00a31,000.[51][52] The church began to deteriorate and local builder Mick Kremastos re-built the church in 1970.[53][54][55][56] Innisfail East State School opened on 3 February 1936.[57] Innisfail State High School opened on 24 January 1955 and operated until the end of 2009 at 2 Stitt Street (Mighell, 17\u00b032\u203212\u2033S 146\u00b001\u203241\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff17.5367\u00b0S 146.0280\u00b0E\ufeff / -17.5367; 146.0280\ufeff (Innisfail State High School (former))).[58] In 2010,  it was amalgamated with the Innisfail Inclusive Education Centre (a special education facility) and Tropical North Queensland TAFE (Innisfail Campus) to form Innisfail State College using the site of the TAFE campus at Innisfail Estate.[57][59][60] Innisfail State High School's website was archived.[61] On 3 July 1970, Innisfail State School introduced a special education program called Opportunity Classes. In 1980 these were replaced by the opening of Innisfail Special School on 29 January 1980. On 7 March 2003 the school was renamed Innisfail Inclusive Education Centre.[34] In 2010 it was amalgamated into the Innisfail State College.[57][59] Radiant Life Christian College opened on 13 February 1982 and closed on 1 November 1991.[34] In 2001, Los Angeles band Sugar Ray filmed part of their music DVD \"Music in High Places\" at the Johnstone Crocodile Farm in Innisfail.\u00a0[citation needed] The Innisfail War Memorial in Jack Fossey Park on Fitzgerald Esplanade was dedicated on 16 April 2005; it commemorates those who served in all wars.[62] Innisfail suffered extensive damage in 2006 due to tropical Cyclone Larry, an Australian Category 5 cyclone with over 100mm of rain in the span of three hours. It struck Innisfail at 7am on 20 March 2006, with the eye of the storm passing over the town. Severe structural damage occurred over the entirety of the township, the main damage being a portion of houses losing roofs and windows and the cyclone rendered even more homes structurally unsound. Power was effectively eliminated from the town and generators became a luxury in many homes. Clean drinking water was also compromised in many homes leading to health fears. The swift response of the Australian Defence Force was praised by many and the cleanup campaign they orchestrated allowed for total utilities restoration within 3 weeks. Severe damage was done to crops and plantations (mainly bananas) which had a serious economic impact on the region. Only one indirect death was record as a result of the cyclone. While Innisfail was always reputed to have a positive sense of community spirit, the aftermath of Tropical Cyclone Larry and the unified cleanup effort acted to promote this spirit through shared suffering.[63] Cyclone Larry was a direct and primary cause of the widely reported and dramatic surge in banana prices in Australia. Inflated cost remained until farmers were able to meet demand again in early 2007.[64][65][66]  After the cyclone the township underwent something of an economic boom that stemmed from an influx of tradespeople and business eager to capitalise upon relatively significant insurance payouts. According to reports local trade had increased some 30 \u2013 40% opposed to expected increases of 10%.[67][68] On 8 February 2007, the Johnstone Shire Council was sacked by the Queensland Government by the Local Government Minister, Andrew Fraser because of internal conflict, inappropriate behaviour and financial problems.[69][70] In 2011, in the early morning of 3 February, Cyclone Yasi crossed the far north Queensland coast causing damage to the Innisfail area. Although the damage was not as severe as Cyclone Larry, Cyclone Yasi still had a huge impact on Innisfail bringing strong winds of possibly 285\u00a0kilometres per hour.[71] Darlinga Forest School in February 2021 at 89 Mourilyan Road, East Innisfail.[72] However, it was closed in mid-2023 by the Queensland Government's Non-State Schools Accreditation Board.[73]"

        "header": "Blackout",
        "content": "The weather had resulted in localised power outages throughout the day and by around 3:50\u00a0p.m. local time, almost the entire state power grid had been cut out. Early indications were that as the transmission lines in the Mid North failed due to damaged pylons, the automatic safety features in the network isolated the generators to protect both the generation facilities and the end consumers' equipment. Over a short period, this resulted in most of the state's distribution network being powered down as the transmission network acted to protect the infrastructure. The preliminary report from the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) identified that problems started 90 seconds before the eventual failure. The first line to trip was a 66\u00a0kV line near Adelaide, and it was automatically reset. The first major fault was 47 seconds later when two phases of the 275\u00a0kV line between Brinkworth and Templers grounded. The Davenport\u2013Belalie line tripped with one phase to ground, was automatically reset, but tripped again nine seconds later, so was isolated for manual inspection, with the fault estimated to be 42\u00a0km (26\u00a0mi) from Davenport. One second later (7 seconds before the state went dark), the Hallett Wind Farm reduced output by 123\u00a0MW. Four seconds later, a third 275\u00a0kV transmission line showed a fault, the Davenport\u2013Mount Lock is on the other side of the same towers as Davenport\u2013Belalie, and the fault was estimated to be 1\u00a0km (0.6\u00a0mi) further on.  The damaged power lines caused 5\u20136 voltage glitches which stressed the ride-through capability of most of the wind farm capacity, causing nine of them to shut down:[11] Finally, all within one second, the Hornsdale Wind Farm reduced output by 86\u00a0MW, Snowtown Wind Farm reduced output by 106\u00a0MW, the Heywood interconnector flow increased to over 850\u00a0MW. Both of its circuits tripped out due to imminent loss of synchronism across the network between South Australia and the eastern states. This occurred before the interconnector circuits' thermal load limits were reached. [12] Supply was then lost to the entire South Australian region of the National Electricity Market, as the Torrens Island Power Station, Ladbroke Grove Power Station, Murraylink interconnector and all remaining wind farms tripped.[13] AEMO identified software settings in the wind farms that prevented repeated restarts once voltage or frequency events occurred too often. The group of wind turbines that could accept 9 ride-throughs in 120 seconds stayed on line through much of the event before the system went black. The rather larger group of turbines that could not accept this many repeated ride-throughs dropped out, instigating the overload and shutdown of the interconnector, and hence the electricity supply. AEMO has suggested better fault ride-through capability for the wind farms. The high wind speed caused 20\u00a0MW of wind power to disconnect to prevent overspeed.[11] In 2019, the Australian Energy Regulator initiated proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia against the operators of four wind farms. It alleged that these companies had failed to comply with performance requirements to ride through major disruptions and disturbances. The companies AGL Energy, Neoen, Pacific Hydro and Tilt Renewables operated several of the large wind farms that tripped during the incident including Hallett,[14] Hornsdale, Clements Gap and Snowtown.[15][16]"

        "header": "Restoration",
        "content": "As so much of the network had been shut down, the authorities needed to act carefully to bring it back online and provide a stable network. This was initiated in the first few hours following the start of the outage, initially using the Victorian interconnectors to establish a stable frequency on the network, and gradually add South Australia's power generators to the network and restore power to areas as soon as possible. The initial focus was to restore power to the Adelaide metropolitan area, and suburbs started to regain power within about three hours, and much of the city power was restored by 10 p.m. By the following morning, power had been restored to most of the areas of Adelaide and the areas south and east of it that did not have storm damage to the distribution network. The substantial damage to the transmission network north of Adelaide meant that large areas of the Mid North and Eyre Peninsula did not have power restored within 24 hours, and further damaging weather indicated that it could be at least the end of the weekend before some of those areas were restored.[17] AEMO had contracts with two \"System Restart Ancillary Services\" (SRAS) providers to help bring the network back up. The Mintaro Emergency Diesel Generator had suffered storm damage, including a cloud-to-ground lightning strike in very close proximity, but would not have been useful anyway due to its location in the network and downed transmission lines.[12] The Quarantine Power Station was unable to start the larger Unit #5 required to provide enough power to restart any of the Torrens Island Power Station units, so Torrens Island needed power from the Victorian interconnector to be restarted. A circuit breaker in the Quarantine Power Station switchyard connecting Torrens Island Power Station and the smaller units at Quarantine Power Station with Unit #5 tripped repeatedly due to in-rush current on the generator transformer and auxiliary transformer, and subsequently ran out of stored energy before Unit #5 could be started.[12] By the morning of Friday 30 September 2016, about 10,000 properties had not yet had power restored since the blackout on Wednesday afternoon, and 18,000 more had lost power due to distribution network faults caused by continued stormy weather. An additional transmission line fault near Tumby Bay was only detected as ElectraNet tried to power up the system, and this fault prevented the power generator in Port Lincoln from being used to power the lower Eyre Peninsula.[18] Due to the extensive nature of the damage, temporary transmission towers were sent by Western Power; these towers can reach a height of 58 metres and take only one day to erect. It is expected that the towers will remain in use for 6 to 12 months while the permanent repairs are made.[19]"

The hurricane continued to intensify, and reached peak intensity as a Category\u00a02\u00a0hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 110\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 961\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.38\u00a0inHg), though these statistical peaks were achieved at different times on September\u00a02. Afterwards, the hurricane began a weakening trend as it proceeded northeastward, and had degenerated into a tropical storm by the time it made its first landfall on Nova Scotia later that day. The storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone the next day while making another landfall on New Brunswick. The extratropical remnants persisted into Quebec before merging with a larger extratropical system late on September\u00a03. Despite not making landfall on the United States, the hurricane caused widespread damage. Extensive precautionary measures were undertaken across the coast, particularly in New England. The heightened precautions were due in part to fears that effects from the storm would be similar to that of a devastating hurricane that struck the region two years prior. Most of the damage associated with the hurricane occurred in New Jersey, where the combination of moisture from the hurricane and a stationary front produced record rainfall, peaking at 24\u00a0in (610\u00a0mm) in the Ewan section of Harrison Township. This made the storm the wettest in state history. The resultant floods damaged infrastructure, mostly to road networks. Damage in the state amounted to $4\u00a0million.[nb 1] Farther north in New England, strong winds were reported, though damage remained minimal. Although the storm made two landfalls in Atlantic Canada, damage there too was minimal, and was limited to several boating incidents caused by strong waves. Overall, the hurricane caused seven fatalities."

        "content": "The origins of the hurricane can be traced to a compact and slow-moving low-pressure area in the open Atlantic Ocean in late August\u00a01940. As the system progressed in a west-northwest direction, its center of circulation became more organized.[1] As a result, the disturbance was classified as a tropical depression between the Greater Antilles and Bermuda at 1200\u00a0UTC on August\u00a026.[2] Operationally, the storm was analyzed to have undergone tropical cyclogenesis on August\u00a030.[3] However, a reanalysis of the storm conducted in 2012 found that the system was already organized prior.[1][4] In its initial stages, the depression remained weak,[2] with few ships reporting abnormally strong winds in association with the storm.[1] Continuing in a slow west-northwest movement, the disturbance gradually intensified, and was analyzed to have attained tropical storm intensity by 1800\u00a0UTC on August\u00a028.[2] At 0600\u00a0UTC on August\u00a030, the tropical storm strengthened further into the equivalent of a modern-day Category\u00a01\u00a0hurricane,[2] roughly 225\u00a0mi (362\u00a0km) east of the Florida peninsula.[3] At the same time, the hurricane began to intensify and move quicker than it had previously.[2] Later that day, a ship within the periphery of the storm reported winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) and a barometric pressure of 979\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.90\u00a0inHg).[1][3] At 1200\u00a0UTC on September\u00a01, the hurricane attained modern-day Category\u00a02\u00a0intensity. Ships continued to report strong winds and low pressures associated with the storm.[2] Early on September\u00a01,[3] the hurricane passed 85\u00a0mi (137\u00a0km) of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina,[1] before recurving towards the northeast and away from the coast.[3] That same day, two ships reported hurricane-force winds. At 0200\u00a0UTC on September\u00a02, the American steamboat Franklin K. Lane reported a barometric pressure of 965\u00a0mbar (965\u00a0hPa; 28.5\u00a0inHg) while located within the hurricane's radius of maximum wind;[1] this was the lowest pressure measured in association with the tropical cyclone and the lowest measured in the entire North Atlantic Ocean in September\u00a01940.[5] Based on the ship observation, the storm was analyzed to have reached peak intensity on September\u00a02 with maximum sustained winds of 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 961\u00a0mbar (961\u00a0hPa; 28.4\u00a0inHg). However, stronger winds of 110\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h) were analyzed to have been present in the hurricane earlier. As it traversed though more northerly latitudes, the storm began to gradually weaken.[2] The storm made landfall slightly northwest of Yarmouth, Nova Scotia at 2100\u00a0UTC later on September\u00a02 as a tropical storm with winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h).[1][3] After quickly passing over Nova Scotia, the weakening tropical storm transitioned into an extratropical storm over the Bay of Fundy at 0000\u00a0UTC on September\u00a03.[2] At the same time, the cyclone made a second landfall on New Brunswick as a slightly weaker storm with winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h). The extratropical system progressed over the Gulf of Saint Lawrence before it was absorbed by a larger extratropical storm at 1800\u00a0UTC later that day in Quebec just north of Anticosti Island.[1][3]"

        "content": "As the hurricane approached the United States East Coast on August\u00a031, the United States Weather Bureau advised extreme caution to ships between Cape Hatteras and southern areas of New England.[6] Storm warnings were issued for coastal regions between Wilmington, North Carolina and the Virginia Capes. These warnings were later extended northward to the Delaware Breakwater. Strong winds exceeding gale-force were expected for much of the East Coast, particularly for Cape Hatteras.[7] On September\u00a01, hurricane warnings were ordered for areas from Hatteras, North Carolina to Pamlico Sound, while previously issued storm warnings remained in place.[8] On September\u00a02, gale warnings extended further north into Nantucket, Massachusetts.[9] In Norfolk, Virginia, city department heads were ordered to stand by for potential emergency duties. United States Coast Guard personnel were also dispatched along the North Carolina coast.[10] United States Navy personnel were detained in New London, Connecticut until the storm passed.[11] In Westhampton, New York, a mass evacuation occurred, involving 10,000\u00a0residences. Air traffic to and from Mitchel Air Force Base was cancelled, and 100\u00a0airplanes stationed at the base were fastened to the ground. Police and firemen evacuated a 50\u00a0mi (80\u00a0km) stretch of the Rhode Island coastline.[9] This included Roy Carpenter's Beach, where 1,000\u00a0families were forced to evacuate. In Narragansett Bay, boats were sent back to harbors or towed to shore.[12] The extensive precautionary measures undertaken occurred in part due to fears that the storm could cause similar effects to a destructive hurricane which swept through areas of New England two years prior.[9] On September\u00a01, the Venezuelan tanker Acosta relayed an SOS signal while near the hurricane 200\u00a0mi (320\u00a0km) southeast of the Frying Pan Shoals. United States Coast Guard stations in Norfolk, Virginia and Morehead City, North Carolina dispatched cutters to aid the ship.[8] Off of the East Coast, an offshoot of the hurricane resulted in the drownings of two people.[13] In the Mid-Atlantic states, the passing hurricane's outflow interacted with a cold front that had become quasi-stationary over the area. The cyclone's flow pattern enhanced the moisture environment over the region, resulting in locally heavy rainfall, particularly in New Jersey, where precipitation peaked at 24\u00a0in (610\u00a0mm) in Ewan in a nine-hour period on September\u00a01.[14] This made the hurricane the wettest tropical cyclone in state history.[15] Most of the rain was in western portions of the state, however, with minimal rainfall at the coast.[14] The floods caused small rivers to overflow, breaching dams.[14] An overflowed creek inundated parts of Lumberton Township, rendering 2,000\u00a0people homeless. Rail service between Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and areas of southern New Jersey was suspended as a result of washed out tracks.[9] Resulting damage to infrastructure totaled $4,000,000\u00a0in the southwestern quarter of New Jersey alone. Damage to roads in Burlington County amounted to $2,500,000.[16] In Camden County, damage was estimated at $1\u00a0million.[13] Four fatalities were reported as a result of the floods.[17] In Delaware, rainfall was comparatively less.[14] However, rough seas generated by the hurricane offshore caused $50,000\u00a0in damages and one death.[9] Further north, strong gusts were reported across New England. Winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) were recorded by a weather station in Nantucket. Peak winds in Massachusetts were estimated at 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h). In Eastport, Maine, winds of 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h) were reported.[1] After the storm, New Jersey state health department investigators from Trenton were dispatched to study the possibility for an increase in typhoid fever in flooded areas.[18] In Woodbury, where the city pumping station was flooded, water was rationed. Gas service was also limited in Woodbury, Pedricktown, Penns Grove. As a result of a gas plant becoming inundated in Glassboro, electricity was rationalized in Hammonton, forcing residents to eat uncooked food. Police were forced to transport residents of Mount Holly to work via boat due to the high floodwaters.[13] Despite making two separate landfalls in Atlantic Canada on September\u00a02 and September\u00a03, the hurricane caused minimal damage. Effects in Nova Scotia were limited to boating incidents. In Lake Milo, near Yarmouth, six yachts capsized due to the strong winds. In New Brunswick, damage was also minimal. A car accident associated with the storm injured a man near Barnesville.[19]"

        "content": " Severe Tropical Cyclone Alby was regarded as the most devastating tropical cyclone to impact southwestern Western Australia on record. Forming out of an area of low pressure on 27 March 1978, Alby steadily developed as it tracked southwestward, parallel to Western Australia. Between 1 and 2 April, the storm quickly intensified and attained its peak intensity as a Category\u00a05 cyclone on the Australian cyclone intensity scale. After turning to the southeast, the storm underwent an extratropical transition as it neared Cape Leeuwin. The storm brushed the cape on 4 April, bringing hurricane-force winds, before rapidly losing its identity the following day. In Western Australia, the combination of Alby's fast movement and hurricane-force winds caused widespread damage. Along the coast, large swells flooded low-lying areas and numerous homes lost their roofs from high winds. Further inland, bushfires were worsened by the storm as it brought little rain, generally less than 20\u00a0mm (0.79\u00a0in) along the coast. These fires burned roughly 114,000\u00a0hectares (281,700\u00a0acres). Cyclone Alby and the associated brushfires caused five deaths, with the heaviest damage in the town of Albany, Western Australia.[1] A report at the time noted that \"The Perth metropolitan area and nearly every town from Geraldton to Albany was extensively damaged.\"[2] The resulting damage was extensive, with monetary losses reaching A$50\u00a0milelion (US$45\u00a0million). According to a Canadian newspaper, the Associated Press reported initially that officials in Perth said that \"A tropical cyclone Tuesday tore across the southwestern tip of Australia, killing at least five persons and sparking brushfires that destroyed two towns,\"[3], but the two towns supposedly destroyed by fire were not identified, nor was there a report in the local press or subsequent investigations."

        "content": "Severe Tropical Cyclone Alby was first identified on 27 March 1978 as a disorganized area of low pressure situated roughly 800\u00a0km (500\u00a0mi) north-northwest of Karratha. At this time, the system was characterised as a large cluster of convection converging around the low. Notable development took place over the following three days as the system drifted towards the southwest. Convection began wrapping around the storm, forming banding features.[4] Early on 29 March, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), classified the system as a tropical storm.[5] Shortly thereafter, the Bureau of Meteorology in Perth classified it as a tropical cyclone, assigning it with the name Alby.[1] Gale-force winds were later confirmed on 30 March by the Martha Bakke, located 385\u00a0km (239\u00a0mi) west-northwest of the storm's centre. By then, a large ragged eye developed and Alby steadily intensified through 2 April.[4] At the end of this strengthening, Cyclone Alby attained its peak intensity as a Category\u00a05 on the Australian cyclone intensity scale; a barometric pressure of 930 mbar (hPa; 27.46\u00a0inHg) was measured at the time and peak winds were estimated to be 205\u00a0km/h (127\u00a0mph) based on the Dvorak technique.[4][1] Additionally, the JTWC assessed the storm to have attained winds of 215\u00a0km/h (134\u00a0mph), a low-range Category\u00a04 on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale.[6] Shortly after reaching this intensity, Alby slowed as it began turning towards the southeast. By 3 April, the storm rapidly accelerated and attained a forward speed of 50\u00a0km/h (31\u00a0mph).[4] This rapid acceleration was due to the cyclone's interaction with a cold front to its south.[7] Gradually weakening, Alby also underwent an extratropical transition as the storm's structure became asymmetrical.[8] Around 1300\u00a0UTC on 4 April, the storm passed within 100\u00a0km (62\u00a0mi) of Cape Leeuwin as an extratropical storm. Due to the rapid movement of Alby, the system maintained winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph) as it reached this point, making it one of the most intense storms to strike the region. By 5 April, the cyclone rapidly lost its identity as it became caught up in a northwesterly flow before merging with the cold front over the Great Australian Bight.[4]"

        "content": "Retaining winds in excess of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph), Cyclone Alby brought damaging winds to much of the region in and around Cape Leeuwin.[4] The highest winds reached 150\u00a0km/h (93\u00a0mph) in Albany.[7] In Perth, a peak gust of 130\u00a0km/h (81\u00a0mph) was measured, the third-highest in the city's history.[8] The intense winds, considered unprecedented for many in the region, were attributed to the fast movement of the storm and its location in relation to land. Moving at speeds up to 90\u00a0km/h (56\u00a0mph), winds along the northeastern edge of the storm were increased by that amount due to Alby's clockwise rotation. It also allowed for winds to cover a large area northeast of the centre, impacting many areas far from the storm.[7] In general, rainfall was limited and generally less than 20\u00a0mm (0.79\u00a0in); this was due to the fast movement, as well as the asymmetrical structure with most of the thunderstorms south of the center.[4] These winds resulted in widespread agricultural, environmental and structural damage. Hundreds of structures sustained severe damage, mostly consisting of roofs blowing off. The most severe losses took place in Albany where most homes had partial or complete roof failure. Air-borne debris also damaged buildings during the storm. Nearly 80% of the apple crop was lost in the Donnybrook\u2013Manjimup area. A total of 154,400\u00a0m3 (5.4\u00a0million ft3) of timber was lost as well as a potential 200,000\u00a0m3 (7\u00a0million ft3) of future growth on established trees. Widespread dust storms also ruined crops and removed topsoil from many areas. Near the coast, the combined effects of strong, onshore winds and little rain led to significant inland sea spray. Numerous power lines and stations failed during the storm due to winds as well as dust and salt accretion. Large portions of the South-West Land Division were without electricity due to Cyclone Alby; Perth nearly sustained a complete breakdown of power services. This led to secondary losses attributable to the storm such as production failure.[4] One person died in Toodyay after falling off his roof while trying to repair it.[2] Newspapers connected the death of one person in a vehicle accident in Pemberton to the storm;[9] however, the Bureau of Meteorology does not attribute it to Alby.[4] The large expanse of gale-force winds without precipitation exacerbated 92 ongoing brush fires in the region.[10] These fires erupted into full-fledged wildfires, expanding at a rate of 5 to 10\u00a0km/h (3.1 to 6.2\u00a0mph). A total of 114,000\u00a0hectares (281,700\u00a0acres) of land was burned throughout Western Australia as a result of the fires. Within this area, more than 10,000 sheep and 500 cattle and horses were killed. Over 100 structures, 1,300\u00a0km (810\u00a0mi) of fencing and tens of thousands of hay bales were destroyed.[8] According to newspaper reports, the towns of Jarrahwood and Yornup were leveled by the wildfires.[9] At least 50 individual fires were fanned by the storm across the region, prompting more than 1,000 firefighters to assist in putting them out.[11] Containment efforts were successful after six days, with the fires put under control by 10\u00a0April.[12] Two people were killed while trying to suppress the fires: one from a fallen tree in Mount Barker and the other in Manjiump when a bulldozer clearing a firebreak flipped over.[2][13] Along the coast, large swells produced by the storm resulted in two fatalities in Albany Harbour as well as significant coastal damage. Tides across the region were expected to increase. Unexpectedly, all forecast values were exceeded by at least 0.3\u00a0m (0.98\u00a0ft).[4] The highest storm tide was in Busselton at 2.5\u00a0m (8.2\u00a0ft), leading to a storm surge of 1.1\u00a0m (3.6\u00a0ft).[8] Here, the surge penetrated roughly 200\u00a0m (660\u00a0ft) inland, forcing several evacuations. This led to significant coastal flooding that damaged dozens of structures, including Busselton Jetty. In Bunbury, water breached the sea wall, inundating 100 homes and prompting the evacuation of 130 residents.[4] Throughout Western Australia, Cyclone Alby was responsible for five fatalities and A$50 million (US$45 million) in damage.[4] There was also severe beach erosion associated with the storm, with some areas losing 30\u00a0m (98\u00a0ft) of land.[14] Due to the extensive damage, the name Alby was retired from the list of Western Australian cyclone names following its usage.[15] In the wake of Cyclone Alby, an appeal for relief in the affected region was made by The Lord Mayor's Distress Relief Fund.[16] The unprecedented scale of damage prompted meteorologists to vastly improve forecasting in the region to be better prepared for a similar storm in the future. At the time, little to no warning was given to residents in the South-West Land Division; this was the result of Alby's abrupt acceleration along a cold front, a complex forecasting situation. It was also regarded as a \"wake up call\" for the region, reminding residents that they are not immune to the effects of tropical cyclones.[7] Cyclone Alby has been used as a benchmark to compare future storms in the region to, such as Severe Tropical Cyclone Bianca in 2011.[17]"

As a result, one of the lows rapidly deepening into a tropical cyclone off the Kimberley coast. After initially moving tracking westward out to sea, the storm executed an anticyclonic loop and proceeded to move eastward. Then, early on 31 January, while located about 250\u00a0km (155\u00a0mi) northwest of Broome, Vern took a sharp turn toward the southeast then south. It continued in that general direction until it made landfall near Anna Plains at about 03:00\u00a0GMT, 1\u00a0February, with winds of about 145\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph). Inland, the system tracked southwestward then to the south again, causing flooding and minor damage, before dissipating on 3\u00a0February over the Pilbara.[1]"

It drifted to the southwest, and slowly strengthened into a tropical storm on 29 March. Alby continued slowly southwestward, and attained cyclone status on 30 March. The rate of intensification, which was slower earlier in its life, became more steady towards strengthening, and reached the equivalent of Category 3 status on 1 April. Tropical Cyclone Alby turned more to the south, and quickly reached a peak of 135\u00a0mph (217\u00a0km/h) later on 1 April. After maintaining its strength for 30 hours, Alby weakened as it turned to the southeast. Its forward momentum increased over the southeast Indian Ocean, and Alby was only an 85\u00a0mph (137\u00a0km/h) cyclone as it passed off the southwest coast of Australia on 4 April. It continued rapidly to the southeast, and became extra-tropical on 5 April while south of the continent. On 4 April, Tropical Cyclone Alby passed close to the southwest corner of Western Australia, killing five people and causing widespread but mostly minor damage to the southwest. The damage bill was estimated to be $39\u00a0million (2003\u00a0dollars). A man was blown from the roof of a shed and a woman was killed by a falling pine tree. Another man was killed when a tree fell on the bulldozer he was operating and two men drowned when their dinghy overturned at Albany. Storm surge and destructive waves caused coastal inundation and erosion from Perth to Busselton, damaging the Busselton Jetty and Fremantle Harbour. Fires fanned by the strong winds burned an estimated 1,140\u00a0km2 (440\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of forest and farming land."

Prior to its arrival a number of record low temperatures were reached for December, with -25.1C at RAF Shawbury in Shropshire[2] and -5.9C in Southampton[3].[citation needed] In the evening spring tides combined with a 1.45\u00a0m (4.8\u00a0ft) storm surge[4] resulted in the highest water levels recorded in the Bristol Channel since the start of the 20th century.[1] Water from melting snow, caused by milder weather accompanying the depression, added to the flooding.[5] The maximum surge at Hinkley Point was measured at 1.3 metres (4\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in) above the 7.4 metres (24\u00a0ft) tidal level Ordnance Datum (OD) at 2025 hours, and 1.3 metres (4\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in) measured at Avonmouth. The wind was measured at 40 knots (74\u00a0km/h; 46\u00a0mph) from the west. Over topping of the sea defences along a 7 miles (11\u00a0km) stretch of the North Somerset coast at 22 locations from Clevedon to Porlock began after 19:30, and continued until about 21:30 when the wind speed had reached 50 knots (93\u00a0km/h; 58\u00a0mph) from the west. Although there was no loss of life, the resultant flooding covered 12,500 acres (5,100\u00a0ha) of land, affecting 1072 houses and commercial properties, with \u00a3150,000 worth of livestock killed and \u00a350,000 of feed and grain destroyed. Wessex Water Authority estimated the total cost of the damage caused at \u00a36m, resulting in a three-year programme of sea defence assessment, repair and improvement.[6][5] In France, the storm caused widespread flooding in the south west, causing considerable damage in the river basins of the Garonne and Adour and flooding the city of Bordeaux.[7] The MV Bonita, an 8000 tonne Ecuadorian cargo ship sailing from Hamburg to Panama was caught in the storm in the English Channel. 29 were rescued from the ship, 4 by helicopter until the storm was too strong for the helicopter to operate. The remaining crew were rescued by the Guernsey lifeboat, however there were 2 fatalities.[8] Water entered the cooling water pump house of Hinkley Point nuclear power station, causing a shut-down for weeks after the storm.[9]"

Moore Jr., was made up entirely of either members sympathetic to the coal industry or government officials whose departments might have been complicit in the genesis of the flood. One of the investigators was Jack Spadaro, a man who devoted his time to regulating dam construction for safety. After then-president of the United Mine Workers Arnold Miller and others were rebuffed by Gov. Moore regarding their request that a coal miner be added to the governor's commission, a separate citizens' commission was assembled to provide an independent review of the disaster. The Governor's Commission of Inquiry report[7] called for new legislation and further inquiry by the local prosecutor. The citizens' commission report,[8] concluded that the Buffalo Creek-Pittston Coal Company was guilty of murdering at least 124 men, women and children. Additionally, the chair of the citizen's commission and Deputy Director of the West Virginia Department of Natural Resources, Norman Williams, called for the legislature to outlaw coal strip mining throughout the state. Williams testified before the legislature that strip mining could not exist as a profit-making industry unless it is allowed by the state to pass on the costs of environmental damage to the private landowner or the public.[9] The state of West Virginia also sued the Buffalo Creek-Pittston Coal Company for $100 million (equivalent to $503 million today) in disaster and relief damages, but a smaller settlement was reached for just $1 million ($5 million today) with Governor Moore, three days before he left office in 1977. The lawyers for the plaintiffs, Arnold & Porter of Washington, D.C., donated a portion of their legal fees for the construction of a new community center. West Virginia has yet to build the center, though the center was promised by Governor Moore in May 1972.[10] Gerald M. Stern, an attorney with Arnold & Porter, wrote a book entitled The Buffalo Creek Disaster about representing the victims of the flood. The book includes descriptions of his experiences dealing with the political and legal environment of West Virginia, where the influence of large coal mining corporations is intensely significant to the local culture and communities. Sociologist Kai T. Erikson, son of psychologist and sociologist Erik Erikson, was called as an expert witness and published a study on the effects of the disaster entitled Everything in Its Path: Destruction of Community in the Buffalo Creek Flood (1978).[11] Erikson's book later won the 1977 Sorokin Award, granted by the American Sociological Association for an \"outstanding contribution to the progress of sociology.\"[12] Long-term studies have examined the mental health of the residents of Buffalo Creek compared to a nearby coal town that did not experience the flood.[13][14][15]"

A second suit was filed by 348 child survivors, who sought $225 million ($1.39 billion today); they settled for $4.8 million in June 1974 ($29.7 million today).[16] Kerry Albright became known as the \"miracle baby\" of the disaster.

        "content": " From mid-March to April 2019 widespread flash flooding affected large parts of Iran, most severely in Golestan, Fars, Khuzestan, Lorestan, and other provinces. Iran has been hit by three major waves of rain and flooding over the course of two weeks[5] which led to flooding in at least 26 of Iran's 31 provinces[6] and at least 70 people died nationwide as of 6 April, according to the officials.[6] The first wave of rain began on 17 March, leading to flooding in two northern provinces, Golestan and Mazandaran with the former province receiving as much as 70 percent of its average annual rainfall in single day.[6] Several large dams have been overflowed, particularly in Khuzestan and Golestan, therefore many villages and several cities have been evacuated.[5] About 1,900 cities and villages across country have been damaged by severe floods as well as hundreds of millions of dollars of damage to water and agriculture infrastructure. 78 roads were blocked and the reliability of 84 bridges was questioned.[7][8] Severity of the floods was greatly increased by converting flood routes and dry river beds for urban development without providing proper drainage infrastructure.[9] According to an Iranian official, due to record rainfalls, more than 140 rivers have burst their banks and about 409 landslides have happened in the country. The impact of the floods was heightened because of the Nowruz holiday; many Iranians were traveling and many deaths occurred due to flash flooding on roads and highways.[7] Around 12,000\u00a0km of roads were damaged by the flooding, about 36% of Iran's national road network.[3] The floods caused at least $2.2 billion (2019 USD) in damages, mostly due to losses in the agricultural industry.[4] Further, according to Red Crescent, two million people are in need of humanitarian aid due to the devastating floods.[10] Civil and armed forces have been mobilized since 24 March after the command of Ali Khamenei, Iran's Supreme Leader, and vice President, Eshaq Jahangiri, along with several ministers as well as army commanders have traveled to the areas affected by floods.[11] However, the lack of government aid and delayed response at the first days quickly heightened political tensions throughout the nation. Many Iranians including politicians took to social media platforms to criticize the handling of the floods by the government, specifically President Hassan Rouhani.[12] Civilian outrage ultimately led to deadly clashes between protesters and government soldiers. The floods prompted a large outcry against the government rule which was perceived as worsening the floods through destructive measures such as the destruction of natural plant coverage, obstruction of flood outlets, and converting flood routes and dry river beds to residential areas following the Islamic Revolution.[13][14]"

Iran's Minister of Energy also reported that 360 villages in Golestan province and 193 villages in Mazandaran province had lost electricity due to floods.[17] Coincident with Iran's national holiday, Nowruz,.[18] The first wave of rain began on 17 March, leading to flooding in two northern provinces, Golestan and Mazandaran with the former province receiving as much as 70 percent of its average annual rainfall in a single day.[6] Several large dams have overflowed, particularly in Khuzestan and Golestan, therefore, many villages and several cities were evacuated.[5] In many areas, homes and lands have been partially or totally submerged for several days.[6] Portions of Golestan province received 50-70\u00a0percent of their average annual rainfall over a five-day period. Some areas recorded approximately 300\u00a0mm (12\u00a0in) of rainfall, equivalent to a year's-worth of rain. These amounts exceed any accumulations in the region in at least 70 years. The flooding in Golestan and Mazandaran provinces is considered a 1-in-100-year event.[19] On 6 April 2019, about two weeks after the flood, the town of Aqqala in the northern province of Golestan, is still covered with lethal flood. Local authorities say \"they have to wait for the water to vaporize\".[citation needed] The governor of Golestan province was also reportedly on vacation outside the country during the floods.[12] Later, he was dismissed by the vice President.[20]"

Rain was short but heavy, lasting in two bursts of approximately 15 minutes each; however, the impact was exacerbated by the heavy road traffic at the time. Iran's Meteorological Organisation gave warnings for further floods, as heavy rains were expected to last at least until 27 March.[24] The leader of the Iranian Ministry of Energy has stated that climate change was a contributing factor to the flooding.[24] As of 26 March 2019, 20 of Iran's 31 provinces are either currently flooded or facing the possibility of imminent flooding.[21] According to a dissident news organization,[which?] local sources reported that as many as 150 people were killed in the floods in Shiraz on 25 March.[citation needed] Official reports, however, indicated that a total of 21 people were killed in Fars Province, which includes Shiraz, by 5 April.[25] A brief but intense rainfall caused a sudden flash flood that submerged the main highway between Shiraz and Esfahan, trapping many travelers who had been leaving the city after Nowruz celebrations. City officials did not warn the people of Shiraz of the deadly weather conditions resulting in many deaths.[26] The initial investigations of the Shiraz flash floods showed that a water canal adjacent to the Quran Gate was paved over in the early 2000s for use as a road by the Shiraz municipality. The road expansion did not include a sufficient drainage system.[citation needed]"

Excavations of Great Wall of Gorgan were also damaged due to its close proximity to a dry riverbed which experienced flooding. The floods have damaged the Aq Qala bridge in northern Iran and several other centuries-old bridges in Isfahan and Shoushtar.[50] According to the guardian, the damages have been so severe that the Iranian authorities have stopped foreign journalists from visiting the areas that are affected the worst.[52] On 15 April 2019 it was reported that a leisure center that belonged to Iran's security forces was one of the \"major structures\" responsible for the recent deadly flood.[53]"

        "content": "Tropical Storm Mindy was a short-lived tropical storm which affected much of Mexico and the Southeastern United States in September 2021. The thirteenth tropical storm of the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season, Mindy originated from a tropical wave which entered the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa on August 22. The wave traveled westward across the Atlantic, breaking apart for the first time on August 27. After moving through Central America breaking apart once more on September 2. The northern part of the wave moved into the Gulf of Mexico on September 5, moving gradually northward between two mid-level ridges. On September 8, the wave began showing signs of organization and gale-force winds, becoming Tropical Storm Mindy southwest of Apalachicola, Florida. Mindy intensified before landfall, attaining a peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1,000\u00a0mbar (30\u00a0inHg) at 01:15 UTC on September 9; as the cyclone made landfall on St. Vincent Island, Florida. The storm rapidly weakened inland before entering the Atlantic and being absorbed by a baroclinic system on September 11.[1] While moving across Mexico, the precursor to Mindy killed a total of 23 people and caused losses of $75 million (2021 USD) as a result of floods. As Mindy tracked across the Southeastern United States, minor damage was reported through tropical storm-force winds and heavy rainfall.[1]"

        "content": "A tropical wave entered the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of West Africa on August 22. The wave moved westward across the Atlantic, steered by a subtropical ridge to the north, fracturing first on August 27, with the northern part becoming Tropical Storm Kate and the southern part entering the Caribbean Sea between August 28\u201329. Briefly on September 1, the system showed some signs of organization, prior to crossing Central America the next day and stopping further development. While crossing Central America, the wave once more broke apart, with the new southern half emerging into the East Pacific and forming into Hurricane Olaf by September 7. The northern half moved over the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula between September 3\u20134 and entered the Gulf of Mexico on September 5.[1] Trapped between two mid-level ridges to the northwest and southeast, the wave was left within an area of weak steering currents, thus it moved gradually northward. A deep-layer trough over the western Gulf of Mexico boosted the system northeastward on September 8. An overnight burst of deep convection the same day helped the disturbance become better-defined at the surface level, thus scatterometer data indicated gale-force winds and a well-defined center at 15:16 UTC. At 18:00 UTC, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) upgraded the disturbance into Tropical Storm Mindy, about 140 nautical miles southwest of Apalachicola, Florida. Throughout the remainder of the day, Mindy strengthened within environmental conditions of warm ocean temperatures of 84\u00a0\u00b0F (29\u00a0\u00b0C), moderate southwesterly vertical wind shear, and marginally favorable mid-level humidity of 60%. However, Mindy had limited time over the Gulf of Mexico as it raced northeastwards toward land.[1] At 01:15 UTC on September 9, a combination of surface observations and radar data indicated that Mindy had attained a peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1,000\u00a0mbar (30\u00a0inHg); as it made landfall on St. Vincent Island, Florida. These radar observations along with velocity data depicted Mindy with a well-defined circulation and spiral banding upon landfall. Over the next few hours, Mindy pushed inland across Florida's Big Bend region, skirting to the south of Tallahassee. By 12:00 UTC the same day, Mindy was downgraded to a tropical depression by the NHC, before emerging back into the Atlantic Ocean just six hours later. Increases of westerly vertical wind shear combined with a recent cold front offshore the Southeastern United States caused Mindy to lose tropical characteristics and convection to become disorganized. At 00:00 UTC on September 10, Mindy transitioned into a post-tropical cyclone around 150 nautical miles southeast of Wilmington, North Carolina. The remnant circulation was noted for another day before fully embedding within a baroclinic zone at 00:00 UTC on September 11.[1]"

        "content": "In Mexico, the precursor to Mindy dropped torrential rainfall between September 2\u20137, resulting in flooding. The worst flooding was reported in the states of Hidalgo, Morelos, Mexico City, State of Mexico, and Jalisco. These floods caused a total of 23 fatalities and $75 million (2021 USD) worth of losses. A total of 31,000 homes were also damaged by flooding.[1][2] In Hidalgo, the Tula River and Rosas River was affected by more than two days of heavy rainfall, resulting in the overtopping of their banks. In Atotonilco de Tula, flooding from the former river forced the evacuation of 41 individuals from a hospital, and caused the deaths of 17 others. Most of the fatalities were patients that had been hospitalized with COVID-19 as stated by Governor Omar Fayad, posting images showing nurses evacuating patients from deep floodwaters. More than 1,000 additional residents were evacuated across the city, while damage was reported to several buildings.[3][4] Across the state of Morelos, flooding was reported in several communities which left four dead and one missing. More than 300 homes received damage, severely affecting about 1,600 citizens. In Tlayacapan, all four fatalities in the state were reported in the village where sixty homes had damage. Shelters were opened for victims of flooding in the state. Cleanup and rescue efforts were assisted by the Red Cross and local civil protection. On September 3, Governor Cuauht\u00e9moc Blanco expressed condolences to victims and pledged to distribute relief supplies while warning of remaining river flooding in the region.[5] In Ecatepec de Morelos, state media reported on two deaths due to flooding in the area.[3] More than 100,000 residents in the city were affected by flooding.[6] Around 60 vehicles sustained damage from the storm in Morelos, as well as infrastructure.[7] Mexib\u00fas transit routes were disrupted by flooding in Chimalhuac\u00e1n, in the State of Mexico.[8] A road connecting Mexico City to the state of Morelos was flooded by waters with a depth of 1.7 feet (0.52\u00a0m).[9] The precursor to Mindy affected the region on the same day as a powerful earthquake impacted the nearby state of Guerrero and was felt around Mexico City and surrounding states.[10] In Jalisco, more than 1,000 homes were damaged by flooding that reached depths of 19 inches (48\u00a0cm) in some areas.[11] Across the southern portion of the Guadalajara metropolitan area, firefighters and members of the civil protection rescued stranded vehicles and removed debris from clogged drains to clear roads. Flooding in Tlaquepaque blocked vehicles from crossing some roads for several minutes. In one of the municipalities' neighborhoods, severe flooding inundated homes and left many stranded on their roofs. Multiple dams were overtopped in Tlajomulco as a result of excessive precipitation, spreading floodwaters over a road and halting traffic. Another street in the town was flooded by the collapse of a fence retaining floodwaters. A public transport unit collided with a vehicle carrying deployed personnel in Tlajomuclo, resulting in several injuries and the needed assistance of paramedics.[12] At least three people in Guadalajara required rescue after their vehicles were swept away in a downpour.[13] Three homes were flooded in the Zapopan neighborhood of Miramar by the overflow of a nearby stream. The neighborhood of La Primavera also suffered flooding which entered homes and caused a vacant structure to collapse. In other nearby neighborhoods, floodwaters reached a level of 5.9 inches (15\u00a0cm).[14]"

        "content": "Mindy's genesis was not well forecast as the NHC was unsure about where the storm would possibly, if at all, spawn. As a result, a Tropical Storm Warning was not issued until the storm was just hours away from landfall. The first of these warnings was issued at 21:00 UTC on September 8 and covered an area from Mexico Beach to the Steinhatchee River in Florida. This warning was expanded slightly before being discontinued as Mindy pushed inland at 09:00 UTC on September 9.[1] Prior rainfall from Hurricane Elsa and Hurricane Ida saturated low\u2014lying areas in Dixie County, forcing residents to evacuate.[15] As a precaution for Mindy, the government of New York City tested a new alert system following major flooding from the remnants of Hurricane Ida.[16] In the United States, Mindy left overall minor damage from tropical storm-force winds and heavy rainfall. A peak wind gust of 54\u00a0mph (87\u00a0km/h) was observed at Island View Park in Carrabelle, Florida on September 9 while a wind gust of 61\u00a0mph (98\u00a0kmh) was also reported at an elevation of 115 feet (35\u00a0m) at Tyndall Air Force Base.[17][1] A small storm surge of 1 to 2 feet (0.30 to 0.61\u00a0m) was reported along the coasts of the Big Bend of Florida and Apalachee Bay. A peak surge of 2.3 feet (0.70\u00a0m) was reported by gauge in Steinhatchee. A rainfall accumulation of 4.85 inches (123\u00a0mm) was observed in Tallahassee, while Mindy's outer bands produced a peak total of 5.6 inches (140\u00a0mm) of precipitation in Beverly Hills. More than 10,000 customers lost electricity in the region because of Mindy, with outages extending into southeastern Georgia.[1] Leon High School and an elementary school in Tallahassee started classes on September 9 without electricity until it was restored a few hours later.[18] Across Leon County, two home suffered damage from downed trees, along with a destroyed manufactured home where a person was trapped inside but escaped unscathed.[1] A semi truck was blown off a road near Tallahassee.[19] Flooding was reported in Lynn Haven and Parker after grounds were saturated by recent rainfall and Mindy.[20] Fallen trees were observed across Franklin, Jefferson, Wakulla, and Holmes counties in Florida. An EF0 tornado was also spawned in Wakulla County near Crawfordville, although damage was only minor and limited to trees.[20] In Jefferson County, large oak trees were downed south of U.S. 27 and the Waukeenah Highway, leaving all customers of Duke Energy in the area without power.[20] Scattered power outages affected most of Georgia as a result of Mindy, with the heaviest outages being reported around the towns of Pearson and Washington on the evening of September 9.[21] Swaths of southeast Georgia up to Interstate 75 in Tifton reported 3\u20135 inches (76\u2013127 millimetres) of rain.[1] In Savannah, rainfall rates of an inch (25.4\u00a0mm) per hour were observed.[17] In South Carolina, a combination of storm surge and heavy rainfall from Mindy prompted the closure of more than a dozen streets in Charleston.[22] A peak rainfall amount of 5.68 inches (144\u00a0mm) was measured near Beaufort; rainfall totals of generally over 4 inches (100\u00a0mm) were observed along the South Carolina coast to the southeast of Interstate 95 from Beaufort to Charleston. A large tree crushed a vehicle and home in Burton. Another residence in Beaufort was struck by lightning, causing about $20,000 (2021 USD) worth of damage.[23] Law enforcement was forced to place barricades on flooded roads near a Charleston hospital. Floodwaters entreated a nail salon in a low-lying part of Charleston, being pushed in by passing vehicles. Tidal levels in Charleston Harbor were measured near 6.8 feet (2.1\u00a0m) during the storm.[24] Flooding was reported north of the Broad River, causing county sheriffs to close some flooded streets and advising motorists to seek alternate routes.[25] Damage across South Carolina totaled $28,000.[23] Total losses across the United States was worth $169,000.[20][23]"

Initial reports indicated that a young boy had been swept away near Santo and was presumed dead.[5] However, the boy was found days later clinging to a rock. The two fatalities in the country resulted from fallen tree limbs on the islands of Epi and Ambae.[4] Following an aerial assessment of damage in Vanuatu, Malampa and Shefa provinces in were declared disaster areas. In these provinces, nearly 50% of all homes sustained damage and upwards of a quarter of all buildings were impacted. In Fiji, damage from Paula was much less than initially feared; however, several homes in the Western Division were destroyed by rough seas produced by the storm. Elsewhere, structural damage was minimal and a few landslides resulted in damage to crops. Throughout the country, preliminary estimates placed the damage at US$800,000.[6] Following the storm, requests for assistance from the French government were made by Vanuatu.

The rain rate over the headwaters of Jacobs Creek is estimated to be several inches per hour with almost 6 inches (15\u00a0cm) of estimated total rainfall by 8:00 pm. At 8:30 pm, the culvert carrying Jacobs Creek reached capacity and the flowing water began to accumulate behind the elevated embankment of the Kansas Turnpike near milepost 116. Water began flowing over the northbound lanes of the highway shortly after. At 9:00 pm, the accumulating water from Jacobs Creek began flowing over the northbound lanes of the highway, pooling against the concrete dividers that separated the north- and southbound lanes. Some vehicles in the northbound lanes began to stall in the pooled water. Within the next 30 minutes, the water level reached the top of the concrete dividers and began spilling over into the southbound lanes of the highway. Stranded motorists attempted to exit their vehicles and swim to safety. At 9:01 pm, KHP Trooper Marc McCune arrived as the \"first on the scene\".[1] By 9:21 pm, Chase County Sheriff's department 9-1-1 dispatcher instructed stalled drivers to \"stay put\".[2] A 'turnpike official' advised dispatch to ... shut down [the road] at 9:29.[2] At 9:35 PM, the force of the accumulated water spilling over the median barriers caused 12 of them to collapse, and the backed-up water surged over the roadway, carrying seven vehicles downstream into Jacobs Creek. Total rainfall was estimated to be from 6 inches (15\u00a0cm) to 8 inches (20\u00a0cm) and the peak flow of Jacobs Creek at the Kansas Turnpike was estimated to be 4,100 cubic feet per second (120\u00a0m3/s).[3] Flash flooding of Jacobs Creek at the Kansas Turnpike killed four children and their mother, as well as another man who was killed after rescuing four people trapped in their vehicles.  In addition, it caused about $250,000 worth of property damage along the creek. Water remained high in Jacobs Creek downstream of the turnpike for several days, impeding recovery efforts.  Severely damaged vehicles and victims from the flood were found as far as 2 miles (3.2\u00a0km) away from the turnpike.  The final victim was recovered on September 2 in a retention pond.[4]"

In 2015, the Kansas Turnpike Authority installed high-water warning signs for the flash flood-prone stretch of Kansas Turnpike (I-35) where the fatalities occurred.[6] In July, 2016, the Kansas Turnpike Authority upgraded the culverts at the locations of the flash flooding. At Jacobs Creek, the original 7-foot (2.1\u00a0m) by 7-ft culvert was replaced with two 14 feet (4.3\u00a0m) by 12 feet (3.7\u00a0m) culverts, designed to channel significantly more water, with a 1% probability of flooding during a given year.[7]"

It was the region's most destructive storm since at least the 1867 San Narciso hurricane; Consul General Christopher Payne and archaeologist Theodoor de Booy considered the 1916\u00a0storm as the archipelago's most damaging. Its peak intensity was equivalent to a Category\u00a03 on the modern Saffir\u2013Simpson scale. The storm began as a tropical depression southeast of Barbados on October\u00a06, though little is known about the storm's origins or its developing stages; by the time its center was first located, the cyclone was already a hurricane and causing damage in the Virgin Islands. After forming, the storm moved northwest into the eastern Caribbean Sea and strengthened quickly. Rough seas were produced in the Windward Islands at Dominica and Saint Kitts as the storm passed nearby between October\u00a07\u20138, damaging coastal villages. On the evening of October\u00a09, the hurricane traversed the Virgin Islands with an intensity equivalent to a Category\u00a02 on the modern Saffir\u2013Simpson scale, passing directly over Saint Croix and producing gusts as high as 160\u00a0mph (260\u00a0km/h). Of the Danish West Indies, Saint Thomas fared worst, with virtually every building sustaining damage. The island harbor suffered greatly and numerous ships were grounded or sunk. Entire towns in Saint Croix and Tortola were destroyed. There were four deaths in Saint Thomas, five in the remainder of the Danish West Indies, and thirty-two in Tortola. After battering the Lesser Antilles, the hurricane continued harmlessly out to sea on a northward and later northeastward trajectory. While well southeast of Bermuda, the storm's intensity peaked on October\u00a012 with maximum sustained winds of 120\u00a0mph (190\u00a0km/h). Steady weakening ensued thereafter, and the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on October\u00a014 before being absorbed by another cyclone east of Newfoundland a day later. Amid the storm's aftermath, coal carriers successfully went on strike for increased wages. Crop production in 1917 was significantly curtailed by the widespread damage wrought to agriculture by the hurricane."

        "content": "The 1916 Virgin Islands hurricane was the thirteenth known tropical cyclone of the 1916 Atlantic hurricane season.[2] Owing to a paucity of weather observations in the region, the precise location of the storm was not known contemporaneously until it was already traversing the Virgin Islands as a fully-fledged hurricane.[4] According to a reanalysis of the hurricane in 2008, conducted by the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory, the storm began just southeast of Barbados as a tropical depression on October\u00a06. Over the next three days, it traveled on a northwestward course into the Caribbean Sea.[2] Winds in the southern Lesser Antilles remained low as the system passed between Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent on October\u00a07.[2][5] However, the emergence of low air pressures in Dominica prompted the United States Weather Bureau to begin monitoring the disturbance, requesting additional weather observations to better diagnose the developing tropical cyclone.[4] The tropical storm strengthened into a hurricane on October\u00a09.[1] Curving towards the north,[5] the storm intensified quickly and made landfall on the Danish West Indies at Saint Croix on the evening of October\u00a09.[2] According to a Weather Bureau report published in the Monthly Weather Review, \"The storm was of small area and of great intensity.\"[6] An air pressure of 963\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.44\u00a0inHg) was registered on the island,[2] lower than any other reading in the island's history;[7] based on this reading, the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project estimated that the hurricane possessed maximum sustained winds of at least 110\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h) during its passage through the Virgin Islands, equivalent to a Category\u00a02 hurricane on the modern Saffir\u2013Simpson scale. The project also noted that the storm may have been a major hurricane at landfall.[2][note 2] Gusts may have been as high as 140\u2013160\u00a0mph (230\u2013260\u00a0km/h).[9][10] After crossing the islands, the hurricane continued north, its winds increasing further to a peak of 120\u00a0mph (190\u00a0km/h) southeast of Bermuda on October\u00a012.[5][4] A ship caught in the hurricane that day reported winds of 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h).[2] The storm curved towards the northeast and weakened following this peak intensity, transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on October\u00a014; the system continued its trajectory into the northern Atlantic before it was absorbed by another extratropical cyclone east of Newfoundland on October\u00a015.[2][5]"

Account of the storm in The Bulletin, October\u00a011, 1916[23] Of the Danish West Indies, Saint Thomas experienced the most severe effects from the hurricane.[18] Nearly every building on the island incurred damage, and several among them were destroyed.[13] Many buildings that remained standing were nonetheless wrecked beyond repair.[26] Slave cabins were separated from their foundations and smashed into flinders against other buildings or trees.[25] The severity of impacts was largely uniform throughout the island, though Savanne and Frenchman's Hill were most seriously affected.[27] Severe flooding occurred in Charlotte Amalie, Frenchtown, and Lindbergh Bay.[28] The 6\u201310\u00a0ft (1.8\u20133.0\u00a0m) storm surge tore buildings away from their foundations and inundated large tracts of land.[29][30] Extensive losses were wrought upon shipping.[11] The harbor at Saint Thomas, normally shielded from most tropical disturbances, saw extensive impacts;[27][31] the harbor was most susceptible to a hurricane approaching from the south, as was the case in the 1916\u00a0hurricane.[32] Steamers were grounded upon the island by the force of the wind-driven waves.[13] Beached ships included the ocean liners Calabria and Wasgenwald of the Hamburg America Line and the Danish dredge St. Hilda.[33] Calabria and Wasgenwald, both German ships, were interned in the Danish West Indies since the start of World War I.[29] Calabria was considered a total loss and St. Hilda was reduced to smaller fragments.[33][29] Two other Danish ships were severely damaged and many smaller vessels capsized.[33] The distress vessel Blandford was the only ship in the harbor not moved from her moorings.[27] Two electric harbor cranes operated by the West Indian Company and built to withstand a 100-mph (160\u00a0km/h) wind were mangled and partially strewn in the sea.[34][11][35][36] Recent additions to the Saint Thomas harbor also sustained heavy blows.[11] A machine shop was swept away by the sea.[36] Electric wires were blown down and warehouses were unroofed across Saint Thomas.[37] The iron sheet roofs of homes were pried off by the wind.[38] Many trees were uprooted or debarked. In the market square, trees laid mangled with communication and electric wires,[26] littering public thoroughfares alongside amalgamations of wind-torn gutters and rooftop tiling.[38] At the supply station of the West India and Panama Telegraph Company, ancillary buildings and storehouses were destroyed. Nearby, a coconut plantation was rendered infertile due to damage sustained to the tops of trees.[39] As more sturdier structures, places of worship fared comparably well but were nevertheless subject to the violence of the winds; rectories were seriously damaged and a chapel was destroyed.[36] Some people sought shelter in parsonages.[40] In addition to the winds and surge, the hurricane also produced heavy rainfall; at Charlotte Amalie, the storm's rainfall total in 24\u00a0hours was a 1-in-20 year event.[41][note 4] Merchant stocks were tarnished by the rainfall.[38] Four deaths\u2014all drownings\u2014were documented at Saint Thomas;[18] these occurred at the harbor in addition to several injuries.[36]"

The roof of one home destroyed a stable and a few rooms after being blown away. Ninety percent of fences and most trees were knocked down.[45] Heavy damage was also wrought in rural areas of Saint Croix,[13] where telecommunications were disrupted.[11] At several settlements, homes were badly damaged; only 4\u00a0homes of 23\u201325 at an estate in Annaly were destroyed.[46] Anegada, Tortola, and Saint John of the Virgin Islands were devastated by the hurricane.[17] At Tortola the hurricane's winds were strongest on the evening of October\u00a09, holding at around 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) for an hour.[6] A report sent to The Sun, a New York-based newspaper, enumerated thirty-two fatalities in Tortola and eight in Saint John. However, a later report indicated five deaths combined in Saint Croix and Saint John from injuries caused by falling walls or trees.[18] More than 50\u00a0people were injured in Saint John.[47] Nearly all houses on the Saint John and Tortola were destroyed.[48] Most boats at Tortola were destroyed, and some were dispersed by the storm's wind and waves on inland hills.[48] Significant damage was dealt to the island's crops. Two thousand people were displaced by the storm in Tortola.[12] Across three settlements in Saint John, all houses except one were razed. Swaths of trees were denuded in some areas of the island.[49] Although the force of the storm was stronger on Saint John than on Saint Thomas, the island's lower population led to a lesser monetary toll to infrastructure;[50] however, total casualties were higher in Saint John due to a lack of communications, leaving the island's residents unaware of the storm's approach.[47]"

Damage from the hurricane was initially estimated by the American consulate at $2\u00a0million.[13][note 5] However, further surveys of the damage suggested a smaller toll.[18] Christopher Payne, the American Consul General to the Danish West Indies, appealed for $50,000 in immediate relief.[51] The government of the Danish West Indies provisioned $5,000 for relief on October\u00a011.[52] Some of the funds allowed the poor to build new homes, though other parts were loaned without interest. Crews were dispatched to repair effaced mountain roads.[53] Further assistance was provided by the Danish Ministry of Finance.[54] HMS Valkyrien embarked on a search-and-rescue operation following the storm, extracting survivors from the stricken barquentine Thor.[55] The Valkyrien's junior surgeon was sent to Saint John to render assistance due to a lack of any medical personnel on the island.[56] Galvanized by the devastation wrought by the hurricane, coal carriers\u2014workers who refueled coal-powered ships[57]\u2014in Saint Thomas went on a successful strike to demand increased wages, ultimately forming a union with 2,700\u00a0members and negotiating a doubling of their pay.[58][57] The loss of trees and foliage on Saint Croix caused by the storm led to decreased outputs of bananas, cocoa, mangoes, oranges, and pineapples;[59] virtually every fruit tree was destroyed by the hurricane.[60] In Saint John, oil extraction from the bay tree (Pimenta acris) in 1917 was a quarter of the annual average; many of the trees were stripped of their leaves. The lime industry was suspended by the severity of damage inflicted upon lime trees;[61] the storm struck amid an effort to establish lime groves on abandoned estates.[62] Difficult living conditions for older populations following the loss of homes and roofs led to increased mortality rates among those older than 40\u00a0years old in 1917; mortality rates recovered to longer-term averages by 1918.[63] The extent of the damage to Saint Thomas's harbor may have increased support for the sale of the Danish West Indies to the United States in the 1916 Danish West Indian Islands sale referendum.[64]"

        "content": " Tropical Storm Debby was a tropical cyclone that caused extensive flooding in North Florida and Central Florida during late June 2012. The fourth tropical cyclone and named storm of the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season, Debby developed from a trough of low pressure in the central Gulf of Mexico on June\u00a023. At the time, Debby was the earliest fourth named storm to form within the Atlantic basin on record. Despite a projected track toward landfall in Louisiana or Texas, the storm headed the opposite direction, moving slowly north-northeast and northeastward. The storm slowly strengthened, and at 1800\u00a0UTC on June\u00a025, attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h). Dry air, westerly wind shear, and upwelling of cold waters prevented further intensification over the next 24\u00a0hours. Instead, Debby weakened, and by late on June\u00a026, it was a minimal tropical storm. At 2100\u00a0UTC, the storm made landfall near Steinhatchee, Florida with winds of 40\u00a0mph (65\u00a0km/h). Once inland, the system continued to weaken while crossing Florida, and dissipated shortly after emerging into the Atlantic on June\u00a027. The storm dropped immense amounts of precipitation near its path. Rainfall peaked at 28.78 inches (731\u00a0mm) in Curtis Mill, Florida, located in southwestern Wakulla County. The Sopchoppy River, which reached its record height, flooded at least 400\u00a0structures in Wakulla County. Additionally, the Suwannee River reached its highest level since Hurricane Dora in 1964. Further south in Pasco County, the Anclote River and Pithlachascotee River overflowed, flooding communities with \"head deep\" water and causing damage to 106\u00a0homes. An additional 587\u00a0homes were inundated after the Black Creek overflowed in Clay County. Several roads and highways in North Florida were left impassable, including Interstate 10 and U.S. Route 90. U.S. Routes 19 and 98 were also inundated by coastal flooding. In Central and South Florida, damage was primarily caused by tornadoes, one of which caused a fatality. Overall, Debby caused at least $250\u00a0million in losses and 8\u00a0deaths, 7\u00a0in Florida and 1 in Alabama."

        "content": "During mid-June, the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) made its annual migration northward into the southern Gulf of Mexico. Coinciding with a Madden\u2013Julian oscillation, a weak surface low pressure area developed on June\u00a019, and subsequently moved inland over the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. While the system crossed the peninsula, a tropical wave moved through the northwestern Caribbean Sea on June\u00a018. The wave reached the Gulf of Mexico on June\u00a020 and merged with the low a few days later, spawning a trough of low pressure on June\u00a022. Located in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico, moderate vertical wind shear caused the system to remain disorganized. Nonetheless, Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicated that the trough acquired a low-level circulation on June\u00a023, while ships in the area reported tropical storm force winds. Thus, it is estimated that Tropical Storm Debby developed at 1200\u00a0UTC on June\u00a023, centered about 290 miles (470\u00a0km) south of mouth of the Mississippi River.[1] Becoming a tropical storm on June\u00a023, Debby became the earliest fourth named storm in the Atlantic basin, surpassing the old record set by Hurricane Dennis on July\u00a05, 2005, however with 2016's Danielle the record was beaten by three days. Initially, Debby was predicted to curve westward and potentially threaten Texas.[2] A deepening trough would curve the storm westward, while wind shear was predicted to decrease.[3] Although the storm generated very cold cloud tops, much of the convection was located more than 100 miles (160\u00a0km) from the center and still displaced to the east.[4] By 1200\u00a0UTC on June\u00a024, the forecast path was shifted from east-central Texas to southeastern Louisiana.[5] Despite persistent wind shear, Debby was strengthening and around that time, the storm attained its maximum sustained wind speed of 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h).[1] Later on June\u00a024, the National Hurricane Center noted in its next advisory that this \"is a very difficult and highly uncertain forecast\", citing Debby's slow movement and widespread computer forecast models.[6] The forecast track for Debby was shifted significantly to the east late on June\u00a024, and it was predicted that the storm would move northward and make landfall near Panama City, Florida.[7] Based on a dropsonde estimate, Debby attained its minimum barometric pressure of 990\u00a0mbar (29\u00a0inHg) at 0000\u00a0UTC on June\u00a025. However, the storm began to weaken due to increasing wind shear, drier air, and upwelling of cold water, caused by Debby's slow movement.[1] It was initially composed of multiple small swirls, but consolidated into one well-defined low-level circulation by early on June\u00a025.[8] Due to its excessively slow movement and no prediction for acceleration, the National Hurricane Center remarked that, \"the cyclone does not seem to be going anywhere anytime soon.\"[9] A burst in deep convection occurred later on June\u00a025, though adverse environmental conditions prevented re-intensification. Debby began curving east-northeastward and began to speed up on June\u00a026, in response to a mid-latitude trough digging into the western Atlantic Ocean. While approaching the Florida Big Bend, Debby produced only a small area of deep convection on satellite imagery.[1] At 2100\u00a0UTC June\u00a026, Debby made landfall near Steinhatchee, Florida with winds of 40\u00a0mph (65\u00a0km/h). The storm weakened quickly after moving inland, and by early on June\u00a027, it was downgraded to a tropical depression, while located about 35 miles (56\u00a0km) north of Gainesville, Florida. Debby maintained tropical cyclone status while crossing Florida, but degenerated into a trough of low pressure by 1800\u00a0UTC on June\u00a027.[1] In the final advisory issued by the National Hurricane Center three hours later, the agency noted that Debby could eventually reacquire tropical characteristics.[10] After its dissipation, however, the remnants did not regenerate into a tropical cyclone, but re-developed a new center of circulation and strengthened slightly due to baroclinic conditions. As it accelerated northward, Debby's remnants became increasingly frontal in nature, and once again degenerated into an open trough at 1800\u00a0UTC on June\u00a030; at this time, the disturbance was located south of Newfoundland.[1]"

On the following day, a separate tropical storm warning was put into effect from the Mississippi and Alabama border to the mouth of the Ochlockonee River in Florida. At 1500\u00a0UTC on June\u00a024, the tropical storm warning was extended to the mouth of the Suwannee River. Simultaneously, a tropical storm watch was issued from the Suwannee River to Anclote Key. These were all canceled at 1500\u00a0UTC on June\u00a025, though a tropical storm warning was then implemented from Destin to Englewood, Florida. Early on June\u00a026, a tropical storm warning was issued from Mexico Beach to Englewood, Florida. By 2100\u00a0UTC that day, the tropical storm warning was extended to the mouth of Steinhatchee River in Florida. This was discontinued after Debby became a tropical depression.[1] Several additional preparations took place in addition to tropical cyclone warnings and watches. According to the Federal government of the United States, nearly 25% of crude oil and natural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico was shut down. In Louisiana, Governor Bobby Jindal declared a state of emergency.[11] On June\u00a024, voluntary evacuations were issued for several areas in northwest Florida during the approach of the storm, especially Taylor and Wakulla Counties.[12] Governor of Florida Rick Scott also declared a state of emergency on June\u00a025.[13] Additionally, mandatory evacuations were issued for St. George Island,[14] Alligator Point, and other low-lying areas of Franklin County.[12]"

Precipitation peaked at 28.78 inches (731\u00a0mm) in Curtis Mill, which is located in Wakulla County. In Panacea, a Mesonet station recorded a 24\u2011hour rainfall of 20.63 inches (524\u00a0mm).[1] Rainfall caused numerous small creeks, streams, and rivers to rapidly exceed their banks and flood adjacent communities. The Sopchoppy River crested at 36.8 feet (11.2\u00a0m), which was a record height. Numerous homes were flooded, some up to the second story. Two bridges were damaged, and numerous roads around the county were washed out or closed. Over 400\u00a0structures were affected by flooding, including more than 170\u00a0mobile homes and nearly 200\u00a0single-family residences. Of these structures, 40\u00a0were destroyed, 61\u00a0had major flood damage, 41\u00a0suffered minor flood damage, and 271\u00a0were affected by flooding. Additionally, coastal flooding impacted the county, with a storm surge of 4 feet (1.2\u00a0m) and tides up 6.5 feet (2.0\u00a0m) in St. Marks. Numerous roads were underwater and several area businesses received water intrusion in that city. U.S. Route 98 was over-washed just north of St. Marks. As a result, mandatory evacuations were ordered south of U.S. Route 98 and around the Sopchoppy River. In total, 67\u00a0people required rescuing.[15] Losses throughout the county were assessed at $9.09\u00a0million.[16] The storm also produced adverse effects in Franklin County. In Apalachicola, a gust of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) was observed as well as 6.03 inches (153\u00a0mm) of rainfall on June\u00a024,[17] resulting in widespread flash flooding.[15] The John Gorrie Memorial Bridge connecting Apalachicola to Eastpoint was closed on June\u00a024 due to high winds.[18] A wind gust of 66\u00a0mph (106\u00a0km/h) was reported at the Apalachicola Regional Airport. The St. George Island Bridge, a 4 miles (6.4\u00a0km) bridge connecting Eastpoint to St. George Island over the Apalachicola Bay, was also closed on June\u00a024 due to high winds.[18] The bridge was opened later that day as both St. George Island and Alligator Point were put under a mandatory evacuation, requiring all people to leave immediately, and those remaining on the islands subject to arrest.[19][20] St. George Island, a popular resort community and tourist destination, lost all power on June\u00a024 due to high winds destroying three power poles in the Apalachicola Bay; a Progress Energy spokesperson stated that it could be days before power was restored because the conditions are too unsafe for workers.[20] In Bay County, moderate beach erosion occurred, with a storm surge reaching 1.5 feet (0.46\u00a0m) and storm tide of 2.42 feet (0.74\u00a0m) in Panama City. Flooding forced the closure of a few roads in Jefferson County, including U.S. Route 27 west of U.S. Route 19.[15] In Madison County, one house was surrounded by in overflowing retention pond near the city of Madison. State Road 51 in Lafayette County flooded, caused by the Steinhatchee River exceeding its banks. In Dixie County, several roads north of Cross City experienced flooding, while water entered at least 40\u00a0homes along the Steinhatchee River. Moderate coastal flooding occurred in Horseshoe Beach, due to an estimated storm surge of 4 feet (1.2\u00a0m), with tides reaching 7 feet (2.1\u00a0m) above normal. Water entered several homes near the coast and surrounded outbuildings by up to 1.5 feet (0.46\u00a0m).[15] In Columbia County, preliminary losses were placed in excess of $20\u00a0million as of July\u00a03 and did not take into account hundreds of homes that remained flooded at the time.[21] Several bridges were washed out due to the heavy rain; both U.S. Route 319 and U.S. Route 98 were closed due to flooding.[14] In Suwannee County, the Suwannee River at Live Oak reached its highest crest since Hurricane Dora in 1964.[1] Gainesville received its second-highest daily rain total of 6.95 inches (177\u00a0mm) on June\u00a024.[22] In Marion County, up to 10.25 inches (260\u00a0mm) of rain was reported near Fellowship. As a result, State Road 40 was closed due to high water. Additionally, as many as 52\u00a0sinkholes were reported to have formed along roadways in the county. Flooding also occurred in Duval County. The public reported that water entered a home on Rose Street in Jacksonville. Streets were flooded in Orange Park, and water approached the doors of houses, forcing some residents to evacuate. The St. Marys River reached historic heights and flooded a lot homes in Baker and Nassau Counties.[15]"

In St. Petersburg, a gust of 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h) was observed, while 1.88 inches (48\u00a0mm) of rain fell in a one-hour period.[1] With the substantial loss of beaches, tourism in the region is expected to suffer significantly.[27] Portions of Upham Beach in Pinellas County were completely eroded up to the seawall and other areas in that county had lost 20 to 30\u00a0ft (6.1 to 9.1\u00a0m) of sand. On Treasure Island, coastal dunes were eroded by 10 to 15\u00a0ft (3.0 to 4.6\u00a0m). In Pass-a-Grille, Debby's storm surge flooded coastal hotels with ankle-deep water as the dunes were washed away.[27] Throughout St. Pete Beach, 30\u201340 homes were damaged by a tornado spawned by Debby.

Average annual rainfall is 2,213.4 millimetres or 87 inches in Colaba, which represents South Mumbai and 2,502.3 millimetres or 99 inches in Santacruz, which represents central and suburban Mumbai.[1] The mean maximum average temperatures is about 32\u00a0\u00b0C (90\u00a0\u00b0F) in summer and 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F) in winter, while the average minimums are 26\u00a0\u00b0C (79\u00a0\u00b0F) in summer and 18\u00a0\u00b0C (64\u00a0\u00b0F) in winter. The city experiences a lengthy, practically rainless dry season, and a relatively short, but extremely rainy wet season; due to the Southwest Monsoon and orographic influences from the nearby Western Ghats.These conditions effectively place Mumbai between a Tropical monsoon climate (Am) and a Tropical savannah climate (Aw), with more tilt towards the former considering annual precipitation."

To the east Tabasco borders with the Pet\u00e9n department of Guatemala, and to the north with the Gulf of Mexico. Tabasco is in the northern half of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The state capital is Villahermosa. The hydrology of Tabasco is complex. Most of the state is a wide coastal plain crossed by rivers coming from the mountains further south in Chiapas and Guatemala. The two main rivers in the region are the R\u00edo Grijalva and the R\u00edo Usumacinta, which converge before draining into the Gulf of Mexico north of Villahermosa through the wildlife-rich wetlands known as the Pantanos de Centla. These rivers are considered mature, since they are in the lowest part of their course, and the plain they cross allows them broad, wide flows, meandering and dividing into separate branches. \nThis is the case with the Grijalva, which separates into several branches in the central part of Tabasco (known locally as the R\u00edo Carrizal, R\u00edo Samar\u00eda and R\u00edo Mezcalapa). These three rivers converge at Villahermosa, where they recombine and again take the name Grijalva. \nThe main branch of the Grijalva in Chiapas is dammed by the country's four largest hydroelectric plants."

        "header": "Causes of the floods",
        "content": "The Tabasco floods caused largely by the sinking of the land over the last century. The constant extraction of petroleum and gas, the construction of dams in the zone, the erosion of land and deforestation have all contributed toward making this region more flood-prone. Deforestation has allowed silt to fill in rivers thereby reducing their capacity and making floods more likely.[5] \nWith the onset of constant rainfall due to a low pressure system located nearby, the combination of these influences contributed to making the flood event even worse than it might otherwise have been. Some have suggested that global warming has increased sea levels, making water regions at the low sandy zones of the Gulf of Mexico disappear. However, sea level rises due to global warming were probably still negligible in their contribution to these floods. A number of sources point to the misuse of hydroelectric dams as a cause of the floods. Hydroelectric plants in the dams of Tabasco share the production of electricity with newer, private, more expensive gas plants. Investors complained that government owned plants cover most of the production of the electricity, lowering the price, and have put pressure on the government to lessen production on hydroelectric plants in order for them to sell more energy and raise their profit levels. This allegedly led to the dams retaining more water than they should have done.[6][7][8][9]"

As much as 80% of the state was under water.[1] At least 20,000 people were forced to leave their houses in the search of emergency shelter.[2] Over 1,000,000 residents have been affected.[3][4] The 2007 Tabasco flood not only destroyed many family houses and took away people's belongings, but also affected theaters, libraries, artistic schools and museums. One of the buildings affected was the house of the poet Carlos Pellicer C\u00e1mara, which ended up under the water. The house where the poet lived his childhood is located in Narciso S\u00e1enz 203, in the center of Villahermosa, Tabasco.\nAnother historical house affected is located at 620 Calle Lerdo de Tejada, in Villahermosa, close to Carlos Pellicer's house. The house once was occupied by Jos\u00e9 Gorostiza, the author of the Muerte sin fin poem, his brother, the dramatist Celestino Gorostiza, and the man of letters Andr\u00e9s Iduarte.[10] Economic impact at national levels will be insignificant. There is important damage in the fields which is causing increases in banana and cacao prices.[11] The flood in Tabasco will not affect the economy in Mexico as much. Guillermo Ortiz Mart\u00ednez, president of the Banco de M\u00e9xico (the central bank), agrees that Mexico will not have excessive inflation because of the Tabasco flood. But some prices of products will increase such as banana and cacao.[12]\nThe General Peasant Confederation informed that because of the flooding, 100% of the harvests are lost. This represents an economic damage of US$480\u00a0million. President Felipe Calder\u00f3n has sent seven thousand and five hundred people to help people in Tabasco. This is because of the major damage to roads, houses, and farms.[13] The flood destroyed agricultural production in the state of Tabasco, the largest producer of cocoa in the country and a major source of bananas, but is not expected that losses affect international prices, experts said on Friday. Tabasco produces 80% of all Mexico's cocoa and 40% of its bananas, according to Luis Rey Carrasco Linares, an expert from the Autonomous University of Chapingo with his squad in Tabasco. The heavy rains that punished the state for more than a week occurred during the cocoa harvest, which lasts from September to December, Carrasco said. All this year's harvest is under water and was lost, he added. The floods caused profound devastation to agriculture, which is a Principal source of Income in the state.[14]\nThe loss will have its greatest impact for the more than 30,000 families who earn their living in the production of cocoa, Carrasco said, adding that before the flood, farmers were grappling with a\nplague of fungus.[15] \"The situation is extraordinarily serious: This is one of the worst natural disasters in the history of the country\" said President Felipe Calder\u00f3n in a televised address on the night of 1 November 2007.[3] The Tabasco flood caused the loss of thousands of books from the Villahermosa central library and 78 other libraries from five different municipalities. The Grijalva River affected the infrastructure and works of the Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Pino Su\u00e1rez State Library where the entire vault has much water. The water also flooded the auditorium causing widespread damage to furniture and equipment, rising to the second floor and damaging 15,000 books from the general collection.[16]"

The remains of the front served as a focusing axis for heavy precipitation that continued into the late morning hours of May 10.  An upper-level trough helped to provide upper-level support to the system.  At the surface, warm and moist air moved in from the Gulf of Mexico continually during the event.  The swath of highest rainfall totals was closely tied to a theta-e ridge at the 850\u00a0mb pressure surface, which stretched from the central Gulf of Mexico into the Mississippi River Delta area.

        "content": " The 2015 South India floods resulted from heavy rainfall generated by the annual northeast monsoon in November\u2013December 2015. They affected the Coromandel Coast region of the South Indian states of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh.[12] More than 500 people were killed[1][2][3][4][5] and over 1.8\u00a0million (18 lakh)\u00a0people were displaced.[13] With estimates of damages and losses ranging from nearly \u20b9200 billion (US$2\u00a0billion) to over \u20b91 trillion (US$12\u00a0billion),[7][8][14][15][16][17] the floods were the costliest to have occurred in 2015, and were among the costliest natural disasters of the year.[18] Though the unusually heavy rainfall in southern India during the winter of 2015 has been attributed to the 2014\u201316 El Ni\u00f1o event, in July 2018 the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) categorised the flooding across Tamil Nadu as a \"man-made disaster\", and held the Government of Tamil Nadu responsible for the scale of the catastrophe, which the latter had termed a natural disaster.[19]"

        "content": "From October to December each year, a very large area of south India, including Tamil Nadu, the coastal regions of the Andhra Pradesh and the union territory of Puducherry, receives up to 60 percent of its annual rainfall from the northeast monsoon (or winter monsoon). The northeast monsoon is the result of the annual gradual retreat of monsoonal rains from northeastern India. Unlike during the regular monsoon, rainfall during the northeast monsoon is sporadic, but typically far exceeds the amount produced by the regular monsoon by up to 90 percent. This excessive rainfall can be exacerbated by an El Ni\u00f1o of order of the magnitude which has since been evaluated to every year, such as 2015.[20] The coastal districts of Andhra Pradesh usually bear the brunt of heavy rains that occur during the northeast monsoon; with numerous river systems and wetlands, Puducherry and eastern Tamil Nadu are prone to flooding.[20] The city of Chennai alone experienced five major floods between 1943 and 2005, with the 1943, 1978 and 2005 floods causing particularly severe damage.[21] In addition, unplanned and often illegal urban development has led to many wetlands and natural sinks being built over; this, along with ageing civic infrastructure and poorly designed drainage systems, has resulted in an increased frequency of severe flooding.[20]"

        "content": "On 8 November 2015, during the annual Cyclone season, a low-pressure area consolidated into a depression and slowly intensified into a deep depression before crossing the coast of Tamil Nadu near Puducherry the next day. Because of land interaction and high vertical wind shear, the system weakened into a well-marked low-pressure area over north Tamil Nadu on 10 November.[22] The system brought very heavy rainfall over the coastal and the north interior districts of Tamil Nadu. On 13 November, Kanchipuram recorded 340\u00a0mm of rain and several low-lying areas were inundated and Vembakkam close to Kanchipuram recorded 470\u00a0mm. On 15 November, a well-marked low-pressure area moved northwards along the Tamil Nadu coast, dropping huge amounts of rainfall over coastal Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh with 24\u2011hour totals peaking at 370\u00a0mm in Ponneri. Chennai International Airport recorded 266\u00a0mm of rainfall in 24 hours. On 28\u201329 November, another system developed and arrived over Tamil Nadu on 30 November, bringing additional rain and flooding. The system dropped 490\u00a0mm of rainfall at Tambaram in 24 hours starting 8:30\u00a0am on 1 December. Very heavy rains led to flooding across the entire stretch of coast from Chennai to Cuddalore. A study from IISc shows that on 1 December, clouds were stationary over Chennai.[23] This study showed that the mountains of Eastern Ghats blocked clouds that came from the Bay of Bengal from moving further inland. The mechanism is referred to as 'upstream blocking'. Therefore, they were stationary over Chennai throughout the day. These clouds gave continuous rainfall over Chennai that caused massive flooding."

        "content": "Between 9 and 10 November 2015, Neyveli received 483\u00a0mm (19.0\u00a0in) of rainfall; rains continued to lash Cuddalore, Chidambaram, Tiruvallur, Kanchipuram and Chennai.[22] Several low-lying areas in Kanchipuram, including major thoroughfare Gandhi Road, were inundated as the city and its neighbourhood received a heavy precipitation of 340mm during the 24-hours that ended with 8.30 a.m. on 13 November 2015. The Manjalneer Kalvai, primarily a flood drain channel for the city, overflowed after the Netteri lake breached on the Kancheepuram-Vellore Road in the wee hours of Friday, flooding the entire stretch of Gandhi Road and Munusamy Mudaliyar Avenue and forcing the police to close for traffic the prime junction Moongil Mandapam where the Gandhi Road joins with Vallal Pachaiyappan Salai. Kanchipuram Collector R.Gajalakshmi told reporters later that a total of 7,294 persons were rescued from inundated areas and accommodated in 26 shelters opened by the civic body. Boats were used to rescue the people from inundated areas in Pillayarpalayam, the Collector said. And also Vembakkam close to Kanchipuram recorded 470mm of rain on 13 November 2015.[24] Continuing rains led to low-lying parts of Chennai becoming inundated by 13 November, resulting in the evacuation of over 1000 people from their homes.[12] The flooding in Chennai city was worsened by years of illegal development and inadequate levels of flood preparedness.[25] Much of the city remained flooded on 17 November, though rainfall had largely ceased.[26] Chennai received 1,049\u00a0mm (41.3\u00a0in) of rainfall in November, the highest recorded since November 1918 when 1,088\u00a0mm (42.8\u00a0in) in of rainfall was recorded. Kancheepuram district registered the heaviest rainfall\u2014183% higher at 181.5\u00a0cm as against average rainfall of 64\u00a0cm in October\u2013December period and Tiruvallur district recorded 146\u00a0cm compared to average 59\u00a0cm of rain.[27][28] The flooding in Chennai city was described as the worst in a century.[29] The continued rains led to schools and colleges remaining closed across Puducherry and Chennai, Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur districts in Tamil Nadu, and fishermen were warned against sailing because of high waters and rough seas.[30] Though rainfall from the earlier low-pressure system ended on 24 November, another system developed on 29 November, bringing additional rain and the India Meteorological Department predicted heavy rainfall over Tamil Nadu until the end of the week.[31][32] On 1 December, heavy rains led to inundation in many areas of Chennai.[33] By afternoon, power supplies were suspended to 60% of the city while several city hospitals stopped functioning.[34] The same day, Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu Jayalalithaa announced that, because of the continued flooding and rains, half-yearly school examinations originally scheduled for 7 December would be postponed until the first week in January.[35] For the first time since its founding in 1878, the major newspaper The Hindu did not publish a print edition on 2 December, as workers were unable to reach the press building.[36] The Southern Railways cancelled major train services and Chennai International Airport was closed until 6 December.[34] Chennai was officially declared a disaster area on the evening of 2 December.[29] At the MIOT Hospital, 14 patients died after power and oxygen supplies failed. With a letup in rainfall, floodwaters gradually began to recede in Chennai on 4 December, though 40 percent of the city's districts remained submerged and safe food and drinking water remained in short supply.[37] Though relief efforts were well underway across most of the area by 3 December, the lack of any coordinated relief response in North Chennai forced thousands of its residents to evacuate on their own.[38] As intermittent rains returned, thousands of displaced residents from Chennai, Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur districts attempted to flee the stricken region by bus or train and travel to their family homes.[39] Chennai International Airport was partly reopened for cargo flights on 5 December, with passenger flights scheduled to resume from the following morning.[40] By 6 December, rescue efforts had largely concluded and relief efforts intensified, with the Chennai Corporation beginning to disburse relief packages.[41] Mobile, banking and power services were gradually restored; fuel and food supplies were reaching their destinations, the airport had fully reopened and rail services slowly resumed. Many city neighbourhoods, however, remained flooded with some lacking basic necessities due to the uncoordinated distribution of relief materials. With the city slowly beginning to recover, state and national health officials remained watchful against disease outbreaks, warning that conditions were right for epidemics of water-borne illnesses to occur.[42] Chennai Corporation officials reported at least 57,000 homes in the city had suffered structural damage, mostly those of working class. State housing boards said they would conduct safety inspections of both public and residential buildings.[43] After being closed for the past month, schools and colleges across the affected districts began to reopen from 14 December.[44] Relief operations were largely wound up by 19 December.[45] South of Chennai, heavy rains and flooding persisted into the second week of December. In Kancheepuram district, Chengalpattu, kanchipuram, Nandivaram- Guduvanchery, Perungalathur, Tambaram, Mudichur and Anakaputhur were inundated in floodwaters up to 7 metres deep by 5 December, which washed away roads and severed rail links; 98 people from the district were reported to have died.[46] During 4\u20135 December, parts of Villupuram and Tiruvarur districts received up to 10 centimetres of rain, while some towns in Cuddalore district saw up to nine centimetres.[47] Flood alerts were broadcast to 12 villages in the neighbourhood of the Tirumurthy dam in Tirupur district on 7 December, as the dam was likely to reach capacity within two days; the residents of those villages were urged to evacuate.[48] Due to rainfall in Tirunelveli district, all of its dams had reached or were approaching full capacity by 7 December, forcing local authorities to discharge thousands of cusecs of water from reservoirs and causing the Thamirabarani River to reach flood stage.[49] Torrential rains inundated hundreds of acres of paddy fields in Thanjavur, Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam districts, and caused residential areas to flood by 8 December. Large parts of Thanjavur city were marooned by rising waters, while several houses collapsed under the brunt of rainfall in Kumbakonam and Veppathoor.[50] After Chennai district, Cuddalore district was among those most severely affected by the flooding. Six of the district's 13 blocks suffered extensive damage during the floods in November.[51] The resumption of heavy rainfall from 1 December again inundated the Cuddalore municipality and the district, displacing tens of thousands of people.[52] Rains continued through 9 December.[53] Despite the state government and individuals sending rescue teams and tonnes of relief materials to the district, thousands of those affected continued to lack basic supplies due to inadequate distribution efforts; this resulted in several relief lorries being stopped and looted by survivors.[53][54] Large swaths of Cuddalore city and the district remained inundated as of 10 December, with thousands of residents marooned by floodwaters and over 60,000 hectares of farmland inundated; over 30,000 people had been evacuated to relief camps.[53][55] The state government reported preliminary flood damages of \u20b984.81 billion (US$1\u00a0billion), and requested \u20b920 billion (US$240\u00a0million) for immediate relief efforts.[14] On 5 December, a senior state revenue official said the state's official estimates of flood-related losses in November alone exceeded \u20b998 billion (US$1\u00a0billion); he added the catastrophic flooding thus far in December could escalate total losses to well over \u20b91,000 billion (US$12\u00a0billion).[7] On 9 December, Chief Minister Jayalalithaa wrote to Prime Minister Modi, requesting him to immediately declare the \"unprecedented, catastrophic and cataclysmic\" flooding as a \"national calamity.\"[56] Aon Benfield, a major UK-based reinsurance broker, classified the floods as the costliest to have occurred in 2015, and the eight-costliest natural disaster of the year.[18] On 13 December, the state government requested the central government to release a total of \u20b9102.50\u00a0billion (US$1.53\u00a0billion) towards relief and rehabilitation efforts, including \u20b950 billion (US$599\u00a0million) for a housing project to accommodate 50,000 displaced people, \u20b97.5 billion (US$90\u00a0million) to rehouse another 50,000 people who had formerly lived in huts destroyed by the floods and \u20b945 billion (US$539\u00a0million) to rebuild damaged roads, drains, tap water pipes and sewers in urban localities.[57] On 22 December, the government further revised its estimates, requesting \u20b9174315.1\u00a0million (US$2.63\u00a0billion) in addition to the \u20b984.81\u00a0billion previously requested for the flood damage sustained in November, for a total of \u20b9259125.1\u00a0million (US$3.91\u00a0billion).[9] In January 2016, the state government issued a detailed final statement which said 421 people in Tamil Nadu had died of flood-related causes between 28 October, when the first monsoonal rains had arrived in earnest, through 31 December;[note 1][1][3][4][6][32][58][59] however, relief workers alone had reported hundreds more who were missing, and various police reports had placed the death toll in the Chennai region alone at over 500 as of mid-December. Chennai-area morgues and crematoria were reported to have been \"piled up\" with bodies as floodwaters began receding in the second week of December, while all of the still-functioning area cemeteries had recorded over three times the usual number of burials, up from a normal 25\u201330 burials per week.[2][58] According to the Tamil Nadu government, 3042,000 (3.042\u00a0million) families had suffered total or partial damage to their dwellings. 3,8276.8\u00a0million hectares of crops had been lost due to flooding, including over 347,000 hectares of agricultural crops and 35,471 hectares of horticultural crops; roughly 98,000 livestock animals and poultry had died.[1] On 25 April 2018, the skeleton of a man reported missing during the floods was discovered in the Chennai neighbourhood of Peerkankaranai near Tambaram, though a definitive identification could not be made immediately.[60]"

        "header": "Puducherry",
        "content": "Puducherry sustained relatively minor damage in November as the depression largely remained offshore; some trees were downed and several banana and sugarcane plantations at Kuttchipalayam were severely damaged.[61] Puducherry reported receiving 55.7\u00a0mm of rainfall over the 24-hour period from 14 to 15 November. Water entered several houses in low-lying areas, while three houses collapsed in Uppalam. Mudaliarpet, parts of Rainbow Nagar, Muthialpet, Krishna Nagar and Lawspet Main Road were inundated, along with portions of roadways near Karuvadikkuppam and the Shivaji statue on the ECR, causing traffic problems. Several roads were badly damaged, hindering motorists, while some members of the public took the initiative to begin clearing areas of water without directions from the government. Chief Minister N Rangasamy stated the official machinery had been readied in preparation for any flooding, while local administration officials closed all schools and colleges in Puducherry and Karaikal districts on 16 November, anticipating further rainfall.[62] On 24 November, it was reported over 4800 hectares of farmland had been flooded, though it remained too early to determine the extent of crop damage.[63] On 26 November, the union territorial government submitted a preliminary estimate of damages to the central government, requesting it to release an initial \u20b91.82 billion (US$22\u00a0million) for relief; based on preliminary estimates, Chief Minister Rangasamy reported losses as follows: public works (\u20b9120.89 crore (US$14\u00a0million)), municipal administration (\u20b9487 million (US$6\u00a0million)), agriculture (\u20b972 million (US$862,696)),\npower (\u20b931.4 million (US$376,231)), revenue (\u20b924.8 million (US$297,151)) and animal husbandry (\u20b9719,000 (US$8,600)).[15] On 1 December, Rangasamy requested an additional \u20b91 billion (US$12\u00a0million) for \"immediate interim relief\".[64] At the start of December, Puducherry reported receiving 83.4 centimetres of rain during November alone, as opposed to a normal average of 76.7 centimetres during the entire north-east monsoonal period from October to December.[65] Since rain-related damage had continued even after the submission of a report on the earlier flooding in November, and also after the recent visit of a central government survey team, on 4 December the Puducherry government said it would submit a supplementary report assessing additional damages and requesting \u20b91.5 billion (US$18\u00a0million) for a total relief-fund requirement of \u20b93.33 billion (US$40\u00a0million).[11] From 1 December, torrential rains again inundated portions of the union territory. Puducherry recorded 22\u00a0cm of rainfall over a 24-hour period, making it the wettest December day ever. Heavy rain beginning on the evening of 4 December flooded parts of Puducherry, continuing through the following morning. According to the Regional Meteorological Centre, Chennai, Puducherry received nine centimetres of rain during this period. Puducherry District Collector D.Manikandan, said the rainfall had been \"unprecedented in Puducherry, and the volume has been the highest [since] 1975.\" The administration said that 618 houses had been damaged thus far and over 2,000 people evacuated to safe places. On 5 December, the Karaikal region recorded 110 centimetres of rainfall since the start of the north-east monsoon.[47] In Karaikal, an enclave of Puducherry, nearly 50 houses were damaged due to heavy rain and flooding.[47] On 5 December, the territorial government announced that nearly 9,000 hectares of paddy fields had been damaged by torrential rainfall, including 4,420 hectares of paddy fields in Puducherry,4,248.34 hectares in Karaikal and 287.15 hectares in Yanam. The government also reported 1,544 hectares of sugarcane fields under cultivation had been damaged, along with 297.73 hectares of plantains, 231.9 hectares of tapioca and related tubers, 168.10 hectares of vegetable fields and eight hectares under betel-leaf cultivation. Proposed compensation rates would be as follows: \u20b950,000 (US$599) per hectare for betel-leaf losses, \u20b935,000 (US$419) per hectare for plantains, \u20b920,000 (US$240) per hectare for paddy fields and \u20b915,000 (US$180) per hectare for losses of vegetables, tapioca, tubers and sugercane. Compensation scales had also been set for losses of cotton, lentils and flowers.[66] G. Sundaramurthy, a 62-year-old man in Ariyankuppam, was killed on 9 November when a mud wall collapsed, while Anandan, a 53-year-old man in Ouppalam, was subsequently reported to have died because of the rain.[61][67] On 17 November, S. Chellammal, a 72-year-old woman in Karayamputhur, was killed by the collapse of a rain-weakened mud wall.[68][69]"

        "content": "The season began on 9 November, with a Depression hitting Tamil Nadu. Rainfall begin pour in the places of Nellore and Chittoor district. Tirumala getting a heavy rainfall of 309mm along with Tirupathi with 148mm in 24 hours triggered a flood situation in Chittoor District. Coastal places of Tada recorded 114mm of rainfall on the same day. There were 3\u20134 good spells of rain between 9th and 15th. As rainfall began in Andhra Pradesh on 16 November, local authorities closed schools in Nellore district. Heavy rain of about 27\u00a0cm pounded the temple town of Tirupathi. Thousands of lakes and ponds across the district overflowed, with breaches reported in some areas. At Sri Kalahasti, a pilgrimage centre in the region, the Swarnamukhi River was reported to be rising. Three people were swept away by floodwaters in Chittoor district, and water entered some houses. Roads were damaged in many parts of Nellore district, disrupting transport services. Andhra Pradesh chief minister Chandrababu Naidu held a teleconference with the district collectors of affected districts and asked disaster response personnel to be on alert.[70] Heavy rainfall in Nellore, Chittoor and Kadapa districts flooded villages and disrupted transport networks. It was estimated by 18 November that at least 500\u00a0km of roads had been damaged by flooding, with the Chennai\u2013Kolkata highway damaged the previous day and stranding hundreds of vehicles and motorists; officials said it would take days to restore the link. As in Tamil Nadu, the Southern Railway diverted or cancelled numerous trains.[71] Over 10,000 lorry drivers were stranded on the Tada-Kavali national highway in Nellore district; district officers established 61 relief camps in the flood-affected areas and deputed senior IAS officers to oversee the relief operations in Gudur, Naidupet and Atmakur divisions, respectively. Up to 500 tanks were breached as rivers overflowed, forcing the administration to suspend rescue operations in marooned villages, though administrators supplied 10,000 food and water packets through the rail network, which managed to operate some trains, while the APSRTC continued to run bus services to less-flooded areas such as Atmakuru, Udayagiri, Marripadu and Seetharampuram.[72] In Kadapa district, the rains tapered off by 18 November; preliminary estimates were that the district had sustained about \u20b9290 million (US$3\u00a0million) of agricultural losses. Horticulture farms at Pendlimerry, Chintakommadinne, Siddhavatam and Khajipet mandals were also destroyed by the rain. Other heavy agricultural losses were reported in Rayalaseema, Nellore, Prakasam, East and West Godavari districts; the chief minister asked agriculture department officials to drain fields at the earliest in order to save crops.[73] In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 19 November, Chief Minister Naidu reported preliminary estimates of flood-related damage in Andhra Pradesh included \u20b912.5 billion (US$150\u00a0million) worth of agricultural-related damages and \u20b910.25 billion (US$123\u00a0million) of damage to infrastructure; he requested central authorities to release \u20b910 billion (US$120\u00a0million) for immediate relief efforts.[16] According to Naidu, Nellore district was the most seriously affected, reporting an estimated \u20b913.95 billion (US$167\u00a0million) worth of losses, followed by Chittoor district, which reported losses of \u20b98.18 billion (US$98\u00a0million). Kadapa district was also seriously affected, with extensive crop damage reported in East and West Godavari districts and a lesser scale of damage in Anantapur, Prakasam and Krishna districts.[16] The aquaculture industry in Nellore district was catastrophically affected, with over 8000 hectares of fish and prawn ponds destroyed, at an estimated loss of \u20b92.5 billion (US$30\u00a0million).[74] On 2 December, Thota Narasimham, an MP from the Telugu Desam Party, reported in the Lok Sabha that preliminary losses in the state roughly totalled \u20b938.19 billion (US$458\u00a0million).[75] Heavy rains resumed on 2 December, adding to the devastation in Nellore and Chittoor districts, with more rains forecast over the ensuing days; Chittoor district received between 50 and 160\u00a0mm of rainfall. Chief Minister Naidu directed district officials and health, water and sanitation officers to organise water purification and set up medical relief camps.[76] On 4 December, Andhra Pradesh Home Minister Nimmakayala Chinarajappa reported heavy infrastructural losses in Nellore and Chittoor districts, with heavy agricultural losses in Godavari district; he added that over 500,000 acres of standing crops had been destroyed, and that the state government had requested \u20b937.5 billion (US$449\u00a0million) in immediate relief funds from the central government.[5] At the start of December, Chittoor district recorded 65.1\u00a0cm of rain over the monsoonal season thus far, as opposed to a normal 16.1\u00a0cm of rainfall. 2,429 hectares of crops in the district were damaged, including 1,790 hectares of paddy that had been submerged. A further 3,039 hectares of horticultural crops were also damaged.[77] After a central government survey team completed an assessment of the flood-hit districts on 12 December, the state government submitted a final revised estimate of damages from the November and December floods; the memorandum stated that the flooding had caused \u20b949.6 billion (US$594\u00a0million) worth of damages and losses.[10] As of 4 December 81 people were reported to have been killed by flooding in the state,[5][6][16] while over 14,000 people had been evacuated to relief camps in Nellore and Chittoor districts.[78]"

        "content": "Supplies of basic necessities, including milk, water, and vegetables, were affected due to logistical difficulties. During the December floods in Chennai and the adjoining areas, milk packets sold for \u20b9100 (US$1.20), five times more than their usual cost. Water bottles and cans were sold at prices between \u20b9100 (US$1.20) to \u20b9150 (US$1.80). Vegetables were sold at \u20b96 to \u20b910 over and above their normal average cost at the wholesale level.[79] Apart from basic necessities, fuel supplies, and travel were greatly affected, especially in Chennai.[80] Numerous accounts of price-gouging were reported; airfares to and from for most parts of South India peaked to almost 10 times over their normal price. A round trip fare from Mumbai or New Delhi to Bangalore, Karnataka (the nearest accessible city to Chennai, Tamil Nadu) was sold by airlines like Jet Airways at rates of almost \u20b9100,000 (US$1,200), a trip which would have ordinarily cost between \u20b910,000 (US$120) to \u20b920,000 (US$240).[81] Apart from airfares in South India, airfares also increased for other connections within the country, due to disruptions in rail services.[82] In response, the Ministry of Civil Aviation warned companies against taking advantage of the situation to overcharge and that it would intervene if any of the passenger flight carriers did so.

Relief work was initially intended to be mostly concentrated in the three districts of Kanchipuram, Villupuram and Thiruvallur, with efforts to widen following further assessments.[169]"

Social media sites were also used extensively to relay information about flooded areas, rescue agencies and food and relief centers. Chennai residents set up a temporary website to crowd source information about people needing help and about those who were ready to help. Celebrities such as RJ Balaji, actor Siddharth and Chinmayi actively participated in the relief process by using social media to co-ordinate aid and gather information.[173] Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu visited and distributed relief materials to the flood victims at Tambaram.[174] A pilot of the Crisis Response Volunteers (CRV) program was kicked of by the State Disaster Management Agency.[175] Disaster management experts from Survival Instincts organized Chennai into grids that are capable of response, rescue and relief operations, independently.[176] College students and corporate members were scheduled into a training regimen that consisted of survival skills, aquatic rescue, emergency medical response, relief warehousing, and essential-material transportation.[177] Skype announced that it would offer free international calls to landlines and mobiles in Tamil Nadu for \"the next few days\", starting 3 December 2015.[178][179] Facebook activated its \"safety check\" feature to allow Chennai residents to let friends know they were safe, while Google posted a link on its homepage called \"Resources for the Chennai Floods\", providing details about relief camps and updates on the situation in the city; it also enabled its Crisis Response tool.[179][180] Several Twitter hashtags including #ChennaiFloods, #ChennaiRains and #PrayForChennai were among the top trending hashtags across Twitter in India.[180] Telecom major Airtel announced loan credit of \u20b930 (36\u00a2\u00a0US) and free benefits of calls and 50 MB of data. Other telecom operators including Vodafone, Aircel, and Reliance Communications also offered free benefits to customers. Indian real estate portal Commonfloor.com created links on its company website for people who need shelter or want to offer shelter.[181] Mobile healthcare startup DocsApp provided free consultation with specialist doctors via mobile.[182] People helped create online spreadsheets documenting possible shelters and a crowd-sourced map on 27\u201328 November to document inundated neighbourhoods and streets in Chennai.[183] Outside India, many members of the Indian and Tamil diaspora sent non-perishable food, clothes, bedding and relief funds from countries including Malaysia, Singapore, the UAE, Mexico and the United States.[184] Tamil and Indian communities across the United States organised dozens of relief and fundraising drives in over 50 cities, raising roughly \u20b9650 million (US$8\u00a0million) in donations by the second week of December.[185] Many NGOs sent tonnes of food, bedding, clothing and relief materials.[186] Companies including Ola Cabs, Paytm, Practo and Zomato also aided in the relief efforts.[179][187][188] Nestl\u00e9, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, ITC, MTR, Britannia and Parle contributed thousands of instant meals, boxes of biscuits and 1-litre water bottles, along with tonnes of milk products and coffee; other major corporations, including Hyundai and Hindustan Unilever, donated vehicles and hundreds of thousands of food and medicine packets and actively aided with rescue efforts across the state.[189][190] Hyundai India donated \u20b920 million (US$239,638) to the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister's Relief fund; U.S. information technology multinational Cognizant made a direct donation of \u20b9650 million (US$8\u00a0million) to the relief fund and various Chennai-based NGOs, while contributing a further \u20b91.95 billion (US$23\u00a0million) towards the long-term recovery efforts of staff and business partners.[191][192] Several notable actors donated towards relief efforts, including: Vijay (\u20b950 million (US$599,095)), Rajinikanth (\u20b91 million (US$11,982)), Raghava Lawrence (\u20b910 million (US$119,819)), Ajith Kumar (\u20b96 million (US$71,891)), Shah Rukh Khan (\u20b910 million (US$119,819)).,[193] Allu Arjun (\u20b92.5 million (US$29,955)), Suriya and Karthi (\u20b92.5 million (US$29,955)), Vishal (\u20b91 million (US$11,982)), Dhanush (\u20b9500,000 (US$6,000)), Varun Tej (\u20b9300,000 (US$3,600)) and Sai Dharam Tej (\u20b9300,000 (US$3,600), in food and medicines).[194] Telugu actors, including Ravi Teja, N. T. Rama Rao Jr., Mahesh Babu, Pawan Kalyan, Prabhas, and Rana Daggubati donated a further \u20b93 million (US$35,946),[195] Actress Shriya Saran donated medical supplies to the affected regions in Chennai while also giving means for anyone to contribute supplies through her foundation Shree Spandana.[196][197][198][199][200] Saina Nehwal and Dipika Pallikal announced a donation of \u20b9200,000 (US$2,400) each for the flood victims.[201] Retired Sri Lankan cricketers Kumar Sangakkara and Muttiah Muralitharan donated \u20b96.698 lakh (US$8,025) and \u20b91 crore (US$119,819) respectively while Indian cricketer M.S.

        "content": "By the end of December 2015, most hospitals in Chennai had wholly or partially restored services.[207] State health authorities in Tamil Nadu reported post-flooding sanitation efforts had been successful, and that there had not been any flood-related outbreaks of disease.[208] While floodwaters had largely receded by 19 December, areas of stagnant water covered parts of Tamil Nadu into January 2016, notably around Cuddalore and Tuticorin. Central government survey teams conducted studies on the extent on the flooding in early January.[209] From 29 December 2015, the Tamil Nadu state government began a massive slum clearance programme, demolishing dozens of illegally constructed dwellings in the Saidapet area of Chennai. Located along the banks of the Adyar River, the area had been among those worst affected by the floods. The residents were rehoused in government housing being built in Okkiyam Thoraipakkam and Perumbakkam. The government further announced that the rehoused residents would receive an allowance of \u20b930,000 (US$359) a year to help them resettle. Medical care would be arranged, children would be enrolled in schools and vocational training would be provided for job-seekers.[210] Despite voicing concern over their ability to find new jobs, many of those resettled expressed satisfaction with the new flats.[211] By March 2016, 4,100 families who had lived in the area had been resettled, and the city corporation had cleared away hundreds of illegally encroaching constructions, widening the Adyar River in Saidapet to 220 metres from its previous 50-metre width.[212] The Chennai Corporation said civic construction projects totalling \u20b94 billion (US$48\u00a0million) and halted by the floods would resume in earnest, and would be completed by 29 February 2016. The corporation also announced that damaged roads would quickly be re-paved and previously shelved storm drain projects would resume.[213] By February 2016, repair work on the damaged boundary walls at Chennai International Airport had largely been completed. Based on the findings of a preliminary report submitted by an IIT-Madras research team, the Airports Authority of India (AAI) announced plans to conduct a full study of the causes of excessive flooding at the airport, along with plans to implement a comprehensive flood-management system; the study was expected to be completed by the end of 2016.[214] In March 2016, Chennai's Water Resources Department began work to revitalise and repair reservoirs in Poondi, Cholavaram, Red Hills and Chembarambakkam. The project would include work to strengthen bunds, install flood warning systems and repair sluice gates; it was scheduled to be completed by the end of 2016, at a cost of \u20b9130 million (US$2\u00a0million). Local NGOs and hydrology experts emphasised the continued need for a comprehensive action plan to protect urban water bodies, however.[215] In state legislative assembly elections in May 2016, the AIADMK was returned to power in Tamil Nadu, albeit with a reduced majority. The party lost eight seats to the opposing DMK in Chennai district and a further eight seats elsewhere; its losses were attributed to its perceived failure to properly address the flood crisis.[216] On 16 June, K. Rosaiah, the governor of Tamil Nadu, announced the state government would soon develop comprehensive flood protection plans for Chennai and its surrounding coastal districts; he said the emphasis would be on providing better roads, storm water drains, solid waste management, sewerage management and street lights. The initiatives would be synergised with the Smart Cities Programme and the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation scheme. Funding had also been obtained from the World Bank and from the Asian Development Bank for climate-change impact reduction initiatives, as well as for the restoration of water bodies and tanks.[217] As of July 2016, however, local citizens' groups said no constructive work had been done to rejuvenate local water bodies and that the effects of a similar north-east monsoon would have an equally destructive impact.[218] In August 2016, a parliamentary panel recommended an immediate special relief and rehabilitation package for Tamil Nadu, in \"consonance with the demand of the state.\" Observing a monetary estimate for flood-related damages in the state could total \"thousands of crores\", the panel's recommendations included a crackdown on criminals involved in illegal construction, a swift removal of illegal encroachments from flood channels and riverbeds, the preparation of a calamity map of all important cities and including \"standard vulnerability indices\", and a continued level of high vigilance by central and state authorities, notably by the Home Affairs Ministry and the National Disaster Management Authority.[219] In response to harsh criticism of a severe lack of transparency and co-ordination during the crisis, the Tamil Nadu government developed a comprehensive disaster response plan, which was successfully implemented when Cyclone Vardah struck the state in December 2016; the plan effectively coordinated local, state and national relief efforts during and after the cyclone.[220] In February 2017, the Tamil Nadu government announced plans to desilt 12 waterbodies in Chennai at a cost of \u20b9140 million (US$2\u00a0million).[221] In April, the Chennai city corporation began the process of mechanically desilting the city's canals and drains using imported recyclers and robotic excavators.[222] Elsewhere in Tamil Nadu, 49 projects in Kancheepuram district to reclaim, revive and strengthen bunds and waterbodies were reported to be nearing completion, at a cost of \u20b947.65 million (US$570,937).[223] In May 2017, the Tamil Nadu government inaugurated several flood protection and dam construction and rebuilding projects in Cuddalore district, which had been one of the worst-affected districts during the floods; the projects were estimated to cost \u20b91.4 billion (US$17\u00a0million).[224] In June, representatives of the Chennai Water Resources Department said the department was developing an eight-year, \u20b912 billion (US$144\u00a0million) \"master plan\" to restore 18 major waterbodies in the Chennai metropolitan area.[225]"

Unless you allow the drains to flow freely to the sea, water will be clogged and that is what has unfortunately happened.\"[226] Sunita Narain, the director of the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) think tank, said the unprecedented floods in the Chennai metropolitan region were the direct result of unregulated urbanisation. According to Narain, \"our urban sprawls such as Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, Chennai, Srinagar, etc., have not paid adequate attention to the natural water bodies that exist in them. In Chennai, each of its lakes has a natural flood discharge channel which drains the spillover. But we have built over many of these water bodies, blocking the smooth flow of water. We have forgotten the art of drainage. We only see land for buildings, not for water.\"[227] According to research conducted by CSE, Chennai had over 600 lakes in the 1980s, but a master plan published in 2008 showed only a fraction of them to be in a healthy condition. State records have shown the total area of 19 major lakes shrank from 1,130 hectares in the 1980s to around 645 hectares in the early 2000s, reducing their storage capacity.[227]"

The drains themselves were reported to have been shoddily built and improperly designed.[228] Drains carrying surplus water from tanks to other wetlands had also been encroached upon, while city storm water drains were clogged and required immediate desilting. Chennai has only 855\u00a0km of stormwater drains against 2,847\u00a0km of urban roads, resulting in flooding after even a marginally heavy downpour.[227] A 2015 CAG report revealed that a diversion channel from the Buckingham canal near Okkiyum Maduvu to the sea (a drain project under the JNNURM scheme) could have saved South Chennai from flooding; the government, however, dropped the \u20b91\u00a0billion scheme, which, had it been completed, would have drained floodwater from southern neighbourhood at a rate of 3,500 cubic feet per second. The 2015 CAG report said the defective planning of flood control projects caused delays and increased costs, defeating the objective of the scheme. \"The fact is that alleviation of inundation of flood water in Chennai city remains largely unachieved\", it said.[229]"

Regarding the current floods, he said the United Nations would not deem the evidence conclusive enough to be able to reach a judgment. \"One thing is sure, climate change brings such disasters more frequently. So [the] frequency, [the] ferocity of untimely rains increases, [along with] erratic monsoons, droughts and floods; all these are caused [by climate change].\" he said.[226] He subsequently clarified his position on the Tamil Nadu floods in a written statement addressed to the Rajya Sabha. According to Javadekar, the recent extreme rainfall across the region was \"highly localised\" and could not be definitively attributed to the effects of climate-change. \"[The] extreme rainfall that occurred over [the] coastal districts of Tamil Nadu is part of the natural variability of the Indian monsoon system. Although some studies have reported an increase in frequency and intensity of extremes in rainfall during the past 40\u201350 years, their attribution to global warming is not established.\" Javadekar said the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and local assessments have indicated that extreme rainfall events will likely increase in frequency by the end of the 21st century.[230] In 2006, a study by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) in Pune showed extreme precipitation events had increased in frequency and intensity in India over the period from 1950 to the 2000s; while CSE's climate change experts recommend detailed attribution studies to establish more links between the Chennai floods and climate change, they did state that existing scientific studies establish a possible connection.[227]"

In the chief minister's state assembly constituency of Radhakrishnan Nagar, flood victims heckled senior ministers Natham Viswanathan, Sellur Raju and Gokul Indira following their visit on 4 December, forcing them to make a hasty retreat. At a subsequent press conference, Tamil Nadu Power Minister Natham Viswanathan and chief secretary Gnanadesikan claimed that relief and rescue work were in full swing and \"extraordinary\". Viswanathan deflected opposition criticism of relief efforts as politically motivated, in light of upcoming assembly elections. He claimed people in even the worst-affected localities had refused to leave their homes and had accepted only food relief from official agencies.[231] Following a statement by Chief Minister Jayalalithaa that the flooding had been the result of exceptional rainfall, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) issued a strong criticism on 16 November, stating that the flooding in Chennai could have been averted if local and state officials had taken strong precautions. The state BJP president, Tamilisai Soundararajan, said: \"Even if it was six months of rain on a single day, the administration should have been ready to tackle it.\" Tamilisai mentioned the cleaning and de-silting of the Cooum River would allow it to divert large amounts of runoff during the monsoons.[232] In North Chennai area, residents staged protests and criticised the government for its lack of any rescue response in their locality.[38] In Puducherry, AIADMK legislator A Anbazhagan said that the government was not providing relief to affected people and had not taken any precautions, contrary to the government's assurances; he added the administration failed to promptly mobilise various essential departments and urged the territorial administration to carefully prepare a report to ensure delivery of relief to those affected.[67] Jet Skis and SUV vehicles were used in places like Anna Nagar to aid the people in mobility due to the high water level. Following numerous complaints regarding the Tamil Nadu state government's lack of relief effort co-ordination, a public-interest litigation petition was filed in the Madras High Court; on 11 December, Chief Justice S.K. Kaul and Justice Puspha Sathyanarayana heard the petition and converted it to suo moto proceedings. The justices directed the state government to report its relief-effort co-ordination measures to the court by 16 December.[233] After the Tamil Nadu government announced a flood-relief package on 7 December, many flood survivors criticised it as meagre and \"insulting.\" DMK leader M.K. Stalin said the state's financial assistance of \u20b95,000 (US$60) for each displaced family \"would not be of much help to the people.\"[234] A survey conducted in the worst-affected districts of Chennai by a group of volunteer organisations between 15 and 30 December found that most families had lost their sources of livelihood, and that the amount of financial assistance was insufficient. Lacking ration cards, migrant workers were the worst off, as they were ineligible for any assistance. Many residents in those areas complained the authorities had insufficiently taken measures to prepare for the floods.[235] The National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights (NCDHR) and the Social Awareness Society for Youths (SASY) surveyed 8,400 Dalit and non-Dalit families in 20 villages in the Cuddalore region in December 2015 and found that around 90 percent of the houses, livestock and crops destroyed in the floods belonged to Dalit families, who made up the majority of flood-displaced people. The final report alleged dominant caste people blocked access to clean water, medicines; official relief measures were concentrated in more accessible upper-caste neighbourhoods. On average, a majority of Dalit settlements were located only 1.5\u00a0km from rivers, canals and the sea and most primary health centres were located in dominant caste neighbourhoods and were, on average, three km from Dalit settlements.[236]"

        "content": "The nexus of the Bihar flood is the Kosi River's immense alluvial fan, extending some 185\u00a0km from the river's exit from the Himalayas and foothills in Nepal, down to its confluence with the Ganges in Bihar. The laws of geology and physics cause rivers to course back and forth across such fans in ephemeral channels lasting decades at most, but for flood control reasons man-made embankments endeavored to contain the Koshi within a channel along its fan's western edge.  On 18 August, heavy monsoon rains caused the river to break out of this channel.  It started flowing through an old channel much further east, inundating cropland and towns and villages with 1.2 million inhabitants, mostly in Bihar. Chief Minister of Bihar Nitish Kumar met India Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to seek his help in dealing with the \"catastrophe\".[9][10] The worst affected districts included Supaul, Madhepura, north Bhagalpur, Araria, Purnia (all by the Kosi) and West Champaran (by Gandak). Relief work was carried with Indian Air Force helicopters dropping relief materials in the worst hit districts.[9] The district magistrate of Madhepura has ordered the inhabitants of the town of Madhepura to evacuate because the water level continued to rise. Relief work was carried with Indian Air Force helicopters dropping relief materials (including 600 food packets per day) from Purnia in the worst hit districts where nearly two million persons were entrapped.[9]\nIt is not possible to assess the magnitude of deaths or destruction, because the affected areas are totally inaccessible. Even mobile phones had stopped working, because entrapped persons cannot get their batteries charged. 150 persons were washed away in a single incident (Dainik Hindustan, Darbhanga edition). Another report says 42 people have died in the flood in Bihar.[11] The Government of Bihar has constituted a technical committee, headed by retired engineer-in-chief of the water resource department, Nilendu Sanyal, to manage the restoration work and closure of the breach in the East Koshi afflux embankment.[11] Indian authorities were working to prevent further widening of the breach and channels would be dug to direct the water back to the main river bed.[12] However, Dainik Hindustan (Darbhanga edition) reported on Aug 28 that Indian officials were chased away by anti-social elements from the breach site in Nepal. Nepal's Defence Minister has made a statement that Nepal will repair the breach on its own, although it was not made clear when this work will be started. Dainik Hindustan (Darbhanga edition) later sent its reporter to the site of the Kushaha breach, who reported with photographs on Sep 5 that all earlier claims by government officials of repairing the breach and of Nepalis chasing away Indian officials were utterly false reports by Indian officials, because there were thick forests on the embankment and it was not possible to reach the site before the end of August. Forest on the embankment proves that these parts of Kosi embankments were not even visited for decades. Its maintenance was the responsibility of Indian, especially Bihar's officials. The life of these embankments elapsed over two decades ago, but no effort was taken to even survey their conditions, although the Bihar government spends huge sums on the maintenance of embankments each year. A high-level Government of Nepal team that inspected areas devastated by the flood in the Koshi River has held India responsible for the havoc. Media reports stated The devastation took place as the Indian side did not carry out repair and maintenance work on the Kosi barrage and the embankment along the river, thereby violating the Nepal-India Koshi agreement. As per the bilateral agreement of 1954[13][14] India is entirely responsible for repair and maintenance work and operation of the barrage.[15] There was no effort by Indian officials to repair the breach in time, although the Kosi took 15 days to make the breach. On the other hand, Indian engineers say that anti-social elements in Nepal did not allow them to repair the embankment (Dainik Hindustan, Darbhanga edition, Aug 28). These so-called \"anti-social\" elements are the victims of the Kosi embankments who have been forced to bear tsunami-like floods every year;[16] they are happy that the river wants to change its course. Kosi embankments are designed to contain the Kosi in the channel of the Tilyuga River, while the old course of the Kosi lies far to the east in Purnia district. Later, Dainik Hindustan reported on Sep 5 that Indian officials could not reach the site of breach as there were forests on the embankment which were cleared in early September, hence Indian officials were lying about being prevented to repair the breach: they had not visited the site for decades due to forests in the way. The New York Times reported that it is the worst flood in the area in 50 years, prompting Manmohan Singh to declare a \u201cnational calamity\u201d on 28 August. The government earmarked US$230 million in aid for the region.[17] The Indian Army, National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and non-governmental organizations[18] operated the biggest flood rescue operation in India in more than 50 years. Death tolls rose from Indian floods as more than 65 people had been killed in monsoon rains.[19] Villagers ate raw rice and flour mixed with polluted water in Bihar, amid hunger and diseases. Supaul district was the worst-hit by floods and surging waters swamped 1,000 square kilometres (250,000 acres) of farmlands, destroying wheat and paddy crops.[20]"

Kaziranga National Park, which has the highest density of rhinos in the world, was 90% submerged in water. Also, Pobitra national park in Assam was flooded. Two rhinos have died in these floods. A tiger has killed one rhino calf. In addition, four deer and one elephant have also failed to survive.\nThe flood situation has affected estimated 2.1 million people and caused 24 deaths so far. Worst affected districts are Dhubri, Jorhat, Kamrup, Lakhimpur, Dhemaji and Morigaon. Thousands of people are staying in makeshift shelters with the government providing food and other essentials to the displaced people, besides healthcare facilities.[21] Indian officials say that the flooding situation could cause an epidemic, because refugees are consuming unclean water and food in shelters.[22] Breaches in embankments have caused these floods in Assam. Four embankments on the Puthimari River, one constructed just three months ago, were breached causing the calamity.[23] Waters have breached embankments at total 54 vital locations,[21] and water levels are dangerously high in about 10 points.[22] The Irish government is sending \u20ac350,000 (Rs. 22.3 million) in aid to the victims of the floods.[24] Eastern Orissa state and most populous northern state Uttar Pradesh were flooded heavily causing more than 150 deaths from September 19 to September 22.[25] Army has reached in UP to rescue at least a quarter million people and food packets have been supplied to the rescued.[26]"

The storm originated from two different systems around the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean on June 16. The systems merged into trough while a circulation began to form off the coast of Florida on June 18. The depression made landfall in Florida and strengthened into a storm over land. The storm entered the Atlantic Ocean and headed to the northeast, becoming extratropical on June 20 near Newfoundland. The storm was the only system of 1982 to affect the eastern half of the United States, and it caused three fatalities and caused $10\u00a0million in damage (1982\u00a0USD, $21\u00a0million 2007\u00a0USD)."

This occurrence is unusual, but not unique, as Subtropical Storm One in the 1974 season formed in similar pattern.[1] A reconnaissance flight on June 17 reported that there appeared to be multiple transient circulations at the surface, but no well-defined center.[2] The first disturbance can be traced back to June 15 in the northwest Caribbean. The disturbance moved north, along with a low-pressure area that formed over the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. A trough merged with the low-pressure area creating an even stronger trough over the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Conditions in the Gulf of Mexico were favorable for tropical storm formation. Some severe weather had been occurring over the Florida Peninsula as early as June 16, as the fringes of disturbance moved across the Florida Straits and over the Peninsula.[2] A circulation began to form on June 18 in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, prompting gale warnings.[3] It was declared Subtropical Depression One the same day. The depression made landfall on the morning of June 18 just north of Spring Hill, Florida and gained subtropical storm status over land. The storm was classified as Subtropical Storm One by the National Hurricane Center, as the rule was not to name subtropical storms. The subtropical storm moved to the northeast and crossed the Outer Banks of North Carolina on June 19. Even though the minimum central pressures remained low, the circulation expanded and became distorted. The subtropical storm peaked at 70\u00a0mph winds (110\u00a0km/h) on June 18, but did not reach its minimum pressure until June 20, when it dropped to 984\u00a0mbar (29.07\u00a0inHg).[4] The subtropical storm was declared an extratropical storm near the Canadian Maritimes, on the same day.[5][6]"

Rainfall peaked at 10.72\u00a0inches (272.28\u00a0mm) in Desoto City, while much of the rest of the state reported between 1\u20135\u00a0inches (25\u2013125\u00a0inches) of precipitation.[10][11] High tides and waves caused flooding and beach erosion from Naples to the Tampa Bay area. Some waterfront buildings suffered damage from undermining including widespread damage of marinas and some boats. Several bulkheads and rock revetments experienced minor damage in Naples and Marco Island. Several man\u2011made dune structures seaward of the Coastal Construction Control Line in Collier County received minor damage at Vanderbilt Beach and Marco Island.[12] Three people were killed in Florida in association with the subtropical storm with a further thirteen people injured. A Brevard County woman died when a canoe overturned and an Orange County child was killed when he was swept into a drainage ditch. 130 families were evacuated a few days after the storm from the Arcadia River area because the Peace River crested above flood stage.[3] The subtropical storm spawned twelve tornadoes across Florida, including at least 2 tornadoes which reached a magnitude of F2 on the Fujita Scale. The first tornado formed in Hendry County on June 18 at 0115\u00a0UTC reaching F2 strength.[13] The third fatality was a man from Hendry County who was killed in his mobile home, which was destroyed by a tornado. A total of twenty-five homes in Florida were destroyed. Total damage in Florida totaled out to $10\u00a0million (1982\u00a0USD, $21\u00a0million 2007\u00a0USD).[3] The storm's effects north of Florida were minor. Rainfall reached up to nine inches (228\u00a0mm) in extreme eastern South Carolina and four inches (101\u00a0mm) in eastern North Carolina. Winds reached 50 miles per hour (80\u00a0km/h) with gusts up to 66 miles per hour (106\u00a0km/h) at the Oak Island Coast Guard Station near Cape Fear, North Carolina and 54 miles per hour (87\u00a0km/h) with gusts of 77 miles per hour (124\u00a0km/h) at the offshore tower at Frying Pan Shoals about forty miles southeast of Cape Fear on June 18 with 70\u00a0mph winds (110\u00a0km/h) the next day. A 68-foot fishing trawler sunk off the coast of Cape Fear in North Carolina from the high waves; no one was killed as the sailors were rescued by the United States Coast Guard on June 19. Flooding was reported with tides of two to three feet in the Carolinas.[3] Rainfall from the subtropical storm reached both states, reaching maximum peaks of up to five inches (127\u00a0mm) on the Georgia coast and seven inches on the Georgia/South Carolina border. Rainfall totaled to about one inch (25\u00a0mm) on the Virginian coast.[11] A ship encountered winds of a minimum tropical storm with gusts as high as a maximum tropical storm.

Parallels are often drawn between the flood waters of these myths and the primeval waters which appear in certain creation myths, as the flood waters are described as a measure for the cleansing of humanity, in preparation for rebirth. Most flood myths also contain a culture hero, who \"represents the human craving for life\".[1] The flood-myth motif occurs in many cultures, including the manvantara-sandhya in Hinduism, Deucalion and Pyrrha in Greek mythology, the Genesis flood narrative, the Mesopotamian flood stories, and the Cheyenne flood story."

        "header": "Mythologies",
        "content": "One example of a flood myth is in the Epic of Gilgamesh. Many scholars believe that this account was copied from the  Akkadian Atra-Hasis,[a] which dates to the 18th century\u00a0BCE.[3][b] In the Gilgamesh flood myth, the highest god, Enlil, decides to destroy the world with a flood because humans have become too noisy. The god Ea, who had created humans out of clay and divine blood, secretly warns the hero Utnapishtim of the impending flood and gives him detailed instructions for building a boat so that life may survive.[5][6] Both the Epic of Gilgamesh and Atra-Hasis are preceded by the similar Eridu Genesis (c.\u20091600 BCE)[7]\u2014the oldest surviving example of such a flood-myth narrative, known from tablets found in the ruins of Nippur in the late 1890s and translated by assyriologist Arno Poebel.[8] Academic Yi Samuel Chen[9] analyzed various texts from the Early Dynastic III Period through to the Old Babylonian Period, and argues that the flood narrative was only added in texts written during the Old Babylonian Period. With regard to the Sumerian King List, observations by experts have always indicated that the portion of the Sumerian King List talking about before the flood differs stylistically  from the King List Proper. Essentially Old Babylonian copies tend to represent a tradition of before the flood apart from the actual King List, whereas the Ur III copy of the King List and the duplicate from the Brockmon collection indicate that the King List Proper once existed independent of mention of the flood and the tradition of before the flood. Essentially, Chen gives evidence to prove that the section of before the flood and references to the flood in the Sumerian King List were all later additions added in during the Old Babylonian Period, as the Sumerian King List went through updates and edits. The flood as a watershed in early history of the world was probably a new historiographical concept emerging in the Mesopotamian literary traditions during the Old Babylonian Period, as evident by the fact that the flood motif did not show up in the Ur III copy and that earliest chronographical sources related to the flood show up in the Old Babylonian Period. Chen also concludes that the name of \"Ziusudra\" as a flood hero and the idea of the flood hinted at by that name in the Old Babylonian Version of \"Instructions of Shuruppak\" are only developments during that Old Babylonian Period, when also the didactic text was updated with information from the burgeoning Antediluvian Tradition.[10] In the Hebrew Genesis (9th century BC), the god Yahweh, who had created man out of the dust of the ground,[11] decides to flood the earth because of the corrupted state of mankind. Yahweh then gives the protagonist, Noah, instructions to build an ark in order to preserve human and animal life. When the ark is completed, Noah, his family, and representatives of all the animals of the earth are called upon to enter the ark. When the destructive flood begins, all life outside of the ark perishes. After the waters recede, all those aboard the ark disembark and have Yahweh's promise that he will never judge the earth with a flood again. Yahweh causes a rainbow to form as the sign of this promise.[12] In Hindu mythology, texts such as the Satapatha Brahmana[13] (c. 6th century BCE)[14] and the Puranas contain the story of a great flood, manvantara-sandhya,[15][16] wherein the Matsya Avatar of the Vishnu warns the first man,  Manu, of the impending flood, and also advises him to build a giant boat.[17][18][19] In Zoroastrian Mazdaism, Ahriman tries to destroy the world with a drought, which Mithra ends by shooting an arrow into a rock, from which a flood springs; one man survives in an ark with his cattle.[20] Norbert Oettinger[who?] argues that the story of Yima and the Vara was originally a flood myth, and the harsh winter was added in due to the dry nature of Eastern Iran, as flood myths did not have as much of an effect as harsh winters. He has argued that the mention of melted water flowing in  Videvdad 2.24 is a remnant of the flood myth, and mentions that the Indian flood myths originally had their protagonist as Yama, but it was changed to Manu later.[21] In Plato's Timaeus, written c.\u2009360 BCE, Timaeus describes a flood myth similar to the earlier versions. In it, the Bronze race of humans angers the high god Zeus with their constant warring. Zeus decides to punish humanity with a flood. The Titan Prometheus, who had created humans from clay, tells the secret plan to Deucalion, advising him to build an ark in order to be saved. After nine nights and days, the water starts receding and the ark lands on a mountain.[22] The Cheyenne, a North American Great Plains tribe, believe in a flood which altered the course of their history, perhaps occurring in the Missouri River Valley.[23]"

Fourteen flood myths refer to a full solar eclipse.[27] According to Masse these indications point to the date May 10, 2807 BC.[28] His hypothesis suggests that a meteor or comet crashed into the Indian Ocean around 3000\u20132800\u00a0BCE, and created the 18-mile (29\u00a0km) undersea Burckle Crater and Fenambosy Chevron, and generated a giant tsunami that flooded coastal lands.[29]"

Similar layers have been recorded at other sites as well, all dating to different periods, which would be consistent with the nature of river avulsions.[32]\nShuruppak in Mesopotamian legend was the city of Uta-napishtim, the king who built a boat to survive the coming flood. The alluvial layer dates from around 2900 BC.[33] The geography of the Mesopotamian area changed considerably with the filling of the Persian Gulf after sea waters rose following the last glacial period. Global sea levels were about 120\u00a0m (390\u00a0ft) lower around 18,000\u00a0BP and rose until 8,000\u00a0BP when they reached current levels, which are now an average 40\u00a0m (130\u00a0ft) above the floor of the Gulf, which was a huge (800\u00a0km \u00d7\u00a0200\u00a0km, 500\u00a0mi \u00d7\u00a0120\u00a0mi) low-lying and fertile region in Mesopotamia, in which human habitation is thought to have been strong around the Gulf Oasis for 100,000 years.

Although the tsunami hit the South Aegean Sea and Crete, it did not affect cities in the mainland of Greece, such as Mycenae, Athens, and Thebes, which continued to prosper, indicating that it had a local rather than a region-wide effect.[37]"

Donnelly in his book Ragnarok: The Age of Fire and Gravel (1883), which followed his better-known book Atlantis: The Antediluvian World (1882). In Ragnarok, Donnelly argued that an enormous comet struck the Earth around 6,000 BCE to 9,000 BCE,[c] destroying an advanced civilization on the \"lost continent\" of Atlantis. Donnelly, following others before him, attributed the Biblical Flood to this event, which he hypothesized had also resulted in catastrophic fires and climate change. Shortly after the publication of Ragnarok, one commenter noted, \"Whiston ascertained that the deluge of Noah came from a comet's tail; but Donnelly has outdone Whiston, for he has shown that our planet has suffered not only from a cometary flood, but from cometary fire, and a cometary rain of stones.\"[52]"

In May, a tropical cyclone struck Acapulco, cutting that city off from the outside communication for four days, causing buildings in the city to be damaged, and caused a woman's death."

        "content": " The 2009 Pacific hurricane season was the most active Pacific hurricane season since 1997. The season officially started on May 15 in the East Pacific Ocean, and on June 1 in the Central Pacific; they both ended on November 30. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Eastern Pacific tropical cyclone basin; however, tropical cyclone formation is possible at any time of the year. The first system of the season, Tropical Depression One-E, developed on June 18, and the last, Hurricane Neki, dissipated on October 27, keeping activity well within the bounds of the season. For the first time since 1999, the first system of the season did not form until mid-June. [1] Three days after One-E formed, the first named storm of the season, Hurricane Andres developed. Activity picked-up during peak-season, and according to the NHC's tropical weather summary, August 2009, with seven named storms in their region, was one of the most active Augusts on record for the basin. This level of activity had rarely occurred, if at all, in the past 41 years, since 1968, when the most active August on record for the region with eight named storms occurred.[2] When Hurricane Rick reached Category 5 strength on October 17, it became the first Category 5 Pacific hurricane since Ioke in 2006, and the third-strongest Pacific hurricane on record, behind 2015's Patricia and 1997's Linda. The first Central Pacific name to be used was Lana, when it crossed into the region from the Eastern Pacific. With the naming of Tropical Storm Maka on August 11, this season became the first in seven years to use multiple Central Pacific names."

        "content": "On May 21, 2009, NOAA released their forecast for the 2009 Eastern Pacific and Central Pacific hurricane seasons. They predicted a below-normal level of activity in the Eastern Pacific, with 13 to 18 named storms, of which 6 to 10 were expected to become hurricanes, and 2 to 5 expected to become major hurricanes. The forecast was based on the dissipation of a La Ni\u00f1a in April 2009. Sea surface temperatures were near normal around the equator makes the season an ENSO-neutral. Additionally, an El Ni\u00f1o was forecast to develop during the latter part of the season. Depending on the intensity of the El Ni\u00f1o, forecasters were unsure of whether or not it would have an effect on the overall activity in the basin. However, due to the low-activity cycle that began in 1995, the El Ni\u00f1o only brought the activity to a slightly above normal season.[3] The Central Pacific basin was also expected to be slightly below average, with three to five tropical cyclones expected to form or cross into the area. However, it was slightly more active than expected, the number of three to five was exceeded, as seven tropical cyclones moved into or formed in the Central Pacific.[5]"

        "content": "The accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index for the 2009 Pacific hurricane season as calculated by Colorado State University using data from the National Hurricane Center was 126.4\u00a0units.[nb 1][6] Broadly speaking, ACE is a measure of the power of a tropical or subtropical storm multiplied by the length of time it existed. It is only calculated for full advisories on specific tropical and subtropical systems reaching or exceeding wind speeds of 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h). The season was characterized as \"near-normal\",[7] featuring 17 named storms 8 hurricanes and 5 major hurricanes. The central Pacific experienced above-average activity with three additional storms forming west of 140\u00b0W and three more crossing over from the eastern Pacific.[4][8] The overall number of storms contrasted to a relative lull in activity experienced over the previous decade. During the course of the year, large-scale factors such as an El Ni\u00f1o and two Madden\u2013Julian oscillations greatly contributed to the changed pattern.[9] The season's activity, east of 140\u00b0W, was reflected with a near-average cumulative accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 100, roughly 94% of the 30-year median.[8][10] ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34\u00a0kn (39\u00a0mph; 63\u00a0km/h) or tropical storm strength.[10] The season started at a below-average pace, with only one named storm forming by the end of June. This marked the first time since 1999 that no tropical storms formed during the month of May; however, on average only one storm develops in the month every other year. The ten-year span of May named storms marked the longest occurrence of this event.[1] The first hurricane of the year, Hurricane Andres, also became the first June hurricane since Hurricane Carlotta in 2000.[8][11] Below-average activity continued into July with four named storms forming. By the end of the month, season to date ACE values were roughly 37% of the long-term mean, the sixth lowest since reliable records began in 1971.[11] An abrupt shift in activity took place during August as seven named storms formed, three of which became major hurricanes. This marked the most storms to form in a single month since 1985 and the most in August since 1968.[12] Of these storms, Hurricane Jimena became the first cyclone of the season to make landfall, as well as the strongest storm to strike the west coast Baja California Sur, alongside Hurricane Norbert in 2008.[13] Following the well-above average August, September experienced below-average activity with ACE reaching 70% of the long-term mean.[14] The final month of activity featured the third-strongest storm on record in the eastern Pacific: Hurricane Rick. A Category 5 storm, Rick attained winds of 180\u00a0mph (290\u00a0km/h) off the coast of Mexico on October 18 before succumbing to increased wind shear and dry air. ACE for the month was 59% above average, mostly attributed to Rick.[15]"

Throughout the day, convection developed around the center of circulation and the system was anticipated to become a tropical storm.[16] Late on June 18, the National Hurricane Center noted that the system was on the verge of becoming a tropical storm.[17] However, the following day, strong wind shear caused the depression to rapidly degenerate into a trough of low pressure before dissipating off the coast of Sinaloa.[16] Although no longer a tropical cyclone, the remnants of the depression brought moderate rainfall to parts of Sinaloa, Nayarit and Jalisco. High winds accompanied the rainfall and left about 50,000 residences without power. Several trees were downed and some structures sustained damage from fresh water flooding. Landslides occurred along major highways and significant structural damage was reported around Mazatl\u00e1n.[18][19] However, there was no loss of life or reports of injuries.[16]"

Deep convection developed around the center of circulation and by June 23, the storm attained hurricane-status, peaking with winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h). Upon attaining this intensity, the storm featured a developing eyewall within a central dense overcast. Within 36 hours, the storm rapidly degenerated, having most of the convection being displaced by high wind shear, becoming a non-tropical trough during the afternoon of June 24.[20] Prior to becoming a tropical depression, Andres produced heavy rainfall Oaxaca and Honduras, resulting in two deaths.[21] Rough seas off the coast of Guerrero resulted in one fatality.[20] Inland, flooding caused by heavy rains killed two people and injured twenty.[22] Several dozen structures were damaged and a few were destroyed.[23] Following the storm, roughly 350 people were left homeless.[24]"

        "content": "A tropical wave exited the western coast of Africa on June\u00a019, which moved westward across the Atlantic without development. By June\u00a029, the wave crossed Central America into the eastern Pacific. Thunderstorms increased over the next several days, which organized into curved rainbands around a developing low-pressure area on July\u00a04. Following further organization, the system developed into a tropical depression on July\u00a06, located roughly 435 miles (700 kilometres) south of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. Soon after, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Blanca.[25] Operationally, the NHC classified the system immediately as a tropical storm. At that time, Blanca developed an eye-feature, though it was not expected to develop into a hurricane.[26] Steered by a ridge to the north, the storm moved west-northwestward throughout its existence.[25] Early on July\u00a07, Blanca attained peak winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) and a barometric pressure of 998 mbar (hPa; 29.47\u00a0inHg).[25] The storm's convection developed into a central dense overcast over the center,[27] which soon began deteriorating, with cloud tops warming and convection shrinking.[28] By late on July\u00a07, the center became devoid of shower and thunderstorm activity,[29] with only intermittent convection.[30] On July\u00a08, Blanca weakened into a tropical depression, and the next day it degenerated into a remnant low. Although no longer a tropical cyclone, the remnants of Blanca maintained a well-defined low pressure center as it continued its northwesterly movement. Early on July\u00a011, the system turned northward and gradually weakened. By the following day, Blanca had dissipated over open waters.[25] Due to the developing storm, Mexican officials posted high seas advisories for Michoac\u00e1n, Jalisco, Nayarit, Baja California Sur and Colima, and advised ships to remain at port in July\u00a06.[31] These advisories were discontinued the following day as Blanca moved out to sea.[32] Moisture from the system enhanced a frontal system over Coahuila. The system produced upwards of 22.2\u00a0mm (0.87\u00a0in) in the span of a few hours, triggering flooding throughout the state. Numerous streets were closed due to flooding and local fire departments were deployed to assist in draining the water. No injuries or structural damage resulted from the flooding.[33] The remnants of the storm also brought unseasonable rainfall, although negligible, to parts of southern and central California on July\u00a011.[34] The moisture reached the region after being pulled northward by an upper-level low off the coast of Oregon.[35]"

The wave entered the eastern Pacific on July\u00a04, later developing more convection on July\u00a08 to the south of Mexico. Early on July\u00a010, convective banding features developed along the periphery of the system[36] and an area of low pressure developed within the wave.[37] On July\u00a010, the NHC designated the system as Tropical Depression Four-E about 900\u00a0mi (1,400\u00a0km) south of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula. Soon after, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Carlos while moving westward through an area of warm waters and light wind shear. On July\u00a011, Carlos intensified further into a minimal hurricane. At that time, the small storm developed a small eye-like feature, which had disappeared the next day, causing Carlos to weaken back into a tropical storm. The eye feature redeveloped, signaling that Carlos reintensified into a hurricane on July\u00a014, reaching peak winds of 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h) early the next day. Located at 10.1\u00baN, this made Carlos the southernmost Category\u00a02 hurricane in the eastern Pacific proper. Late on July\u00a015, the hurricane encountered strong wind shear, resulting in rapid weakening. About 24\u00a0hours after its peak intensity, Carlos deteriorated into a tropical depression, and dissipated early on July\u00a017 well to the southeast of Hawaii.[36]"

Shower and thunderstorm activity associated with the system gradually increased over the next several days as it tracked west-northwestward. By July 15, the low became sufficiently organized and was declared a tropical depression roughly 695 miles (1,118\u00a0km) of Manzanillo, Colima. Turning towards the northwest in response to a ridge over Mexico, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Dolores later that day.[38] Despite southwesterly wind shear displacing the center of Dolores from the deepest convection,[39] the system continued to strengthen, attaining peak winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) on July 16. Shortly thereafter, convection associated with the storm dissipated, possibly due to entrainment of dry air. Later that day the system degenerated into a remnant low and gradually weakened. The remnants of Dolores eventually dissipated on July 19, roughly 995 miles (1,601\u00a0km) west-southwest of Los Angeles.[38]"

Later that day, it moved into the Central Pacific as a tropical depression, quickly strengthening into Tropical Storm Lana, becoming the first central Pacific tropical storm to form as a depression in the eastern Pacific but be named in the central since Hurricane Li in 1994. It also started to develop an eye feature, based on satellite imagery. But, southerly shear, introduced by a large upper-level trough, caused Lana to become slightly disorganized on July 31. Despite this, Lana reached its peak intensity of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) early on August 1, and slowly weakened to become a very disorganized, yet still fairly strong tropical storm, maintaining maximum winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) for the next couple of days. However, Lana weakened to a tropical depression late on August 2, while continuing to quickly become disorganized. Lana degenerated to a remnant low on 00:00 UTC of August 3, roughly 580 miles (930\u00a0km) southwest of Honolulu, and 410 miles (660\u00a0km) east of Johnston Island, with the CPHC issuing their last advisory at the same time.

The center of circulation was embedded within a central dense overcast and located within an area favoring further development. The depression tracked just north of due west in response to a mid-tropospheric ridge north of the system. Upon becoming a tropical cyclone, a second area of low pressure, that would later become Hurricane Felicia located nine degrees of longitude to the west, had the possibility to develop into a tropical depression and possibly influence the system.[41] Late on August 3, the depression intensified to a tropical storm and was given the name Enrique. Enrique strengthened to reach a peak intensity of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) on August 4. However, interaction with Hurricane Felicia weakened the system late that evening, with maximum winds decreasing to 50\u00a0mph. Enrique maintained winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) for the next day or so, until early on August 6, when the NHC downgraded Enrique to depression status.

It strengthened into a tropical storm and was named Felicia early on August 4. It rapidly strengthened that morning as an eyewall quickly developed, the rapid intensification being attributed to warm water along the forecast track, which allowed for more rapid intensification. Felicia continued to intensify and became a hurricane that afternoon. Rapid intensification continued into that evening, and the NHC upgraded Felicia to a Category 2 hurricane. It continued to rapidly strengthen, becoming the first major hurricane of the season on the morning of August 5, when the NHC upgraded it to a Category 3 hurricane. Later that day, Felicia rapidly intensified to a Category 4 hurricane, with maximum winds increasing to 145\u00a0mph (233\u00a0km/h), making it the strongest storm in the Eastern Pacific since Daniel in 2006. The NHC predicted that Felicia would rapidly weaken during the next couple of days starting on August 6, but it was also noted by the NHC that Felicia was displaying annular hurricane characteristics, which would allow for it to maintain intensity for longer than expected over marginal SSTS. On August 8 it crossed into the Central Pacific basin, gradually weakening to a tropical storm and then a tropical depression as it approached the Hawaiian Islands. Tropical storm and flash flood watches were issued on August 7 for the Big Island of Hawaii and Maui County, and were extended to include Oahu on August 9. The watches for the Big Island were later canceled as the track for Felicia appeared to turn toward the north. All watches were canceled at 11 a.m. HST August 11 as Felicia dissipated to a remnant low.[43]"

Nine-E initially formed as a tropical wave that had entered the eastern Pacific on August 1, but was ill-defined, and difficult to trace. The NHC had initially forecast Nine-E to strengthen to a tropical storm by August 10, but moderate shear inhibited development, and the depression was no longer forecast to strengthen to a tropical storm, as the shear inhibited deep convection within the depression's circulation. Shear continually inhibited development until the end, when Nine-E degenerated to a remnant low on August 12. The next day, the NHC noted the possibility for regeneration of the system, although, by late on the 14th, the disturbance had weakened, and was becoming embedded in the ITCZ, as a result, the probability for regeneration was low. Nine-E's remnants dissipated on August 15, while located just within the central Pacific."

Situated over warm waters, estimated at 28\u00a0\u00b0C (82\u00a0\u00b0F) and within an area of low wind shear, the system gradually intensified as it tracked northwestward in response to a subtropical ridge to the north.[44] By August 11, convection had consolidated around an area of low pressure that formed within the system. Since further development was expected, a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert was issued.[45] Shortly thereafter, the CPHC upgraded the low to a tropical depression, assigning it with the identifier One-C.[44] Over the following 12 hours, further development took place, and the depression intensified into a tropical storm. Upon attaining this intensity, the storm was given the name Maka from the list of names for the Central Pacific basin.[44] The next afternoon, the final advisory on Maka was issued as it degenerates into a remnant low.[44] The remnants of Tropical Storm Maka crossed the International Date Line and moved into the Western Pacific, regenerating into a tropical depression.[46]"

On August 14, it strengthened to become the fourth hurricane of the season, concurrent to the development of a good, banding type eye. That afternoon, Guillermo strengthened to a Category 2 hurricane with maximum winds increasing to 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h). Early on August 15, Guillermo intensified to become the second major hurricane of the season, as it was upgraded by the NHC to a Category 3 hurricane, with maximum winds increasing to 125\u00a0mph (201\u00a0km/h). On August 16 it crossed into the Central Pacific basin as a Category 1 hurricane, and then quickly weakened to a tropical storm thereafter due to very high wind shear. Despite over very strong as high as 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h) of shear, Guillermo survived as a weak tropical storm for a further 3 days before weakening to a depression and degenerating to a remnant low on August 19, near the West Coast. However, the remnants continued to curve towards the northeast for the next several days, before finally dissipating on August 23.[47] Although Guillermo remained well away from land, large swells produced by the system resulted in 6 to 8 feet (1.8 to 2.4\u00a0m) surf along the eastern coasts of the Hawaiian Islands between August 18 and 19.[48]"

Moving over land, Jimena weakened into a Category 1 later that day, only to move back offshore as a Category 1 hurricane. The hurricane made a third landfall near San Junacio with 85\u00a0mph (135\u00a0km/h) winds. Finally, around 03:00\u00a0UTC of September 3, Jimena weakened to a tropical storm, but despite reemerging in the Gulf of California, Jimena continued to weaken due to increased wind shear. On September 4, the storm weakened into a tropical depression and made a fourth and final landfall near Santa Rosal\u00eda, Baja California Sur. Five hours after Jimena made the final landfall, Jimena degenerated into a remnant low and dissipated by September 5.[51] Owing to the storm's slow movement, torrential rains fell over much of Baja California Sur and Sinaloa, resulting in widespread flooding.[55] In Guaymas, a record 26.54 inches (674\u00a0mm) of rain fell in association with Jimena. According to a report by Mexico's Centro Nacional de Prevenci\u00f3n de Desastres, the magnitude of the event was analyzed to be a once in 2000 year occurrence.[56] Thousands of homes were damaged or destroyed across Baja California and much of Puerto Lopez Mateos was leveled. Significant damage to infrastructure not only left people without water and power, it hampered relief efforts as many towns were isolated from surrounding areas.[55] At least six people were killed and an estimated 72,000 were affected across the region.[57][58] Total losses related to Hurricane Jimena reached 2.3 billion pesos ($173.9 million).[59]"

The wave continued westward without development, crossing Central America into the Pacific Ocean on August 28. Convection remained minimal until September 3, when the system became better organized. A Low-pressure area developed on September 6, and deep convection consolidated around the circulation. Early on September 7, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) designated the low as Tropical Depression Fifteen-E about 1,130 miles (1,820\u00a0km) west-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula.[62] Moving over warm water temperatures and modest wind shear, gradual intensification was anticipated.[63] The depression moved slowly to the west due to a weakening subtropical ridge to its north. Shortly after developing, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Linda. By September 9, a new ridge developed east of Linda, causing the storm to turn northwestward.[62] Despite intensifying into a strong tropical storm, Linda's low-level circulation was misaligned from its upper circulations, although the system developed expansive outflow to the south and east.[64] Late on September 9, Linda attained hurricane status, and although an eye developed, it was not over the center due to increasing wind shear. Early on September 10, Linda attained peak winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) and a pressure of 985\u00a0mbar (29.1\u00a0inHg).[62] Operationally, the NHC assessed Linda to have been slightly stronger with peak winds of 85\u00a0mph (137\u00a0km/h).[65] Persistent wind shear eroded the eyewall and led to weakening.[66] Compounded with decreasing water temperatures, Linda deteriorated to tropical storm status early on September 11.[62] At that time, the center became exposed and lacked deep convection.[67] After the intrusion of dry air, the convection dissipated,[68] and late on September 11, the NHC issued their final advisory on Linda after it degenerated into a remnant low.[69] At this time, the system weakened below tropical storm intensity. The remnants of Linda persisted for several more days, initially tracking southwest before turning due west. The system eventually dissipated on September 15 roughly 1,195 miles (1,923\u00a0km) east of the Hawaiian Islands.[62]"

Situated off the southern coast of Mexico, the depression tracked west-northwest in a region favoring explosive development. Shortly after being classified as Tropical Depression Twenty-E, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Rick. Roughly 18 hours later, Rick had become a Category 1 hurricane as it underwent rapid intensification. After a brief pause in this phase, the storm went through another period of intensification, reaching Category 5 status on October 17, becoming the first storm of this intensity since Hurricane Kenna in 2002 east of 140\u00b0W.[90] Early on October 18, the storm attained its peak intensity with winds of 180\u00a0mph (290\u00a0km/h) and a barometric pressure of 906\u00a0mbar (26.8\u00a0inHg).[90] Not long after attaining this intensity, the combination of increasing wind shear and dry air caused the storm to rapidly weaken. By October 19, Rick weakened below Category 3 status and began to turn north, towards the Baja California Peninsula. Continued degradation of the structure led to the hurricane being downgraded to a tropical storm on October 20. By this time, the storm had become highly asymmetric, with most deep convection being displaced to the northeast. The following day, Rick made landfall near Mazatl\u00e1n with winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h). The storm rapidly degenerated as it moved over land, dissipating within 12 hours of landfall.[90] Prior to making landfall, the NHC initially forecasted Rick to make landfall in southern Baja California as a high-end Category 2 hurricane, prompting hurricane watches.[90] Officials ordered several hundred residents to evacuate from low-lying areas,[91] although tropical storm warnings replaced the hurricane watches after the storm had weakened.[90] Overall, the damage from Rick was significantly less than what was initially anticipated. Throughout Mexico, three people were killed by the storm, one in Oaxaca and two in Baja California Sur.[92][93][94] Total losses from the storm reached 192 million pesos ($14.6 million USD).[95]"

While passing through the Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine National Monument, Neki was downgraded to a tropical storm after the center became exposed from the deepest convection.[96] It caused little impact in the island chain.[97] After stalling and executing a small loop, Neki resumed its northward track and dissipated on October 27.[96] Hurricane Neki caused relatively little damage in the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument. All of the structures were undamaged; however, two small natural habitat islands, Round and Disappearing Islands, were affected substantially.

Slow-moving remnants of a tropical storm triggered the flood. 11.4 inches (290\u00a0mm) of rain fell within 24 hours on Paterson, New Jersey, which received over 15 inches (380\u00a0mm) of rain during the entire event. The Passaic River crested at 17.5 feet (5.3\u00a0m) at Little Falls, New Jersey. At the height of the flood, the Passaic river, which ordinarily carries 12,000 cubic feet of water per second, carried about 37,500 cubic feet of water per second. Other than the Passaic, three northern basin tributaries, the Ramapo, Wanaque, and Pequannock also experienced extreme flooding. The Rockaway and the Whippany rivers experienced less flooding. [2] Bridges and dams along the Passaic and Ramapo Rivers were destroyed, including a 27-foot (8.2\u00a0m) dam at Pompton Lakes, New Jersey. Flooding encompassed 25 percent of Wallington, 20 percent of Passaic and 10.3 miles of Paterson streets. Additionally, 1,200 Paterson residents were displaced due to the flood. The flood, the most severe in the region since the American Colonial Period, caused $7\u00a0million in damage (equivalent to $237.4\u00a0million in 2023).[3][4] The Edison Manufacturing Company produced a short documentary film, Flood Scene in Paterson, N.J., shot a few days after the flood.[5][unreliable source?] The flood still ranks as New Jersey's worst. It followed a similar course to the Passaic flood of 1902 that had occurred the prior year. [6] The flood occurred on the Passaic floodplain, which was the site of an ancient lake. This massive lake formed 25,000 years ago after a glacier that covered northern New Jersey retreated. Water collected in this basin and a lake resided there for 2,000 years. At its largest, this lake was 30 miles long and 15 miles wide. The lake eventually drained through Great Notch, but this point has a high elevation so the lake took a long time to drain. The lake did not drain at a more efficient, lower-elevation point because the northward retreat of the Wisconsin glacier blocked the earlier, lower-elevation, drainage point. The slow drainage of the lake allowed time for a floodplain to form, increasing the flooding risk that continues today. [7]"

The storm progressed inland along the Rio Grande Valley, dissipating on June\u00a027.[11] In Mexico, Alice left minor damage, and killed one person due to a fallen power line.[12] Across Texas, Alice dropped torrential rainfall, peaking at 24.07\u00a0in (611\u00a0mm) near Pandale,[13] with most of the rainfall concentrated around the Pecos River. High precipitation accumulations occurred in areas that had seen little rains in three years. This led to significant flooding along the Pecos River that produced \"probably the greatest rate of runoff for a watershed of [that] size in the United States\", as reported by the International Boundary and Water Commission.[14] Ozona, Texas, sustained the most impact, estimated at $2\u00a0million in damage. Downstream, the Rio Grande rose to the highest level since 1865,[13] which flooded seven towns on either side of the border;[15] Eagle Pass, Texas, was flooded with 8\u00a0ft (2.4\u00a0m) of water.[16] Overall there were at least 55\u00a0deaths.[6]"

Maximum sustained winds reached 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h),[4] although a tanker offshore named the Henry M. Dawes reported wind gusts of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h).[6] Officials at the United States Weather Bureau posted a storm warning from Cameron to Burrwood, Louisiana, and also advised small craft to remain at port along the entire northern Gulf Coast.[18] Without intensifying further, Barbara made landfall near Vermilion Bay, Louisiana on July\u00a029,[6] dissipating the next day over Texas.[4] The storm dropped heavy rainfall along its path,[6] including over 2\u00a0in (51\u00a0mm) in New Orleans.[19] The rains caused flooding as well as some damage to the rice crop.[20] However, the Monthly Weather Review yearly summary described the precipitation as \"far more beneficial than damaging\".

Moving parallel to the coastline of the southeastern United States, Carol passed just east of Cape Hatteras with winds estimated at 110\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h).[6] It intensified further as it accelerated, striking eastern Long Island as Category 3 hurricane.[21] Carol made its final landfall on Old Saybrook, Connecticut, late on August\u00a031. Within a few hours, the hurricane became extratropical over New Hampshire, which later dissipated over Quebec.[6] In North Carolina, hurricane-force winds left minor damage to houses,[22] estimated around $228,000.[6] Rains from Carol alleviated drought conditions in the Washington, D.C. area.[23] On Long Island, the storm surge flooded the Montauk Highway with 4\u00a0ft (1.2\u00a0m) of water about a mile across. High winds left 275,000\u00a0homes without power, and damage totaled $3\u00a0million on the island.[24] The hurricane moved ashore in Connecticut shortly after high tide, producing a storm surge of 10\u201315\u00a0ft (3.0\u20134.6\u00a0m) from New London eastward. The surge in Narragansett Bay reached 14.4\u00a0ft (4.4\u00a0m), which surpassed that of the 1938 New England hurricane, which flooded downtown Providence with 12 feet (3.7\u00a0m) of water. In New London, rainfall peaked around 6\u00a0in (150\u00a0mm).[25] The hurricane produced winds of over 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h) in Connecticut and Rhode Island,[5] including a record-high gust of 135\u00a0mph (217\u00a0km/h) at Block Island.[25] Widespread areas were left without power from eastern Connecticut to southern Massachusetts.[25] Further north in Maine, Hurricane Carol downed hundreds of trees, as well as destroying widespread apple groves and corn fields. It became the costliest natural disaster in the state's history,[26] only to be surpassed by Hurricane Edna ten days later.[7] Across New England, the hurricane destroyed about 4,000\u00a0homes, 3,500\u00a0cars, and 3,000\u00a0boats.[25] Damage totaled $460\u00a0million,[6] and there were 60\u00a0deaths.[5] In neighboring Canada, high rains caused flooding while strong winds downed trees and power lines.[27]"

The Hurricane Hunters estimated maximum sustained winds of 85\u00a0mph (137\u00a0km/h) on September\u00a02 after the storm passed about halfway between the Outer Banks and Bermuda. Dolly turned to the northeast on September\u00a02 and became extratropical later that day to the south of Nova Scotia.

It turned to the north and northeast, bypassing the Outer Banks and skirting Cape Cod.[4] On September\u00a011, Edna struck Massachusetts as a strong Category 2 hurricane.[5] The hurricane later moved ashore near the border between Maine and New Brunswick around the time it became extratropical. The remnants persisted a few more days before dissipating south of Greenland.[4] Early in its duration, Edna produced high seas and gale-force winds in the Bahamas, but there was no damage there. Hurricane-force winds occurred in the Outer Banks, although damage was minor.[6] As it passed New England, Edna produced a 6\u00a0ft (1.8\u00a0m) storm surge during a high tide, which caused severe flooding in Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket, and Cape Cod. Wind gusts peaked at 120\u00a0mph (190\u00a0km/h) on Martha's Vineyard, and the strong winds across the region left widespread power outages. The hurricane dropped additional heavy rainfall to areas affected by Carol, resulting in flooding in Massachusetts and Rhode Island.[30] In Long Island and New England, the hurricane left over $42\u00a0million in damage and 20\u00a0deaths, only 11\u00a0days after Carol affected the same area.[6] About a third of the damage occurred in Maine,[7] becoming the costliest hurricane on record in the state.[26] Hurricane-force winds extended into Canada, causing $6\u00a0million in damage (1954\u00a0CAD), mostly from crop damage.

After making a hard turn northward, it rapidly intensified as it approached Haiti, reaching Category 3 intensity before landfall.[6] In Haiti, Hazel destroyed 40% of the coffee trees and 50% of the cacao crop, affecting the economy for several years to come.[38][39] It fluctuated in intensity before making landfall as a Category 4 hurricane in the Carolinas, which destroyed most waterfront dwellings near its point of impact.[40] It affected several more states, including Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia, bringing gusts near 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) and causing $308\u00a0million in damage.[6][41] When Hazel arrived in Ontario, rivers and streams passing through the Greater Toronto Area overflowed their banks, causing severe flooding.[42] As a result, many residential areas located in floodplains, such as the Raymore Drive area, were subsequently converted to parkland.[43] In Canada alone, over C$135\u00a0million (2009: $1.1\u00a0billion) of damage was incurred.[44] Hazel was particularly destructive in Toronto, as a result of a combination of a lack of experience in dealing with tropical storms and the storm's unexpected retention of power. Hazel had traveled 680\u00a0mi (1,090\u00a0km) over land, but while approaching Canada, it had merged with an existing powerful cold front. The storm stalled over the Greater Toronto Area, and although it was now extratropical, it remained as powerful as a category 1 hurricane.[45] To help with the cleanup, 800 members of the military were summoned, and a Hurricane Relief Fund was established that distributed $5.1\u00a0million (2023: $56.2\u00a0million) in aid.[44]"

The depression also moved ashore with high waves and tides.[51] When the system reached the Big Bend region on October\u00a05 it reintensified slightly. Around that time, the United States Navy conducted a rocket test from White Sands, New Mexico; this was despite that such tests were rarely performed when the skies were cloudy. The rocket took an unintended photograph of the depression from an altitude of about 100 miles (160\u00a0km), which became the first such large-scale image of a tropical cyclone.[50] The depression later moved into New Mexico and dropped additional rainfall,[50] interacting with an approaching cold front.[52] Flooding was reported around Roswell,[50] as well as along the Pecos River system.

Search and rescue teams were deployed across the state to assist stranded residents.[14] Numerous swift water and rooftop rescues were conducted.[9] A volunteer firefighter and other residents of White Sulphur Springs used front-end loaders and other heavy machinery to move through debris-laden floodwaters during the overnight of June\u00a023\u201324 to save 60\u00a0people.[15] On June\u00a025, President Barack Obama declared West Virginia a major disaster area, ordering aid to assist victims of the floods in Kanawha, Greenbrier and Nicholas counties.[14] On June 28, Tomblin requested the disaster area be expanded to include Clay, Fayette, Monroe, Pocahontas, Roane, Summers and Webster counties.[21] Five of those counties\u2014Clay, Fayette, Monroe, Roane and Summers \u2014 were granted the request.[22] As a precautionary measure, natural gas service was suspended for White Sulphur Springs in Greenbrier County.[9] In Fayette County, where there were reports of looters, the sheriff warned would-be thieves that citizens were legally armed and ready to protect what they had left.[23] Law enforcement officials in the county later clarified that such actions were \"not sanctioned by the sheriff's department.\"[24] In unaffected parts of the state including Morgantown[25] and Martinsburg,[26] residents collected items to donate to the flood-ravaged areas. The 2016 Greenbrier Classic golf tournament, scheduled to start on July\u00a07, was canceled due to the floods. The Greenbrier Resort, where the tournament is played, was closed indefinitely,[14][27] though available rooms were offered free-of-charge to flood victims in need of shelter.[28] By June 28, about 200 people displaced by the flood were staying at the resort.[29] Flooding in Alleghany County, Virginia, prompted deployment of the Virginia National Guard.[30]"

In January 2020, the office was described as \"barely functioning,\" and rebuilding from the flood remained incomplete.[31]"

The cold front at the border between Ontario and Quebec is supported by an intensifying barometric trough at 500\u00a0mb, and a low pressure is developing at the surface, just southwest of Ottawa, Ontario. Cumulonimbus with high tops were easily forming in the moist, humid and unstable air mass near the ground while drier air was cooling the air in the mid-tropospheric levels. A wind divergence at the upper level and a convergence near the surface, due to the low pressure, was helping to organize the deep convection.[3] Evaluation of the nearby upper air station tephigram showed a very strong convective available potential energy (CAPE) and the hodograph had a strong wind shear in the first 4 kilometres (13,000\u00a0ft) above ground, conducive to rotation in the convective clouds, hail, heavy rain downpours, and downbursts. There was a thick layer of clouds northwest of Montreal, near the frontal zone, but only a thin layer of low clouds further southeast. The analysis of the upper air data led to the prediction of a maximum temperature again above 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F) and dew points of 23\u00a0\u00b0C (73\u00a0\u00b0F).[3]"

By noon, conditions deteriorated quickly to thunderstorms and heavy rain showers. The weather radar loop on the right shows that a series of four thunderstorms, noted A to D, crossed the Island of Montreal from Valleyfield to Sorel. These affected roughly the same area from 1620 UTC (12:20 pm local) to 1830 UTC (2:30 pm local). The intensities on the 1.5\u00a0km height CAPPI are over 47\u00a0dBZ which represents rain rates of 40 millimetres (1.6\u00a0in) per hour or more. Three times, these intensities reached above 7 kilometres (23,000\u00a0ft), indicating the possibility of severe downbursts and hail.

However the highest amounts were recorded around the Mont-Royal and downtown areas. The largest official amount has been 103 millimetres (4.1\u00a0in) at Parc Lafontaine but a non official total of 181 millimetres (7.1\u00a0in) was recorded by a City of Montreal station in the downtown core.[5] The city of Laval that occupies \u00cele J\u00e9sus just to the north, received a large amount of rain too, up to 72.4 millimetres (2.85\u00a0in). However, the region just across the Saint Lawrence River from Montreal was spared the worst as only 10 millimetres (0.39\u00a0in) is recorded at Saint-Hubert airport and 20 millimetres (0.79\u00a0in) in Laprairie according to Environment Canada.[2] Montreal's sewer system was designed to handle only 36 millimetres (1.4\u00a0in) per hour, which is a once-in-10-years occurrence, according to Gaston Moreau, assistant director of public works. The flood's return period was estimated to be at least 50 years.[6] Lightning and wind caused widespread power outages which in turn stopped the pumping system from evacuating the excess water from low lying roads and underpasses. D\u00e9carie expressway, a sunken highway, rapidly filled with water descending from access roads and soon became a river. Thousands of motorists were trapped and had to be rescued by firefighters and truckers with higher-clearance vehicles. An 80-year-old man drowned and another person died of electrocution.[1] Nearly 350,000 households lost electrical power, 40,000 to 50,000 houses and businesses were flooded causing an estimated C$220\u00a0million in damages (close to half a billion C$ of 2017).[7][8] Traffic was paralyzed for hours as most streets and roads had flooded areas. Montreal Metro, buses and suburban train service were stopped.[1] The basement of an elderly care hospital in the Saint-Henri neighbourhood was flooded and 240 patients were left without electricity, food, and health services for a while.[1]"

In 1997, the bureau was renamed Centre de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 civile.[9] Following the Municipal reorganization in Quebec in 2002, most of the cities were regrouped into the greater Montreal and the center became the Centre de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 civile de Montr\u00e9al.[11]"

The 13th named storm of the season, Marco formed from a cold-core low pressure area along the northern coast of Cuba on October\u00a09, and tracked northwestward through the eastern Gulf of Mexico. With most of its circulation over the western portion of Florida, Tropical Storm Marco produced 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) winds over land. However, it weakened to a tropical depression before moving ashore near Cedar Key. The cyclone combined with a cold front and the remnants of Hurricane Klaus to produce heavy rainfall in Georgia and the Carolinas. After interacting with the nearby Hurricane Lili, Marco continued northward until being absorbed by a cold front on October\u00a013. In Florida, the cyclone triggered flooding of some houses and roadways. Rainfall across its path peaked at 19.89 inches (505\u00a0mm) in Louisville, Georgia, though several locations received over 10 inches (250\u00a0mm) of precipitation.

The low drifted westward, and interacted with Hurricane Klaus to its east.[1] Initially cold-core in nature, the system gradually built downward to the surface, and on October 9, the low developed a low-level circulation; at 1200\u00a0UTC the National Hurricane Center classified it as Tropical Depression Fifteen while located near the Cuban city of Caibari\u00e9n,[2] though the cyclone was initially subtropical in character.[3] To its east, Tropical Storm Klaus continued to weaken; the depression absorbed most of Klaus and became the dominant system.[1] The storm tracked parallel to the coast of Cuba before veering northward and crossing the Florida Keys, where it intensified into Tropical Storm Marco about 35\u00a0mi (56\u00a0km) south-southeast of Key West, Florida.[2] After passing midway between Key West and the Dry Tortugas, Tropical Storm Marco adopted a steady northward track and quickly intensified, reaching peak winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) on October 11, while still southwest of Englewood, Florida. The center of the storm continued on its off-shore parallel for another six hours after reaching its peak intensity, until it reached a position about six\u00a0mi (10\u00a0km) west of Bradenton Beach; although the center of the storm remained offshore, much of its circulation was over land.[2] Initially the storm still was forecast to move ashore between Fort Myers and Sarasota.[4] However, the cyclone continued its northward trajectory, the center remaining offshore, and it weakened to a tropical depression prior to making landfall near Cedar Key early on October 12.[2][5] After landfall, the cyclone accelerated in forward speed northward, weakening in intensity, and, by 1200\u00a0UTC on October 12, Marco became an extra-tropical cyclone. It turned to the northeast and east through South Carolina, following behind Hurricane Lili to its northeast.[3] For a time, the system's proximity to Lili resulted in hints of the Fujiwhara effect, in which two tropical cyclone appear to rotate around each other.[6] The cold front that absorbed the weakening low was to the storm's north on October 13,[2] though moisture from the remnants of Marco dropped heavy rainfall across the southeast United States for another day.[3]"

Public schools were not opened on the day of the storm's passage in Manatee and Sarasota counties, though most other schools remained open.[8] As the storm tracked northward, the National Weather Service issued a flood watch for much of Georgia. A flood watch was later issued for western portions of the Carolinas and for high elevations in Virginia and West Virginia.[9]"

Statewide damage totalled $3\u00a0million (1990\u00a0USD$, 7\u00a0million 2024\u00a0USD),[7] of which $1\u00a0million (1990\u00a0USD$, 2.33\u00a0million 2024\u00a0USD) occurred in Manatee County.[11]"

Rainfall peaked at 19.89 inches (505\u00a0mm) at a weather station near Louisville, Georgia where over 16 inches (410\u00a0mm) fell in a 24\u2011hour period.[7] In Augusta, 2.79 inches (71\u00a0mm) of rainfall fell in one hour, which forced the evacuation of about 300\u00a0people. Some roads in eastern Georgia were flooded up to 6 feet (1.8\u00a0m) deep, and police officers in Augusta rescued people in flooded cars. The flooding resulted in some power outages. In the deluge, five people drowned,[9] and 450\u00a0were left homeless.[15] The remnants of the storm spawned a tornado in Brantley County, which destroyed 25\u00a0unoccupied homes.[16] Damage in Georgia totaled $42\u00a0million (1990\u00a0USD$, 98\u00a0million 2024\u00a0USD).[7] On October 19, 1990, President George H. W. Bush declared several counties in Georgia as federal disaster areas, which permitted the use of emergency funds for victims.[17][18] Heavy rainfall continued northward into the Carolinas. Much of South Carolina experienced over 7 inches (180\u00a0mm) of precipitation; statewide, the rainfall peaked at 13.96 inches (355\u00a0mm) in Pageland.[3][19] The highest totals in 100\u00a0years in some locations[20] also ended a severe drought.[21] In the flooding, 80\u00a0bridges in the state failed; in total, more than 120\u00a0bridges were either closed, damaged, or destroyed.[22] In South Carolina, the system caused three drowning deaths;[15] damage totaled $12\u00a0million ($1990,  28\u00a0million 2024\u00a0USD).[7] In North Carolina, rainfall reached 10.74 inches (273\u00a0mm) in Albemarle.[19] The storm directly caused two deaths in North Carolina,[7] and indirectly caused two traffic deaths.[15] Rainfall from the combined remnants of Marco and Klaus extended into the Ohio Valley, with 3.67 inches (93\u00a0mm) recorded near Mountain City, Tennessee.[19] Totals of 2\u20135 inches (51\u2013127 millimetres) spread across northwest Virginia, western Maryland, eastern West Virginia, and the Susquehanna Valley of Pennsylvania.[7] In New York, the rainfall combined with moisture from Hurricane Lili, which triggered flooding that closed a portion of a railway line and a highway.[23]"

It was also the earliest-forming storm in both the Northwestern Pacific Ocean and North Indian Ocean basins on record. Forming on the last day of 2018, Pabuk persisted into 2019, spanning two calendar years, and crossed into the North Indian Ocean basin several days later. The first tropical cyclone and named storm of the 2019 Pacific typhoon and North Indian Ocean cyclone seasons, Pabuk originated as a tropical disturbance in the South China Sea on December 28, 2018, which organized into a tropical depression on December 31. A day later, on January 1, 2019, the system intensified into a tropical storm and was named Pabuk. Pabuk made landfall in Thailand on January 4, emerging into the Bay of Bengal in the North Indian Ocean basin shortly afterward. Pabuk weakened after it entered the North Indian Ocean, eventually degenerating into a remnant low on January 7, before dissipating on the next day. Pabuk killed a total of 10 people, and the storm caused an estimated total of US$95 million in damages. In Thailand, eight people were killed and the economic losses were estimated at $93.8 million.

This made Pabuk the first tropical storm to exist in the gulf since Muifa in 2004.[7] Around that time, the storm tried to form an eye, which was revealed by microwave imagery.[8] On January 4, the Thai Meteorological Department reported that Pabuk had made landfall over Pak Phanang, Nakhon Si Thammarat at 12:45 ICT (05:45 UTC), although other agencies indicated a landfall at peak intensity between 06:00 and 12:00 UTC.[9] Pabuk became the first tropical storm to make landfall over southern Thailand since Linda in 1997. Shortly after 12:00 UTC, the JMA issued its last full advisory for Pabuk, as the storm exited the basin into the North Indian Ocean.[10][11] Soon after Pabuk crossed over into the basin, the IMD initiated advisories on the storm, making Pabuk the earliest-forming cyclonic storm for this basin, surpassing Hibaru in 2005, as well as the first cyclonic storm with a name originally assigned by RSMC Tokyo.[12] Over the next few days, Pabuk continued moved west-northwestward, before weakening into a well-marked low on January 7. The system's remnant low then turned to the northeast, subsequently dissipating on January 8.[citation needed]"

From 1999 to 2004, he was also the Leader of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). As chancellor, he led a coalition government of the SPD and Alliance 90/The Greens. Since leaving public office, Schr\u00f6der has worked for Russian state-owned energy companies, including Nord Stream AG, Rosneft, and Gazprom.[1][2] Schr\u00f6der was a lawyer before becoming a full-time politician, and he was Minister President of Lower Saxony (1990\u20131998) before becoming chancellor. Following the 2005 federal election, which his party lost, and after three weeks of negotiations, he stood down as chancellor in favour of Angela Merkel of the rival Christian Democratic Union. He was chairman of the board of Nord Stream AG and of Rosneft but in 2022 resigned from the latter and opted not to join the board of Russian state-run gas company Gazprom. He also had roles as a global manager for investment bank Rothschild, and as chairman of the board of football club Hannover 96. After the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Schr\u00f6der was criticized for his policies towards Vladimir Putin's government, his work for Russian state-owned companies, and his lobbying on behalf of Russia. In March 2022, the Public Prosecutor General initiated proceedings related to accusations against Schr\u00f6der of complicity in crimes against humanity due to his role in Russian state-owned corporations, while the CDU/CSU group demanded that Schr\u00f6der be included in the European Union sanctions against individuals with ties to the Russian government.[3][4] An SPD party arbitration committee ruled in March 2023 that he had not violated any party rules and would remain a member of the party.[5]"

His mother, Erika (n\u00e9e Vosseler), worked as an agricultural labourer to support herself and her two sons.[6] After the war, the area where Schr\u00f6der lived became part of West Germany. He completed an apprenticeship in retail sales in a Lemgo hardware shop from 1958 to 1961 and subsequently worked in a Lage retail shop and after that as an unskilled construction worker and a sales clerk in G\u00f6ttingen while studying at night school for a general qualification for university entrance (Abitur). He did not have to do military service because his father had died in the war.[7] In 1966, Schr\u00f6der secured entrance to a university, passing the Abitur exam at Westfalen-Kolleg, Bielefeld. From 1966 to 1971 he studied law at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. In 1976, he passed his second law examination, and he subsequently worked as a lawyer until 1990.[8] Among his more controversial cases, Schr\u00f6der helped Horst Mahler, a founding member of the Baader-Meinhof terrorist group, to secure both an early release from prison and permission to practice law again in Germany.[9]"

Following his election as Minister-President in 1990, Schr\u00f6der also became a member of the board of the federal SPD. In 1997 and 1998, he served as President of the Bundesrat. Between 1994 and 1998, he was also chairman of Lower Saxonian SPD. During Schr\u00f6der's time in office, first in coalition with the environmentalist Green Party, then with a clear majority, Lower Saxony became one of the most deficit-ridden of Germany's 16 federal states and unemployment rose higher than the national average of 12 percent.[11] Ahead of the 1994 elections, SPD chairman Rudolf Scharping included Schr\u00f6der in his shadow cabinet for the party's campaign to unseat incumbent Helmut Kohl as chancellor.[12] During the campaign, Schr\u00f6der served as shadow minister of economic affairs, energy and transport. In 1996, Schr\u00f6der caused controversy by taking a free ride on the Volkswagen corporate jet to attend the Vienna Opera Ball, along with Volkswagen CEO Ferdinand Pi\u00ebch. The following year, he nationalized a big steel mill in Lower Saxony to preserve jobs.[13] In the 1998 state elections, Sch\u00f6der's Social Democrats increased their share of the vote by about four percentage points over the 44.3 percent they recorded in the previous elections in 1994 \u2013 a postwar record for the party in Lower Saxony that reversed a string of Social Democrat reversals in state elections elsewhere.[14]"

Throughout his campaign for chancellor, he portrayed himself as a pragmatic new Social Democrat who would promote economic growth while strengthening Germany's generous social welfare system.[15] After the resignation of Oskar Lafontaine as Leader of the Social Democratic Party in March 1999, in protest at Schr\u00f6der's adoption of a number of what Lafontaine considered \"neo-liberal\" policies, Schr\u00f6der took over his rival's office as well. In April 1999, in Germany's first session in the restored Reichstag, to applause he quoted Albanian writer Ismail Kadare, saying: \"The Balkans is the yard of the European house, and in no house can peace prevail so long as people kill each other in its yard.\"[16] In a move meant to signal a deepening alliance between Schr\u00f6der and Prime Minister Tony Blair of the United Kingdom,[17] the two leaders issued an eighteen-page manifesto for economic reform in June 1999. Titled \"Europe: The Third Way\",[18] or \"Die Neue Mitte\" in German, it called on Europe's centre-left governments to cut taxes, pursue labour and welfare reforms and encourage entrepreneurship. The joint paper said European governments needed to adopt a \"supply-side agenda\" to respond to globalisation, the demands of capital markets and technological change.[19] Schr\u00f6der's efforts backfired within his own party, where its left-wing rejected the Schr\u00f6der\u2013Blair call for cutbacks to the welfare state and pro-business policies. Instead, the paper took part of the blame for a succession of six German state election losses in 1999 for the Social Democratic Party. Only by 2000, Schr\u00f6der managed to capitalise on the donations scandal of his Christian Democratic opposition to push through a landmark tax reform bill and re-establish his dominance of the German political scene.[20] Schr\u00f6der's tenure oversaw the seat of government move from Bonn to Berlin. In May 2001, Schr\u00f6der moved to his new official residence, the Federal Chancellery in Berlin, almost two years after the city became the seat of the German Government.[21] He had previously been working out of the building in eastern Berlin used by the former leaders of East Germany.[22]"

In February 2004, Schr\u00f6der resigned as chairman of the SPD amid growing criticism from across his own party of his reform agenda;[25][26] Franz M\u00fcntefering succeeded him as chairman. On 22 May 2005, after the SPD lost to the Christian Democrats (CDU) in North Rhine-Westphalia, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der announced he would call federal elections \"as soon as possible\". A motion of confidence was subsequently defeated in the Bundestag on 1 July 2005 by 151 to 296 (with 148 abstaining), after Schr\u00f6der urged members not to vote for his government in order to trigger new elections. In response, a grouping of left-wing SPD dissidents and the Party of Democratic Socialism agreed to run on a joint ticket in the general election, with Schr\u00f6der's rival Oskar Lafontaine leading the new group.[27] The 2005 German federal elections were held on 18 September. After the elections, neither Schr\u00f6der's SPD-Green coalition nor the alliance between CDU/CSU and the FDP led by Angela Merkel achieved a majority in parliament, but the CDU/CSU had a stronger popular electoral lead by one percentage point. On election night, both Schr\u00f6der and Merkel claimed victory and chancellorship, but after initially ruling out a grand coalition with Merkel, Schr\u00f6der and M\u00fcntefering entered negotiations with her and the CSU's Edmund Stoiber. On 10 October, it was announced that the parties had agreed to form a grand coalition. Schr\u00f6der agreed to cede the chancellorship to Merkel, but the SPD would hold the majority of government posts and retain considerable control of government policy.[28] Merkel was elected chancellor on 22 November. On 11 October 2005, Schr\u00f6der announced that he would not take a post in the new cabinet and, in November, he confirmed that he would leave politics as soon as Merkel took office. On 23 November 2005, he resigned his Bundestag seat.[29] On 14 November 2005, at a SPD conference in Karlsruhe, Schr\u00f6der urged members of the SPD to support the proposed coalition, saying it \"carries unmistakably, perhaps primarily, the imprint of the Social Democrats\". Many SPD members had previously indicated that they supported the coalition, which would have continued the policies of Schr\u00f6der's government, but had objected to Angela Merkel replacing him as chancellor.

He also eliminated capital gains tax on the sale of corporate stocks in an attempt to make the country more attractive to foreign investors.[35] After the 2002 election, the SPD steadily lost support in opinion polls. Many increasingly perceived Schr\u00f6der's Third Way program to be a dismantling of the German welfare state. Moreover, Germany's high unemployment rate remained a serious problem for the government.[36][37][38] Schr\u00f6der's tax policies were also unpopular; when the satirical radio show The Gerd Show released The Tax Song (Der Steuersong), featuring Schr\u00f6der's voice (by impressionist Elmar Brandt) lampooning Germany's indirect taxation, it became Germany's 2002 Christmas #1 hit and sold over a million copies.[39][40] The fact that Schr\u00f6der served on the Volkswagen board (a position that came with his position as minister-president of Lower Saxony) and tended to prefer pro-car policies led to him being nicknamed the car chancellor (Auto-Kanzler).[41]"

At the fortieth anniversary of the Elys\u00e9e Treaty, both sides agreed that rather than summits being held twice a year, there would now be regular meetings of a council of French and German ministers overseen by their respective foreign affairs ministers.[44] In an unprecedented move, Chirac formally agreed to represent Schr\u00f6der in his absence at a European Council meeting in October 2003.[45] In his first months in office, Schr\u00f6der vigorously demanded that Germany's net annual contribution of about $12,000,000,000 to the budget of the European Union be cut, saying his country was paying most for European \"waste.\"[46] He later moderated his views when his government held the rotating Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 1999.[citation needed] In 2003, Schr\u00f6der and Chirac agreed to share power in the institutions of the European Union between a President of the European Commission, elected by the European Parliament, and a full-time President of the European Council, chosen by heads of state and government; their agreement later formed the basis of discussions at the Convention on the Future of Europe and became law with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon.[47] Ahead of the French referendum on a European Constitution, Schr\u00f6der joined Chirac in urging French voters to back the new treaty, which would have enshrined new rules for the expanded EU of 25 member states and widened the areas of collective action.[48] Also in 2003, both Schr\u00f6der and Chirac forced a suspension of sanctions both faced for breaching the European Union's fiscal rules that underpin the euro \u2013 the Stability and Growth Pact \u2013 for three years in a row. Schr\u00f6der later called for a revision of the Lisbon Strategy and thereby a retreat from Europe's goal of overtaking the United States as the world's most competitive economy by 2010. Instead, he urged the EU to reform the Pact to encourage growth, and to seek the reorientation of the \u20ac100,000,000,000 annual EU budget towards research and innovation.[49] By 2005, he had successfully pushed for an agreement on sweeping plans to rewrite the Pact, which now allowed EU members with deficits above the original 3% of GDP limit to cite the costs of \"the reunification of Europe\" as a mitigating factor.[50] Schr\u00f6der was regarded a strong ally of Prime Minister Leszek Miller of Poland[51] and supporter of the 2004 enlargement of the European Union.[52] On 1 August 2004, the sixtieth anniversary of the 1944 Warsaw Uprising, he apologised to Poland for \"the immeasurable suffering\" of its people during the conflict; he was the first German Chancellor to be invited to an anniversary of the uprising. Both Schr\u00f6der and Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer also supported the accession of Turkey to the European Union.[53]"

Reversing the hard-line stance of his predecessor, Helmut Kohl, he agreed to the government contributing alongside industry to a fund that would compensate people forced to work in German factories by the Nazi regime and appointed Otto Graf Lambsdorff to represent German industry in the negotiations with survivors' organisations, American lawyers and the US government.[56] Schr\u00f6der sent forces to Kosovo and to Afghanistan as part of NATO operations.[57] Until Schr\u00f6der's chancellorship, German troops had not taken part in combat actions since World War II. At the beginning of the Iraq crisis, Schr\u00f6der declared in March 2002 that Germany would not take part in the Iraq war without a UN mandate.[58] In the summer of 2002, during the federal election campaign, he proclaimed the \"German Way\" as an alternative to the \"American warmongering\" in Iraq and presented Germany as a peace power.[59] In May 2019 at WORLD.MINDS in Belgrade, 20 years to the day after the bombing of Belgrade by NATO troops, Schr\u00f6der stated unequivocally that in retrospect, if he had to make the decision again, he would authorize the aerial bombardment of the former Yugoslavia again. Schr\u00f6der said that \"the easiest solution would be to first accept Serbia into the European Union and then within, as an integral part the EU, find a solution [to the Kosovo issue].\"[60][61] With Germany having a long experience with terrorism itself, Schr\u00f6der declared solidarity with the United States after the September 11 attacks in 2001.[62] When Schr\u00f6der left office, Germany had 2,000 troops in Afghanistan,[63] the largest contingent from any nation other than the United States, UK, France, Canada and after two years Afghanistan."

Schr\u00f6der's stance caused political friction between the US and Germany, in particular because he used this topic for his 2002 election campaign. Schr\u00f6der's stance set the stage for alleged anti-American statements by members of the SPD. The parliamentary leader of the SPD, Ludwig Stiegler, compared US President George W. Bush to Julius Caesar while Schr\u00f6der's Minister of Justice, Herta D\u00e4ubler-Gmelin, likened Bush's foreign policy to that of Adolf Hitler. Schr\u00f6der's critics accused him of enhancing, and campaigning on, anti-American sentiments in Germany. After his 2002 re-election, Schr\u00f6der and Bush rarely met and their animosity was seen as a widening political gap between the US and Europe. Bush stated in his memoirs that Schr\u00f6der initially promised to support the Iraq war but changed his mind with the upcoming German elections and public opinion strongly against the invasion, to which Schr\u00f6der responded saying that Bush was \"not telling the truth\".[67] When asked in March 2003 if he was self-critical about his position on Iraq, Schr\u00f6der replied, \"I very much regret there were excessive statements\" from himself and former members of his government (which capitalised on the war's unpopularity).[68]"

        "content": "On his first official trip to Russia in late 1998, Schr\u00f6der suggested that Germany was not likely to come up with more aid for the country. He also sought to detach himself from the close personal relationship that his predecessor, Helmut Kohl, had with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, saying that German-Russian relations should \"develop independently of concrete political figures.\"[69] Soon after, however, he cultivated close ties with Yeltsin's successor, President Vladimir Putin, in an attempt to strengthen the \"strategic partnership\" between Berlin and Moscow,[70] including the opening of a gas pipeline over the Baltic Sea exclusively between Russia and Germany (see \"Gazprom controversy\" below). During his time in office, he visited the country five times. Schr\u00f6der was criticised in the media, and subsequently by Angela Merkel, for calling Putin a \"flawless democrat\" on 22 November 2004, only days before Putin prematurely congratulated Viktor Yanukovich during the Orange Revolution.[71] In 2005, Schr\u00f6der suggested at the ceremonial introduction of the Airbus A380 in Toulouse that there was still \"room in the boat\" of EADS for Russia.[72] In his last days in office in 2005 he signed a deal between Germany and Russian state-owned Gazprom to build Nord Stream 1 before leaving office and almost immediately joining the pipeline company\u2019s board.[73] He rejected criticism of the move and announced legal action over reports he would be paid between \u20ac200,000 (\u00a3134,000) and \u20ac1m a year.[74] In 2022 he was reportedly paid about $270,000 a year as chairman of the shareholder committee.[75] Only a few days after his chancellorship, Schr\u00f6der joined the board of directors of the Nord Stream joint venture, thus bringing about new speculations about his prior objectivity. In his memoirs Decisions: My Life in Politics, Schr\u00f6der still defends his friend and political ally, and states that \"it would be wrong to place excessive demands on Russia when it comes to the rate of domestic political reform and democratic development, or to judge it solely on the basis of the Chechnya conflict.\"[76] Schr\u00f6der's continued close connection to Vladimir Putin and his government after his chancellorship has been widely criticized in Germany.[77]"

Within weeks, he started to oversee the project implementation himself, leading the Nord Stream AG's shareholder committee. On 24 October 2005, just a few weeks before Schr\u00f6der stepped down as chancellor, the German government guaranteed to cover 1\u00a0billion euros of the Nord Stream project cost, should Gazprom default on a loan. However, this guarantee was never used.[110] Soon after stepping down as chancellor, Schr\u00f6der accepted Gazprom's nomination for the post of the head of the shareholders' committee of Nord Stream AG, raising questions about a potential conflict of interest.[citation needed] German opposition parties expressed concern over the issue, as did the governments of countries over whose territory gas was pumped at the time.[111] In an editorial entitled Gerhard Schroeder's Sellout, the American newspaper The Washington Post also expressed sharp criticism, reflecting widening international ramifications of Schr\u00f6der's new post.[112] Democrat Tom Lantos, chairman of the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs, likened Schr\u00f6der to a \"political prostitute\" for his recent behaviour.[113] In January 2009, the Wall Street Journal reported that Schr\u00f6der would join the board of the oil company TNK-BP, a joint venture between oil major BP and Russian partners.[114] In 2016, Schr\u00f6der switched to become manager of Nord Stream 2, an expansion of the original pipeline in which Gazprom is sole shareholder.[115] In 2017, Russia nominated Schr\u00f6der to also be an independent director of the board of its biggest oil producer, Rosneft.[116] At the time, Rosneft was under international sanctions over Russia's role in the Ukraine crisis.[116] Schr\u00f6der told Blick that he would be paid about $350,000 annually for the part-time post.[117] His decision caused an outcry in Germany and abroad, especially in a climate of fear about any potential Russian interference in the 2017 German elections.[118] German Chancellor Angela Merkel criticized her predecessor, saying in August 2017: \"I do not think what Mr Schr\u00f6der is doing is okay\".[119] In 2019 Schr\u00f6der and his wife hosted the Nordstream Race, a sailing competition which finished in Saint Petersburg at the mouth of the undersea pipeline.[108] In early February 2022, Schr\u00f6der was nominated to the board of directors of Gazprom.[120] Later that year, facing criticism in Germany, he decided against taking on the role.[citation needed] Especially as tensions between Russia and NATO mounted before the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Schr\u00f6der's stance as a \"Putinversteher\" was criticized.[121] Schr\u00f6der criticized the behaviour of the western countries as \"saber rattling\". ARD journalist Georg Schwarte stated that Schr\u00f6der would no longer be \"a former chancellor. At best\", he would be an \"ex-chancellor with a sense of money.\"[122] The current chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) said in early February 2022 that \"I don't want his advice.\"[123] In 2022, it was reported that Schroeder was paid nearly $1\u00a0million per year by Russian energy companies.[2] In their book Die Moskau Connection, journalists Bingener and Wehner describe the network around Schr\u00f6der and his support for Putin's policies. Their conclusion is:[124] Schr\u00f6der would have had quite a few opportunities to take a different path after his chancellorship. While researching this book, the authors did hear several explanations for why he did not, including defiance, greed and stubbornness. His actions nevertheless remain a mystery."

In 2006, they adopted another child from Saint Petersburg.[139] Schr\u00f6der rents an apartment in Berlin while retaining his primary residence in Hanover. As a former chancellor, he is entitled to a permanent office, also situated in Berlin. In late 2005, he spent time in the UK improving his English language skills.[140] In 2013, Schr\u00f6der and K\u00f6pf purchased another home in G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fl\u00fck, Turkey, in a real estate project developed by Nicolas Berggruen.[141][142] Schr\u00f6der's fourth marriage earned him the nickname \"Audi Man\", a reference to the four-ring symbol of Audi motorcars.[143] Another nickname is \"The Lord of the Rings\".[144][145] Schr\u00f6der married for the fifth time in 2018. His wife is South Korean economist and interpreter Kim So-yeon.[146][147] Schr\u00f6der is Lutheran-Protestant.[148] He did not add the optional phrase \"so help me God\" (So wahr mir Gott helfe) when sworn in as chancellor for his first term in 1998.[149] Schr\u00f6der is known to be an avid art collector. He chose his friend J\u00f6rg Immendorff to paint his official portrait for the German Chancellery. The portrait, which was completed by Immendorff's assistants, was revealed to the public in January 2007; the massive work has ironic character, showing the former chancellor in stern heroic pose, in the colors of the German flag, painted in the style of an icon, surrounded by little monkeys.[150] These \"painter monkeys\" were a recurring theme in Immendorff's work, serving as an ironic commentary on the artist's practice. On 14 June 2007, Schr\u00f6der gave a eulogy at a memorial service for Immendorf at the Alte Nationalgalerie in Berlin.[151]"

The floods started in the United Kingdom as flash floods causing some property damage and inconvenience. Later floods affected several river basins across Europe including Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Switzerland.[8] At least 243 people died in the floods, including 196 in Germany,[9] 43 in Belgium,[2] two in Romania,[3] one in Italy[4] and one in Austria.[5] Belgian Minister of Home Affairs Annelies Verlinden described the events as \"one of the greatest natural disasters our country has ever known.\" German minister-president Malu Dreyer of the Rhineland-Palatinate state called the floods \"devastating\". In addition to the confirmed fatalities, the flooding led to widespread power outages, forced evacuations and damage to infrastructure and agriculture in the affected areas. The damage to infrastructure was especially severe in Belgium and Germany.[10] The floods are estimated to have cost up to \u20ac2.55 billion (US$3 billion) in insured losses, with the total damage costs being much higher,[11][12] at a minimum of \u20ac10 billion (US$11.8 billion).[6] In the aftermath, scientists, activists and reporters all highlighted the connection to global trends in extreme weather, especially more frequent heavy rainfall caused by climate change.[13]"

A storm complex moved east from France into Germany and stalled over the region for two days. Precipitation was intense in the East of Belgium, with 271.5 millimetres (10.69\u00a0in) of rain over 48 hours in Jalhay and 217 millimetres (8.5\u00a0in) over 48 hours in Spa. Heavy rainfall was also seen in the south of North Rhine-Westphalia and north of Rhineland-Palatinate in Germany where accumulations averaged 100 to 150\u00a0mm (3.9 to 5.9\u00a0in) in 24 hours, equivalent to more than a month's worth of rain. In Reifferscheid, 207\u00a0mm (8.1\u00a0in) fell within a nine-hour period while Cologne observed 154\u00a0mm (6.1\u00a0in) in 24 hours. Some of the affected regions may not have seen rainfall of this magnitude in the last 1,000 years.[14] Floods started in Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland on 14 July 2021 after record rainfall across western Europe caused multiple rivers to burst their banks.[15] The European Flood Awareness System (EFAS) issued alerts of life-threatening floods in advance, which, although very vague, were delivered to national authorities.[16]"

In the town of Pepinster on the banks of the river Vesder, at least 20 houses collapsed and 23 of the 31 casualties as of 18 July were found here. The town of Verviers was also badly affected[25] and has more than 10,000 of its residents having to be moved because of homes having become uninhabitable. Widespread looting has also been a problem. Precipitation was most intense in the east of Belgium, with 271.5 millimetres (10.69\u00a0in) of rain over 48 hours in the municipality of Jalhay, in the province of Li\u00e8ge -- an absolute record for Belgium, almost three times the average rainfall over one month in this location for July. In the town of Spa, also in Li\u00e8ge, 217 millimetres (8.5\u00a0in) of rain fell over 48 hours.[26] An empty passenger train derailed at Grupont when the track bed was washed out by floodwater, with debris strewn across the track.[27] The Charleroi\u2013Namur\u2013Li\u00e8ge line, and all railway lines in Belgium south east of that line, were closed.[28] The overall damage to the rail network was estimated to take several weeks to repair.[29] Early estimates also pointed to severe damage to the agricultural sector of the country, including long-term effects like soil erosion. During the flooding itself, farms and livestock had to be evacuated and many fields were damaged and crops destroyed by inundation.[30] The Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps suffered damage to access roads and its digital safety infrastructure.[31] The circuit was due to hold the 2021 Belgian Grand Prix on 29 August;[32] damage was repaired sufficiently to allow the race to go ahead, although it was ultimately cut short after just one lap by further torrential rainfall and flooding at the circuit. Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo declared 20 July a national day of mourning.[33] In the evening of 24 July, southern and central parts of Belgium were hit again by severe flash floods as a result of intense but shorter thunderstorms. Particularly the city of Dinant and its surroundings in the province of Namur were badly hit, where tens of floating cars resulted in a pile-up and in damage to railroads.[34][35]"

On 14 July, the city of Hagen declared a state of emergency, after the Volme river started overflowing its banks.[53] The village of Kordel in Trier-Saarburg, which has around 2,000 residents, has been completely cut off.[52] Several rivers reached their highest water level to date, including the Kyll, which rose from an average level of 1 metre (3.3\u00a0ft) to 7.85 metres (25.8\u00a0ft).[58] On 15 July, Thalys train services to Germany were suspended,[59] and Deutsche Bahn stated that many rail services in North Rhine-Westphalia were also cancelled.[60] Deutsche Bahn reported that over 600 kilometres (370\u00a0mi) of track was affected in North Rhine-Westphalia. The Cologne\u2013Wuppertal\u2013Hagen\u2013Dortmund and Cologne\u2013Bonn (Main Central Station)\u2013Koblenz lines were closed. The Cologne\u2013Bonn Beuel\u2013Koblenz line remained open, but trains were subject to delay and cancellation.[28] Customers were asked to avoid travel within and to North Rhine-Westphalia by train.[61] The train connection from Dresden to Prague was also suspended after mudslides buried the tracks.[62] Along the Ahr Valley Railway, at least seven railway bridges have been destroyed.[63] In Blessem, floodwaters of the Erft river inundated a quarry on 16 July, leading to a major landslide with several people possibly dead.[64][65] Several buildings collapsed including parts of Burg Blessem\u00a0[de].[66] Around 40 meters of the nearby Bundesautobahn 1 broke away and fell into the Erft, but no cars were on the highway since it was closed.[65] Experts voiced concerns on 15 July that the Steinbachtal Dam was unstable and could burst, and 4,500 people were preemptively evacuated from parts of Euskirchen,[67] and later several thousand more from parts of Rheinbach and Swisttal.[68] Drones were deployed to inspect the dam; while no cracks were found, local politicians said the situation as of 16 July[update] remained \"critical\".[69] Several other dams in North Rhine-Westphalia, such as the Rur Dam, were also overflowing, but there were no concerns about their structural integrity.[69] Regardless, on 16 July a dam of the Rur burst near Wassenberg, prompting the evacuation of Ophoven\u00a0[de].[70][71] Around 360 inmates had to be evacuated from a prison near Euskirchen due to a failing supply of water and electricity.[72]  In Eschweiler, all of the more than 300 patients of the St.-Antonius-Hospital Eschweiler\u00a0[de] had to be evacuated.[73] On 14 July, in Hagen, a veteran soldier rescued a 13-year-old girl who required mechanical ventilation as well as two elderly people using a MAN KAT1 which was usually exhibited in a local museum, after regular rescue vehicles were unable to get there in time.[74] Strong rainfall also led to flooding in the states of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and Saxony. As of 15 July, one person in Saxony remains missing.[75] Further strong rainfall on 17 July caused flooding in Saxony and Bavaria  e.g. Berchtesgadener Ache, where at least one person died.[76][77] The flooding damaged the K\u00f6nigssee bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton track where it washed away part of the track that will take until October 2022 to rebuild.[78] Direct damage caused by the flooding in Germany was estimated at \u20ac33.4 billion with further \u20ac7.1 billion in indirect damage.[79]"

On 15 July, King Willem Alexander and Queen M\u00e1xima visited the town.[84] After the floodwaters had receded, damage was assessed at \u20ac400 million, half of which was physical damage and half being business losses. 2,300 families were affected in the town, 700 homes were rendered uninhabitable, and a bridge had collapsed. As of 21 July, the town was still subject to an evacuation order.[85] The River Meuse in Limburg reached its highest summertime level in over 100 years, according to authorities, and was expected as of 15 July[update] to surpass the winter records set in 1993 and 1995.[86] On 14 July, the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute gave a code red highest warning for Limburg.

In the end, the dyke held. The Dutch government declared the flooding to be an official disaster. More than 10,000 people were evacuated in Venlo and the neighbouring communities Belfeld, Steyl and Arcen on the same evening.[89][90] The VieCuri Hospital\u00a0[nl] in Venlo was also evacuated as a precaution against flooding from the Maas. A total of 240 patients were transferred to other hospitals in the region. It reopened on 21 July.[91][92] Rainfall was in excess of 100 millimetres (3.9\u00a0in) in a day and 200 millimetres (7.9\u00a0in) over three days, said to be a once-in-a-millennium event.[91] The state of emergency in Limburg was lifted on 21 July. The Dutch Army was drafted in to assist in the cleanup and with repairing damage.[92] Heavy rain in the early hours of 25 July caused flooding in the north west of Friesland.

Thames Water received more than 2,500 calls relating to overflowing sewage, stating that the rainfall had surpassed the design capability of their sewage system; the heaviest rainfall occurred close to high tide, resulting in sewers that empty into the River Thames being unable to do so.[100] In Notting Hill, floodwaters rose by 1.5\u00a0ft (0.46\u00a0m) in less than five minutes.[101] Sloane Square tube station was closed after floodwater from street level surged down stairways into the underground station; Chalk Farm, Hampstead and Wimbledon stations were also closed due to flooding.[100] There was also a reduced level of service at Euston railway station, the London terminus of the West Coast Main Line and across the London Overground and Thameslink networks.[100] Overnight into 13\u00a0July, more than 120 residents of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea were placed into emergency accommodation due to severe flooding in the borough.[102] Elsewhere in England, flooding was reported in the city of Southampton, blocking roads and railway lines.[102] On 25 July, London was again hit by thunderstorms and flash floods.

Mann from Penn State University, Hayley Fowler of Newcastle University and Kai Kornhuber of Columbia University pointed to a slowing in the jet stream as a possible explanation.[124] Stefan Rahmstorf of the University of Potsdam warned that further losses of Arctic ice would likely result in a weaker jet stream and more extreme weather, saying \"we should not play with this sensitive climate system\".[132] In the aftermath of the flooding, a spokesperson of the World Meteorological Organization called for more action against climate change.[133] On 13 July 2023, the European Union declared 15 July as the Annual EU Day for the Victims of the Global Climate Crisis, the date was chosen to commemorate the floods of 2021.[134]"

The season ran from November 1, 1994, until April 30, 1995, with the first disturbance of the season developing on November 12 and the last disturbance leaving the base on March 5. The most intense tropical cyclone during the season was Tropical Cyclone Violet, which briefly existed within the basin. After the season, the name William was retired from the tropical cyclone naming lists. During the season, tropical cyclones were officially monitored by the Fiji Meteorological Service, New Zealand's MetService, and Australia's Bureau of Meteorology. Throughout the season, the United States Navy also monitored the basin and issued unofficial warnings through its Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) and Naval Pacific Meteorology and Oceanography Center (NPMOC). Tropical cyclones that were located between the Equator and 25\u00b0S were monitored by the FMS, while any that were located to the south of 25\u00b0S were monitored by MetService. During the season, the JTWC issued warnings on any tropical cyclone that was located between 160\u00b0E and 180\u00b0 while the NPMOC issued warnings for tropical cyclones forming between 180\u00b0 and the American coast. The FMS, MetService, and BoM all used the Australian Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale and measured windspeeds over a 10-minute period, while the JTWC and the NPMOC measured sustained windspeeds over a 1-minute period."

The basin remained quiet until December 13, when Tropical Depression 04P developed to the east of the Solomon Islands before going on to affect Fiji and Tonga.[2] During the final days of 1994, several areas of low pressure developed within the South Pacific Convergence Zone between 8\u00b0S and 16\u00b0S, and 180\u00b0W and 160\u00b0W. During December 30, one of these areas of low pressure developed into a tropical depression within the northern Cook Islands, just to the east of Pukapuka Atoll.[3] Over the next couple of days, the depression moved southeastwards towards the Southern Cook Islands and gradually developed into Tropical Cyclone William.[4] Throughout its lifetime, William moved southeast and affected parts of French Polynesia and the Cook Islands before becoming extratropical on January 3.[5] After William left the basin on January 5, the basin remained quiet until March 6, when Severe Tropical Cyclone Violet briefly crossed into MetService's area before crossing back to the BoM's area hours later.[6] After the season had ended, the name William was retired from the tropical cyclone naming lists due to its destructive effects. In 1995, the World Meteorological Organization designated the FMS as a Regional Specialized Meteorological Center.[7]"

On November 14, the FMS named the system Vania, after it had become a category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian scale.[8][9][11] Intensifying further, Vania moved through northern Vanuatu on November 15 as a category 2 tropical cyclone.[9] Later that day, the FMS predicted that Vania would become a hurricane and issued a hurricane warning; however, Vania had peaked as a category 2 tropical cyclone with peak 10-minute sustained windspeeds of between 100\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph), while the JTWC estimated that the system had peaked with 1-minute sustained windspeeds of 110\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph).[9][11] [8] Over the next couple of days, the system stalled and started to move westwards, before the FMS and JTWC issued their final advisories on the cyclone during November 18, as it had weakened below tropical cyclone intensity and degenerated into a sheared depression to the north of New Caledonia.[8][9][11] The remnant low-level circulation was last noted during November 19, while they were located about 80\u00a0km (50\u00a0mi) to the west of Port Vila.[9] Within Vanuatu, preparations had been completed for a storm-force cyclone, before the FMS issued a hurricane warning at 18:15\u00a0VUT (07:15\u00a0UTC) on November 15, which prompted a higher response from the residents of the island nation.[8] The warning proved problematic as it was issued just after it had gone dark, which caused the higher response to be done in darkness when the winds were becoming stronger, which endangered residents.[8] It was later realised that the hurricane warning should not have been issued, as only storm-force winds were experienced over Vanuatu, while various weather stations reported winds below 75\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph).[8] Overall, the system had a minimal impact on the island nation, with damage reported to crops and bush houses, while heavy rain associated with the cyclone helped break a long dry spell of weather in Vanuatu.[4] Vania also brought rain to parts of Fiji that were responsible for severe flooding within Tailevu Province, which in turn caused over 100 hectares (250 acres) of crops to be damaged and the deaths of a significant number of farm animals.[8][12][13]"

The third named storm of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season, Cristobal formed on July 19 from a trough of low pressure off the Southeast U.S. Coast. In a marginally favorable environment, it attained minimal tropical storm status later that day. The storm remained offshore, and peaked as a strong tropical storm on July 21 while it passed east of Cape Hatteras. It accelerated northeast parallel to the East Coast and became extratropical on July 23 near Nova Scotia. Because it was a weak storm and never made landfall, Cristobal's effects were mostly limited to moderate rainfall. The storm dropped 3.43 in (87\u00a0mm) of rain in Wilmington, North Carolina, where minor flooding was reported. Additionally, the extratropical remnants contributed to rainfall on Nova Scotia which caused some street and basement flooding."

Late on July 18, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) remarked that a tropical depression was developing,[7] with its convection becoming more concentrated around a circulation; at 11 p.m. EST on July 18 (0300\u00a0UTC July 19), it was classified as Tropical Depression Three, about 65\u00a0miles (105\u00a0km) southeast of Charleston, South Carolina.[8] Located between a ridge to its southeast and northwest, the depression moved slowly northeastward, and with a marginally favorable upper-level environment, it attained minimal tropical storm status during the early afternoon of July 19.[9] Initially fairly disorganized with little deep convection,[10] dry air in the mid- to-upper-levels of the atmosphere prevented immediate intensification.[11] However, late on July 20 thunderstorm activity increased.[12] Cristobal remained a fairly weak tropical storm as it tracked adjacent to the Carolina coast, and the storm never made landfall. It reached peak intensity as a strong tropical storm on July 21 while it passed east of Cape Hatteras, and remained such over the warm Gulf Stream waters as convection became strong over the southern portion of the circulation.[13] Beginning to enter cooler waters, the cyclone accelerated east-northeastward on July 21 and July 22.[14] On the afternoon of July 22, Cristobal began to weaken south of Nova Scotia. In the evening hours, satellite imagery indicated that the mid-level center became separated from the low-level center.[15] The storm's cloud pattern became disorganized, and by July 23 it had completed an extratropical transition. The National Hurricane Center issued its last advisory on the system at 5:00 am EDT (0900 UTC) on July 23.[16]"

In Lake Wales, 6\u00a0inches (150\u00a0mm) of precipitation was reported, most of which fell within the period of two hours. The sudden, heavy rainfall clogged storm drains, causing some street flooding.[21] Up to 40 cars were pulled from flooded streets, some being submerged with 2\u00a0ft (0.6\u00a0m) of water. Damages from the flooding was estimated at $10,000.[22] In Georgia, the storm produced 3.48 inches (88\u00a0mm) of rain, while in South Carolina, 2.60 inches (66\u00a0mm) was recorded.[23] On July 20, Cristobal skirted eastern North Carolina, resulting in minimal damage. Along the coast, water levels rose 1 foot (0.30\u00a0m) above normal;[24] rough surf was also reported.[25] Rainfall averaged 0.5 to 1.5 inches (13 to 38\u00a0mm), though the NEXRAD weather radar estimates indicated that isolated amounts exceeded 4 inches (100\u00a0mm).[24] The storm dropped 3.43\u00a0in (87\u00a0mm) in Wilmington, North Carolina, where minor flooding occurred. Because the bulk of the storm remained over open waters, winds along the coast ran about 25\u00a0mph (40\u00a0km/h).[26] While the center of Cristobal was more than a day away from the Canadian Maritimes, moisture extended ahead of the cyclone and became enhanced by a stalled frontal system. As a result, heavy rainfall fell along the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia.[17] At Baccaro Point, 224\u00a0mm (8.8\u00a0in) of rain was reported, while 145\u00a0mm (5.8\u00a0in) fell at Sambro, near Halifax. The rain flooded basements and streets in the Cape Sable area.[27] A sailor from Connecticut was rescued 250\u00a0km (160\u00a0mi) to the southeast of Halifax when his ship capsized in stormy seas.[28] The highest winds remained offshore, though a buoy recorded gusts to 58 miles per hour (93\u00a0km/h).[17]"

Most of the languages spoken today in Solomon Islands derive from this era, but some thirty languages of the pre-Austronesian settlers survive. Most of the people that settled there back then were Papuans (see East Papuan languages). There are preserved numerous pre-European cultural monuments in Solomon Islands, notably Bao megalithic shrine complex (13th century AD), Nusa Roviana fortress and shrines (14th \u2013 19th century), Vonavona Skull island \u2013 all in Western province.

In June 1893, Captain Herbert Gibson of HMS\u00a0Curacoa, declared the southern Solomon Islands a British protectorate.[12][13] No immediate steps to place administrators in the Solomon Islands, which were made part of the British Western Pacific Territories (BWPT), which was administered by a high commissioner who resided in Fiji.  \nThe Colonial Office appointed Charles Morris Woodford as the Resident Commissioner in the Solomon Islands on 17 February 1897. He was directed to control the labour trade operating in the Solomon Island waters and to stop the illegal trade in firearms.[14] Arthur Mahaffy was appointed as the Deputy Commissioner to Woodford in January 1898.[15][16] In January 1900, Mahaffy established a government station at Gizo, as Woodford considered Mahaffy\u2019s military training as making him suitable for the role of suppressing headhunting in New Georgia and neighbouring islands.[16][17] In 1898 Britain annexed the Santa Cruz and the Rennell and Bellona Islands.\nIn 1900, under the terms of the Treaty of Berlin (14 November 1899), Germany transferred Choiseul, Santa Isabel, the Shortlands and Ontong Java Atoll Islands to the British Solomon Islands Protectorate, but retained Bougainville and its surrounding islands. Germany granted this claim in exchange for the British giving up all claims to Western Samoa. In 1927 District Commissioner William R. Bell was killed on Malaita, along with a cadet named Lillies and 13 Solomon Islanders in his charge. A massive punitive expedition, known as the Malaita massacre, ensued; at least 60 Kwaio were killed, nearly 200 detained in Tulagi (the protectorate capital), and many sacred sites and objects were destroyed or desecrated.

Stability was restored during the 1950s, as the British colonial administration built a network of official local councils. On this platform Solomon Islanders with experience on the local councils started participation in central government, initially through the bureaucracy and then, from 1960, through the newly established Legislative and Executive Councils. Positions on both Councils were initially appointed by the High Commissioner of the British Protectorate but progressively more of the positions were directly elected or appointed by electoral colleges formed by the local councils. The first national election was held in 1964 for the seat of Honiara, and by 1967 the first general election was held for all but one of the 15 representative seats on the Legislative Council (the one exception was the seat for the Eastern Outer Islands, which was again appointed by electoral college). Elections were held again in 1970 and a new constitution was introduced. The 1970 constitution replaced the Legislative and Executive Councils with a single Governing Council. It also established a 'committee system of government' where all members of the Council sat on one or more of five committees. The aim of this system was to reduce divisions between elected representatives and the colonial bureaucracy, provide opportunities for training new representatives in managing the responsibilities of government. It was also claimed that this system was more consistent with the Melanesian style of government. However this was quickly undermined by opposition to the 1970 constitution and the committee system by elected members of the council. As a result, a new constitution was introduced in 1974 which established a standard Westminster form of government and gave the Islanders both Chief Ministerial and Cabinet responsibilities. Solomon Mamaloni became the country's first Chief Minister in July 1974."

That area was then still occupied by the tribal owners of the land. Unfortunately for them Point Cruz had a deep-water harbour and was only a few miles away from the Guadalcanal Plains, where Henderson airfield was built by the Americans during WWII. The landowners accepted the need for such military effort based on their land, presuming it would be returned to them afterwards. In the meantime they moved out, over to the Weather Coast on the opposite side of the island, settling in and around an area called Bambanakira. \nBut they were never compensated. Efforts to resolve this issue as late as 1998 by Ezekiel Alebua, then Guadalcanal Premier, were thwarted and for just a few million dollars ($SBD). Ethnic bias within the bureaucracy and authorities at the time was well known. As well, in the late 90s suburban development had been accelerating on the outskirts of Honiara, whole suburbs of squatters mainly of Malaitan origin. Exacerbating the problem, the police had refused to properly investigate a growing series of violent murders, all of Guadalcanal men in and around Honiara. \nIn early 1999 long-simmering tensions between the local Guale people on Guadalcanal and more recent migrants from the neighbouring island of Malaita erupted into violence. The 'Guadalcanal Revolutionary Army', later called Isatabu Freedom Movement (IFM), began terrorising Malaitans in the rural areas of the island to make them leave their homes. About 20,000 Malaitans fled to the capital and others returned to their home island; Guale residents of Honiara fled. The city became a Malaitan enclave. Meanwhile, the Malaita Eagle Force (MEF) was formed to uphold Malaitan interests. The Government appealed to the Commonwealth Secretary General for assistance. The Honiara Peace Accord was agreed on 28 June 1999. Despite this apparent success the underlying problems remained unresolved and had already resulted in the death or serious injury of 30,000 civilians.[citation needed] The accord soon broke down and fighting broke out again in June 2000. Malaitans took over some armouries at their home island and Honiara and helped by that, on 5 June 2000 the MEF seized the parliament by force. Through their spokesman Andrew Nori, they claimed that the government of the then Prime Minister, Bartholomew Ulufa'alu, had failed to secure compensation for loss of Malaitan life and property. Ulufa\u2019alu was forced to step down. On 30 June 2000 Parliament elected by a narrow margin a new Prime Minister, Manasseh Sogavare. He established a Coalition for National Unity, Reconciliation and Peace, which released a program of action focused on resolving the ethnic conflict, restoring the economy and distributing the benefits of development more equally. However, Sogavare's government was deeply corrupt and its actions led to the downward economic spiral and the deterioration of law and order.[citation needed] The conflict was foremost about access to land and other resources and was centered on Honiara. Since the beginning of the civil war it is estimated[when?] that 100 have been killed. About 30,000 refugees, mainly Malaitans, had to leave their homes, and economic activity on Guadalcanal was severely disrupted. Continuing civil unrest led to an almost complete breakdown in normal activity: civil servants remained unpaid for months at a time, and cabinet meetings had to be held in secret to prevent local warlords from interfering. The security forces were unable to reassert control, largely because many police and security personnel were associated with one or another of the rival gangs. In July 2003 the Governor General of Solomon Islands issued an official request for international help, which was subsequently endorsed by a unanimous vote of the parliament. Technically, only the Governor General's request for troops was necessary. However, the government then passed legislation to provide the international force with greater powers and resolve some legal ambiguities. On 6 July 2003, in response to a proposal to send 300 police and 2,000 troops from Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Papua New Guinea to Guadalcanal, warlord Harold Keke announced a ceasefire by faxing a signed copy of the announcement to the Solomons Prime Minister, Allan Kemakeza. Keke ostensibly leads the Guadalcanal Liberation Front, but has been described as marauding bandits based on the isolated southwestern coast (Weather Coast) of Guadalcanal. Despite this ceasefire, on 11 July 2003 the Solomon Islands Broadcasting Corporation broadcast unconfirmed reports that supporters of Harold Keke razed two villages. In mid-July 2003, the Solomons parliament voted unanimously in favour of the proposed intervention. The international force began gathering at a training facility in Townsville. In August 2003, an international peacekeeping force, known as the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI) and Operation Helpem Fren, entered the islands. Australia committed the largest number of security personnel, but with substantial numbers also from other South Pacific Forum countries such as New Zealand, Fiji, and Papua New Guinea (PNG). It acts as an interim police force and is responsible for restoring law and order in the country because the Royal Solomon Islands Police force failed to do so for a variety of reasons. Peacekeeping forces have been successful in improving the country's overall security conditions, including brokering the surrender of a notorious warlord Harold Keke in August 2003. In 2006, riots broke out following the election of Snyder Rini as Prime Minister, destroying part of Chinatown and displacing more than 1,000 Chinese residents; the large Pacific Casino Hotel was also totally gutted.[23] The commercial heart of Honiara was virtually reduced to rubble and ashes.[24] Three National Parliament members, Charles Dausabea, Nelson Ne'e, and Patrick Vahoe,[25] were arrested during or as a result of the riots. The Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI), the 16-country Pacific Islands Forum initiative set up in 2003 with assistance from Australia, intervened, sending in additional police and army officers to bring the situation under control. A vote of no confidence was passed against the Prime Minister. Following his resignation, a five-party Grand Coalition for Change Government was formed in May 2006, with Manasseh Sogavare as Prime Minister, quelling the riots and running the government. The military part of RAMSI was withdrawn in 2013 and rebuilding took shape.[26] In 2009, the government is scheduled to set up a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, with the assistance of South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu, to \"address people\u2019s traumatic experiences during the five-year ethnic conflict on Guadalcanal\".[27][28] The government continues to face serious problems, including an uncertain economic outlook, deforestation, and malaria control. At one point, prior to the deployment of RAMSI forces, the country was facing a serious financial crisis. While economic conditions are improving, the situation remains unstable."

Schools and businesses were closed down as police and government forces clashed with protesters. Violence escalated as Honiara's Chinatown was looted.[35][36] Most of the protesters came from Malaita Province.[37][38] Australia responded to the unrest by deploying Australian Federal Police and Australian Defence Force personnel following a request from the Sogavare government under the Australia\u2013Solomon Islands Bilateral Security Treaty.[39] Papua New Guinea, Fiji and New Zealand also sent peacekeepers.[40][41]"

An estimated 49,000\u00a0people were affected by the floods, of whom 9,000\u00a0were left homeless.[43][44] As the precursor tropical low to Ita affected the Islands, local authorities issued heavy flood warnings, tropical disturbance and cyclone watches.[45]\nNearly two days of continuous heavy rains from the storm caused flash flooding in the Islands.[46] Over a four-day span, more than 1,000\u00a0mm (39\u00a0in) fell at the Gold Ridge mine in Guadalcanal, with 500\u00a0mm (20\u00a0in) falling in a 24\u2011hour span.[47] The Matanikau River, which runs through the capital city Honiara, broke its banks on 3 April and devastated nearby communities. Thousands of homes along with the city's two main bridges were washed away, stranding numerous residents.[46] The national hospital had to evacuate 500\u00a0patients to other facilities due to flooding.[48] Graham Kenna from Save the Children stated that, \"the scale of destruction is like something never seen before in the Solomon Islands.\"[49] According to Permanent Secretary Melchoir Mataki, the majority of homes destroyed in Honiara were built on a flood plain where construction was not allowed.[43] Severe flooding took place on Guadalcanal.[46] Immediately following the floods, Honiara and Guadalcanal were declared disaster areas by the Solomon Government.[50] Debris left behind by the floods initially hampered relief efforts, with the runway at Honiara International Airport blocked by two destroyed homes. Food supplies started running low as the Red Cross provided aid to the thousands homeless. The airport was reopened on 6 April, allowing for supplies from Australia and New Zealand to be delivered.[44] Roughly 20\u00a0percent of Honiara's population relocated to evacuation centers as entire communities were swept away.[51] There were fears that the flooding could worsen an already ongoing dengue fever outbreak and cause outbreaks of diarrhea and conjunctivitis.[43] New Zealand offered an immediate NZ$300,000 in funds and deployed a C-130 Hercules with supplies and emergency response personnel.[51] Australia donated A$250,000 on 6 April and sent engineers and response teams to aid in relief efforts.[52] On 8 April, Australia increased its aid package to A$3\u00a0million while New Zealand provided an additional NZ$1.2\u00a0million.[43][53] Taiwan provided US$200,000 in funds.[54]"

Eventually, it approached Charleston, South Carolina by 1\u00a0September, before making landfall near Cape Lookout, North Carolina on 3\u00a0September, where the hurricane's effects lasted for three days.[2] The storm then swept inland, curving east of Wilmington and nearing New Bern soon thereafter. The hurricane subsequently veered northeastward at Edenton, its deviation in track coinciding with a shift in winds toward the northeast west of the system's trajectory.[3] Tracking northeast, the system entered the Chesapeake Bay and passed into the open waters of the Atlantic Ocean after transiting over Norfolk, Virginia on 5\u00a0September, and continued to parallel the East Coast of the United States.[4] Gales were observed on Long Island and in portions of New England, with heavy rain and strong winds noted.

On the evening of 31\u00a0August, the 140-ton British vessel Spring, which originated from Liverpool, was beached near Cape Romain within the vicinity of the Raccoon Keys. Massive waves caused the boat to disintegrate, and the crew fled on a longboat toward Charleston, South Carolina, surviving but losing the ship's cargo.[5] The craft Brutus, meanwhile, overturned while en route toward Charleston from New York City, suffering the loss of its rigging and main boom. Despite experiencing damage to its cargo of cheese and potatoes, the ship arrived in Charleston safely. Meanwhile, off of Savannah, Georgia, the storm dismasted the clipper Richmond Packet which was delivering Spanish wine. Along the coast of Charleston, high waves prevented ships from docking at port, and boats did not remain with their moorings, with one breaking free and washing aground at James Island. Moving up the coast, the storm leveled fields of cotton, pushed salt water upstream, and destroyed dams protecting rice fields on the Cooper River, destroying the year's harvest. An editor of the newspaper Savannah Republican composed a poem reflecting upon and lamenting the plight of seamen who died in the storm.[6] At Sullivan's Island near Charleston, the hurricane beached several vessels, and from Charleston to Georgetown, intense gusts and copious rainfall ruined cotton and rice fields in low-lying regions.[7] The hurricane destroyed ships from Cape Fear to Currituck, North Carolina, ruined crops, uprooted forests, displaced gristmills, and demolished roads inland.[8] At Wilmington, the storm inflicted damage to numerous buildings, among them the Cape Fear Bank, which suffered the loss of its chimneys. The city's wharves also experienced moderate damage, with a sloop from Bermuda capsizing and a brig separating from port, drifting toward a nearby plantation. A saltworks at Masonboro Island and several other offshore barrier islands endured severe damage, with the hurricane producing a 14\u00a0ft (4.3\u00a0m)-high storm surge in some regions, driving thousands of pounds of salt to sea. In all, the salterns at Masonboro Island suffered approximately $60,000 (1815\u00a0USD) in losses. Damage was similarly severe near Bear Island and locations along the White Oak River. At Swansboro, meanwhile, two schooners struck a sand bar and another two were grounded nearby,[9] and three other vessels later washed into a nearby forest. A second saltworks was obliterated, and on a nearby beach, a residence was destroyed, with five family members drowned. A second house was also swept away, with four individuals inside killed.[10] Majestic shade trees throughout the state were uprooted, and doors of houses near Cape Lookout burst open despite being firmly locked shut. At Edenton, the hurricane was believed to have been worse than the 1806 Great Coastal hurricane. Winds uprooted numerous trees at Fayetteville, obstructing roads, with similar impacts at Raleigh. Significant crop damage was also noted at Winston-Salem, where fences were toppled, and fields of corn, orchards, and forests ruined.[3] The remnants of a small unidentified vessel were discovered, abandoned, near the origin of the New River, likely delivering cheese from New England. At Beaufort on the Outer Banks, several structures along the shoreline experienced damage, and several under construction ships were wrecked. Nearby at the Shackleford and Bogue Banks, several watercraft were destroyed. On the eastern sector of the latter, Fort Hampton was nearly washed away by the high storm surge generated by the hurricane.[10] The barracks of the fort were lifted afloat for some time, with survivors clinging to its roof. To the north, another 30\u00a0boats were found destroyed near Ocracoke. Six men were killed after being knocked overboard upon the Julia, which was washed aground between Hatteras and Ocracoke. Additionally, a number of vessels were grounded near Cape Hatteras. Inland, thousands of trees and many structures were toppled, and fields of crops were flooded, disrupting the impending harvests. New Bern suffered especially acutely, with the waters of the Neuse River breaking their banks and inundating the town with 6\u00a0ft (1.8\u00a0m) of water;[11] there, the flood was considered to be the worst since 1795.[3] Buildings disintegrated under the force of high winds and flood waters, and many people attempted to escape their residences. Meanwhile, at Washington, the storm caused the neighboring Pamlico River to rise at a speed of 15\u00a0in (38\u00a0cm) per hour before peaking at a height 8\u00a0ft (2.4\u00a0m) above normal. Massive amounts of lumber and naval goods were swept away by the high waters, and numerous ships broke free of their moorings, of which two were beached.[4] Four British ships were forced to dock at Norfolk, Virginia after experiencing damage on 5\u00a0September, and at Long Island, similarly severe gales were endured by ships at Long Island. Heavy rain occurred in sections of New England on 5\u00a0and 6\u00a0September, though no significant damage occurred.[3]"

About 80% of buildings in the mainland centres of Shute Harbour, Airlie Beach and Cannonvale were severely damaged. Some damage occurred also inland at Proserpine where, following 24-hours of heavy rain that accompanied the storm,  the Proserpine River peaked at 11.16\u00a0metres: its highest recorded flood. Fourteen people died and property damage was estimated at A$390\u00a0million (1997 values).[3] Like Tropical Cyclone Tracy that devastated Darwin on Christmas Eve 1974, Ada was small in diameter (estimated width 30\u00a0km) and damage from her path was limited to a comparatively small geographical area. The wind from Tropical Cyclone Ada was not felt in Bowen (60\u00a0km to the north) or Mackay (120\u00a0km to the south).  However, the heavy rains did cause flooding in the Pioneer River (Mackay) and the Don River (Bowen). Before degenerating into a rainstorm Cyclone Ada travelled further inland to the Cathu State Forest (83\u00a0km north-west of Mackay behind the small Bruce Highway township of Calen) and caused extensive damage to the eucalypts, rainforest and pine plantations in that area. It was as a result of complaints about the lack of timely warning about the 1970 cyclone that the Bureau of Meteorology introduced the cyclone warning siren that now accompanies all media broadcasts and telecasts of cyclone warnings in Queensland."

        "content": " The 1923 Atlantic hurricane season featured 11\u00a0tropical cyclones, 9\u00a0of which intensified into tropical storms, the most since 1916. Four of the tropical storms intensified into hurricanes, one of which reached major hurricane intensity\u2014Category 3 or higher on the modern-day Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale.[1] No tropical storms or hurricanes formed in or entered the Caribbean Sea.[2] The first known system, a tropical depression, formed on June\u00a019, while the last known system, a tropical storm, transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on October\u00a026. A total of Additionally, an October tropical depression was previously recognized as a tropical storm until reanalysis in 2009, while the first and third tropical storms were added to the Atlantic hurricane database that year. The sixth, seven, and eight storms as well as the October tropical depression existed simultaneously on October\u00a016. Four tropical cyclones made landfall in the United States during 1923, with three striking the Gulf Coast of the United States and the other hitting Massachusetts. The first of the four, which struck Louisiana in June, mostly produced excessive rainfall along the Gulf Coast and parts of the East Coast. A storm which formed in the eastern Pacific basin around October\u00a012 struck Louisiana as a Category\u00a01 hurricane on October\u00a016. The system caused some damage to coastal areas, especially between New Orleans, Louisiana, and Pensacola, Florida. Just two days later, a tropical storm also struck Louisiana; it caused less damage, though four people died after a ship capsized in Perdido Bay. On October\u00a019, a cyclone struck Massachusetts, but produced mostly beneficial rainfall in New England. The fifth system and the October tropical depression caused significant impact as extratropical cyclones. The former left at least 9\u00a0deaths and about $300,000 (1923\u00a0USD) in damage in Atlantic Canada, while the latter was attributed to 2\u00a0fatalities and more than $1\u00a0million in damage along the East Coast of the United States. The season's activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 49\u00a0units,[1] well below the 1921\u20131930 average of 76.6.[3] ACE is a metric used to express the energy used by a tropical cyclone during its lifetime. Therefore, a storm with a longer duration will have high values of ACE. It is only calculated at six-hour increments in which specific tropical and subtropical systems are either at or above sustained wind speeds of 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h), which is the threshold for tropical storm intensity. Thus, tropical depressions are not included here.[1]"

It remained at that intensity for the next three days while drifting slowly northeastward, while its pressure continued to gradually fall. By late June\u00a025 it had begun to become better organized and move more swiftly to the north-northeast as a tropical storm. The storm clipped the southeastern Louisiana coastline and made landfall as a minimal tropical storm over extreme southern Mississippi and Alabama on June\u00a026. The system weakened into a tropical depression while over southeastern Alabama late on June\u00a026.[2] The cyclone turned in a more easterly direction under the influence of an extratropical low.[4] On June\u00a027, it regained tropical storm intensity as it reached the Atlantic Ocean off the Georgia\u2013South Carolina coast. On June\u00a028, the cyclone reached a peak intensity of 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h) and a peripheral pressure of 999\u00a0mbar (29.5\u00a0inHg). At this time, the extratropical low to the northwest began to affect this tropical storm more heavily,[4] causing it to lose tropical characteristics around 00:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a029.[2] Excessive rains fell in the vicinity of the cyclone and farther up the East Coast of the United States,[4] which mostly proved beneficial, especially for cotton crops in North Carolina and South Carolina.[5] This storm was first introduced to the Atlantic hurricane best track in a 2009 reanalysis of the season.[4]"

On September\u00a030, a weather station on Bermuda recorded a sustained wind speed of 81\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h).[4] The hurricane caused minor damage to the electrical and telephone plant, as well as slight impact to vessels anchored at the harbor. Additionally, several buildings \"of a temporary nature\" lost their roofs, according to the Montreal Gazette.[7] The remnants of the storm brought wind gusts up to 66\u00a0mph (106\u00a0km/h) to Nova Scotia. Winds toppled trees and power, telegraph, and telephone lines throughout the province, while also leaving sporadic damage to structures. Heavy rains fell over the province, including a total of 4.1\u00a0in (100\u00a0mm) in Sydney. The resultant flooding inundated low-lying areas of the city with up to 15\u00a0ft (4.6\u00a0m) of water, submerging at least 40\u00a0homes and damaging bridges. Winds and floods caused significant damage to apple orchards, especially in Annapolis Valley. Damage in Nova Scotia alone exceeded $300,000. On Prince Edward Island, the storm damaged or destroyed 23\u00a0bridges, while winds toppled trees and knocked out communications. Winds caused mostly minor damage in Newfoundland, though rainfall washed out several roads and swept away many small bridges in the vicinity of Conception Bay.

Several washouts occurred along the Louisville and Nashville Railroad in New Orleans and eastward, causing a suspension of service. At Lake Pontchartrain, tides partially flooded Milneburg and Spanish Fort.[10] Mississippi experienced the highest storm surge, which peaked at approximately 7\u00a0ft (2.1\u00a0m) above mean low tide at Gulfport.[4] Along the coast of the state, the storm surge and tides capsized rowboats and small launches and destroyed small piers. The Mississippi and Gulf Coast Traction Company reported about $35,000 in damage to its railroads.[11] In Alabama, an observation site in Mobile recorded wind gusts up to 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h).[4] Storm surge and abnormally high tides inundated low-lying coastal areas of the state, with 4\u00a0ft (1.2\u00a0m) of water on the beachfront road in Bayou La Batre.

Early on October\u00a020, the storm turned northward while situated just east of Andros Island and passed over or near several western Bahamian islands throughout the day. The system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone by 12:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a021 about 290\u00a0mi (465\u00a0km) east of Daytona Beach, Florida. However, the extratropical remnants intensified, reaching sustained winds of 85\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) early on October\u00a023 \u2013 equivalent to a Category\u00a01 hurricane. Moving north-northwestward, the extratropical low struck Virginia near the southern end of the Delmarva Peninsula later that day. After entering Canada, the system curved east-northeastward over Quebec and crossed the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and Newfoundland before re-emerging into the Atlantic on October\u00a026. The low was last recorded to the east-southeast of the southern tip of Greenland on October\u00a029, though historic weather maps suggest that the system may have persisted until November\u00a02.[4] In Virginia, the remnants of the depression produced sustained winds up to 56\u00a0mph (90\u00a0km/h) at Cape Henry.[4] Storm surge and abnormally high tides inundated parts of Norfolk, particularly at Willoughby Spit. Coastal flooding submerged many roads in the city, with up to 1\u00a0ft (0.30\u00a0m) of water on the streets in the business district. Significant erosion occurred between Willoughby Spilt and Cape Henry.[14] Rough seas in Ocean City, Maryland, damaged a portion of a seawall and two cottages. Approximately 50\u00a0children at a school were sent home after a wave swept over a boardwalk adjacent to the same street as the school.[15] Coastal flooding inundated the harbor-front section of Baltimore, with two blocks inland submerged.[16] Heavy rainfall from the storm washed out the dirt shoulders of a newly completed state highway in Delaware.[17] Along the coast, storm tides threatened to topple the Cape Henlopen Lighthouse. Rehoboth Beach lost significant amounts of sand, while a hotel and several cottages suffered coastal flooding damage.[18] One person in Delaware died from exposure during the storm.[19] In Pennsylvania, winds downed trees in and around Philadelphia, some of which blocked traffic after falling onto roads and other causing electrical outages after collapsing onto power lines.[20] The remnants of the depression produced strong winds in New Jersey, with a gust of 82\u00a0mph (132\u00a0km/h) in Atlantic City.[4] The city was among the hardest hit in the state. Many trees and tree limbs, including fruit and shade trees, suffered damage or destruction throughout the city. Downed electrical wires left many power outages. Waves swept over the Atlantic City boardwalk and adjacent meadow lands.[21] New York also experienced significant impact, especially in Brooklyn and Long Island. High winds downed numerous signs, telephone poles, and trees.[22] A tree crashed onto a feed wire in Nassau County, leaving all of the county south of Roslyn without electricity.[23] Heavy rainfall caused several head-on car accidents, while a pedestrian was run over and killed. The storm also capsized or wrecked many small boats and vessels and left many other watercraft missing. Waves washed away part of a portion of a seawall on Coney Island, while sections of Brooklyn experienced coastal flooding, particularly at Greenpoint.[22] Damage in the United States totaled at least $1\u00a0million.[24] In Canada, the extratropical cyclone dropped up to 3.4\u00a0in (86\u00a0mm) of rainfall in Ontario. Montreal in the province of Quebec observed 2.8\u00a0in (71\u00a0mm) of precipitation. The heavy rainfall flooded the Wellington Street subway station with up to 4\u00a0ft (1.2\u00a0m) of water, delaying tramcar operations. Throughout the province, floodwaters damaged or destroyed about 60\u00a0bridges.[25]"

By late on October\u00a016, the system peaked with maximum sustained winds of 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h). The cyclone turned northwestward on October\u00a017.[2] The storm then weakened slightly to winds of 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h) prior to making landfall on Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts at 09:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a019 and then near New Bedford a few hours later. After moving inland, the system rapidly lost tropical characteristics and transitioned into an extratropical storm over Vermont late on October\u00a019, shortly before dissipating altogether.[2] In Massachusetts, Nantucket observed sustained winds of 48\u00a0mph (77\u00a0km/h).[4] Due to drought conditions, rainfall produced by the storm in Massachusetts was mostly beneficial, especially in the area around the Watuppa Ponds and Quequechan River.[26] Precipitation in New Hampshire resulted in slippery roads, which caused some minor car accidents.[27]"

        "content": "A tropical storm was first observed in the Bay of Campeche around 12:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a016. For a brief time on October 16, there were three tropical storms active in the Atlantic simultaneously. The storm tracked northeastward and progressively moved faster throughout its duration as a tropical cyclone. Late on October\u00a017, the system peaked with maximum sustained winds of 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h) while curving northward. Around 01:00\u00a0UTC on the following day, the storm made landfall near Mississippi City, Mississippi, at the same intensity. Although the system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone just 11\u00a0hours later over western Tennessee, the extratropical low moved northeastward across the Midwestern United States and eastern Canada; it was last noted over Baffin Bay late on October\u00a021.[2] In Mexico, Salina Cruz observed sustained winds of 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h). Other locations in Mexico reported only light winds. The highest measured sustained wind speed in the United States was 56\u00a0mph (90\u00a0km/h) at Pensacola, Florida.[4] The city also observed 6.82\u00a0in (173\u00a0mm) of precipitation in a 24-hour period.[28] In Perdido Bay, waves smashed the schooner Bluefields into a reef, forcing the eight occupants to abandon ship and swim to shore. Four survived; the other four drowned.[29] Rough seas in Lake Pontchartrain caused a barge to crash into a draw bridge spanning the Rigolets, shifting the bridge about 3\u00a0ft (0.91\u00a0m) from its foundation and forcing the Louisville and Nashville Railroad to suspend service between New Orleans and Gulfport, Mississippi.[30] The storm produced heavy rains and relatively strong winds over portions of the Mississippi River Valley and Midwestern United States, with Toledo, Ohio, observing a sustained wind speed of 43\u00a0mph (69\u00a0km/h).[4]"

Early the next day, the storm peaked with maximum sustained winds of 45\u00a0mph (75\u00a0km/h). The cyclone then curved northward late on October\u00a026 and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone approximately 220\u00a0mi (355\u00a0km) south of Bermuda.[2]"
