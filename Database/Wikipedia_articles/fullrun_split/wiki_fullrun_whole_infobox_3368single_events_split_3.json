        "content": "Hurricane Emily was a powerful early season tropical cyclone that caused significant damage across the Lesser Antilles, the Caribbean, and Mexico. The fifth named storm of the record-breaking 2005 Atlantic hurricane season, Emily is one of only two Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes on record in the month of July, along with Hurricane Beryl in 2024. It formed on July\u00a011 from a tropical wave, which progressed westward across the Atlantic. Three days later, the hurricane struck Grenada before entering the eastern Caribbean Sea. After fluctuating in intensity, Emily strengthened to attain maximum sustained winds of 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph) on July\u00a016 while passing southwest of Jamaica. Slight weakening occurred before Emily made landfall along Mexico's Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula on July\u00a018. Quickly crossing the peninsula, Emily emerged into the Gulf of Mexico and reorganized, making a second landfall in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas on July\u00a020. It rapidly weakened and dissipated over land. Just ten months after Hurricane Ivan's damaging path through the Caribbean, Emily wrought additional damage to the Lesser Antilles, damaging or destroying hundreds of homes. A landslide killed a person on Grenada, and damage on the island totaled US$110.4\u00a0million. Later, five people died in Jamaica due to a vehicle accident, while ten people died in Haiti related to floods from the storm. Emily's impacts occurred as far south as Honduras, where one person drowned due to river flooding from the storm. In northeastern Mexico, the hurricane left widespread power outages, affecting 200,000\u00a0people, with additional flood damage during its last landfall. Damage in Mexico was estimated at over US$843.3\u00a0million, with five deaths in the country."

        "content": "On July 6, a tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa. Moving westward, the disturbance gradually organized until July\u00a010, at which point convection became more concentrated, and it is estimated Tropical Depression Five formed in the central tropical Atlantic that evening.[1] Late on July\u00a011, it strengthened and was named Tropical Storm Emily. Initially forecast to strengthen rapidly and move west-northwest through the Greater Antilles, Emily instead moved almost due west toward the Windward Islands, remaining a moderate tropical storm. The storm languished while moving quickly west, and struggled with maintaining its form. Contrary to the normal occurrence that hurricanes leave a cold wake behind, Hurricane Dennis had made portions of the Caribbean warmer,[2] and therefore more favorable for tropical cyclone development. Late on July\u00a013, Emily strengthened rapidly and reached hurricane strength while passing north of Tobago and entering the eastern Caribbean. On July\u00a014, Emily made landfall in northern Grenada with 85\u00a0mph (137\u00a0km/h) winds.[1] The intensification trend picked up again the next day with a fairly rapid drop in the storm's central pressure as it entered the southeastern Caribbean Sea, a region typically unfavorable for intensification. Hurricane Emily's winds increased in reaction, briefly bringing the storm to Category 4 strength early on July\u00a015. During the day, the storm's strength fluctuated greatly, dropping to a Category\u00a02 storm before reintensifying to a Category\u00a04. On July\u00a016, Emily strengthened considerably, reaching peak Category 5 winds of 160\u00a0mph (260\u00a0km/h). Initially at this point, Emily was thought to have peaked as a Category\u00a04 storm, but the post-storm analysis showed it was indeed a Category\u00a05 hurricane.[1] Unrelated to Emily, Typhoon Haitang developed and intensified into a Category 5-equivalent super typhoon around the same time Emily intensified into a Category 5 hurricane, marking the first time since Typhoons Ivan and Joan in 1997 when two tropical cyclones of Category 5 strength existed simultaneously in the Northern Hemisphere.[3] The storm weakened slightly as it continued westward, and remained a Category\u00a04 while passing south of Jamaica and, on July\u00a017, the Cayman Islands. Emily continued on its nearly straight track to the west-northwest, weakening somewhat but remaining at Category\u00a04 strength until striking Cozumel just before mainland landfall at Playa del Carmen at 06:30\u00a0UTC on July\u00a018. Sustained winds were 130\u00a0mph (210\u00a0km/h), and the eyewall passed directly over Cozumel.[1] The center of circulation emerged over the Gulf of Mexico later that morning.[1] Passage over land disrupted the hurricane's center of circulation, and it had weakened to a minimal hurricane with wind speeds of 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h). However, several hours over the warm waters of the western Gulf provided the energy needed for Emily to regenerate, and by midnight wind speeds were increasing. The increase in wind speed stalled, but the storm continued to become better organized. Emily started to show very symmetrical outflow, but the hurricane's strongest winds were being found at three different distances from the center. However, the outer wind radii subsided in the end, and the inner core prevailed. The result was a rapid strengthening of the inner core on the evening of July\u00a019. The pressure dropped about 30\u00a0millibars and the winds went from 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) to more than 125\u00a0mph (201\u00a0km/h), all within a few hours.[1] Further strengthening was expected by forecasters, but did not come.[1] The storm's motion slowed, and the center began wobbling erratically toward the coast. The storm made landfall around 11:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a020 near San Fernando in Tamaulipas. The storm had sustained winds of 125\u00a0mph (201\u00a0km/h), Category\u00a03 on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale. After heading inland over northeast Mexico, it dissipated over the Sierra Madre Oriental on July\u00a021.[1]"

This left fewer buildings as reliable shelters and many homes without roofs by the arrival of Emily.[6] Of the 80\u00a0buildings considered for public shelters, 45 were used as such, with 1,650\u00a0people seeking refuge in them.[7] Residents rushed to stock up on emergency supplies, resulting in heavy road traffic.[6] The International Federation of Red Cross And Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) described residents to be in \"panic\"; grocery stores were emptied and stretches of cars lined at gas stations.[8] The Grenada Red Cross Society affirmed their stockpile of 2,000 jerry cans, 600 blankets, 100 tarps, 50 cots, and 10 generators.[9] They also coordinated evacuations with local transportation services.[8] The nation's government enacted a curfew from 7:00\u00a0p.m. July\u00a014 to 6:00\u00a0a.m. July\u00a015 local time.[7] Telecommunication services Cingular and Digicel suspended service as a precaution.[10] In the easternmost Caribbean Island of Barbados, the government ordered the closure of businesses while residents stocked up on emergency supplies.[11] Shelters were opened nationwide, and local radio stations broadcast regular warnings to alert the public.[12] A delegate from the Panama Regional Delegation was sent to assist the local chapter of the Red Cross.[8] The Dominica Red Cross Society confirmed emergency resources were properly stockpiled.[9] Trinidad and Tobago activated its National Emergency Centre and ordered the closure of commerce.[8] Approximately 544 people sought refuge in shelters across Trinidad and Tobago.[13] BP evacuated all but 11 essential workers from their 14 oil platforms around the nation. Businesses shuttered across St. Vincent and the Grenadines and St. Lucia. Although airports remained open, British Airways cancelled flights to and from Hewanorra International Airport.[6] The St. Lucia Red Cross placed ten response teams on standby. The Antigua and Barbuda Red Cross placed 100 personnel on standby.[9] The Pan American Disaster Response Unit (PADRU), already prepping its response to Hurricane Dennis, allocated supplies for the anticipated effects of Emily.[9] In Venezuela, a few oil tankers were forced to remain at Puerto la Cruz.[14] Some flights were cancelled or delayed as early as July\u00a012.[15] Residents were alerted to the possibility of floods and mudslides.[16] A red alert was issued for Aragua and 100\u00a0personnel were deployed to coastal communities.[17] People living or visiting the Los Roques Archipelago were advised to remain sheltered in their homes.[18] Conditions were considered safe by July\u00a015 and activities returned to normal.[19] Alerts were also raised for the nearby islands of Aruba, Bonaire, and Cura\u00e7ao.[16]"

The Jamaica Red Cross moved supply stockpiles originally intended for Dennis-related relief to southern areas of the island in preparation for Emily.[8] The nation's Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management advised residents to check their disaster supply kits, ensure their property was secured, and be prepared to evacuate. Fishermen, especially those out by the Morant Cays and Pedro Bank, were advised to return to port.[21] Prime Minister P. J. Patterson ordered J$100,000 be made available for each of the nation's constituencies. A further J$250,000\u2013300,000 would be allocated for the activation of public shelters.[20] Thousands of people were evacuated from coastal communities, including all of Port Royal and many from Portmore. Government offices were closed beginning on July\u00a015 and local businesses were advised to do the same.[22] Upon the onset of the storm, a total of 3,269 people were utilizing public shelters.[23][24] On July\u00a014, residents of the Cayman Islands were alerted to the potential effects of Emily.[25] The following day shelters were opened across the territory: all but one on Grand Cayman, two on Cayman Brac, and one on Little Cayman. Owen Roberts and Charles Kirkconnell International Airports shut down for the duration of the hurricane.[10] Water Authority - Cayman shut down services starting the night of July\u00a016 with utilities to be reactivated after the storm. The territory's government enacted a curfew and warned all residents that emergency services would not be responding to calls during the storm.[26] Already severely impacted by Hurricane Dennis, alerts were raised for four departments in Haiti on July\u00a015: Grand'Anse, Ouest, Sud, and Sud-Est. In neighboring Dominican Republic, storm alerts were issued for the towns of Ban\u00ed and Pedernales.[27]"

The agency transported 30\u00a0t (30 long tons; 33 short tons) of supplies, rescue vehicles, communication teams, and pantry trailers to the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.[28] Preparations to evacuate thousands of residents from coastal communities (up to 0.62\u00a0mi (1\u00a0km) inland) in the eastern Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula began on July\u00a016, including the islands of Cozumel, Holbox, and Mujeres.[29] Supermarkets in M\u00e9rida were packed with residents stocking up on supplies. Officials in the state of Yucat\u00e1n opened 1,118 shelters. Emergency services prepped response units for medical needs.[30] State authorities in Campeche prepared 624 shelters with a collective capacity of 85,000 persons.[31] A state of alert was raised for Veracruz, prompting the readying of shelters.[32] Considered an \"extremely dangerous\" storm, with a trajectory mirroring Hurricane Gilbert in 1988, the highest level of alert was issued for the states of Yucat\u00e1n and Quintana Roo on July\u00a017.[33][34] Residents in these areas were advised to stockpile supplies, board up their homes, and shelter in sturdy structures; travel during the storm was advised against.[33] In response to this, \"massive\" evacuations began that day. With the region being a tourist destination, an estimated 120,000 people were visiting at the time of Emily's approach. Local officials ordered the evacuation of 85,000 people, and the complete relocation of guests at beach hotels in Canc\u00fan.[34] An estimated 60,000 people were relocated to gymnasiums, hotels, and schools farther inland. Some hotels packed 15 people into a single room. Approximately 2,000 tourists from three hotels locked inside a gymnasium without air conditioning or fans by soldiers.[35] On July\u00a016, Canc\u00fan International Airport saw 340\u00a0departing flights, 100 more than normal.[34] The Mexican military mobilized in preparation for rescue operations.[36] Numerous oil platforms owned by Pemex in the Gulf of Mexico were evacuated\u2014approximately 15,800 workers\u2014and two ports used for crude oil exports were closed.[35][37] Two pilots died during the evacuation process when their helicopter crashed amid high winds.[35] Hotel guests were evacuated on Saturday afternoon, and staff on Sunday afternoon. Though some hotel guests in second floor rooms and above were given the option to be bussed into the center of Canc\u00fan to safe houses and shelters or to stay and wait out the storm in only the modern built hotels and resorts. Most of the remaining guests were restricted to their rooms and were not allowed out on the beach areas. No alcohol was sold in Canc\u00fan for 36\u00a0hours prior to the arrival of the storm, in an attempt to avoid drunken tourists being injured during the night. A German resident was electrocuted on his roof in Playa del Carmen while preparing for the storm.[38]"

Although the storm was expected to remain in the Caribbean, county officials identified supplies used for Dennis-related relief; an influx of fuel was expected to normalize reserves before any potential impact.[44] On July\u00a017, the American Red Cross began preparations to open shelters and had emergency supplies deployed for rapid distribution in South Texas.[45]"

These rains caused extensive flooding, reaching a depth of 3\u00a0ft (0.91\u00a0m) in some locations, with an estimated 200\u2013300 homes being inundated.[57][13] Rivers in the country's capital, Port of Spain, and across central Tobago topped their banks; many roads were inundated.[58] Thirty people required evacuation in Chaguanas. Flooding in Couva left Caparo Village temporarily isolated.[59] At least 16\u00a0homes lost their roof and 2\u00a0collapsed amid gusty winds. Approximately 40\u00a0percent of residences\u201415,630 Trinidad and Tobago Electricity Commission customers: 11,000 in Trinidad and 4,330 in Tobago\u2014lost power and communications were temporarily lost with a town in the northern part of the country.[7][57] In San Juan\u2013Laventille, the Aranguez Bridge was rendered impassable after its supporting gabions were washed away.[59] Landslides occurred along multiple sections of the Blanchisseuse Road between Matelot and Toco.[13] Strong winds downed power lines on the island, one of which sparked a fire.[5] Two homes were destroyed and thirty others were damaged across Trinidad while extensive flooding was reported island-wide.[57][60] Striking Grenada as a hurricane, Emily inflicted extensive damage to the already storm-battered nation. Hurricane-force winds tore roofs from homes, devastated agriculture, and worsened the nation's struggling economy. Nationwide, 2,641\u00a0homes were damaged and of which at least 120 were destroyed, leaving 167 families homeless. Of the impacted homes, 1,153 were in Saint Andrew Parish alone.[10][61] Emily resulted in one fatality in Saint Andrew Parish from a landslide and significant damage in northern parts of the country, including Carriacou and Petite Martinique which had been spared from the worst effects of Ivan.[7][62] A hospital in Carriacou lost its roof, forcing the relocation of patients, and many homes were damaged in Petite Martinique. Hardest hit were areas within Saint Andrew and Saint Patrick Parish Parishes.[7] Mount Rich, located within the latter parish, saw the destruction of half its homes.[62] A police station in Sauteurs lost its roof.[7] Two of the main hospitals were flooded,[7] including the one just rebuilt with assistance from Cuba after Ivan.[63] Flooding affected communities in Saint George's, notably in Grenville.[7] Much of the nation lost its water supply, though restoration of power quickly remedied this.[62] The slowly recovering agricultural industry was devastated, with progress made in the wake of Ivan destroyed. Cash crops including corn, pigeon peas, and bananas were largely lost while breadfruit, nutmeg, and cocoa trees were negatively impacted.[64] Damages in Grenada amounted to $110.4\u00a0million.[65] In St. Vincent and the Grenadines, various islands experienced differing degrees of damage. The most extensive occurred on Union Island where 21 homes were damaged, 17 severely. On Canouan, four homes had their roof torn off and three others had major damage. The roof of Canouan Airport was also damaged, though it continued operating normally.[13] No structural damage occurred in St. Lucia; some debris washed ashore, however.[59] One child was injured on St. Vincent. Losses to the banana crop were minimal.[13] Heavy rainfall began impacting Jamaica on July\u00a016, with floods soon commencing in Trelawny Parish. More than 100 people required evacuation.[23] Extensive flooding occurred in Saint Elizabeth Parish, with many roads rendered impassable or washed away altogether. Destruction of a coastal road rendered Treasure Beach inaccessible.[66] Five people died when their vehicle was swept into a lake near Myersville.[66][46] In Manchester Parish, at least 20 homes were inundated by floodwaters.[66] Landslides were reported in eastern Jamaica, triggered by heavy rain as the storm passed south of the island.[67] Damage in Jamaica was estimated at $65\u00a0million.[65] Heavy rainfall associated with Emily killed 10 people and affected 500 families in Saint-Marc, Haiti, as homes and vehicles were swept away.[50] In Honduras, a man drowned in a river swollen by rains from Emily.[38]"

Areas in Playa del Carmen, Tulum and Cozumel sustained the most severe impact. In a few instances, concrete utility poles were snapped in half by powerful wind gusts. Due to the relatively fast movement of Emily, rainfall was fairly light, peaking at 4.9\u00a0in (120\u00a0mm). Few meteorological reports exist during Emily's passage of the Yucat\u00e1n, though an unofficial station recorded a storm surge of 15\u00a0ft (4.6\u00a0m) in San Miguel, Cozumel.[1] Along the mainland, surge heights were generally less than 4\u00a0ft (1\u00a0m). Additionally, waves reached 13\u00a0ft (4\u00a0m), resulting in some beach erosion and damage to dunes and coral reefs. Additionally, 0.7\u00a0mi (1.1\u00a0km) of retaining walls sustained damage, leaving areas vulnerable to flooding from future storms.[68] The high winds produced by Emily caused considerable impact in Quintana Roo, especially in the municipality of Solidaridad, leaving nearly 200,000 residences without power. In terms of structural damage, 851 homes were impacted in varying degrees. Roughly 13,345 acres (5,401 hectares) of forests and agricultural land was affected by the storm; some swathes of trees experienced defoliation. The most substantial losses associated with the hurricane stemmed from the tourism industry, with hotels experiencing 947\u00a0million pesos ($88.7\u00a0million) worth of damage. More than 12,500 rooms, nearly one-fifth of the state's available hotel infrastructure, sustained damage. Overall, damage in the state reached 1.11\u00a0billion pesos ($104.3\u00a0million).[68]"

        "content": " Hurricane Ophelia was a long-lived tropical cyclone in September 2005 that moved along an erratic path off the East Coast of the United States for much of its existence. The fifteenth named storm and the eighth hurricane of the record-breaking 2005 Atlantic hurricane season, Ophelia originated from a complex set of systems across the Atlantic in early September. An area of low pressure consolidated near the Bahamas and was classified as Tropical Depression Sixteen on September\u00a06. Stuck in a region of meager steering currents, largely dominated by a lull between two ridges to the north and east, this system moved along a looping course with a general northward trajectory. The following day it organized into Tropical Storm Ophelia and soon reached hurricane status on September\u00a08. Over the next week, Ophelia's intensity oscillated between tropical storm and hurricane levels due to intrusions of dry air, varying levels of wind shear, and gradual upwelling of cooler waters along its meandering path. Gradually growing in size, the system reached hurricane strength for the fourth time and its peak strength on September\u00a014, with maximum sustained winds of 85\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h). By this time Ophelia had completed a second loop and was moving northwest toward North Carolina. Changing direction once again, the system turned away from the state though its eyewall scraped the coastline for two days. The system degraded to tropical storm strength for a final time on September\u00a016 as it began accelerating northeast. Becoming embedded within the westerlies, Ophelia transitioned into an extratropical cyclone the next day. Remaining on a steady east-northeast to northeast path for the next week, Ophelia traversed Atlantic Canada and the northern Atlantic Ocean before dissipating on September\u00a023 over the Norwegian Sea. Ophelia's erratic track prompted warnings and watches for a large swath of the Eastern Seaboard, ultimately a greater area than necessary. With the storm occurring on the heels of Hurricane Katrina, state governments were quick to prepare shelters out of an abundance of caution. National Guard servicemen were deployed to North Carolina while thousands more were on standby there and in South Carolina. More than 2,000 people used public shelters as Ophelia approached land. As the hurricane's core remained largely offshore, its impacts were significantly less than feared. Some coastal locales saw heavy rain, notably more than 15\u00a0in (380\u00a0mm) in the Outer Banks of North Carolina. The greatest impacts were felt in North Carolina, where more than 240,000 people lost power and more than 1,500 homes were damaged. Total monetary losses in the state were estimated at $70\u00a0million.[nb 1] Extensive beach erosion occurred due to the hurricane's prolonged effects. Tropical storm-force wind gusts and heavy rain caused minor damage in Florida, Massachusetts, and South Carolina. Rough seas led to one fatality in Florida and left another person missing in South Carolina while rain-slicked roads contributed to a fatal accident in North Carolina. Atlantic Canada saw negligible effects as Ophelia's remnants traversed the region; one person died after falling from his roof while preparing for the storm. In the storm's wake, 37 of North Carolina's counties were declared disaster areas. The Federal Emergency Management Agency provided roughly $5.2\u00a0million in public assistance and the National Guard assisted with distribution of relief supplies."

        "content": "The 2005 Atlantic hurricane season was the most active on record at the time by numerous metrics, with 28 tropical or subtropical storms forming throughout the year. It also proved to be a ruinous year, with thousands of fatalities and more than $100\u00a0billion in damage.[1] Above-normal sea surface temperature anomalies, averaging 1.8\u00a0\u00b0F (1\u00a0\u00b0C) in the western tropical Atlantic and Caribbean Sea contributed to the development of these storms.[2] The Climate Prediction Center determined four primary factors driving the season's activity: the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation, the reduction of atmospheric convection in the tropical Pacific, record-high sea surface temperatures in the tropical Atlantic and Caribbean, and conducive wind and pressure patterns across the western Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico.[3] Additionally, the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO) was in a neutral phase, lowering the likelihood of storms making landfall on the East Coast of the United States and leading to a concentration of impacts farther west.[4] September saw considerable activity, with five hurricanes developing.[5]"

        "content": "On September\u00a01, 2005, a cold front emerged off the East Coast of the United States and propagated southeast. The system became increasingly elongated into a trough over the following days, eventually extending from near the Florida Peninsula east to the edge of Tropical Depression Lee east of Bermuda. By September\u00a04, two defined areas of low pressure consolidated along the trough: one south of Bermuda that would later become Hurricane Nate and the second near the Bahamas which would become Hurricane Ophelia.[6] Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center (NHC)[nb 2] described the dual lows as a \"complex scenario\" and stated that possible tropical cyclogenesis would be slow to occur.[8] Initially drifting south, the latter system reversed course on September\u00a05 as convection organized around the low within an area of favorable upper-level conditions.[6][9] Based on satellite data and synoptic observations, the NHC estimated that Tropical Depression Sixteen formed around 06:00\u00a0UTC[nb 3] on September\u00a06 between Andros and Grand Bahama.[6] Winds at Freeport and Settlement Point reached 30\u00a0mph (45\u00a0km/h).[11] Situated within a region of weak steering currents, the depression drifted generally north and later north-northwest, crossing Grand Bahama around 16:00\u00a0UTC.[6] Wind shear displaced convection north of the broad center as it traversed the northern Bahamas.[12] Initially, the system consisted of three defined mesoscale convective systems (MCS) spanning an area 120\u00a0mi (200\u00a0km) across, each producing areas of heavy rain. Throughout September\u00a06, the MCSs congealed into a single spiral rainband and the precursor to an eyewall.[13]"

        "content": "Early in the storm's lifecycle, meteorologists struggled with a complex track forecast as models depicted a wide-range of scenarios for the depression.[14] Some models took the system into the Gulf of Mexico and others kept the system off the coast of the Southeastern United States.[15][14] The cyclone was stuck between two lobes of the subtropical ridge to the north as a strong trough moved off the eastern United States.[15] The system became more organized on September\u00a07 and intensified into Tropical Storm Ophelia approximately 115\u00a0mi (185\u00a0km) east-southeast of Cape Canaveral, Florida.[6] This marked the earliest formation of a season's fifteenth named storm. This record was later tied by Hurricane Nate in 2011 and subsequently broken by Tropical Storm Omar on September\u00a01, 2020.[16] Becoming embedded within a broad trough extending from Florida, through Ophelia and Nate, and all the way east to Hurricane Maria over the central Atlantic, Ophelia executed a slow counter-clockwise loop. During this time it steadily intensified as banding features coalesced around the storm.[6][17] High sea surface temperatures of 84\u00a0\u00b0F (29\u00a0\u00b0C) fueled bursts of deep convection throughout September\u00a08. Following the formation of an eyewall and well-defined upper-level outflow,[18][19][20] Ophelia intensified into a hurricane around 21:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a08 with sustained winds reaching 75\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h).[6][20] The hurricane's prolonged lack of movement resulted in the upwelling of cooler waters which in turn caused it to weaken back to a tropical storm early on September\u00a09.[6][21] Later on September\u00a09, Ophelia began moving slowly northeast in response to a mid-latitude trough.[22] The storm soon developed a 12\u00a0mi (19\u00a0km) wide eye and regained hurricane status around 18:00\u00a0UTC.[23][24] Soon thereafter, increasing wind shear and intrusions of dry air into the hurricane's core caused degradation of its structure.[25] However, Ophelia's structure once again improved late on September\u00a010 with a 35\u00a0mi (55\u00a0km) wide eye developing;[26] this coincided with it regaining hurricane status for the third time.[6] Concurrently, it attained its lowest central pressure of 976\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.82\u00a0inHg).[23] Over the next two days the hurricane executed a clockwise loop within an area of weak steering between two ridges. Its slow movement led to further upwelling of cooler waters even over the relatively warm Gulf Stream.[6][27] Gradual degradation of the hurricane's structure occurred as it looped back to the west-southwest, with meager convection unable to maintain vertical mixing.[28] Sea surface temperatures beneath the system had plummeted to an average of 74.3\u00a0\u00b0F (23.5\u00a0\u00b0C) by this time,[29] and with insufficient heat content convection within the eyewall collapsed. Slightly warmer waters farther from the center helped support a broken ring around the decaying center.[30] By 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a012, Ophelia weakened back to a tropical storm for the third time.[23] An unusual eyewall replacement cycle commenced with its inner core dissipating and a larger eye organizing around it; its radius of maximum wind doubled from about 30\u00a0mi (50\u00a0km) to 60\u00a0mi (100\u00a0km). This differed from classical replacement cycles as Ophelia never displayed defined concentric eyewalls, rather the inner one degraded as the outer one formed.[30] After completing the two-day-long loop, the storm proceeded along a slow northwest and later northward trajectory toward the Carolinas.[31]"

        "content": "After remaining largely steady-state from September\u00a012 into the early part of September\u00a013,[32] convection became increasingly organized as it moved back over the Gulf Stream.[33] Maintaining a broad circulation, the storm's smaller core rotated erratically within it while the overall system progressed steadily north.[34] Ophelia regained hurricane strength for a fourth and final time early on September\u00a014.[32] The system displayed an increasingly organized eye once again and expansive outflow aloft. The ridge previously halting the hurricane's northward motion began accelerating off the New England coastline; however, westerly flow in its wake would not be strong enough to induce significant acceleration of Ophelia. Accordingly the hurricane began an \"excruciatingly long passage\" along the shores of North Carolina.[35] Throughout September\u00a014, the storm's eye expanded to a diameter of 60\u00a0mi (95\u00a0km).[36] A more defined inner eyewall featured small vortices which enhanced the vertical mixing of winds.[37] Around 12:00\u00a0UTC it attained maximum sustained winds of 85\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h), the highest during its existence.[23] Over the next two days, the hurricane's eyewall scraped the North Carolina coastline bringing hurricane-force winds to these areas. A station at Cape Lookout measured a peak two-minute sustained wind of 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h) while an unverified gust of 104\u00a0mph (167\u00a0km/h) was reported in Davis.[38] Ophelia once again became caught between two ridges on September\u00a015 as it turned east.[39] Over a two-day period, Ophelia's eyewall impacted areas from Wilmington to Morehead City.[32] The combination of dry air coming from land and cooler shelf waters caused convection on the hurricane's west side to collapse; its proximity to the Gulf Stream enabled it to maintain convection elsewhere in its circulation.[39] Ophelia pulled away from North Carolina early on September\u00a016 as it weakened to a tropical storm for the final time.[32] The storm accelerated east late on September\u00a016 as it became embedded within the mid-latitude westerlies.[40] An approaching baroclinic wave over the Great Lakes also induced a northward component to Ophelia's track.[41] Increasing shear displaced convection north of its center and caused its core to become vertically tilted.[40] After a brief resurgence in convection,[42] Ophelia began transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on September\u00a017 as it interacted with an approaching trough. Its surface center became increasingly separated from the strongest winds and thunderstorm activity.[43] During this time the storm made its closest approach to Massachusetts, passing 70\u00a0mi (110\u00a0km) to the southeast of Cape Cod.[32] Ophelia completed its extratropical transition by 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a018 as it approached Nova Scotia.[32][23] The system remained just offshore, with its center scraping the coast of Guysborough County in the eastern portion of the island. It then traversed the Cabot Strait before making landfall in south-central Newfoundland around 18:00\u00a0UTC with maximum winds of 50\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h).[23][41] Ophelia traversed the island within six hours, emerging over the north Atlantic Ocean by September\u00a019.[23][32] The cyclone continued along an east-northeast to northeast path for several days as it spun down. Ophelia ultimately dissipated on September\u00a023 over the Norwegian Sea.[32]"

This was the first such mission conducted into a tropical cyclone. Flying at an altitude of 2,500\u00a0ft (760\u00a0m), the vehicle measured peak winds of 85\u00a0mph (137\u00a0km/h). A concurrent NOAA Hurricane Hunter mission corroborated the vehicle's measurements, and the project was considered a success.[47] This was followed two weeks later by the first successful Aerosonde core penetration of a tropical cyclone within Typhoon Longwang near Taiwan.[48] The final research mission into Ophelia was conducted on September\u00a017, focusing on its extratropical transition. A collaborative effort between NOAA and Canada's Atmospheric Environment Service, two recon missions were flown into the storm to study structural changes during this transitory period.

Schools in the county were closed on September\u00a08 over flooding concerns. Fourteen ships departed Naval Station Mayport to avoid the storm.[53] Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission search and rescue teams previously sent to Mississippi returned to the state. Mariners as far west as Tallahassee were advised of possible adverse conditions.[55] Shipment of the Space Shuttle external tank to NASA's Vehicle Assembly Building at the Kennedy Space Center was delayed in order to protect the equipment. The tank was originally meant to be delivered to a facility in New Orleans but that structure was closed indefinitely due to damage from Hurricane Katrina.[56][57] Concerns over flooding were raised in Polk County with areas already heavily saturated ahead of the storm. Pumping of water into Lake Rosalie was authorized by the South Florida Water Management District, but the pumps were unlikely to arrive in time.

There, breaking waves of 6 to 8\u00a0ft (1.8 to 2.4\u00a0m) caused moderate beach erosion. Water reached the banks of a canal in Palm Coast, with occasional splashes over the top on September\u00a09.[101] A portion of State Road A1A was undermined by erosion and closed near Flagler Beach.[102] The Florida Department of Transportation used  dump trucks to shore up the road with large rocks.[103] On September\u00a011, a father and daughter were pulled out to sea off Duval County; they were later rescued.[102] Squall lines associated with the storm produced locally heavy rain and strong winds, with a storm spotter in Duval estimating winds of 62\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h). Minor street flooding occurred in a poor drainage area within Jacksonville.[104] A peak storm surge of 3.03\u00a0ft (0.92\u00a0m) was measured in Mayport.[105] A small area along the east-central coast experienced tropical storm-force winds, with a NASA station in Cape Canaveral reporting sustained winds of 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h) and a gust to 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h).[38] On September\u00a012, the body of a man was found in Palm Beach Shores near an empty boat; his death is presumed to be the result of rough seas produced by Ophelia.[106] The entire east coast saw at least 1\u00a0in (25\u00a0mm) of rain, with accumulations exceeding 5\u00a0in (130\u00a0mm) in northeastern coastal counties.[107] Accumulations were greatest in Flagler County where three-day rainfall totals reached 15.2\u00a0in (390\u00a0mm) in Palm Coast;[108] this was the highest total from Ophelia in the state.[109] Secondary roads saw up to 12\u00a0in (300\u00a0mm) of standing water in poor drainage areas in the city.[108] The collective effects of Ophelia and six other tropical cyclones that impacted Florida in 2005 led to the addition of 20.2\u00a0mi (32.5\u00a0km) of critically eroded beaches and 0.2\u00a0mi (0.32\u00a0km) of critically eroded inlet shorelines.[110] In South Florida, temperatures rose 3\u20135\u00a0\u00b0F (1.7\u20132.8\u00a0\u00b0C) above normal.[111] Effects from Ophelia in Georgia were limited to the immediate coastline, with these areas largely receiving 3\u00a0in (76\u00a0mm) of rain at most.

Additionally, there was an unverified measurement of a gust to 103\u00a0mph (166\u00a0km/h) in Davis.[38][119]  Tropical storm-force wind gusts extended as far as 100\u00a0mi (155\u00a0km) inland.[119] Offshore, the ship Sanmar (callsign V2EX) measured sustained winds of 74\u00a0mph (119\u00a0km/h) about 85\u00a0mi (140\u00a0km) east-southeast of Morehead City.[38][128] Persistent onshore flow resulted in the entire coastline experiencing a storm surge of at least 1\u00a0ft (0.30\u00a0m).[119] Surge was greatest along the interior Pamlico Sound, especially along the lower reaches of the Newport, Neuse, and Pamlico Rivers;[38] however, the peak coincided with low tide.[129] A peak surge of 8\u00a0ft (2.4\u00a0m) occurred along Clubfoot Creek.[119] The displacement of water left parts of the Sound's seafloor exposed.[130] Ocean-facing coastlines of Carteret and Onslow Counties saw surges of 4 to 6\u00a0ft (1.2 to 1.8\u00a0m).[38] Near Atlantic Beach, two cannons, an anchor, and other debris from the Queen Anne's Revenge were uncovered by churning waters.[131] Heavy rain accompanied the storm's three-day impact, with the greatest totals occurring along the immediate coastline.[38] Peak accumulations were concentrated in Brunswick County, reaching a maxima of 17.5\u00a0in (440\u00a0mm) at the Oak Island water treatment plant.[38][129] Accumulations as much as 12\u00a0in (300\u00a0mm) extended northward to Oracoke Island.[119] Trace amounts of rain fell across half the state.[129] Heavy rainfall across Brunswick County caused widespread flooding. At least 200 homes were damaged on Bald Head Island and floodwaters briefly isolated 15 houses during the storm. Floodwaters reached a depth of 4\u00a0ft (1.2\u00a0m) in some locations, rendering roads impassable.[129] A 50\u00a0ft (15\u00a0m) section of coastal road was washed away in Ocean Isle.[73] Wind damage was confined to eastern areas of the county and consisted of minimal structural damage and downed trees.[129] Damage across Carteret County was primarily concentrated in coastal communities and barrier islands.[119] Numerous docks and piers were damaged or destroyed.[132] About 100\u00a0ft (30\u00a0m) of the 1,000\u00a0ft (300\u00a0m) long Bogue Inlet Pier was destroyed.[133] Six homes were destroyed and 120 others were damaged in Salter Path. In Emerald Isle, 25 people required rescue.[134] The county's beaches lost a total of 1,427,388\u00a0cubic yards (1,091,316 cubic meters) of sand, with Emerald Isle accounting for about one-third of this.[135] Wind gusts up to 84\u00a0mph (135\u00a0km/h) in New Hanover County prompted officials to suspend emergency patrols; however, police and firefighters remained on-call.[73] Damage across the county reached $4.9\u00a0million, with barrier islands suffering the brunt of damage. A total of 636 structures sustained varying degrees of damage with wind being the primary cause.[136] Coastal erosion was extensive, with Carolina Beach, Kure Beach, and Wrightsville Beach losing 25 to 80\u00a0percent of their beaches extending into the primary protective dunes. Septic tanks were exposed in some areas.[129] At least 1\u00a0ft (0.30\u00a0m) of water covered a main road in Carolina Beach.[79] A fishing vessel was stranded about 175\u00a0mi (275\u00a0km) off Wrightsville Beach amid 35\u00a0ft (11\u00a0m) seas and gusts to 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) after being struck by lightning.[137] A force main in the Hewletts Creek watershed burst due to an influx of water from the hurricane, resulting in a 750,000\u00a0US\u00a0gal (2,800,000\u00a0L) spill.[138] Damage across Pender County reached $1.5\u00a0million, and was primarily concentrated in Surf City and on Topsail Island. Hurricane-force wind gusts caused minor damage to about 500\u00a0homes. Salt water flooding occurred along the backside of Topsail Island as water levels in the adjacent sound rose.[129] Some areas of Topsail Island lost 25\u00a0ft (7.6\u00a0m) of beach and were gouged up to 4\u00a0ft (1.2\u00a0m) vertically. Eight duplexes were undermined by the erosion, potentially rendering them uninhabitable.[139] On the mainland of Pender County, damage was relatively light, limited to some downed trees and minor flooding.[129] A total of 388\u00a0homes were damaged across Onslow County, five of which were condemned.[136] The Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune suffered $1.2\u00a0million in damage, with the majority coming from the 300\u00a0ft (91\u00a0m) Riseley Pier.[140] About 150\u00a0ft (46\u00a0m) of the pier was destroyed, and sand surrounding the support pillars was eroded to the point where the remaining structure was unstable. The pier was condemned in October and eventually slated for demolition in February\u00a02010.[141] Minor wind damage occurred in parts of Craven, Duplin, Jones, and Lenoir counties.[142] Persistent northeasterly flow caused flooding in low-lying areas of New Bern by September\u00a012.[137] Inland counties, including Columbus, Duplin, and Samson, primarily suffered agricultural damage. Little damage occurred in Dare County, with preliminary losses reaching only $19,500.[136]"

        "content": "Rip currents were reported in coastal Delaware on September\u00a016 to 17.[108] The combination of onshore flow and a full moon led to minor coastal flooding in Cape May and Monmouth counties in New Jersey. On September\u00a016, water levels in Cape May reached 6.98\u00a0ft (2.13\u00a0m) above the mean lower water level.[143] From September\u00a015 to 17, moisture brought north from Ophelia interacted with a cold front, leading to widespread heavy rain in the Northeast. In Essex County, New Jersey, flash floods of roadways prompted water rescues. In Irvington, a local creek rose rapidly and inundated the Garden State Parkway with 3 to 4\u00a0ft (0.91 to 1.22\u00a0m) of water.[144] Several streets in Suffolk County, New York, became impassible from swiftly moving water.[145] In Upstate New York, heavy rain fell across the Adirondacks on September\u00a016 to 17, leading to localized flash floods.[146] Scattered thunderstorms, some severe, elsewhere in the state downed trees and power lines.[145] Rainfall directly associated with Ophelia's passage in New Jersey and New York reached 2.4\u00a0in (61\u00a0mm) and 1.8\u00a0in (46\u00a0mm), respectively.[147] Flash floods occurred in Fairfield and New London counties in Connecticut.[148] Rainfall directly associated with Ophelia reached 2.57\u00a0in (65\u00a0mm) in Stafford Springs.[149] Ophelia brought locally heavy rain and gusty winds to southeastern Massachusetts as it brushed the state late on September\u00a016. Wind gusts on Nantucket reached 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h) while rainfall peaked at 3.62\u00a0in (92\u00a0mm) in Falmouth.[89][149] Offshore, waves reached 19\u00a0ft (5.8\u00a0m) high.[89] Maine, Maryland, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Virginia received minimal rainfall with state accumulations peaking at 1.5\u00a0in (38\u00a0mm), 0.89\u00a0in (23\u00a0mm), 1.84\u00a0in (47\u00a0mm), 0.6\u00a0in (15\u00a0mm), and 0.88\u00a0in (22\u00a0mm) respectively.[149][150] Meteorologist Ted McIldoon at the CHC described Ophelia as a \"typical storm for [Atlantic Canada].\" Heavy rain affected much of Nova Scotia while the strongest winds remained offshore.[151] Winds in the province peaked at 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) on Beaver Island.[152] Only one power outage occurred, affecting 130 residents in Stewiacke.[151] One person died after slipping off a ladder while checking his roof for leaks.[121][151] Much of Nova Scotia received 1 to 2\u00a0in (25 to 50\u00a0mm) of rain, with a swath of 2 to 3\u00a0in (50 to 70\u00a0mm) across the center of the province.[151][153] A peak of 3.46\u00a0in (87.9\u00a0mm) was measured on Cape Sable Island. In Newfoundland, over 2.0\u00a0in (50\u00a0mm) of rain fell over parts of the eastern region of the province. Farther west, portions of New Brunswick received up to 1\u00a0in (25\u00a0mm) of rain.[153]"

South Carolina Governor Sanford signed an executive order providing members of their state's National Guard, and personnel and equipment from their Emergency Management Department.[154] On September\u00a016, FEMA and state disaster estimators sent out four teams to ascertain the scope of Ophelia's effects. President George W. Bush declared 37\u00a0counties disaster areas where damage was reported.[127][155] Governor Easley requested government assistance on September\u00a022 as cleanup costs and damage to public utilities exceeded $16.5\u00a0million.[156] He later wrote a letter to President Bush on September\u00a026 formally asking for assistance in Carteret, Craven, Hyde, Jones, Pamlico, and Onslow Counties.[157] President Bush signed this request October\u00a07, designating ten counties (the requested six plus Brunswick, Dare, New Hanover, and Pender Counties) as major disaster areas.[158] FEMA ultimately provided $5,201,233.40 in public assistance to the designated counties.[159] Of the 300 National Guard troops initially deployed in the state, 180 were relieved from duty shortly after the hurricane's passage. The remaining soldiers distributed relief supplies and aided local emergency personnel.[82][127] The Salvation Army provided meals to 175\u00a0people in Morehead City.[160] Band Together, a nonprofit organization, held a disaster relief show for victims of Katrina and Ophelia on September\u00a021; benefits went to the Food Bank of Central & Eastern North Carolina.[161] Construction companies in Carteret County were overwhelmed with requests to repair docks and piers in the month following Ophelia.[132] North Carolina Senate President Marc Basnight and North Carolina House Speaker James B. Black suggested building codes be reformed for all structures to have windows resistant to 200\u00a0mph (320\u00a0km/h) winds.[160] Basnight emphasized that \"the kind of building that goes on the coast has to change\u00a0... [they] are catching damage each and every time.\"[162] With funding from FEMA, the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) restored 11\u00a0mi (18\u00a0km) of beaches along Emerald Isle, Indian Beach, and Pine Knoll Shores, North Carolina, between January\u00a010 and March\u00a029, 2007.[163][164] In total, 1,229,836 cubic yards (940,277 cubic meters) of sand was distributed at a cost of $13,773,768.[165] The USCAE conducted additional nourishment projects around Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.[166] Ecological effects from the hurricane were largely minor. The influx of brackish water into the Emily and Richardson Preyer Buckridge Coastal Reserve negatively impacted the health of local Chamaecyparis thyoides (Atlantic white cedar) trees.[167] The draining of swamp water into Beard Creek dropped dissolved oxygen levels and caused a significant fish kill event with an estimated 28,500 fish dying.[168] A 2008 study on the effects of Ophelia and Tropical Storm Ernesto in 2006 noted a significant increase in Vibrio spp. populations in relation to their passage.[169] Ecological biochemistry composition along the Neuse River estuary saw little disturbance; however, disruption to ferry services limited the sample frequency during data collection.[170]"

        "content": " The 2005 Atlantic hurricane season was the most active on record in terms of number of tropical cyclones, until surpassed by the 2020 season. It featured 28[1]\u00a0tropical or subtropical storms. The United States National Hurricane Center[nb 1] named 27\u00a0storms, exhausting the annual pre-designated list, requiring the use of six Greek letter names, and adding an additional unnamed storm during a post-season re-analysis. A record 15\u00a0storms attained hurricane status, with maximum sustained winds of at least 74 miles per hour (119\u00a0km/h). Of those, a record seven became major hurricanes, rated Category\u00a03 or higher on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale. Four storms of this season became Category\u00a05 hurricanes, the highest ranking. The four Category\u00a05 hurricanes during the season were: Emily, Katrina, Rita, and Wilma. In July, Emily reached peak intensity in the Caribbean Sea, becoming the first Category\u00a05 hurricane of the season, later weakening and striking Mexico twice. In August, Katrina reached peak winds in the Gulf of Mexico but weakened by the time it struck the U.S. states of Louisiana and Mississippi. The most devastating effects of the season were felt on the Gulf Coast of the United States, where Katrina's storm surge crippled New Orleans, Louisiana, for weeks and devastated the Mississippi coastline. Katrina became the costliest U.S. hurricane, leaving $125\u00a0billion in damage[nb 2] and 1,392\u00a0deaths. Rita followed in September, reaching peak intensity in the Gulf of Mexico before weakening and hitting near the border of Texas and Louisiana. The season's strongest hurricane, Wilma, became the most intense Atlantic hurricane on record, as measured by barometric pressure. Lasting for ten days in October, Wilma moved over Cozumel, the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, and Florida, causing over $22\u00a0billion in damage and 52\u00a0deaths. The season's impact was widespread and catastrophic. Its storms caused an estimated 3,468\u00a0deaths and approximately $172.3\u00a0billion in damage. It was the costliest season on record at the time, until its record was surpassed 12 years later. It also produced the second-highest accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) in the Atlantic basin, surpassed only by the 1933 season. The season officially began on June\u00a01, 2005, and the first storm \u2013 Arlene \u2013 developed on June\u00a08. Hurricane Dennis in July inflicted heavy damage to Cuba. Hurricane Stan in October was part of a broader weather system that killed 1,668\u00a0people and caused $3.96\u00a0billion in damage to eastern Mexico and Central America, with Guatemala hit the hardest. The final storm \u2013 Zeta \u2013 formed in late December and lasted until January\u00a06, 2006."

The increase was based on the Atlantic continuing to warm and a strong belief that El Ni\u00f1o conditions would not persist into the hurricane season.[6] On May\u00a02, the Cuban Institute of Meteorology (InsMet) issued their seasonal forecast, which predicted that the season would feature 13\u00a0tropical storms and 7\u00a0hurricanes.[5] This was followed on May\u00a016 by NOAA, who predicted a 70% chance of above normal activity, with 12\u201315 tropical storms, 7\u20139 hurricanes, and 3\u20135 major hurricanes.[7] CSU issued its second forecast update on May\u00a031, revising its forecast to 15\u00a0named storms, 8\u00a0hurricanes and 4\u00a0major hurricanes; by this point, the group believed El Ni\u00f1o conditions were unlikely.[8]"

        "content": "With 28 storms (27\u00a0named storms and one unnamed), the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season set a new single-year record for most storms, surpassing the total of 20 from 1933.[15] This record stood until surpassed by the 2020 season, which had 30 storms.[16] A total of 7\u00a0named storms formed before August\u00a01, which exceeded the record of 5\u00a0set in 1997; this record stood until 2020. The fourth named storm developed at a then-record early date, surpassed in 2012. The fifth though eleventh and the thirteenth and onward named storms developed at then-record early dates that were later surpassed in 2020.[17] Further, the months of July and November set records for number of named storms, with 5 and 3, respectively. The 2005 season featured 15\u00a0hurricanes, surpassing the previous record of 12, set in 1969.\nOf the 15\u00a0hurricanes, 5\u00a0formed in September, with the season becoming only the sixth to feature 5 in that month.[17] The 2005 season also featured a record seven major hurricanes, one more than the previous record, set in 1926, 1933, 1950, 1996, and 2004. The four Category\u00a05 hurricanes were also a record.[15][18] The season's activity was reflected with an ACE rating of 250, the second-highest value on record in the Atlantic basin, after the 1933 season.[19][20] The extremely active 2005 hurricane season was a continuation of an extended sequence of active years for tropical activity in the Atlantic.[21] Tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic Ocean between 1995 and 2004 was more active than any other decade in reliable record. With the exception of two years in which El Ni\u00f1o conditions were prevalent (1997 and 2002), all hurricane seasons were individually above average. This was associated with an active phase of the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO), with a similar period of elevated tropical activity occurring between 1950 and 1969. The anomalously frequent formation of tropical storms and hurricanes reflected the emergence of unusually warm sea surface temperatures across the tropical Atlantic.[22] The Climate Prediction Center (CPC) predicted in May\u00a02005 that the conditions associated with this active multi-decadal signal would continue into the 2005 hurricane season, providing favorable conditions for tropical cyclogenesis in the tropical Atlantic.[23]"
      },
      {
        "header": "Record activity",
        "content": "Chylek and Lesins (2008) determined that the likelihood of a season generating as much tropical activity as 2005 was less than 1\u00a0percent. The consecutive occurrence of hurricane seasons as active as 2004 and 2005 in the Atlantic was unprecedented.[24] While environmental conditions favorable for the development of tropical cyclones were analogous to other active seasons, they were more pronounced and encompassed larger areas in 2005. The CPC determined that this environmental enhancement was primarily driven by four factors: the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation, the reduction of atmospheric convection in the tropical Pacific, record-high sea surface temperatures in the tropical Atlantic and Caribbean, and conducive wind and pressure patterns across the western Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. The multidecadal oscillation increased the potency of conducive environmental factors for tropical development, including the increased strength of subtropical ridges in the northern and southern Atlantic and the eastern Pacific. This amplified the African easterly jet and enhanced upper-level easterlies, attenuating wind shear detrimental to tropical cyclogenesis across the central tropical Atlantic and the Caribbean. Frequent lulls in convection over the tropical Pacific also contributed to the strength of these ridges, focusing hurricane activity in the Atlantic. Most of the tropical storms and all major hurricanes in the Atlantic in 2005 formed when a lack of convection was present near the International Dateline, while a brief uptick in storms near the International Dateline led to a lull in tropical cyclogenesis in the Atlantic for the first half of August.[25] The Gulf of Mexico saw record levels of tropical activity in 2005, with 11\u00a0named storms entering the basin. The unusual activity was attributed to a persistent high pressure area over the Southeastern United States, the northeastward displacement and amplification of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) over the eastern Pacific, and above average sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico. These factors reduced vertical wind shear and favored cyclonic flow, creating an environment highly supportive of tropical development. The high pressure area also steered incoming storms into the Gulf of Mexico.[25] In addition, the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO) was in a neutral phase, lowering the likelihood of storms making landfall on the East Coast of the United States and leading to a concentration of impacts farther west.[21] This focusing mechanism led to a complementary reduction in storms developing close to Cape Verde.[26] During the peak of the 2005 season, the Loop Current\u00a0\u2013 an ocean current that transports warm water from the Caribbean Sea northward into the Gulf of Mexico and offshore the U.S. East Coast\u00a0\u2013 propagated northward, reaching its most poleward point in advance of Hurricane Katrina. This protrusion detached into a warm core ring, or a small region of warm waters to an abnormally deep depth, and began to drift southwest as Hurricane Rita traversed the region. By mid-October, the Loop Current returned to its typical position in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. This evolution provided enhanced ocean heat content to both hurricanes and was partially responsible for the extreme intensities attained by those cyclones.[27] In addition to the unusually high amount of tropical activity, the 2005\u00a0season also featured an abnormally high amount of storms in the typically inactive early and latter parts of the season.[28] Lowered sea-level atmospheric pressures in the late spring and early summer of 2005 curtailed the strength of trade winds, resulting in a reduction of latent heat loss from the tropical Atlantic and Caribbean. This allowed the persistence of the anomalously warm sea surface temperatures that had contributed to the active 2004 hurricane season; this warmth remained until November\u00a02005.[29] The activity in later parts of the 2005\u00a0season was elevated by the unusual development of four tropical cyclones from non-tropical origins over the eastern Atlantic.[30] In the wake of the season, questions arose regarding the potential impact of global warming on Atlantic hurricane activity. Hurricane experts noted that establishing a conclusive relationship would be difficult given the significant role that natural variability plays on hurricane formation and significantly improved tropical cyclone detection methods compared to decades past. A series of international workshops were established after 2005. After five years of analysis, researchers were unable to confirm whether the recent increase in tropical cyclone activity could be attributed more to climate change than natural variability. Models developed within the workshops projected that the number of tropical cyclones under Category\u00a03 intensity would fall over the 21st century, while the number of intense Category\u00a04\u20135 hurricanes would increase significantly. One potential hypothesis for these findings was a projected increase in vertical wind shear contradicted by warmer ocean temperatures for hurricanes to utilize. The team also concluded that the amount of precipitation produced by tropical cyclones would increase over the next century.[31] In May\u00a02020, researchers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the University of Wisconsin at Madison built upon this research and, for the first time, established a statistically significant global trend toward more intense tropical cyclones, particularly in the Atlantic basin. The research not only reaffirmed a trend toward stronger, wetter tropical cyclones, but it also identified a trend toward increased rapid intensification events and a general slowing of tropical cyclones' forward motion near land.[32]"

Total damage is estimated to be about US$171.7\u00a0billion, and the seasons' storms contributed to the deaths of 3,912\u00a0people.[14] There were a record 15\u00a0storms making landfall,[25] including seven storms that struck the United States.[15] The hardest-hit area was the United States Gulf Coast from eastern Texas to Florida, affected to varying degrees by Arlene, Cindy, Dennis, Katrina, Ophelia, Rita, Tammy, and Wilma.[14] Dennis left $2.23\u00a0billion in damage along the Florida Panhandle.[33] Katrina caused catastrophic damage to the Gulf Coast, devastating a long stretch of coast along Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama with a 30-foot (9.1\u00a0m) storm surge. Wind damage was reported well inland, slowing down recovery efforts. Storm surge also breached levees in the city of New Orleans, Louisiana, flooding about 80% of the city. Total damage has been estimated at $125\u00a0billion, making Katrina the costliest hurricane in U.S. history, surpassing Andrew in 1992 and tying Harvey in 2017. At least 1,392\u00a0people were killed by the storm, making it the deadliest hurricane in the U.S. since 1928.[34][35][36] Southeastern North Carolina suffered some damage from the slow-moving Ophelia.[37] Rita struck near the border of Louisiana and Texas. The hurricane re-flooded New Orleans (though to a far less degree than Katrina), and caused about $18.5\u00a0billion in damage.[38] Wilma caused about $19\u00a0billion in damage when it moved across southern Florida in October. The hurricane contributed to 30\u00a0deaths, five of whom were killed directly by the storm.[39][40] Three hurricanes struck Mexico \u2013 Emily, Stan, and Wilma. Emily struck Quintana Roo and Tamaulipas as a major hurricane,[41] causing US$343\u00a0million ($3.4\u00a0billion MXN) in damage.[42] Stan killed 80\u00a0people in Mexico, and damage in the county was estimated at US$1.2\u00a0billion ($13.2\u00a0billion MXN). Stan was part of a broader weather system across Central America that killed 1,513\u00a0people in Guatemala, where damage was estimated at US$996\u00a0million.[43][44][42][45] Wilma dropped historic rainfall while drifting across the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula.[46] It killed four people in the country and left US$454\u00a0million ($4.8\u00a0billion MXN) in damage.[47][42] In the Caribbean, Cuba suffered the effects of Dennis and Wilma. The former killed 16\u00a0people and left US$1.4\u00a0billion in damage when it struck Cuba twice.[48] Later, Wilma flooded parts of western Cuba, leaving US$704\u00a0million in damage.[48] The island of Hispaniola experienced Dennis in July, which killed 56\u00a0people in Haiti.[49] Emily killed one person and left US$111\u00a0million in damage when it struck Grenada,[50] and later it killed five people on Jamaica.[41] Collectively, Dennis and Emily caused about US$96\u00a0million (J$6\u00a0billion) in damage to Jamaica.[51] Wilma killed 12\u00a0people in Haiti and one in Jamaica.[47] Alpha killed 26\u00a0people in the Caribbean.[52] In Central America, Beta killed nine people and caused US$11.5\u00a0million in damage when it struck Nicaragua in October.[53][54][55][56][57][58][59][60] In November, Tropical Storm Gamma killed two people in Bequia in the Grenadines, 34\u00a0people in Honduras, and 3 in Belize.[61][62] Unusual impacts were felt in Europe and nearby islands. The remnants of Maria caused a landslide in Norway that killed three people.[63][64] The unnamed subtropical storm in October moved through the Azores.[65] Also in October, Vince became the first recorded tropical cyclone to strike Spain, making landfall at tropical depression intensity.[66] In November, the extratropical remnants of Delta struck the Canary Islands, causing 7 fatalities, with 12\u00a0people missing.[67]"

The cyclone quickly weakened after moving inland and became extratropical over Kentucky on August\u00a030.[34] On August\u00a028, the New Orleans National Weather Service issued an urgent weather bulletin describing potentially catastrophic impacts, comparing Katrina to Hurricane Camille of 1969. That same day, New Orleans mayor Ray Nagin issued the city's first-ever mandatory evacuation. About 80% of the city and 83% of neighboring Jefferson Parish evacuated ahead of the storm.[100] The hurricane left catastrophic damage across southern Louisiana, with more than 300,000\u00a0houses damaged or destroyed; most of these were in Orleans Parish.[101] In New Orleans, storm surge breached the levees along the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway and 17th Street and London Avenue Canals, flooding about 80% of the city. Portions of the city remained underwater for 43\u00a0days.[34] The Mississippi and Alabama coastlines also suffered catastrophic damage from the storm's 30\u00a0ft (9.1\u00a0m) storm surge, with very few structures remaining on the coast of the former.[34] Across the region, the hurricane flooded and ruined about 350,000\u00a0vehicles. About 2.4\u00a0million people lost access to clean drinking water.[102] Katrina also spawned an outbreak of 62\u00a0tornadoes across the eight states in the eastern United States.[34] Hurricane Katrina imparted catastrophic damage in portions of Louisiana and Mississippi, with overall damage estimated at $173\u00a0billion; this makes Katrina the costliest natural disaster in U.S. history. Throughout the United States, Katrina killed 1,392 people, making it one of the deadliest hurricanes in the United States,[103][104][34] and the deadliest American hurricane since 1928.[100] The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) managed the aftermath of the hurricane, and faced criticism for its response time, lack of coordination with state agencies, supply shortages, and insufficient housing for federal workers.[105] Tens of thousands of people lost their jobs following the hurricane.[100] Residents across the New Orleans area suffered health effects, including rashes and respiratory problems, from polluted water and air following the hurricane.[102] Katrina forced about 800,000\u00a0people to move temporarily, which was the greatest number of displaced people in the country since the Dust Bowl. The United States federal government spent $110.6\u00a0billion in relief, recovery and rebuilding efforts, including $16\u00a0billion toward rebuilding houses, which was the nation's largest ever housing recovery project.

This depression quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Nate, which moved slowly northeastward. On September\u00a07, Nate intensified into the seventh hurricane of the season. A day later, the hurricane passed southeast of Bermuda,[111] where it produced wind gusts of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h).[112] Early on September\u00a09, Nate attained peak winds of 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) as it accelerated northeastward ahead of a trough. The same trough created unfavorable conditions, causing Nate to weaken quickly back to tropical storm status. On September\u00a010, Nate transitioned into an extratropical storm which was absorbed by a larger extratropical storm near the Azores on September\u00a013.[111] Canadian Navy ships headed to the U.S. Gulf Coast to help in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina were slowed down trying to avoid Nate and Ophelia.[113] Rip currents caused by hurricanes Nate and Maria killed one person in New Jersey and severely injured another person.[114]"

Ophelia fluctuated between hurricane and tropical storm intensity for the next week as it meandered off the southeastern United States. Twice it attained peak winds of 85\u00a0mph (137\u00a0km/h). On September\u00a014, the northern eyewall moved over the North Carolina coast from Wilmington to Morehead City. After moving away from the state, Ophelia weakened to tropical storm status for a fourth and final time due to stronger wind shear and dry air. The storm accelerated northeastward and passed southeast of Cape Cod. Ophelia transitioned into an extratropical storm on September\u00a018 and subsequently crossed Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, eventually dissipating on September\u00a023 north of the Scandinavian Peninsula.[37] Ophelia caused significant coastal erosion from the churning waves. The hurricane caused extensive damage in the Outer Banks and around Cape Fear. Damage in the United States was estimated at $70\u00a0million. The storm's remnants produced strong winds and heavy rain over Atlantic Canada. Ophelia killed three people \u2013 a drowning in Florida from high surf, a traffic fatality in North Carolina, and a death from a fall in Nova Scotia.[37][115]"

Rapid intensification ensued as Rita moved into the Gulf of Mexico. Late on September\u00a021, Rita strengthened into a Category\u00a05 hurricane, and the next day it attained peak winds of 180\u00a0mph (290\u00a0km/h).[118] Its minimum pressure of 895\u00a0mbar (895\u00a0hPa; 26.4\u00a0inHg) was the lowest of any storm in the Gulf of Mexico on record.[119] The hurricane weakened as it approached the northwest Gulf Coast. On September\u00a024, Rita made landfall near the Texas\u2013Louisiana border with sustained winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h). It rapidly weakened over land as it turned to the north and northeast, and was later absorbed by an approaching cold front on September\u00a026 over Illinois.[118] Across the United States, Rita imparted $18.5\u00a0billion in damage and killed 120\u00a0people, although only seven deaths were directly related to the hurricane.[39][120][118] Early in its evolution, Rita flooded houses in northern Cuba and the Florida Keys.[121][118] Rita's approach to the U.S. Gulf Coast prompted one of the largest mass evacuations in the country's history, with an estimated 3.7\u00a0million people fleeing the Texas coast between Corpus Christi and Beaumont.[118][122] Due in part to high temperatures preceding Rita's landfall and elderly susceptibility to excessive heat, at least 80\u00a0people died during the mass evacuation;[123] a coach fire en route to Dallas claimed 23\u00a0lives.[124] Rita generated a 15-foot (4.6\u00a0m) storm surge that devastated parts of Cameron Parish in Louisiana,[125] destroying most structures in towns like Cameron and Holly Beach. Storm surge also damaged homes in adjoining Jefferson County in Texas. In New Orleans, Rita produced additional flooding and overtopped levees that had been repaired after Hurricane Katrina a month earlier. Impacts from heavy rainfall, gusty winds, and tornadoes associated with Rita affected much of the lower Mississippi River Valley, and over a million electricity customers lost power.[118] A third of Cameron Parish's population left the parish following the devastation wrought by Rita.[126]  FEMA granted over $1.3\u00a0billion to Louisiana to support recovery efforts; $668.8\u00a0million was allocated in the form of public assistance grants for initial recovery measures, and $523.5\u00a0million was sent to individuals as part of the agency's Individuals and Households program.[127] Over $1\u00a0billion in federal assistance was also disbursed to Texas.[128] Texas' Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery Program aided 1.85\u00a0million people in addition to supporting longer-term infrastructure repairs.[129]"

Wilma moved slowly through the warm waters of the western Caribbean Sea and began a period of rapid deepening on October\u00a018 that lasted into the following day. This culminated in the cyclone attaining Category\u00a05 hurricane status, reaching peak winds of 185\u00a0mph (298\u00a0km/h) and setting a record for the lowest barometric pressure in an Atlantic hurricane; at 12:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a019, hurricane hunters recorded a pressure of 882\u00a0mbar (26.0\u00a0inHg) in the center of the tiny, well-defined eye of Wilma. Wilma weakened to Category\u00a04 intensity by the time it made landfall on Cozumel on October\u00a021.

Convection developed atop the center of the nascent disturbance two days later, and satellite data suggested that it was acquiring thermodynamic characteristics exhibited by tropical cyclones. On November\u00a022, the NHC classified the low-pressure system as a subtropical storm with the name Delta.

        "content": " Hurricane Epsilon was the twenty-seventh named tropical or subtropical storm and the final of 15\u00a0hurricanes in the record-breaking 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. Originating from a cold front beneath an upper-level low, Epsilon formed on November\u00a029 about 915\u00a0mi (1470\u00a0km) east of Bermuda, becoming the second tropical storm to do so in that area of the Atlantic within the span of a week. Initially, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecast the storm to transition into an extratropical cyclone within five days, due to conditions unfavorable for significant intensification. Epsilon continually defied forecasts, at first due to an unexpected loop to the southwest, and later due to retaining its strength despite cold waters and strong wind shear. Epsilon persisted into December, extending the 2005 season beyond its stated November\u00a030 end date.[1] On December\u00a01, it began a northeast motion due to an approaching trough, and the next day it attained hurricane status. After turning to the east, it developed characteristics of an annular hurricane, meaning it had a circular eye, a ring of intense convection, and had few fluctuations in its intensity. On December\u00a05 Epsilon attained peak winds of 85\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h), and the next day it turned to the south and southwest. Late on December\u00a07, the winds dropped below hurricane status for the first time in five days, making Epsilon the longest-lasting December hurricane on record. Stronger wind shear caused rapid weakening, and the storm could no longer be classified as a tropical cyclone late on December\u00a08. The next day the remnant circulation of Epsilon dissipated. Since Epsilon stayed well out to sea and never approached land, no warnings or watches were issued. No ships reported tropical storm force winds from Epsilon and there were no damages or fatalities.[2]"

        "content": "On November\u00a027, a surface storm with gale-force winds developed beneath an upper-level low pressure area, about 1150\u00a0mi (1850\u00a0km) east of Bermuda. At the time, a cold front extended eastward from the surface storm toward the eastern Atlantic Ocean, north of Tropical Storm Delta.[2] By that time, tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated the possible development of a subtropical cyclone, and although they were inconsistent, National Hurricane Center (NHC) specialist Eric Blake stated, \"blocking at high latitudes seems to favor another subtropical cyclone effort.\" The blocking referred to a ridge stretching across the northern Atlantic.[3] The surface storm gradually separated from the frontal zone, but initially its convection, or thunderstorm activity, was sparse and poorly organized.[2] The NHC introduced the system in its tropical weather outlook on November\u00a028, with the possibility of subtropical or tropical development noted.[4] It moved slowly westward, becoming better organized,[5] and by late that day resembled a subtropical cyclone; however, as it was still connected to the cold front, it could not have been classified as such. Early on November\u00a029, an area of deep convection developed and organized over the surface center when it was about 915\u00a0mi (1470\u00a0km) east of Bermuda. The NHC accordingly assessed the system as developing into a tropical storm, designating it with the Greek letter Epsilon.[2] Operationally, the NHC did not initiate advisories until 1500\u00a0UTC on November\u00a029, about nine hours after it actually developed. By that time, the convection had wrapped into a ring 45\u00a0mi (72\u00a0km) in diameter.[2] In the first advisory on Epsilon, the NHC forecast steady strengthening to near hurricane status due to marginally favorable conditions, followed by extratropical transition within five days; an alternate possibility was Epsilon being absorbed by a larger extratropical storm.[6] Epsilon moved westward after its development, steered by a ridge to its north.[6] Initially, Epsilon was embedded beneath an upper-level low that provided an area of low wind shear and instability.[2] An eye-like feature briefly developed in the center of the convection, although the thunderstorms waned late on November\u00a028 due to restricted inflow. However, banding features and outflow improved at the same time.[7] By November\u00a030, the NHC anticipated extratropical transition to occur within two days, although some strengthening was still expected.[8] That day, there was an increase in convection over the center of a ragged eye-feature.[9] The winds briefly increased to 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h),[2] although the intensity of the thunderstorms diminished. Initially Epsilon was predicted to continue westward and eventually turn to the north and northeast.[10] Instead, it turned toward the southwest and executed a cyclonic loop; the unexpected motion caused larger than normal errors in the extended track forecast.[2] As it moved to the south, the storm crossed over an area of warmer water temperatures, and the NHC remarked that \"just a modest increase in convection [would be] needed to make Epsilon a hurricane.\" At the time, forecasters assessed the winds in Epsilon to be around 70\u00a0mph (115\u00a0km/h),[10] although in a post-season re-analysis it was found to have been 10\u00a0mph (15\u00a0km/h) weaker. Late on November\u00a030, Epsilon made its closest approach to Bermuda, passing about 645\u00a0miles (1045\u00a0km) east-southeast of the island.[2] Tropical Storm Epsilon began its motion to the east and northeast on December\u00a01,[2] due to an approaching trough.[11] Its structure became that of a \"shallow hybrid-type tropical cyclone\", and an eye-feature again developed within the convection. At the time, the NHC and several computer models anticipated extratropical transition within 36\u00a0hours as it accelerated northeastward near the Azores. However, four computer models predicted an alternate scenario, and forecaster Stacy Stewart stated such transition would only occur \"barring any southward motion over warmer water that would prolong both the lifetime of Epsilon and the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season.\"[12] As it continued northeastward, the storm separated from upper-level low it was previously beneath.[2] After a decrease in convection, the thunderstorm activity again increased over the center, and there were more banding features.[13] Despite moving over slightly cooler water temperatures, Epsilon attained hurricane status late on December\u00a02, following the development of a well-defined eye 29\u00a0miles (46\u00a0km) in diameter.[14] A few hours after reaching hurricane status, the NHC thought Epsilon reached peak winds, as the storm was about to move over cooler water temperatures. Additionally, the hurricane was expected to stall near the Azores, in contrast to the original forecast of continued acceleration to the northeast.[15] On December\u00a03 it turned due eastward, still maintaining an eye, modest amounts of convection, and outflow.[16] Despite moving into an area of cooler waters and generally unfavorable atmospheric conditions, Epsilon retained its hurricane status; the only entity supporting its intensity was its warm upper-level temperature.[17] By late on December\u00a03, its presentation was described as \"remarkably well-organized for a hurricane at high latitude in December... embedded in a strong upper-level westerly wind environment and moving over [70\u201372\u00a0\u00b0F (21\u201322\u00a0\u00b0C)] water.\"[18] As it continued eastward, Epsilon developed characteristics of an annular hurricane;[2] such cyclones, more often found in the deep tropics with greater intensity, have circular eyes, surrounded by a nearly uniform ring of convection and a general lack of thunderstorms outside the ring.[19] For several days, the intensity fluctuated in a narrow range,[2] and although Epsilon was briefly downgraded to tropical storm status on December\u00a04,[20] the NHC assessed it as remaining a hurricane.[2] After it was thought to have weakened, the eye became more symmetric as the ring of convection became stronger. The hurricane remained difficult to forecast, as NHC forecaster Lixion Avila remarked, \"There are no clear reasons... and I am not going to make one up... to explain the recent strengthening of Epsilon.\"[21] By late on December\u00a04, the NHC was no longer anticipating extratropical transition, after a front passed north of the storm and there was no interaction.[22] At 0600\u00a0UTC on December\u00a05, the hurricane's appearance generated 4.7 on the Dvorak technique, a system used to estimate intensity from satellite imagery. This was the highest rating during Epsilon's duration, and suggested winds of 85\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h), its peak intensity. Around that time, the hurricane began a turn to the east-southeast, as the ridge to its north built behind the passage of a cold front.[2] Despite the cold water temperatures and unfavorable strong upper-level winds, Epsilon maintained its intensity, and the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) model predicted it would remain a hurricane for nearly three days.[23] On December\u00a06 the hurricane turned to the south and southwest.[2] As it did so, Epsilon passed beneath a mid-level trough that sheltered it from the wind shear.[24] After weakening during the evening, the convection redeveloped around the large and distinct eye in the daytime, a process Epsilon had done repeatedly in its duration.[25] However, late on December\u00a07, an approaching trough began increasing wind shear over the system,[26] displacing the convection from the center and causing the eye to dissipate. After maintaining hurricane status for five days, Epsilon weakened to tropical storm status about 920\u00a0mi (1480\u00a0km) southwest of the Azores.[2] Once weakened to a tropical storm, Epsilon began rapidly deteriorating. On December\u00a08, it was downgraded to a tropical depression as the convection had totally dissipated.[2] The NHC issued their final advisory on Epsilon at 1500\u00a0UTC that day, after the cyclone consisted of a tight swirl of low clouds with no convection. On issuing the last advisory, Lixion Avila remarked, \"I hope this is the end of the long lasting 2005 hurricane season.\"[27] There was ultimately one more tropical storm \u2013 Zeta.[28] Late on December\u00a08, Epsilon transitioned into a remnant low pressure area. The remnant circulation elongated in advance of a frontal zone, and it dissipated late on December\u00a09.[2] The front absorbed the remnants the next day.[29]"

The first observed storm of the season, this cyclone developed from a tropical wave over the deep tropics of the Atlantic Ocean on August\u00a018. Initially a tropical storm, it moved west-northwestward and intensified into a Category\u00a01 hurricane on the modern day Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale by August\u00a019. The storm intensified significantly over the next few days, and by August\u00a022, it peaked as a Category\u00a03 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 125\u00a0mph (205\u00a0km/h). Around that time, the system began curving northwestward and later northward. By August\u00a023, it turned to the north-northeast and then began weakening on August\u00a024. Thereafter, the storm accelerated toward Atlantic Canada. Late on August\u00a024, the hurricane struck near Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, as a Category\u00a02 hurricane, just before becoming extratropical. In New England, rainfall caused minor street flooding, especially in central Massachusetts and Maine, where 2.09 inches (53\u00a0mm) of precipitation fell in the city of Portland. Of the 173\u2013192\u00a0fatalities in Canada, most of them occurred due to damaged or missing ships, with two boats losing their entire crew. On land, Nova Scotia was impacted most significantly. Heavy rainfall washed out 20\u201325 percent of the rail lines, which disrupted rail service. Flooding also damaged numerous roads and swept away bridges, making traveling difficult. Crop damage from the hurricane was severe as the storm destroyed about half of the fruit, vegetable, and hay harvest, leaving a loss of $1\u00a0million (1927\u00a0USD).[nb 1]  Property damage in the province was in the thousands of dollars range. There were many electrical and telephone service outages. The storm's rains and winds caused similar but less severe damage in the provinces of New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland. Overall, the hurricane caused just under $1.6\u00a0million in damage."

The storm deepened significantly over the next few days, becoming a Category\u00a02 late on August\u00a020 and reaching Category\u00a03 at 06:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a021. The cyclone peaked as a Category\u00a03 hurricane with sustained winds of 125\u00a0mph (205\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 950\u00a0mbar (28\u00a0inHg) around 06:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a022.[3] The latter was observed by the S.S.

The hardest hit area was Harbourville and adjacent settlements along the \"Bay Shore\" coastline of the Bay of Fundy.[13] There the hurricane completely destroyed a gravel road which had been built shortly before the storm's impact. Another road connecting to a hotel was also severely damaged. Heavy rainfall brought by the hurricane caused landslides and flooding along the Harbourville Mountain which washed out numerous roads.[12] In the Annapolis Valley, the rainfall fell so quickly that drainage ditches and small creeks overflowed. In Lakeville, flooding washed away a 25-foot (7.6\u00a0m) bridge, and fallen trees and other storm debris littered the streets and roads. The Cornwallis River overflowed its banks, causing serious flash flooding. Near Harrington's Crossing, a small creek overflowed its banks, stalling numerous automobiles.[14] Roads were extensively impacted in Digby, Wolfville, Yarmouth, and Annapolis County, which suffered $150,000 in damage to streets alone. Overall, there was about $500,000 in damage to roads in Nova Scotia.[12] In Halifax, wind gusts of 48\u00a0mph (77\u00a0km/h) were observed, damaging a grain elevator. Heavy rainfall washed out the railroad lines between Halifax and Yarmouth. A power plant in Pictou County suffered $500 in damage after the roof blew off. In Springhill, strong winds downed trees, fences, and houses. A warehouse in Sydney was destroyed after being tossed about 50\u00a0ft (15\u00a0m) by the wind.

Overall, property damage in the province was in the thousands of dollars range and there were many electrical and telephone service outages.[12] Wind gusts in Newfoundland as strong as 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) at the Corner Brook subdivision of Curling caused about $500 in damage to circus tents and associated equipment.[12] In New Brunswick, precipitation peaked at 3.3\u00a0in (84\u00a0mm) in Saint John. A car tumbled into washed out culvert in Horseman's Hill, injuring three people. Several bridges and culvert were destroyed in Springhill. A dam broke near University of St. Joseph's College, severely flooding the campus and demolishing the gymnasium. Throughout the province, streets, bridges, gardens, and crops, particularly hay and grain, were damaged, while railroad lines were destroyed. Power outages and loss of telephone services were common. Damage in New Brunswick totaled at least $51,000. In Prince Edward Island, 2\u00a0in (51\u00a0mm) of rain fell in Charlottetown and winds of 30\u00a0mph (45\u00a0km/h) were observed. The city was littered with debris. Generally minor street flooding occurred. Fruit trees and crops suffered extensive damage. At the exhibition grounds, buildings and fences received about $1,000 in damage.[12] Offshore, seventy-five fishing boats of the Lunenburg fishing fleet were reported missing in the Grand Banks.[14] Of the seventy-five, four vessels were reported as total losses.[15] The Joyce Smith and Clayton Walters were the first two fishing vessels to fall victim to the hurricane. The Joyce Smith was carrying 22\u00a0men (mostly from Newfoundland) and it and the Walters were fishing off the coast of Sable Island at the time of the hurricane. The last sighting of the two fishing boats was from the crew of the Marshall Frank 27\u00a0mi (43\u00a0km) off Sable Island. Newspaper reports suggested that both fishing boats did not survive the storm and all 43 crewmen perished at sea.[16] The Mahala, another fishing schooner, was also listed among the ships missing after the hurricane. A search in the area where the ship was reported missing turned up nothing and it was assumed that the ship sank along with its eighteen fishermen.[17] The fourth fishing boat to be reported missing was the Uda R. Corkum,[18] which was carrying a crew of 21 men and 1800 quintals of fish. In all, the loss from all four vessels totaled up to 80 and monetary losses from all four ships totaled over $100,000.[19] Four more fishing boats also sank, taking 33 lives.[20] In addition to the Canadian fishing boats, the famous U.S. racing and fishing schooner Columbia.[21] carrying 22 crew men (many from Nova Scotia) sank during the storm off the coast of Sable Island. There were no survivors.[15] The Nova Scotia hurricane of 1927 followed another tragic August storm the previous year and together they became known as \"The August Gales\", remembered for generations as one of the worst tragedies in the fisheries of Maritime Canada. The severe shipping losses, especially among banks fishing schooners, accelerated a move to outfit Canadian schooners with motors and radios. Today, the hurricane is commemorated in a waterfront monument and an exhibit at the Fisheries Museum of the Atlantic in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia.[22]"

The wave entered the eastern Pacific Ocean on October 19, and a tropical disturbance along the wave axis gradually became better organized. Conditions favored continued development, and Dvorak classifications began late on October 20. Early on October 22, the system developed into Tropical Depression Fourteen-E while located about 375\u00a0mi (604\u00a0km) south of Manzanillo, Colima.[1] Initially the depression was disorganized, with little inner convective structure and sporadic deep convection. Computer models predicted an increase in wind shear by 60\u00a0hours; as such the National Hurricane Center forecast the depression to strengthen to a peak strength of 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h) before weakening.[2] The depression quickly became better organized with a great increase in convection near the center, and six hours after forming it strengthened into Tropical Storm Kenna. Upper-level outflow and banding features improved in an organization, as well. With warm water temperatures of over 29\u00a0\u00b0C (84\u00a0\u00b0F) and updated model forecasts anticipating light amounts of vertical wind shear, forecasters predicted Kenna to slowly intensify to reach winds of 85\u00a0mph (137\u00a0km/h) within 72\u00a0hours of October 22.[3] The storm moved to the west-northwest around the periphery of a mid-level high-pressure system, and initially failed to strengthen further with much of its convection being associated with outer rainbands. On October 23, the outer rainbands dissipated and convection became more concentrated near the center, which coincided with a steady increase in strength. Late on October 23, Kenna intensified into a hurricane while located about 380\u00a0mi (610\u00a0km) southwest of Manzanillo.[1] Shortly after becoming a hurricane, Kenna began to rapidly intensify with a 17\u00a0mi (27\u00a0km) wide eye located within its well-defined central dense overcast.[4] Early on October 24 Kenna became a major hurricane, and in a 24\u2011hour period the hurricane more than doubled its windspeed from 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) winds to 145\u00a0mph (233\u00a0km/h). After turning to the north and northeast in response to the flow ahead of a large mid to upper-level trough, Kenna attained peak winds of 165\u00a0mph (270\u00a0km/h) early on October 25 while located about 255\u00a0mi (410\u00a0km) southwest of Puerto Vallarta, the third Category 5 hurricane of the season. A Hurricane Hunter flight into the hurricane while it was near peak intensity recorded a pressure of 913\u00a0mbar (hPa),[1] the fourth lowest recorded pressure for a Pacific hurricane.[5][6] Quickly after peaking, wind shear from the approaching trough weakened the hurricane, and by six hours after reaching peak intensity, the winds in Hurricane Kenna dropped to 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h), after the eye nearly dissipated. Despite a 27\u00a0mbar increase in pressure in 12\u00a0hours, convective activity increased prior to Kenna making landfall. On October 25, Hurricane Kenna made landfall near San Blas in the state of Nayarit, as a Category\u00a04 hurricane, with estimated sustained winds of 140\u00a0mph (220\u00a0km/h). Hurricane Kenna was at the time, the third most intense Pacific hurricane to strike Mexico. The hurricane rapidly weakened over the mountainous terrain of western Mexico, and the circulation dissipated on October 26 over the Sierra Madre Occidental mountains. The remnants continued northeastward into the Gulf of Mexico and the southeastern United States later that day, producing rainfall across the region.[1]"

Six hours later when its track became more apparent, the watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning from Mazatl\u00e1n to La Fortuna, with a tropical storm warning southward to Manzanillo.[1] Roughly 8,800 of the 9,000 residents in the landfall location, San Blas, evacuated, which ultimately contributed to a low death toll.[1] Officials ordered for the evacuation of 50,000 residents and fishermen along the southwest coast of Mexico, including 3,000 in the Islas Mar\u00edas,[7] 10,000 near Mazatl\u00e1n, and 15,000 near flood-prone areas. Civil authorities closed all schools and docks in potentially affected areas. The Mexican Red Cross prepared for the storm by shipping 215\u00a0tonnes of relief supplies such as food, water, clothing, and medicine to the Red Cross branch in Jalisco. Assistance from the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula delivered 10\u00a0tonnes of food and water, as well.[8] The Mexican Red Cross prepared 20 emergency shelters in the state of Nayarit.[9] Officials took security measures in Los Cabos, Baja California Sur, where the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation was meeting during the passage of the hurricane. Early forecasts indicated a possible threat to the meeting, causing the government to prepare for a potential alternate site.[7] Officials recommended boats to stay at port due to severe conditions.[10]"

Upon making landfall, Kenna was accompanied with an estimated 16 feet (4.9\u00a0m) storm surge in San Blas. The surge also affected Puerto Vallarta, with reports of 10 feet (3.0\u00a0m) waves rushing inland from the bay. The hurricane dropped about 1.38 inches (35\u00a0mm) of precipitation while passing about 60\u00a0mi (97\u00a0km) east of the offshore archipelago, Islas Mar\u00edas. There, sustained winds reached an estimated 106\u00a0mph (171\u00a0km/h).[1] On land, Kenna dropped heavy rainfall peaking at 18.91 inches (480\u00a0mm) at San Ignacio, Sinaloa, and 12.89 inches (327\u00a0mm) near Manzanillo, Colima.[18] The highest recorded sustained wind on land was about 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) at Tepic, Nayarit, with wind gusts at Puerto Vallarta reaching 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h).[1] The hurricane also produced heavy rainfall in Guerrero, Michoac\u00e1n, Colima, and Jalisco, and hit Baja California Sur with strong winds and rough seas.[10] In San Blas, strong winds from the hurricane damaged or destroyed 95% of the homes,[19] with 1,540\u00a0houses damaged and 8,800\u00a0people affected.[20] There, large commercial shrimp boats were swept up to 900 feet (270\u00a0m) inland from their docks. An elderly woman died in the city when the wall of her house collapsed on her.[1] Large portions of the city were covered with building debris and sand washed from the ocean.[8] Elsewhere in Nayarit, flying debris killed a person in Santiago Escuintla. There, two elderly men drowned, one by falling into a river. Both were believed to have been killed during the storm as they fled their homes.[1] In Santiago Ixcuintla, the hurricane damaged 3,770\u00a0homes,[20] and throughout Nayarit, strong winds from the hurricane destroyed the roofs of hundreds of houses.[21] Federal authorities lost communications with at least 30\u00a0Indian villages due to the high winds of the hurricane.[8] Kenna destroyed the entire banana, tobacco, and tomato crops in the rural areas of San Blas, Tecuala, and Acaponeta, leaving more than 700\u00a0subsistence farmers and their families in need of water and food.[20] In Puerto Vallarta, about 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km) southeast of the landfall location, the storm surge resulted in an estimated damage total of US$5\u00a0million, primarily to hotels.[1] The surge flooded the hotels and other waterfront areas, and extended up to 330 feet (100\u00a0m) inland. Waist-deep floodwaters swept away vans and cars,[22] ruining several vehicles. The passage of the hurricane destroyed 150\u00a0stores near the ocean and extensively damaged three hotels. Damage to the city's port was minor.[23] The hurricane injured at least 52 in Puerto Vallarta[24] and dozens in San Blas from widespread flying glass and other forms of debris,[1] with two people seriously injured due to the hurricane. Ten municipalities suffered substantial damage,[23] with insured damage in Mexico totaling US$96\u00a0million.[25] Rainfall from the hurricane spread across northern Mexico, causing minor flash floods and mudslides.[20] The remnants of Kenna entered the south-central United States on October 26, resulting in enhanced rainfall in various locations.[1]"

The Mexican Navy was sent to assist to support medical personnel in the San Blas area, and the government Department for Family Development assisted the Mexican Red Cross in delivering food. Grupo Modelo, brewers of Corona beer, sent 6,600\u00a0gallons (25,000\u00a0liters) of drinking water and 1000\u00a0food sets for the San Blas area.[20] Backhoes and dump trucks gradually removed the debris and sand from San Blas.[8] Dozens of storeowners, municipal employees, and volunteers in Puerto Vallarta worked to clear the debris caused by the storm. The remaining stores, bars, and shops placed signs on their windows describing they were open in an effort to attract the tourists still in the town.[23] By about two months after the hurricane, most hotels, restaurants, and shops were reopened.[26]"

It had the appearance of a volcano, and was attended with a noise as if 100 forges had been at work at once; it filled the air with a nausseous sulpherous smell; it rose from the mountains in the form of a prodigious thick smoak, and proceeded to the valleys, where it rose and fell several times; and at length it subsided in a turnep-field, where the leaves of the turneps, leaves of the trees, dirt, sticks, &c. filled the air and flew higher than the highest hills. It was preceded with the most dreadful storm of thunder and lightning ever heard in the memory of man, and spread a universal consternation, wherever it was seen or heard."

        "content": " The 1896 Cedar Keys hurricane was a powerful and destructive tropical cyclone that devastated much of the East Coast of the United States, starting with Florida's Cedar Keys, near the end of September 1896. The storm's rapid movement allowed it to maintain much of its intensity after landfall and cause significant damage over a broad area; as a result, it became one of the costliest United States hurricanes at the time. The fourth tropical cyclone of the 1896 Atlantic hurricane season, it formed by September 22, likely from a tropical wave, before crossing the Caribbean Sea just south of the Greater Antilles. It entered the Gulf of Mexico as the equivalent of a major hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale, and struck the Cedar Keys\u2014an offshore island chain that includes the island and city of Cedar Key\u2014early on the morning of September 29 with winds of 125\u00a0mph (205\u00a0km/h). The area was inundated by a devastating 10.5\u00a0ft (3.2\u00a0m) storm surge that undermined buildings, washed out the connecting railroad to the mainland, and submerged the smaller, outlying islands, where 31 people were killed. Strong winds also destroyed many of the red cedar trees that played an important role in the economy of the region. No hurricane would hit this region of Florida with a similar strength until 2023. The cyclone continued inland over the Suwannee River valley, causing widespread destruction in dozens of communities across interior northern Florida; in the hardest-hit settlements, intense winds left few trees or buildings standing. The hurricane razed 5,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (13,000\u00a0km2) of dense pine forests in northern Florida, crippling the turpentine industry. Crops and livestock were destroyed, and thousands of individuals were left homeless. The storm killed at least 70 people in mainland Florida, while inflicting approximately $3 million (equivalent to $110\u00a0million in 2023) in property damage across the state. Speeding north, the hurricane ravaged southeastern Georgia and the Sea Islands. In Savannah, a 45-minute onslaught of fierce winds unroofed thousands of structures. Parks, cemeteries, and streets in the city were littered with fallen trees, and the Savannah River saw dozens of wrecked boats. At least 37 people in Georgia died. Strong winds and high tides battered southeastern South Carolina, ruining rice crops and peeling off roofs. The storm then tracked through mostly rural sectors of North Carolina and did significant wind damage in the Raleigh\u2013Durham area. Although the hurricane was weakening and transitioning into an extratropical cyclone late on September 29, its rapid forward movement contributed to high wind velocities across parts of the Mid-Atlantic states, with gusts approaching 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h). Additionally, torrential rains fell west of the storm's track. In Virginia, cities and agricultural districts alike suffered extensive damage. Flash flooding in the Shenandoah Valley culminated in the failure of an earthen dam upstream from Staunton, unleashing a torrent of water that swept houses from their foundations and ravaged the town's commercial district. In Washington, D.C., thousands of trees were uprooted or snapped, communications were severed, and localized streaks of violent gusts damaged many public and private buildings. The White House grounds were left in disarray. High tides in the Chesapeake Bay triggered flooding in coastal cities. In Pennsylvania, flooding rains and powerful wind gusts produced widespread destruction. Railroads in western parts of the state were plagued by washouts and landslides, while in southeastern areas, hundreds of barns were destroyed. The storm demolished a 5,390\u00a0ft (1,640\u00a0m) bridge over the Susquehanna River, while the Gettysburg Battlefield lost hundreds of trees, a few of which struck and damaged historical monuments. Strong winds extended as far east as Long Island. Heavy rainfall reached west into Ohio, and the hurricane's extratropical remnants wrought havoc on shipping in the Great Lakes. The storm caused at least 202 deaths and wrought more than $9.6 million (equivalent to $352\u00a0million in 2023) in damage."

The cyclone steadily intensified, turned northward, and moved through the Yucat\u00e1n Channel on September 28.[1] The aftermath of the storm in western Cuba was consistent with the effects of a Category 1 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir\u2013Simpson scale, suggesting that the storm was a major hurricane of Category 3 intensity while passing west of the island.[4] As the storm entered the Gulf of Mexico, it began to accelerate and curve toward the north-northeast.[1] In the early morning on September 29,[2] the center of the hurricane made landfall on Cedar Key, Florida, with a minimum central pressure of 960\u00a0mb (28.35\u00a0inHg), and moved inland across Levy County. The cyclone possessed an unusually tight core, with a 17\u00a0mi (27\u00a0km) radius of maximum wind, and was traveling at a swift pace of about 35\u00a0mph (55\u00a0km/h). Consequently, its estimated maximum winds of 125\u00a0mph (205\u00a0km/h) were higher than pressure alone would suggest.[4] The small but intense hurricane continued northeastward through northern Florida and southeastern Georgia, and its core contracted further; outside of a narrow corridor along the storm's track, winds were comparatively light.[5][6] At Savannah, Georgia, air pressure fell 15\u00a0hPa (0.45\u00a0inHg) in 45 minutes as the storm center passed just to the west around midday on September 29.[7] The system weakened as it sped northward through the Carolinas, but when it reached the Mid-Atlantic states on the evening of September 29, its increasingly rapid forward movement contributed to renewed wind violence.[8] A band of heavy rain was observed along and west of the storm's track from northern North Carolina to southern Pennsylvania, with the heaviest totals exceeding 6\u00a0in (150\u00a0mm).[6] As the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone by early on September 30,[1] its envelope of damaging winds expanded.[7] The extratropical system passed west of Washington, D.C., and progressed into central Pennsylvania, dissipating near the Southern Tier of New York.[1] Its remnants continued into the St. Lawrence Valley, where they merged with another low pressure area.[8][9]"

Sidewalks along the street were washed out.[34] The surge of water undermined the foundations of stone buildings, weakening many of them to the point of collapse,[35] while sweeping away weaker structures.[34] Inside the buildings left intact, mud was sometimes found several feet deep.[10] The hurricane also contaminated wells with seawater and debris, so residents were forced to travel for clean water.[36] Hardest-hit were the small outlying islands, which were fully submerged by the storm surge and \"completely cleared out\". Survivors often braced against young, supple trees that were able to withstand the storm's force,[37] or used pieces of debris as flotation devices.[38] Powerful winds added to the destruction by damaging or leveling numerous churches and houses that managed to remain out of the flood's reach.[39] The hurricane's cumulative force wrecked at least 100 homes on Cedar Key,[40] and damaged or destroyed every building on nearby Atsena Otie Key.[41] A fire broke out during the storm and reduced two large Cedar Key hotels to mounds of coquina.[34]  When the storm abated, streets were strewn with piles of debris, including trees, roofs, railroad ties, and boats.[42] A large ship called the Luna Davis was tossed ashore and sat in the middle of Cedar Key's business district for weeks after the storm.[42] Interests in shellfish harvesting took a significant blow, as the hurricane ruined oyster beds and carried most fishing boats out to sea. The 4\u00a0mi (6.4\u00a0km) stretch of the Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad connecting Cedar Key to the mainland was completely washed out,[43] leaving boats to transport people, mail, and supplies until the railway was rebuilt in mid-October.[44] The hurricane destroyed large swaths of red cedar trees (Juniperus virginiana) in the islands and along the adjacent coastline, although that resource had already been in decline due to unsustainable harvesting practices.[45] Cedar wood from the area was prized for making high-quality pencils; some companies produced the pencils locally while others shipped processed cedar to their factories elsewhere.[46] The Eagle Pencil Company mill on Cedar Key was destroyed. Across the channel on Atsena Otie Key, the Eberhard Faber mill lost 3,000 cases of cedar slats, as well as unprocessed timbers, at a loss of around $40,000[47] (equivalent to $1.5\u00a0million in 2023). Several other mills were destroyed. Damage to the Faber facility was repaired following the storm, but it closed just two years later due to a shortage of local cedar wood.[48] Atsena Otie Key was abandoned a few years after the hurricane, largely attributable to the closure of the mill,[45] which provided income for 100 households on the island.[47] In total, 31 people are known to have been killed by the hurricane in the Cedar Keys,[49] mostly on the exposed outer islands; very few casualties were reported on Cedar Key itself.[35] Immediately after the storm, there were unconfirmed reports that an entire fleet of sponge diving boats sank near the Cedar Keys, leading to the deaths of some 700 men. Only a few bodies of sponge divers were recovered, and modern historians believe that most of the vessels actually rode out the storm in sheltered parts of the island chain.[50] When news of the disaster in the Cedar Keys reached the mainland, many less damaged communities in Florida and Georgia formed relief groups to collect donations for storm victims.[51] Answering pleas to \"feed the hungry, clothe the naked, and provide shelter for the homeless,\" Jacksonville sent thousands of dollars in aid, while Albany residents donated 8,000\u00a0lb (3,600\u00a0kg) of emergency supplies within days of the storm. Henry Flagler pledged a donation of $1,000[52] (equivalent to $0.4\u00a0million in 2023). By the end of October, the Jacksonville relief committee turned its focus to distributing goods and provisions instead of money, shipping hundreds of barrels of nails\u2014highly sought-after for rebuilding efforts\u2014to the hardest-hit areas.[44] The destruction of timber continued onto the mainland, prompting one observer to remark that no usable trees were left standing between the mouths of the Waccasassa and Suwannee rivers.[53] In Williston, nearly a dozen residences were destroyed, killing at least one person and injuring 15 more. Six prison inmates were killed by a falling tree on a farm near the town,[9] and in total, about 13 people died in mainland Levy County.[10] Damage throughout the county, including the Cedar Keys, was estimated at $450,000[54] (equivalent to $16.5\u00a0million in 2023)."

        "content": "Along the coast about midway between Tampa and Cedar Key, eight people on a sailboat died when their vessel was driven aground.[11] In Tampa, the storm flooded low-lying areas, wrecked a bridge over Spanishtown Creek, and crumbled sea walls.[55] As the hurricane proceeded inland, it devastated interior parts of the state.[2] Reports from the hardest-hit localities were slow to reach the outside world because of extensive damage to communications infrastructure, as well as obstructed or washed out railroads. Initial reports indicated that at least 20 communities were \"wrecked\" by the hurricane.[9] In these areas, almost all stores and houses were demolished, particularly in western Alachua and eastern Lafayette counties. Debris was often carried for miles. Farmers lost livestock, crops, and provisions needed for the winter, and hundreds of families were left homeless with little or no food. Along the Suwannee River, storm victims sought refuge in a makeshift shelter constructed from stray timbers.[10] Extreme winds razed entire pine forests across numerous counties, initially uprooting weaker trees before shearing the rest off at their trunks during the height of the storm.[7] By one estimate, the hurricane wiped out 5,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (13,000\u00a0km2) of timber across the state.[56] This transformed the landscape and gave it a \"prairie-like appearance\".[57] The turpentine industry was decimated, as the value of the lost pine timber was estimated at $1.5 million (equivalent to $54.9\u00a0million in 2023). Additionally, stills used to process turpentine were mangled. Consequently, some 2,500 turpentine workers were left unemployed.[10] Phosphate processing plants east of the Suwanee River also sustained $500,000 in damage[10] (equivalent to $18.3\u00a0million in 2023). By several days after the hurricane, 12 people were reported dead across Alachua County.[10] Five of them were in High Springs,[58] including two seeking shelter in a box car that was blown off the tracks.[12] Four turpentine workers in LaCrosse were crushed to death when a fallen tree landed on their cabin, and three others in the town were killed. In Newberry, which was \"totally wrecked\",[12] three people died.[58] About 20 homes and businesses in Gainesville were ravaged,[12] as were a sawmill, church, and warehouse.[59] In Boulogne, Nassau County, five people were killed when a school building collapsed; four were crushed inside, and a baby was fatally struck by airborne timbers from the disintegrating structure.[57] One child escaped the school but later died along with two others when her house collapsed.[12] Another school collapse in Hilliard took the lives of four individuals.[57] Along the St Marys River in Kings Ferry, strong winds drove two ships into a marsh, killing three sailors.[9] Six others died nearby.[60] One sawmill owner donated free lumber to Kings Ferry residents so they could rebuild their homes.[60] Several communities in Baker County were devastated, leaving seven people dead, as many as 100 injured, and hundreds destitute.[10] The county sheriff estimated that merely a dozen houses out of a thousand survived the storm, that thousands of cows were killed, and that hundreds of thousands of trees were toppled.[10] Not one church or school was left standing in the county,[61] and damage there was estimated at $250,000[62] (equivalent to $9.2\u00a0million in 2023). Eight people were killed in Suwannee County, including two children crushed by the collapse of their home near Wellborn. In Columbia County, dozens of buildings suffered near or total destruction, while nine people were killed.[10][12] One woman died in Grady, a small settlement in Lafayette County.[13] Additionally, there were five fatalities in Bradford County, including one man reportedly struck by flying bricks that were lofted nearly a half mile downwind.[58] Strong winds and heavy rainfall affected areas as far southeast as St. Augustine. In Fernandina Beach, the hurricane toppled oak trees and destroyed buildings.[63] Although wind gusts in Jacksonville reached 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h),[7] the effects were generally insignificant.[9]"

The winds brought down telephone, telegraph, and electric wires throughout the region, severing communications.[18] Damage in the Sea Islands was extensive, costing an estimated $500,000[20] (equivalent to $18.3\u00a0million in 2023); by some accounts, the winds were more intense than in the catastrophic hurricane of 1893,[64] but without the exceptionally high storm surge.[29] The tropical cyclone caused severe damage to the islands' plantations,[18] ruining around a third of the rice crop, devastating the cotton crop, and killing up to 100 people.[13][15] Charlton and Camden counties bore the brunt of the storm's force in Georgia, as evidenced by the complete clearing of dense pine forests east of Folkston.[65] This dealt a $500,000 (equivalent to $18.3\u00a0million in 2023) blow to the turpentine industry. Many structures in Folkston were destroyed, including multiple churches, a courthouse, and a school that collapsed with 38 students inside, all of whom safely escaped.[18][19] In small communities throughout extreme southeastern Georgia, the storm caused widespread destruction of homes and businesses.[66] Six people in Camden County were killed,[58] including four in a logging settlement that was ravaged near the Florida border.[9] In Brunswick, freight cars in rail yards were badly damaged, and railroads were clogged by fallen trees and utility poles.[18][67] Estimates of property damage in Brunswick ran as high as $500,000 (equivalent to $18.3\u00a0million in 2023), while five people died and many more were injured by flying debris.[15][19] Hurricane-force wind gusts lifted the roof off the Oglethorpe Hotel and shattered its windows,[19] while the L'Arioso Opera House, regarded as one of Brunswick's \"most beautiful buildings\", collapsed in the hurricane. At least six churches were severely damaged in the city,[58] along with dozens of stores and residences.[19] The hurricane sank numerous large vessels in the Brunswick harbor, including one loaded with 5,000\u00a0lb (2,300\u00a0kg) of dynamite, and blew others aground. Observers reported the masts of submerged sailing ships protruding from the surface of the water.[19][67] On St. Simons Island, the storm destroyed bath houses, cottages, churches, and a pier,[67] and inundated a hotel with sea water. Black settlements on the island suffered extensively. Overall, damage on St. Simons Island totaled $150,000[19] (equivalent to $5.5\u00a0million in 2023). To the north, damage was similarly severe in Darien. Eight people there were reported dead and buildings were \"torn to pieces.\"[17] Sustained winds in Savannah reached 75\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h), though maximum gusts were not ascertained because the recording anemometer malfunctioned at the height of the storm. The hurricane passed in an unusually brief period of two hours,[7] with most of the damage being done over the course of about 45 minutes.[68] Roofs were \"rolled up like tissue-paper\" in the fierce winds, while chimneys and brick walls were toppled.[15] In all, thousands of buildings in the city were unroofed, with many of them totally destroyed.[18] Trees were variously uprooted or snapped in parks and cemeteries,[18] including Forsyth Park, considered the \"pride of the city\", which lost between half and three quarters of its trees.[23][68] Piles of debris left streets impassable, even to pedestrians.[68] Numerous large ships were driven ashore, though some survived unscathed, and dozens of smaller vessels were wrecked along waterways in the city.[18] Several people, including the captain, drowned when the tugboat Robert Turner capsized in the Savannah River.[64] Another craft, the Island Flower, sank nearby, killing three.[68] The storm surge associated with the hurricane flooded low-lying coastal areas and washed away several miles of the Tybee Railroad.[18] Wind gusts estimated at over 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) demolished hotels and beachfront cottages on Tybee Island. Near Wilmington Island, a fisherman drowned after getting caught in the storm on a small boat.[68] In Burroughs, along the outskirts of Savannah, two churches were leveled and three people were killed. Residents there were forced to abandon their homes and endure the storm in open fields to avoid injury.[18] Initial estimates placed damage in Savannah at more than $1 million (equivalent to $36.6\u00a0million in 2023), a quarter of which resulted from devastation to railroads.[18] In particular, the Savannah, Florida and Western Railway and Central of Georgia Railway sustained extensive losses, and about 50 streetcars in Savannah were destroyed.[15] Overall, the storm killed at least 17 people in and around Savannah.[68] Even before the storm subsided, people crowded the streets in a \"stampede\" to verify the safety of friends and family.[69]"

Powerful gusts shifted a drawbridge spanning the river north of Hardeeville. Seven people in Hardeeville died in building failures, while train stations were blown down there and in Yemassee.[21] Around Beaufort, the storm wrecked numerous boats and effected significant damage to homes and businesses.[18] Wharves and warehouses were flooded, though low astronomical tides limited the extent of the inundation. The winds peeled off tin roofs, allowing rainwater to douse home interiors.[70] In Charleston, tropical storm-force winds blew down fences, signs, and other light installations, but damage was generally minor, and no deaths were reported. The storm churned Charleston Harbor until waves breached seawalls and flooded low-lying areas.[21] Total damage in the state was around $25,000[6] (equivalent to $0.92\u00a0million in 2023). In North Carolina, the weakening tropical cyclone tracked through predominately rural areas, limiting its adverse effects.[29] Nonetheless, severe winds affected the Raleigh\u2013Durham area, uprooting trees and littering streets with debris. One woman was killed when a large oak tree fell on her bedroom.[22] Damage to utility lines left Raleigh without communications or electricity, while in Durham, a four-story tobacco curing barn collapsed with about 475,000\u00a0lb (215,000\u00a0kg) of tobacco inside, worth as much as $60,000[23] (equivalent to $2.2\u00a0million in 2023). About $20,000 (equivalent to $0.73\u00a0million in 2023) in other property damage was attributed to the storm.[6] Residents in Chapel Hill described the storm as the most severe in recent memory.[29]"

        "content": "As the cyclone expanded and accelerated, it entered Virginia with renewed violence, and produced what still stands as the most severe windstorm in Richmond's history. Generally, the strongest winds were mostly confined to east of the storm center's track. The East End of Richmond was hit particularly hard, but damage to church steeples, roofs, and chimneys was common throughout the whole city.[29] Downed trees and broken branches carpeted the ground and clogged streets. All telegraph lines except one, which ran to Wilmington, North Carolina, were rendered useless, while communications in Petersburg were entirely cut off. Damage in Richmond totaled $150,000[71] (equivalent to $5.5\u00a0million in 2023). Rural areas were also severely impacted; in Boydton, the storm destroyed many barns and stables, crushing the livestock inside them. In farmlands throughout central Virginia, fences, crops, and outbuildings were blown down, stunting agriculture in the region.[29] \"It is said by those who witnessed these scenes that the huge sheets of tin sailed through the air in a manner suggestive of giant vampires. They would be apparently about to alight on one side of a street when they would sail upward again and fall in the opposite direction.\" The Alexandria Gazette and Virginia Advertiser[25] The destruction continued into northern portions of the state; brick walls were toppled and about 500 shade trees felled in Fredericksburg. Farms in Fairfax and Arlington counties were substantially damaged,[25] and dozens of windmills were destroyed around Falls Church. Wooden houses were blown away.[71] In Alexandria, four people were killed,[25] while factories and homes along the Potomac River were damaged.[27] One of the fatalities occurred when a three-story brick building partially collapsed onto the roof of a smaller house. Across the city, large sheets of tin roofs were peeled off buildings and followed erratic paths before hitting the ground in a clangor that \"produced a pandemonium long to be remembered.\"[25] Property in Alexandria incurred about $400,000 in damage[20] (equivalent to $14.6\u00a0million in 2023). Despite the destruction in the city, surveys of the storm's effects revealed that initial reports of its severity were exaggerated. In some cases, damage was enabled or worsened by pre-existing structural flaws.[27] In Manassas, the winds shifted a church 6\u00a0in (0.15\u00a0m) off its foundation.[71] Heavy rain fell along and west of the storm's track, most prodigiously in the Shenandoah Valley.[26] Reports of 5\u00a0in (130\u00a0mm) or more were common;[25] in Dale Enterprise, 6.3\u00a0in (160\u00a0mm) of rain fell in a period of 18 hours. Nearly 7\u00a0in (180\u00a0mm) of rain fell over Staunton in a similarly short span of time. The rapid inflow of water caused a lake in Staunton's Gypsy Hill Park to rise until its earthen dam failed around 10 p.m. local time, sending a large volume of water rushing into the town's business district. Along the way, the torrent swept away 25 homes, one of which was occupied by a family of four. Power was cut to the town after floodwaters inundated the electric plant,[71][72] and multiple hotels, stores, and other businesses were extensively damaged.[24] As waters rose, victims were forced to await rescue from their roofs.[20] A local waterway known as Lewis Creek also overflowed its banks and contributed to the flooding.[73] The Staunton flood took the lives of six people,[24] and inflicted as much as $500,000 (equivalent to $18.3\u00a0million in 2023) in property damage.[20] In the countryside, about 40 horses and mules drowned.[72] Deadly flooding also took place in Rockingham County, affecting the communities of Bridgewater, Elkton, and Keezletown. Three fatalities were reported in the county, and local infrastructure sustained $20,000 in damage[24] (equivalent to $0.73\u00a0million in 2023). The South Fork Shenandoah River at Luray swelled to 25.4\u00a0ft (7.7\u00a0m)\u2014flood stage being 14\u00a0ft (4.3\u00a0m)\u2014which still stands as one of its highest historical crests.[74] In Stephens City, rushing waters crumbled bridges and washed out corn crops.[25] A waterway in Waynesboro reportedly rose 15\u00a0ft (4.6\u00a0m) and flowed with enough force to wipe nearby buildings off their foundations.[75] Urban flooding also plagued Roanoke streets. From there to Hagerstown, the Norfolk and Western Railway was severely washed out in multiple places.[71] In total, property damage in Virginia amounted to at least $1 million[26] (equivalent to $36.6\u00a0million in 2023). Strong winds and significant rainfall extended into West Virginia, chiefly in northern and eastern parts of the state. Trees, fences, and houses were blown down in the Eastern Panhandle region, while flash floods undermined railroads and destroyed entire fields of crops. Some livestock drowned around Old Fields.[26]"

At the time, it was the worst storm to ever affect the city.[27][72] The winds brought down signs, awnings, trees, and brick walls, while unroofing homes, toppling church steeples, and shattering windows.[72] Electric, telegraph, and telephone utilities were lost.[15] The destruction was not uniform, as poorly built structures often survived unscathed in the vicinity of much stronger buildings that incurred significant damage.[76] It was deduced that the strongest gusts occurred in narrow \"streaks\".[27] Approximately 5,000 trees were destroyed in the city,[28] many of them being snapped 10 to 15\u00a0ft (3.0 to 4.6\u00a0m) above the ground.[7] Some of the worst damage occurred in cemeteries, such as the United States Soldiers' and Airmen's Home National Cemetery, where 300 trees were prostrated. In a few cases, the fallen trees unearthed underlying coffins.[77] A residence building under construction at the Catholic University of America was dismantled, and the personal home of President Grover Cleveland in Woodley Park lost its roof. Roofs of several government offices were also torn away, and the steeple of New York Avenue Presbyterian Church was \"reduced to match wood\".[78] The Smithsonian Institution Building sustained notable damage.[79] Fallen trees littered the grounds of the White House,[76] among them being historic specimens like an elm planted by Abraham Lincoln.[20] Some of the more celebrated trees were picked apart by passersby trying to procure souvenirs.[76] The White House itself suffered some minor damage, mostly limited to dislodged coping and copper roofing,[20][71] along with a few broken windows.[28] Nearby, five men were entrapped and one killed when the Abert Building\u2014a newly built, five-story brick structure on Pennsylvania Avenue\u2014partially collapsed in the storm, crushing two adjoining buildings.[27][71] Over the coming months, tenants filed multiple lawsuits against the building's owner after at least one local builder asserted that the wall failure resulted from neglectful construction.[80][81][82] The Abert Building was completely repaired by October 14.[83] On the Potomac River, where tides ran well above normal, ships broke free from their moorings and drifted downstream. In one instance, a large steamship called the George Leary struck and damaged six other ships. Numerous vessels capsized in the river, including the steamer Mary Washington and the schooner John W. Linnell.[71][84] At the Washington Navy Yard, multiple buildings sustained damage.[79] Overall losses in Washington, D.C. were approximately $400,000[27] (equivalent to $14.6\u00a0million in 2023), and at least two dozen individuals in the city suffered injuries from falling debris.[20]"

A report from Sandy Spring estimated that 20% of trees in the region were uprooted, splintered, or violently twisted, often falling on utility wires and roads. Some of the trees left standing were stripped of their limbs and reduced to bare trunks. Telegraph poles crashed to the ground in large numbers.[85] In some cases, damage patterns and eyewitness accounts suggested the formation of tornadoes embedded within the larger storm system.[86] As in northern Virginia, churches, homes, and businesses incurred significant damage, some being wholly destroyed. Montgomery County was hit particularly hard; the storm wrecked an amusement park in Bethesda, forcing it to permanently close, while Gaithersburg was \"most disastrously wrecked\". Several individuals died in Montgomery County, including one man who died of a stress-induced heart attack. Most of the farms in central Maryland were affected to some degree.[85] Periods of exceptionally heavy rainfall, amounting to 4.90\u00a0in (124\u00a0mm) in Flintstone and 3.91\u00a0in (99\u00a0mm) in Cumberland,[87] caused rapid rises along waterways in the Potomac River watershed, inundating adjacent low-lying areas.[85] The Cumberland and Pennsylvania Railroad line in Cumberland was washed out.[88] High tides in the Chesapeake Bay flooded streets in Annapolis.[88] Farther north, at Baltimore, water funneled into the Inner Harbor and flooded the city's waterfront.[75] Pratt Street was submerged waist deep, while an overflowing Jones Falls filled bordering streets with 8\u00a0ft (2.4\u00a0m) of water. Floodwaters drained into cellars and lower levels of warehouses, and forced some families to evacuate their homes.[88] Hundreds of structures in Baltimore were damaged by the windstorm, and several small fires were ignited by downed power lines.[86] Throughout Maryland, the storm took the lives of eight people and wrought $500,000 in damage[6][75] (equivalent to $18.3\u00a0million in 2023)."

Large trees were uprooted \"with masses of earth clinging to them as big as a room.\" In all, damage reached $200,000 (equivalent to $7.3\u00a0million in 2023) in Harrisburg.[18][88] On the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad at Philson, two freight trains violently collided, killing six vagrants.[20] Several more train wrecks were attributed to obstructing storm debris.[89] In Steelton, an overpass collapsed onto the tracks of the Pennsylvania Railroad shortly before a train careened through the rubble, damaging the locomotive and several cars.[90] Additionally, two roundhouses were destroyed in Lebanon, with eight locomotives sustaining damage in one of the structures.[88] The third incarnation of the Columbia\u2013Wrightsville Bridge\u2014a 5,390\u00a0ft (1,640\u00a0m) covered railroad bridge across the Susquehanna River\u2014was shoved off its piers and demolished by the intense winds.[89] Several people were reportedly inside the bridge when it collapsed, but this was not confirmed.[28] The stone, wood, and steel span was replaced by a steel truss bridge less than a year later.[89] At Sunbury, two steamboats sank in the Susquehanna.[28] Across Lancaster County, hundreds of farmers lost their entire tobacco crops that were stored in barns and ready for market. Some of the tobacco barns were carried off their foundations and blown afield. The storm also destroyed more substantial brick structures.[88] Damage in the county was estimated at $1 million[88] (equivalent to $36.6\u00a0million in 2023). Two men died in the Patterson Coal Company miners' village in Shamokin that was devastated by the winds and a subsequent fire that together destroyed dozens of houses and shanties.[28][88] The storm destroyed equipment and facilities at the nearby Colbert Colliery, putting hundreds of miners out of work.[28] In Reading, two men died in the collapse of an iron furnace casting house which left five others badly injured.[28][87] Six children died to a storm-induced fire in tenement housing belonging to a mining company in Natalie.[15] Hundreds of trees were blown down or broken on the historic battlefield at Gettysburg National Park, largely on Culp's Hill and Big Round Top. The 66th Ohio Infantry monument on Culp's Hill was destroyed by a fallen tree, and the nearby monument to the 78th and 102nd New York Volunteer Infantries sustained minor damage.[91] In addition to the winds, several inches of rain fell in parts of the state; Altoona recorded 3.79\u00a0in (96\u00a0mm) of precipitation. Flash flooding along the Juniata River rushed through Huntingdon, washing out streets and railways, inundating homes, and drowning livestock.[87] Washouts and landslides plagued railroads throughout western Pennsylvania.[88] Overall, the storm caused over $2 million (equivalent to $73.2\u00a0million in 2023) in damage in the state.[6]"

Resulting floods damaged crops and property,[6] and the inclement weather disrupted William McKinley's presidential campaign activities at his home in Canton.[87] On September 30, gales from the former hurricane swept across the Great Lakes. Hundreds of spectators lined the shores of Lake Michigan at Chicago, Illinois, to watch the enormous waves.[15] A schooner was torn from its moorings at Chicago, and crashed into nearly a dozen smaller vessels while being blown about.[92] The schooner Belle from Racine, Wisconsin, went missing amid the storm, while the barge Sumatra broke up and capsized near Milwaukee, taking the lives of four crew members; the captain, first mate, and cook were safely rescued.[15] The storm damaged around $75,000 worth of property on the Great Lakes[20] (equivalent to $2.7\u00a0million in 2023)."

Later that day, Danas began to weaken. On July 20, around 13:00 UTC, Danas made landfall in South Korea as a minimal tropical storm, before weakening into a tropical depression soon afterward.[citation needed] The weakening trend also accelerated on July 20 due to the drop in sea surface temperatures to 23\u00a0\u00b0C (73\u00a0\u00b0F) near landfall. The Republic of Korea Meteorological Administration downgraded Danas to a tropical depression at 11 am and stopped issuing announcements.[1] At 12:45 UTC on July 21, Danas transitioned into an extratropical low in the Sea of Japan, and the JMA issued their final advisory on the storm.[citation needed]"

        "content": " Hurricane San Roque was a destructive tropical cyclone in August 1893 that principally affected Puerto Rico, eastern New England, and Atlantic Canada. Its informal name in Puerto Rico arises from the feast day of Saint Roch, or San Roque in Spanish, which coincided with the hurricane's landfall on that island.[nb 1] It was the third known hurricane of the 1893 Atlantic hurricane season. The system was first observed on August 13 at low latitudes east of the Lesser Antilles. It grew to be a powerful, slow-moving hurricane in the Caribbean Sea, and on August 17 struck Puerto Rico at the equivalence of Category 3 on the modern-day Saffir\u2013Simpson scale. The eye crossed the island from southeast to northwest in about seven hours. A prolonged period of strong winds caused widespread destruction on the island, most notably along the northern coast. Large numbers of homes sustained varying degrees of damage, with flimsy shacks belonging to poor workers faring the worst; many families were left homeless, and four people were killed. Telegraph communications were severed across the island. In addition to the intense winds, several days of heavy rainfall in interior sectors triggered extensive river flooding. The combined effects of rain and wind destroyed fields of crops, most notably coffee and sugar cane. On August 19, the hurricane began to turn northeastward, accelerate, and gradually weaken. Although its center remained far from the United States, heavy rainfall and gale-force winds overspread the country's East Coast on August 20 and 21. Eastern New England experienced conditions akin to a particularly bad nor'easter, with winds as high as 72\u00a0mph (116\u00a0km/h) recorded on Block Island. Across Rhode Island and Massachusetts, grain crops were flattened and orchards were stripped of their fruits. The racing yacht Volunteer was badly damaged, and a fishing schooner sank off Nantucket; only one of the seven crew members managed to survive, by clinging to debris for 33 hours. Later that day, the now-rapidly moving cyclone made landfall in Nova Scotia. Damage to utility wires in Halifax cut power and communications services, and a child was killed by a downed power line. The storm wrought havoc on ships and boats throughout Atlantic Canada, becoming \"one of the most notorious marine storms in the history of Nova Scotia\".[4] The greatest maritime tragedy was the wreck of the steamship Dorcas and its barge, Etta Stewart, which struck a rocky shoal while underway east of Halifax. Dorcas capsized and was driven ashore, while the barge broke up in the pounding surf. All crew members and passengers on the two vessels, totaling 24 people, were killed. Two more people died when their boat sank on Trinity Bay in Newfoundland, for a storm total of 37 fatalities."

        "header": "Meteorological history",
        "content": "Because of scarce meteorological observations, little is known about Hurricane San Roque's early history. According to contemporaneous accounts, it most likely originated in the Intertropical Convergence Zone off the northern coast of South America.[5] In the Atlantic hurricane database, its formation as a tropical storm is entered on August 13, corresponding with the first observation of the system, about 730\u00a0mi (1,170\u00a0km) east of Trinidad and Tobago. It crossed the Lesser Antilles island arc on August 15, passing between Dominica and Guadeloupe.[6] The intensifying cyclone moved toward the northwest and by 18:00 UTC on August 16, it was centered very close to St. Croix.[7] Upon receiving the first report of the storm from Saint Thomas, the U.S. Weather Bureau issued a special bulletin relaying the current position of the hurricane, forecasting its recurvature by August 21, and advising shipping interests to take necessary precautions.[5] At 00:00 UTC on August 17, the cyclone made landfall near Patillas, Puerto Rico, as the equivalent of a Category 3 major hurricane on the modern-day Saffir\u2013Simpson scale.[6][8] Modern reanalysis efforts estimated the intensity at landfall through the severity of wind damage in Puerto Rico, which was consistent with F2 on the Fujita scale.[3] The eye was marked by a period of stark calm as it crossed the island such that during its passage, some people believed the storm to be over.[9] At San Juan, to the north of the center path, barometric pressure fell to 987.8\u00a0mbar (29.17\u00a0inHg).[8] Approximately seven hours after moving ashore, the center exited Puerto Rico between Isabela and Quebradillas.[7][8] On August 18, weather stations along the Atlantic coast of the Southeastern U.S. started to register the hurricane's distant influence.[5] It passed over or close to the Turks and Caicos Islands.[7] While situated northeast of the Bahamas on August 19, the hurricane began its recurvature to the north and ultimately northeast.[6] Late on August 20 and into the following day, gales and heavy rainfall overspread the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast coasts.[5] The hurricane weakened as it gained latitude and early on August 21, it passed approximately 185\u00a0mi (300\u00a0km) east of Cape Hatteras. Later that day, the accelerating storm passed within 150\u00a0mi (240\u00a0km) of Nantucket. At 00:00 UTC on August 22, it was one of four active hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean, and the first of three to impact the U.S. East Coast in the span of eight days; Hurricane Four would strike western Long Island on August 24, and Hurricane Six ravaged the Sea Islands on August 28 before moving northward along the Eastern Seaboard.[6][10] Though some modern researchers catalogued the system as a hurricane on its final approach to Nova Scotia, the official Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project found no conclusive evidence of hurricane-force winds in Canada.[7][3] In the early morning hours of August 22, the storm made landfall in Nova Scotia via St. Margarets Bay,[11] as an extratropical cyclone.[6] Its northeasterly path placed greater Halifax in the typically intense right-front quadrant of the storm center; this would not be repeated until Hurricane Juan in 2003.[11] After rapidly crossing Nova Scotia, the extratropical system impacted the island of Newfoundland. Its remnants continued eastward into the North Atlantic for several more days; its documented course ends on August 25.[6]"

        "content": "For the first time in Puerto Rico's history, warning flags were used to alert the public of the approaching hurricane.[8] Officials in San Juan first hoisted cautionary red flags during the mid-morning on August 16, upgraded three hours later to more urgent yellow and blue signals, and finally to black flags to mark the cyclone's onslaught.[14] By mid-afternoon the Port of San Juan was closed; although orders were given to evacuate ships from the port, the short notice and lack of available tugboats meant some vessels had to ride out the storm at anchor, exposed to the elements.[15] Ships at dock were required to be unloaded of their cargo.[12] When the severity of the hurricane became clear, local officials ensured moorings were secure and orchestrated the positioning of ships to minimize risk of collisions.[9] Bus and tram services were suspended as conditions worsened, leaving many residents unable to reach their homes for the night.[9] On the night of August 16\u201317, winds of 55\u00a0mph (89\u00a0km/h) and 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) were recorded in San Juan and Mayag\u00fcez, respectively, before both recording anemometers were blown away.[7] It was the long duration of the storm, rather than its intensity alone, which made it so destructive.[13] The northern coast suffered most as the storm wrought havoc on crops, telegraph infrastructure, and buildings of varying construction quality.[15] Poorly built shacks and huts, the residences of impoverished workers, fared the worst.[14] In Camuy, the storm destroyed up to 20 houses, uprooted trees, and sparked two small fires; in the aftermath, the mayor appointed a special commission to facilitate the transfer of relief funds to storm victims. Many of the homeless families received donations from neighbors to help cover basic expenses. The winds unroofed many small huts near the shore of Arecibo, forcing their residents to flee for cover, and knocked down wooden and brick fences. The local telegraph station was rendered inoperative, slowing the initial spread of damage reports.[15] Both the city and outlying rural areas of Manat\u00ed incurred widespread damage, with dozens of thatch roofs blown off and some homes left uninhabitable. The basement of a colectur\u00eda, or tithe barn, was provided as temporary shelter to poor and injured storm victims. Numerous people in Hatillo were left homeless, and reports there described trees being blown far from where they once stood.[15] Severe damage befell Vega Baja, with at least 28 houses destroyed and many banana, coconut, and other fruit trees toppled.[16] Eight houses were destroyed in Isabela, and one family required rescue after its home was crushed under the dislocated roof of an adjacent building. Many poor families became homeless; some were offered shelter in the homes of local government and Civil Guard officials.[16] A church atrium in the town was destroyed.[17] Many more peasant huts were destroyed in Bayam\u00f3n, along with the roofs of more substantial structures. All telegraph wires and poles in the community were blown down.[15] Seven or eight houses were destroyed in Trujillo Alto.[18] The effects proved less severe than feared in Utuado, though banana plantations suffered.[16] In Dorado, numerous houses were damaged and six were destroyed, their residents forced to seek shelter in government buildings.[15] The storm was not as severe in San Juan as in other towns, although destruction remained widespread. One hospital was badly damaged, with the roof over the maternity ward peeled away. Timbers and metal roofing tiles were blown a great distance from the structure, and patients had to be transferred to a nearby military hospital. Another hospital in the Puerta de Tierra subbarrio was also unroofed.[19] With telegraph wires downed in all directions, San Juan initially had no contact with the rest of the island.[9] Many gas lanterns were broken. Palm and fruit trees were uprooted throughout the city, while garden fences and awnings were blown down. Many houses, huts, businesses, and public facilities around San Juan sustained varying degrees of structural damage.[9] Several houses in the nearby town of Cata\u00f1o were demolished.[19] Heavy rainfall lasted two to three days in some locations.[19] San Juan recorded 2.36\u00a0in (60\u00a0mm) of precipitation.[8] Further inland, rivers overflowed their banks with the torrential rainfall, inundating wide tracts of low-lying terrain.[15] Among the major rivers flooded were the R\u00edo Grande de Arecibo, R\u00edo Grande de Manat\u00ed, and Santiago. Floodwaters ruined harvests of crops like rice, corn, and sugar cane.[15] One farmer in Humacao, near the eastern coast, reported the loss of about 80 acres (32\u00a0ha) of sugar cane fields.[16] The neighborhood of Marina in Gurabo had to be evacuated due to river flooding. The mayor of the town started a donation drive for poor families. One worker on a hacienda died, and his burial was delayed until flooding in the local cemetery receded.[16] Many railways and thoroughfares, including the road between Cata\u00f1o and Bayam\u00f3n, were made impassable by both fallen trees and deep floodwaters.[19] With mail routes blocked and telegraph communications severed, the full extent of the destruction was slow to be revealed.[14] On the day after the storm, workers began to clear railways and reestablish communications.[15] Several ships were destroyed and others left stranded on the beach. The schooner Enriqueta broke free and crashed into a pier; the sloop Tomasito grounded out, crushing its keel; and another sloop, the Maria Artau, went ashore at Palo Seco, with all hands saved by another crew.[19][9] At Arecibo, the British schooner Robbie Godfrey broke free from its moorings in port while being loaded with sugar. The ship was driven aground and destroyed, along with its cargo, but all hands were able to reach the shore with the assistance of rescue brigades. One crewman was hospitalized for an arm injury.[15][19] The schooner Martiniguesi, loaded with cattle en route to Martinique, went ashore at Maunabo, with one crewman and numerous head of cattle killed.[16] The sloop Pepito was lost at Cata\u00f1o.[19] Sea baths along the shore were destroyed.[9] Among all agricultural losses, that of the year's coffee crop was most significant.[8] Losses to the coffee harvest in Lares alone were estimated at 500,000 Puerto Rican pesos. In some localities, only crops in sheltered valleys survived.[16] As much as 60% of the coffee harvest was lost to the storm in Comer\u00edo.[20] The storm was locally referred to as \"San Roque\" since it began on the feast day of Saint Roch, known as San Roque in Spanish.[7][9] It was among the last significant tropical cyclones to affect Puerto Rico before the island came under United States rule in 1898.[13] Some contemporary accounts drew comparisons to the devastating San Felipe hurricane of 1876.[16] The hurricane caused four known fatalities in Puerto Rico.[8]"

A closer pass by New England the following day resulted in severe nor'easter-like conditions, with winds peaking at 72\u00a0mph (116\u00a0km/h) on Block Island and 52\u00a0mph (84\u00a0km/h) on Nantucket. In Woods Hole, Massachusetts, winds up to 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) were reported. Tropical storm-force winds extended north to Eastport.[7] The Hartford Courant described the hurricane \"the most severe August storm known for many years\" in Chatham;[21] in Oak Bluffs (then called Cottage City) on Martha's Vineyard, it was \"without a precedent during the summer season\" according to The Boston Globe.[22] The U.S. Weather Bureau had predicted bad weather for several days, and warning signals were raised along the coast 24 hours before onset. Consequently, shipping interests generally endured the storm without major losses.[23] Throughout Cape Cod and the Islands, trees, fences, and utility wires were blown down. Apple and pear trees were stripped of their fruit, and vegetable crops suffered. Floodwaters inundated streets and cellars while the driving rain forced its way inside east-facing walls.[21][22] Many roads were littered with the broken branches of large trees; some smaller trees and shrubs were uprooted entirely.[23] Part of the Nantucket Railroad was washed out at Tom Nevers Head, and wharves on the island received minor damage.[24] In the mid-morning on August 21, the Portland, Maine-based fishing schooner Mary Lizzie sank in heavy seas off Nantucket. Six of the seven crew members drowned. The one survivor held to floating debris for 33 hours until he was rescued by a passing steamship.[25][26] The racing yacht Volunteer, winner of the 1887 America's Cup, broke free from her anchorage and was tossed onto the rocks near the entrance to Hadley's Harbor on Naushon Island, Massachusetts. Pounding seas battered the vessel, breaking up much of its deck and flooding the hull. After an unsuccessful attempt by another yacht to rescue Volunteer with the storm still raging, a tugboat was able to dislodge the stricken craft and tow her to a nearby wharf.[21][23] The storm disabled several ships around Martha's Vineyard, including the schooners Sarah Louise and Clara Jane, both of which were damaged, and the sloop Cassie, left stranded on the shore. Numerous other fishing vessels lost their anchors, sails, or seine fishing boats. The maritime havoc extended westward to New Jersey's Sandy Hook, where a yacht was wrecked.[22] President Grover Cleveland sheltered in his summer home of Gray Gables  during the storm. His yacht was narrowly saved from being swept ashore.[23] Rainfall in Boston commenced in the late evening of August 20 and continued through the following afternoon, totaling 1.65\u00a0in (42\u00a0mm); the Charles River breached its banks, flooding the Cambridgeport neighborhood of Cambridge up to 3\u00a0ft (0.9\u00a0m) deep. At Nantasket Beach in the town of Hull, immense swells drew crowds of onlookers, photographers, and artists before the surf action began damaging boardwalks and carnival game booths. Roads in Plymouth were littered with broken tree limbs, and several pleasure craft in Plymouth Harbor were blown aground.[23] Great damage to grain crops also plagued the neighboring state of Rhode Island.[23][27] Two sailors were rescued after their boat capsized in Newport Harbor. A fishing schooner drifted to sea with its crew aboard; it was ultimately rescued by a tug south of the Brenton Reef Light. Numerous ships rode out the storm in the shelter of Dutch Island in the West Passage of Narragansett Bay, being \"tossed like cockle shells on the swirling waters\" as described by the Fall River Daily Evening News .[28] One of Ethel Swift's two anchor chains broke, resulting in a wreck on the western shore of the bay. The schooner's crew of four was safely rescued.[28] Further up the bay, three ships were blown aground on Prudence Island.[27]  A yacht race set for August 21 around Newport was postponed because of the bad weather.[29] Some 17 fire alarm call boxes in Charlestown, Rhode Island, were rendered inoperative, so firefighters had to patrol the town continuously through the night of August 20\u201321.[27]"

        "content": "Though in a weakened state, the cyclone battered the Atlantic provinces of Canada. Writing for Cape Breton's Magazine, Michael L. MacDonald wrote that it was \"one of the most notorious marine storms in the history of Nova Scotia\".[4] There, the storm came to be known as the \"Second Great August Gale\", in reference to a catastrophic hurricane in August 1837.[11][30] Throughout the Maritimes, dozens of large ships were stranded or destroyed.[4] Warning signals were hoisted in Nova Scotia on the evening of August 20, and ultimately lowered near midday on August 22.[31] In Halifax, rain and wind began in the early afternoon on August 21 and grew in severity through the night. The city was plunged into darkness and cut off from the outside world as electricity and communications wires fell. Severed power lines sparked small fires and posed a hazard to public safety; a young girl was electrocuted and killed by a live wire, and two more people received non-life-threatening shocks while attempting to recover her body. Parks, public gardens, and cemeteries throughout the city suffered extensive damage, with many large trees destroyed.[32] Many ships and boats were wrecked or blown ashore in Halifax Harbour. In one instance, after colliding with a wharf and being struck by two pontoon boats, the schooner Janie R.'s cargo of lime swelled with the influx of seawater such that the ship burst open.[33] Trees were uprooted and chimneys toppled in Liverpool.[31] The storm was less severe in Yarmouth, at the western end of the province, but still washed out streets and blew down trees.[33] The winds damaged trees, fences, and some buildings in Amherst, and flattened crops in the surrounding countryside.[33] In Cumberland County, the Palmerston Bridge over the upper Pugwash Harbor was badly damaged, and two barques were blown ashore at Northport.[33] Several schooners were wrecked along the shores of Cape Breton;[33] in Ingonish, two ships were left stranded on the shore and six fishing boats drifted out to sea. Residents of the rural community fled their homes at the height of the storm to seek shelter in nearby valleys.[31] Late on the night of August 21, the steamship Dorcas, with barge Etta Stewart in tow, wrecked on the notoriously hazardous reef surrounding Shut-In Island, near the entrance to Three Fathom Harbour.[4][34] Both vessels were loaded with coal en route from Sydney to Halifax. It is likely that the barge took on water in the heavy seas, making it impossible to steer and causing both ships to drift inexorably toward shore in the strong southerly winds.[4] After hitting the rocks, the steamer overturned, losing its engine, boilers, and cargo, and came to rest inverted on the beach. The barge broke up, littering the shore with timbers.[4][34] All crew-members and passengers, totaling 24 people, were killed: Dorcas carried a crew of 10, plus the chief engineer's pregnant wife and 4 children in their care, while 8 crewmen and one passenger were on Etta Stewart.[4][35] All bodies but one were recovered. The small community of Louisbourg, home to 16 of the victims and many of their families, was left reeling, and a rare government inquiry into the disaster was opened; it concluded that the wreck was beyond the control of Captain Angus Ferguson of Dorcas, who \"sacrificed his own life in his endeavour to save those on board the two vessels\".[4]  The commissioner of the inquiry acknowledged that cutting the barge free may have increased the chance of survival for the crew and passengers of Dorcas, but dismissed this as a viable option: \"It may be considered by some that it would have been more prudent and wise for the master of the Dorcas to have disconnected his steamer from the barge at some safe time before approaching the breakers, in order to enable his vessel to reach off shore and thus have made an effort to save the larger number of people on board the steamer at the sacrifice of the less number of people on board the barge.\"Had Captain Ferguson, however, acted in such a manner and been successful in saving the steamer with those on board, he would have forever been branded as a coward when he reached the land and laid himself open to the serious charge of deliberately and wilfully sacrificing the lives of many human beings for the sake of saving his own. To a brave man this would have been intolerable and it must be acknowledged that in acting as he did he displayed the genuine characteristics of a noble seaman, when, amidst the dangers of such a hurricane and wild sea, he met death at the post of duty.\"[4] Despite the tragedy at Shut-In Island, the loss of life in Nova Scotia was considered low relative to the large number of shipwrecks.[35][36] Extensive storm damage, including downed trees and telegraph wires, collapsed barns, and sunk vessels along the coast, was reported in parts of New Brunswick.[33] At Point Escuminac, winds blew at 60 to 62\u00a0mph (97 to 100\u00a0km/h) for three hours and many fishing boats were blown ashore. A similar situation presented itself further north in Shippagan.[31] The cyclone severed communications between Prince Edward Island and the mainland, and inflicted widespread damage upon the province. Streets in the capital city of Charlottetown were strewn with downed tree limbs; in rural sectors, barns were destroyed. A stretch of breakwater in Souris was washed out.[33] Fishing boats in Tignish were shattered.[31] In Perc\u00e9, on the eastern tip of Quebec's Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula, 14 fishing vessels were destroyed.[31] The extratropical remnants of the cyclone continued to produce strong winds over Newfoundland, ruining crops and damaging homes that were under construction. The sinking of a boat in Trinity Bay resulted in the drowning deaths of two men, including member of the General Assembly of Newfoundland, David C. Webber.[36] St. John's reported powerful winds that toppled trees.[31]"

It stayed on the ground for 48 miles (77\u00a0km) and 78 minutes. The tornado injured 1,288 people and killed 94, making it one of the deadliest tornadoes in U.S. history[2] and the deadliest tornado to ever strike New England.[4] A total of 4,000 buildings were damaged or destroyed and, per National Weather Service estimates, 10,000 people were left homeless. The tornado caused $52.193 million (or $590 million [2023 USD] when adjusted for inflation) which, at the time, was the costliest tornado ever recorded. At approximately 4:25\u00a0p.m. EST, the tornado developed in a forest near the town of Petersham, and proceeded to move through Barre, where two people were killed.[5] It then moved through the western suburbs of Worcester, where 11 more people were killed. The storm then passed through Worcester, where it destroyed Assumption College and several other buildings, killing 60. After striking Worcester, it killed 21 more people in the towns of Shrewsbury, Southborough, and Westborough, before dissipating over Framingham."

        "content": "On June 7, 1953, a strong shortwave trough moved eastward over the Rocky Mountains, bringing with it strong upward motion that induced lee cyclogenesis: the formation of a low-pressure area over eastern Colorado. In combination with the warm unstable air in place over the Great Plains, and an elevated mixed layer from the desert southwest, this led to conditions favorable for severe thunderstorms and tornadoes.[6] More than 30 tornadoes occurred that day across Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, and Iowa, including a violent tornado that killed 11 people near Arcadia, Nebraska.[7] On June 8 the storm system moved northeast [8] These conditions led to several tornadoes in the states of Michigan, Ohio, and Nebraska: most notably the Flint-Beecher tornado. The storm killed 116 people in the northern Flint suburb of Beecher, and injured 844. In addition, seven other tornadoes across the region caused 449 more injuries and 26 more fatalities. After the use of the Fujita scale began, the Flint-Beecher tornado was rated F5.[9] On the morning of June 9, the low pressure system had moved northeastward into Ontario near the south end of Hudson Bay. An occluded front extended south from it, towards a triple point with a warm front and cold front near the northern end of Lake Superior. The warm front extended southeast across New York, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey, and over the course of the day moved northeast, bringing warm, moist, unstable air into the New England area, including Massachusetts. In the mid-atmosphere, the elevated mixed layer was still in place, keeping storms from forming earlier in the day before maximum temperatures were reached.[6] By afternoon, temperatures in Worcester had reached 80\u00a0\u00b0F (27\u00a0\u00b0C), with a dew point of 66\u00a0\u00b0F (19\u00a0\u00b0C); in combination with cold air aloft, this meant that atmospheric conditions were very unstable and conducive to severe weather. Along with this, amplified wind shear was present into the afternoon of June 9, which made conditions in the atmosphere supportive of supercell development, and the formation of tornadoes. [7] Forecasters at the National Weather Service office in Boston believed that there was a possibility for tornado activity in the area; however, they did not include such an advisory in their forecast, fearing that people might panic unnecessarily.[10][6] 1953 was the first year that tornado and severe thunderstorm warnings were used, so forecasters compromised and issued the first severe thunderstorm watch in the history of Massachusetts.[10] Most news reports only made mentions of possible thunderstorms.[7] Because of this, the tornado struck with little to no warning for residents.[6][11]"

        "content": "The tornado first developed over the Quabbin Reservoir in Petersham, Massachusetts at 4:25\u00a0p.m., and was witnessed by boaters on the reservoir - three funnels were seen at the beginning, with rapid dissipation of one of them.[citation needed] After brushing Petersham (occasionally with twin funnels several hundred feet apart), the tornado tracked southeastwards and slammed into the rural towns of Barre and Rutland, with two fatalities occurring at each of these locations.[12] The now \nmassive tornado then tore directly through suburban Holden, completely wiping out the Brentwood Estates subdivision, resulting in fatalities.[13] At 5:08\u00a0p.m., the tornado entered Worcester and grew to a width of one mile (1.6\u00a0km). The damage was phenomenal in Worcester (the second-largest city in Massachusetts) and in some areas equaled the worst damage in any U.S. tornado.[12] Hardest-hit areas included Assumption College (now home to Quinsigamond Community College), where a priest and two nuns were killed. The main building's three-foot (0.91\u00a0m)-thick brick walls were reduced by three floors, and the landmark tower lost three stories.[12] A nearby storage tank, weighing several tons, was lofted and tossed across a road by the tornado.[14] The nearby Burncoat Hill neighborhood saw heavy devastation (especially on its western slope), but it was the Uncatena-Great Brook Valley neighborhoods to the east of Burncoat Hill that were utterly leveled, with the tornado possibly reaching F5 intensity in this area.[12] Houses simply vanished, with the debris granulated and scattered well away from the foundations. Entire rows of homes were swept away in some areas. Forty people died in the Uncatena-Great Brook Valley areas alone. A 12-ton (10.89 metric-ton) bus was picked up, rolled over several times, and thrown against the newly constructed Curtis Apartments in Great Brook Valley, resulting in the deaths of two passengers. The Curtis Apartments blueprints were blown all the way to Duxbury (near Plymouth), 75 miles (121\u00a0km) away. Across Boylston St. from the Curtis Apartments, the Brookside Home Farm (a city-operated dairy facility and laundry) sustained total damage, with six men killed and the loss of its herd of 80 Holsteins. Houses and bodies were blown into Lake Quinsigamond. The six fatalities at Brookside were the most in any one building in the tornado's path.[13] At approximately 5:20\u00a0p.m., the funnel moved into Shrewsbury, and maintained its one-mile (1.6\u00a0km) width throughout much of the town, killing 12. The tornado was still doing maximum damage when it moved through downtown Westborough (five deaths), where it began curving towards the northeast in its final leg. In the storm's final moments, three people perished in the collapse of the Fayville Post Office in Southborough.[13] Coincidentally, around the time it ended at 5:45\u00a0p.m., a tornado warning was issued, although by then it was too late. A separate F3 tornado also struck about the same time the warning was issued, in the nearby communities of Sutton, Northbridge, Mendon, Bellingham, Franklin, Wrentham and Mansfield in Massachusetts, injuring 17 persons. Another tornado did minor damage and caused several injuries in Fremont and Exeter in Rockingham County, New Hampshire; other smaller tornadoes occurred in Colrain, Massachusetts and Rollinsford, New Hampshire. Baseball-size hail was reported in a score of communities affected by the Worcester supercell. Airborne debris was strewn eastward, reaching the Blue Hill Meteorological Observatory 35 miles (56\u00a0km) away, and even out over Massachusetts Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. The farthest documented distance of tornado debris was an item that blew from Holden to Eastham on Cape Cod, a distance of 110 miles (180\u00a0km). Some debris was found in the Atlantic Ocean. This is one of the greatest such instances in a U.S. tornado.[12]"

        "content": "The Worcester tornado's greatest effect on the nation was its being the principal catalyst for the Storm Prediction Center's reorganization on June 17, 1953, and subsequent implementation of a nationwide radar/storm spotter system. The results proved successful: only one tornado since the Worcester event - the EF5 tornado that struck Joplin, Missouri in 2011 - has killed greater than 100 people.[citation needed] The severity of this epic storm has been disputed by the meteorological community for several decades. Official observations classified this tornado as F4, but damage was consistent with an F5 tornado in five of the affected towns (Rutland, Holden, Worcester, Shrewsbury and Westborough). As a result of this debate, the National Weather Service took an unprecedented step and convened a panel of weather experts during the spring of 2005 to study the latest evidence on the wind strength of the Worcester tornado. The panel considered whether to raise its designation to F5, but decided during the summer of 2005 to keep the official rating as a strong F4. The reasoning for this was that the anchoring techniques used in many of the destroyed or vanished homes could never be ascertained with certainty now, and some of these structures (many of recent postwar construction) were possibly more vulnerable to high winds than older homes. Without a proper engineering qualification, it would be nearly impossible to determine with 100% accuracy which damage was F5 and which was F4, as appearances would be similar.[citation needed]"

Over the following few days, showers and thunderstorms began to organize around the wave.[1] At this time, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) remarked upon the possibility for tropical cyclogenesis.[2] By June\u00a020, the wave spawned an area of low pressure roughly 175\u00a0mi (280\u00a0km) south-southeast of Acapulco, Mexico. Around 1200\u00a0UTC the following day, the system had become sufficiently organized for the NHC to designate the low as Tropical Depression Two-E.[1] The depression briefly track westward before turning towards the northwest, a track which it would maintain for the remained of its existence, due to a mid-tropospheric ridge located northeast of the system.[1] It continued to organize throughout the day on June\u00a021, developing banding features and increased convection.[3] Several hours after being classified a depression, the system intensified into a tropical storm, at which time it received the name Andres.[1] Upon being named, Andres marked latest date that the first named storm of a season developed since 1969 when Tropical Storm Ava developed on July\u00a01 of that year.[1][4] By the morning of June\u00a022, very deep thunderstorm activity existed near the center, and the overall convective pattern had become more symmetric in nature.[5] Favorable conditions, warm sea surface temperatures, allowed Andres to gradually intensify as it tracked near the Mexican coastline.[1] However, strong wind shear, a factor that generally weakens tropical cyclones, had little effect on the developing storm.[6] By the evening of June\u00a022, satellite imagery indicated the formation of an eyewall;[7] by this time Andres was near hurricane status.[1] Early the next day, the center of circulation became embedded within a central dense overcast[8] and Andres intensified into a hurricane, the first of the season, around 0600\u00a0UTC. At this time, the storm attained its peak intensity with winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 984\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.06\u00a0inHg); the storm was located roughly 80\u00a0mi (130\u00a0km) southwest of L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas upon attaining this intensity.[1] Twelve hours after becoming a hurricane, most of the deep convection associated with the storm had weakened; however, Hurricane Hunters still recorded 75\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h) winds despite the ragged appearance of Andres.[9] By the evening of June\u00a023, Andres weakened to a tropical storm due to increasing wind shear, decreasing sea surface temperatures as it entered a more stable air mass.[1] The system began to rapidly degenerate, as convection became dislocated from the center and the overall structure of Andres degraded.[10] By 1200\u00a0UTC on June\u00a024, the storm weakened into a tropical depression while situated roughly 100\u00a0mi (155\u00a0km) west of Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco. Shortly after, the depression sharply turned north and degenerated into a trough of low pressure, no longer a tropical cyclone.[1]"

        "content": "The NHC issued several watches and warnings for portions of the Mexican coastline; the first was a tropical storm watch for areas between Zihuatanejo and Manzanillo on June\u00a022. Several hours later, a portion of the watch was upgraded to a warning as Andres neared the coastline. By 1500\u00a0UTC, a hurricane watch was declared for areas between L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas, Michoac\u00e1n, and Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco, and the tropical storm watch for Zihuatanejo to L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas was discontinued. Roughly six hours later, a hurricane warning was raised for Punto San Telmo to Cabo Corrientes and the tropical storm warning and hurricane watch were extended northward to Punto San Telmo. By the following afternoon, the hurricane watch was discontinued and several hours later, areas under a tropical storm warning followed suit. Early on June\u00a024, all watches and warnings associated with Andres were discontinued as it rapidly dissipated offshore.[1] Authorities closed ports in L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas, Manzanillo and Puerto Vallarta because of rough seas.[11] Schools throughout Colima were closed prior to the storm[12] and Mexican officials raised the awareness level to orange.[13] Prior to classification as a tropical cyclone, the storm dropped over 160\u00a0mm (6.3\u00a0in) of rainfall in some areas, triggering flooding and landslides.[14] Heavy rain, produced by the wave that spawned Andres, in Honduras killed two people.[15]  A river overflowed its banks, flooding homes and surrounding land.[14] On Mexican Federal Highway 200, gusty winds blew down about fifteen trees. In the city of Acapulco, it was reported that fallen trees damaged two cars.[16] Rough seas led to the drowning of a fishermen in a lagoon near Tecpan de Galeana, Guerrero,[1] while flooding caused by the storm prompted the evacuation of 200 people; 14 shelters were opened to accommodate the evacuees. Additionally, some trees were downed along the coast.[17] Swells up to 4\u00a0m (13\u00a0ft) caused structural damage along the Mexican coastline, with the worst being around Acapulco where several bars and restaurants were damaged or destroyed.[18] In Jalisco, 20 temporary shelters were opened to house evacuees following the storm.[19] The Civil Protection System prepared relief materials, consisting of  600 blankets, 600 mattresses and 700 cots to house people in emergency shelters.[20] In the municipality of Atoyac de Alvarez, in the community of Cerro Prieto, 350 people were left homeless by the storm.[21] Similarly, the paths that connect the towns of San Vicente de Jesus San Vicente and La Soledad Ben\u00edtez-Paradise in this town, there were cuts in solitary vehicle traffic.[21] In the community of La Soledad, heavy rains accompanied by hail hit 38 homes, crops and coffee grounds cultivation in the region.[22] In Colima, 50 homes and two hotels were inundated by flood waters, leaving MXN 3\u00a0million ($231,000\u00a0USD) in damage.[23] In Puebla, heavy rains produced by the outer bands of the hurricane triggered flooding that killed two people. In addition to the fatalities, 20 people were injured by the storm.[24] In the wake of the storm, the Government of Mexico allocated roughly MXN 3\u00a0million (US$231,000) in funds which would be distributed to 96 businesses significantly affected by the storm. These funds accounted for supplies, such as refrigerators and stoves to help restart their industries.[25]"

        "content": " The 1934 Central America hurricane (called the El Salvador hurricane by meteorologist Ivan Ray Tannehill)[1] was a deadly tropical cyclone during the 1934 Atlantic hurricane season which caused at least 506\u00a0fatalities in Central America. Its peak strength, attained while in the Gulf of Mexico, was equivalent to a Category\u00a02 hurricane on the modern Saffir\u2013Simpson scale. The storm's path was erratic, beginning in the Gulf of Honduras on June\u00a04 shortly before making its first landfall in British Honduras as a tropical storm. It then took a looping course through Guatemala before reemerging into the Gulf of Honduras on June\u00a08. The storm struck the northeastern Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula as a hurricane on June\u00a09, crossing into the western Gulf of Mexico where its course made another loop. An accelerated northward course followed, leading to the hurricane's landfall along the Louisiana coast on June\u00a016. It weakened over land and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on June\u00a018, accelerating northeast towards the Canadian Maritimes thereafter. The storm's slow track over Central America between June\u00a05\u20138 led to copious rainfall and triggered deadly floods; El Salvador and Honduras suffered most among Central American countries. Rainfall totals exceeded 25\u00a0in (640\u00a0mm) in some areas. Fourteen rivers in El Salvador rose above their banks. Entire villages in El Salvador were destroyed by the floods, with damage extensive in the country's interior and along its Pacific coast. Communications with El Salvador were downed for 36\u00a0hours. Extensive damage to crops and infrastructure occurred in and around San Salvador, where at least 2,000\u00a0people may have perished; property damage totaled $2\u00a0million (1934 USD) in the city. The hurricane was especially deadly in Honduras, primarily west and north of Tegucigalpa. In Ocotepeque, torrential rainfall caused a landslide that formed a natural dam, allowing floodwater to accumulate behind it. The dam failed on June\u00a07, and the resulting debris flow downstream destroyed most of Ocotepeque and killed an estimated 468\u00a0people. The Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula's sparse population mitigated significant damage when the hurricane struck Quintana Roo on June\u00a09, though crops were impacted between Progreso and Payo Obispo. Much of the shores of the Gulf of Mexico were affected by the hurricane due to its erratic path. High winds and coastal floods stemming from swells generated by the storm reached Tamaulipas and Brazos Island along the western extents of Gulf of Mexico, while a stationary front tapped into moisture from the storm to produce heavy rainfall across southern Georgia and Florida. The worst of the hurricane's impacts associated with its landfall in Louisiana were caused by the storm's rainbands that raked across Louisiana and Mississippi ahead of the hurricane's center. Six people were killed in Louisiana and four were killed in Mississippi. Approximately 3,000\u20137,000\u00a0homes were damaged in Louisiana. The storm continued to produce high winds and flooding rainfall as it tracked northeast across the Mid-Atlantic states and into Canada, causing power outages and property damage."

        "content": "The circumstances leading to the storm's formation in the western Caribbean Sea were unclear, marked only by inclement weather in the Gulf of Honduras.[2] An area of low pressure developed in the area and organized into a tropical depression by 12:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a04, strengthening into a tropical storm six hours later.[3] The following day, the cyclone made landfall near Belize City in the British Honduras with maximum sustained winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h).[2][3] Over the next two days, the storm took a looping path primarily through Guatemala.[4] Although interaction with land initially weakened the cyclone, the storm's winds quickly increased when it passed near Guatemala's Pacific coast. It re-entered the Gulf of Honduras on a northward path early on June\u00a08 and strengthened into a hurricane by June\u00a09.[2][3][4] Concurrently, it curved towards the west, leading to a landfall along the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula on June\u00a09 with winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h).[4] The next day, the system moved into the Gulf of Mexico as a tropical storm on a northwestward heading.[3] Two days later, the storm executed another loop,[2] restrengthening into a hurricane before taking a northward course.[4] Observations from ships in the vicinity of the hurricane were suggestive of an intensifying system.[3][5] On June\u00a014, the storm attained winds of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h), ranking it as a Category\u00a02 hurricane intensity on the modern Saffir\u2013Simpson scale. It held this intensity for two days and made landfall along the coast of Louisiana near Jeanerette at 19:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a016.[3][4] Upon landfall, the storm's barometric pressure was 966\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.53\u00a0inHg).[4] The hurricane weakened and accelerated towards the northeast after moving ashore, though the swampy terrain of coastal Louisiana curtailed the weakening process.[2][4] The storm's winds decreased below hurricane strength on June\u00a017 and fell further to tropical depression strength on June\u00a018 as the system tracked across Mississippi and Tennessee.[4] Its entanglement with an approaching cold front on June\u00a018 signaled the storm's transition into an extratropical cyclone.[3] The storm continued towards the northeastern United States and the Canadian Maritimes, tracking across Nova Scotia and the northern shores of the Gulf of St. Lawrence before it was last documented on June\u00a021 over Labrador.[4][5]"

        "content": "Between June\u00a05\u20138, the center of the storm slowly tracked across British Honduras, southeastern Mexico, and Guatemala, with estimated peak sustained winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) along this path.[4] These peak winds were measured in San Salvador, El Salvador. Lesser winds of 34\u00a0mph (55\u00a0km/h) were recorded in Belize City, British Honduras, where the storm initially made landfall.[2] The slow-moving tropical cyclone produced torrential rainfall, resulting in widespread flooding that killed several thousand people.[6] Estimates of the death toll in Central America vary;[7] a list of the deadliest Atlantic tropical cyclones compiled by meteorologists Edward Rappaport and Jose Fernandez-Partag\u00e1s in 1996 indicates that the hurricane may have caused over 3,000\u00a0fatalities, with a low-end estimate of 506.[7] Between 1,000 and 3,000\u00a0casualties occurred across Honduras according to the U.S. Weather Bureau's report in the Monthly Weather Review.[2] Relief workers in Honduras suggested approximately 2,000\u00a0fatalities occurred,[1] while reporting by the Associated Press estimated at least 2,000\u00a0deaths near San Salvador with at least 2,500\u00a0deaths across Central America.[8] Rainfall totals exceeded 25\u00a0in (640\u00a0mm) in some locations,[2] increased by the effects of the mountains of the Trifinio region.[9] In El Salvador, the storm contributed to the country's wettest year on record; this record stood until 2005.[10] Rivers and lakes rose 45\u201360\u00a0ft (14\u201318\u00a0m) from the excessive rains. Banana and timber regions were heavily impacted by the storm.[8] The worst effects were felt in El Salvador and Honduras,[2] with lesser impacts occurring in Guatemala.[11] The heaviest damage in El Salvador occurred in the departments of Caba\u00f1as, Cuscatl\u00e1n, La Paz, San Miguel, San Vicente, and Usulut\u00e1n.[12] Fourteen rivers throughout the country overflowed their banks, with floods along the Lempa proving to be particularly devastating in northwestern El Salvador.[10] Entire villages in El Salvador were destroyed,[13] including those along the Pacific coast of El Salvador from La Libertad to La Uni\u00f3n.[8] On a single estate along the coast, 100,000\u00a0head of cattle perished.[14] All Pacific ports were flooded; few buildings withstood the storm in Acajutla, whose port was rendered inoperable.[15][10] Verapaz was wrecked by floods rushing down the slopes of a nearby volcano.[11] Power lines were brought down by the storm, with communications company All America Cables reporting an inability to connect with the country for 36\u00a0hours.[16] A report from San Salvador described \"considerable damage\" arising from flooding.[2] Property damage totaled $2\u00a0million (1934 USD) and initial reports tallied 500\u00a0people rendered homeless near the city.[17][16] Large buildings in the city were damaged and homes were washed away in the residential districts of Ilopango and Soyapango.[18] The 30-foot (9\u00a0m) rise of Lake Ilopango destroyed buildings along its banks.[12] Similarly, flooding along the banks of Lake G\u00fcija and the Coatepeque Caldera washed away settlements along their shores.[8] A partially-completed stadium intended for the Central American and Caribbean Games in December\u00a01934 was flooded, forcing to event to be delayed to March\u00a01935.[19] Substantial damage was also wrought to crops around San Salvador.[17] Long segments of the international railroad of Central America were washed out, requiring three months of repairs;[20][8] one train on its tracks derailed.[8] Bridges were torn apart by the flooding, with washouts and landslides reported on railways and highways.[18][16] Washouts occurred on nearly all roads throughout the country.[21] On June\u00a08, martial law was declared in El Salvador,[16] with an early curfew enforced in San Salvador.[22] Electricity was restored in the city between June\u00a09\u201310 while potable water was made available twice daily.[8] Churches and other public buildings served as havens for those displaced by the storm in San Salvador.[22] The government of El Salvador seized all gasoline in San Salvador to ensure adequate supplies for emergency transport. A decree from the president enacted price controls on food and suspended import duties on cereal for three months.[8] Hundreds of men were pressed into service by the presidents to repair highways.[23] The American Red Cross contributed $10,000 towards relief for victims of the hurricane in the country.[13] Rains from the hurricane affected Honduras for nine days.[24] The storm disrupted transportation service in Honduras,[17] completely isolating Tegucigalpa. Low-lying areas of the capital city were flooded as the R\u00edo Grande quickly rose due to heavy rainfall. The storm destroyed homes in San Juancito. Banana-growing regions along the Atlantic coast were also heavily impacted;[25] plantations near Santiago were inundated in floodwaters, and large plantations owned by the United Fruit Company were destroyed.[12] Rail service to these areas was suspended due to the flooding.[26][27] The worst impacts in Honduras occurred in districts west and north of Tegucigalpa.[12] On June\u00a04, 25.2\u00a0in (64\u00a0cm) of rain fell in Ocotepeque, Honduras, triggering a landslide in a mountain valley above the city. The landslide acted as a natural dam along the southern slope of Cerro El Pital . Rainfall accumulated in a lake formed behind this temporary obstruction as the storm meandered over Central America. On June\u00a07, the barrier burst, producing a debris flow that killed an estimated 468\u00a0people, representing over 10\u00a0percent of Ocotepeque's population.[28] The town was largely destroyed,[6] with all buildings succumbing to the flood except for the town church.[2] Despite the magnitude of the disaster, contemporary reports were scarce due to the city's remote location and lack of communications. The destruction caused the city to be relocated 2.5\u00a0mi (4\u00a0km) north, where it was named Nueva Ocotepeque; the former city was later resettled slightly outside the floodplain of the R\u00edo Marchala and renamed as Antigua Ocotepeque.[28][29] The scene that meets the eyes of the survivors is most grievous. Everywhere are groups of persons, hungry, almost naked, seeking among the corpses still floating some loved one they will not see again. The church remains standing; all else is ruin, misery, mud... The Lempa and Ul\u00faa rivers rose significantly due to the rainfall, with the latter rising 45\u00a0ft (14\u00a0m). Residents of Pimienta fled to a hill to avoid advancing floodwaters only to be drowned there as the Ul\u00faa River continued to rise.[1]  Hundreds of cattle also drowned in Pimienta. More than 125\u00a0buildings were destroyed in the city with property losses estimated at $500,000.[26] At Villanueva, floods were 6\u201315\u00a0ft (1.8\u20134.6\u00a0m) deep.[12] Honduran president Tiburcio Car\u00edas Andino appealed to American officials in Panama for tents due to the displacement of Ocotepeque residents. A total of 65\u00a0tents were delivered by 11\u00a0bombers to Tegucigalpa on June\u00a016.[30] Serum for combating disease in storm-stricken Honduras and El Salvador was prepared and sent to San Salvador for distribution.[31] The American Red Cross allocated $1,000 towards relief for those affected by the hurricane in Honduras.[13] Six people were killed in the Mexican state of Chiapas following a plane crash, possibly due to strong winds from the storm.[17] After completing its loop over Central America and reemerging into the Caribbean Sea, the storm made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane on Quintana Roo on June\u00a09,[4] producing hurricane-force winds inland over the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.[2] Due to the region's sparse population, there were no reports of significant damage.[32] The storm damaged crops between Progreso and Payo Obispo. Ships were sunk in the harbor at Progreso.[26]"

        "content": "Along the U.S. Gulf Coast ahead of the storm, a semi-stationary weather front across southern Georgia and northern Florida drew moist air from the hurricane, causing heavy rains over central and northern Florida; the maximum rainfall total in the state was 20.9\u00a0in (530\u00a0mm) as recorded in St. Leo.[33] The storm's trajectory on June\u00a011 suggested a possible track towards the Mexican coast between Tampico and the Mexico\u2013United States border.[34] Swells ahead of the storm flooded roads in low-lying areas of Brazos Island and cut off the beach at Playa Miramar.[35][11] Buildings were boarded up in the Rio Grande Valley in preparation for the hurricane.[34] In Tampico, hospitals, police, and the Red Cross prepared for the storm. Bus fleets were readied for potential evacuations.[11] High winds ultimately reached the coast of Tamaulipas on June\u00a013 with little impact.[36] Northeast storm warnings were issued for the U.S. Gulf Coast between Pensacola, Florida, and Morgan City, Louisiana, on June\u00a015. Hurricane warnings were later issued on June\u00a016 for the Louisiana coast between Grand Isle and Vermilion Bay.[2] These warnings were disseminated via radiophone, telegraph, and telephone.[37] A cutter from the United States Coast Guard was sent to alert ships of the storm's approach at Mobile Bay.[38] The hurricane moved ashore Louisiana at Category 2 intensity on June\u00a016, passing over Jeanerette, west of Morgan City.[4][39] Along the coast, shrimp-drying platforms and oil derricks incurred $105,000\u00a0in damage.[40] However, the hurricane's small size reduced the resulting storm surge, leading to maximum storm tide heights of 2\u20133\u00a0ft (0.61\u20130.91\u00a0m) between Grand Isle and Vermilion Bay. The storm's most destructive effects were associated with squalls that swept across Louisiana and Mississippi in advance of the storm's landfall. These localized storms felled trees throughout New Orleans.[37] Winds in Morgan City reached 68\u00a0mph (109\u00a0km/h) as the hurricane made landfall.[2] There, homes lost their roofs and chimneys.[41] A rainfall maximum of 9.6\u00a0in (240\u00a0mm) was recorded in Lafayette.[33] Six people were killed in Louisiana and the property damage toll reached $2.605\u00a0million.[2] The American Red Cross estimated that 75\u2013150\u00a0homes were destroyed and that another 3,000\u20137,000\u00a0were damaged.[37] An additional $1.5\u00a0million damage toll was inflicted upon crops, including corn and cotton.[40][42] Corn and cotton crops recovered soon after the hurricane's passage.[40] Squalls associated with the hurricane killed four people and injuring many others in Mississippi.[43] Gusty winds destroyed and unroofed homes in Natchez.[37] The storms produced heavy rainfall across western parts of the state, elevating the Pearl River above flood stage by 1\u20133.5\u00a0ft (0.30\u20131.07\u00a0m) between Monticello and Jackson.[43] Mississippi crops sustained $3\u00a0million in losses.[42] In Tennessee's Red River Valley, crops and roads sustained $250,000 in damage from excessive rainfall. Cedar Hill, Tennessee, recorded 10\u00a0in (250\u00a0mm) of rain in 14\u00a0hours; this was the heaviest June rain event in state history. A 50\u00a0yd (46\u00a0m)-wide tornado struck a rural area north of Joelton, Tennessee on June\u00a017, damaging a few farm buildings.[44] The tropical storm proceeded to produce strong winds and rainfall over New England and the Mid-Atlantic states. A 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h)-wind was measured in Atlantic City, New Jersey, as the storm emerged into the Atlantic.[2] The extratropical remnants of the hurricane passed over the Canadian Maritimes with sustained winds of up to 40\u00a0mph (65\u00a0km/h).[4] The storm caused power outages between Sorel and Montreal, Quebec. Poles were toppled along the Canadian National Railway between the two cities. A fire caused by the storm destroyed three barns near Verch\u00e8res; eight other barns were destroyed throughout Quebec. The storm also caused flooding in Ontario, inundating some of the main streets in Toronto.[45]"

        "content": " Tropical Storm Norman was the fourteenth tropical cyclone of the 2012 Pacific hurricane season that brought minor flooding to western Mexico and record rainfall to areas of Texas in September 2012. Originating from a disturbance near the southern tip of Baja California, it soon moved north and developed into a tropical cyclone on September\u00a028. Upon developing into one, Norman attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 50\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h). Heading northward into the Gulf of California, the storm began to weaken later that day due to southwesterly wind shear and land interaction. Norman curved northwestward and weakened to a tropical depression early on September\u00a029. Around that time, it briefly moved inland near Topolobampo, Sinaloa, before re-emerging into the Gulf of California. Later on September\u00a029, Norman degenerated into a remnant low pressure area. In anticipation of the storm, a tropical storm warning was issued for a portion of the Pacific coast of Mexico. Additionally, orange, yellow, green, and blue alerts were posted for several states. About 553\u00a0shelters were opened, though only 65\u00a0people sought refuge in them. Heavy rainfall from Norman was reported in Colima, Jalisco, Nayarit, Sinaloa, Baja California Sur, Durango, and Zacatecas. In Baja California Sur, mudslides and flooding left roads impassable, mainly in the La Paz area. Flooding in Sinola left streets inundated and about 150\u00a0families fled their homes. About 24\u00a0cars in the area were swept away. The remnants of Norman brought record rainfall totals to some areas of Texas. Local flooding occurred, with a few roads inundated in Wimberley. A woman died after her vehicle was swept off the road."

        "content": "A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa on September\u00a012. The wave moved westward across the Atlantic basin with minimal deep convection. By September\u00a023, it reached the eastern Pacific Ocean and began increasing in shower and thunderstorm activity over the next few days. While located near Acapulco another burst in convection occurred on September\u00a025, likely due to interaction with the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ).[1] Around that time, the National Hurricane Center began Tropical Weather Outlooks (TWOs) on the system,[2] which is information issued every six hours on significant areas of disturbed weather and their potential for development out to 48\u00a0hours.[3] The tropical wave split on September\u00a026, with the northern portion moving northwestward near the southwestern coast of Mexico. By September\u00a027, the system had organized deep convection and was producing tropical storm force winds, but data from scatterometers indicated that it lacked a closed circulation.[1] Although TWOs issued on September\u00a027 predicted a high probability for development,[4] the chances for tropical cyclogenesis was decreased later that day, due to the system's close proximity to land.[5] On September\u00a028, satellite data and ships' observations indicated a closed circulation.[6] Thus, Tropical Storm Norman developed at 0600\u00a0UTC, while located about 115\u00a0mi (185\u00a0km) southeast of Cabo San Lucas.[1] Initially, the storm was expected to intensify slightly before making landfall on September\u00a029 and then dissipate on the following day.[6] However, upon developing into a tropical cyclone at 1200\u00a0UTC on September\u00a028, Norman attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 50\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h). Thereafter, Norman began heading northward between a mid-to upper-level low to its west and a mid-level ridge over the Gulf of Mexico. Later on September\u00a028, the storm entered the Gulf of California and began weakening due to a significant increase in wind shear and interaction with land.[1] Around that time, the cloud pattern became less organized and convection was being displaced from the circulation.[7] Early on September\u00a029, the storm curved northwestward and was downgraded to a tropical depression due to difficulty in locating the center of circulation and significant disorganization.[8] Norman made landfall near Topolobampo with winds of 35\u00a0mph (55\u00a0km/h) at 0500\u00a0UTC on September\u00a029. Shortly thereafter, the storm re-curved west-northwestward and re-emerged into the Gulf of California. Norman degenerated into a remnant low pressure area at 1200\u00a0UTC on September\u00a029. The remnant low moved slowly west-southwestward, before dissipating over Baja California Sur near Loreto on September\u00a030.[1]"

Early on the following day, the tropical storm warning was discontinued.[1] An orange alert\" (high risk)  was issued for parts of the state of Sinaloa, and a yellow alert was in effect for Baja California Sur, and green alert was declared for southern Sonora. A \"blue alert\", minimum risk, was issued for north-central Sonora, Durango, Chihuahua and Zacatecas.[9] Officials deployed 400\u00a0soldiers in the cities of La Paz and Los Cabos. According to the state director of Civil Protection, Carlos Enriquez Rincon, 500\u00a0schools were available to operate as temporary shelters. The shelters have a capacity of around 30,000\u00a0people, though only 65\u00a0people spent the first night of the storm in shelters. Furthermore, a total of 5,000\u00a0food packages were sent to residents.[10] In the mainland, authorities in the municipality of Culiac\u00e1n opened 53 shelters, with a total capacity of over 7,000.[11] In addition, classes were suspended in 5 states.[12] Tropical Storm Norman brought extremely heavy rains to Colima, Jalisco, Nayarit, Sinaloa, Baja California Sur, Durango, and Zacatecas.[1] The ports of Cabo San Lucas and San Jose del Cabo were closed for boats and water activities. In the former, 15\u201320\u00a0ft (4.6\u20136.1\u00a0m) waves were recorded.[13] Due to mudslides and wash flooding[14] over 24\u00a0cars were swept away in La Paz.[15] In Sinaloa, the rains caused by Norman did not represent an important contribution to the 11\u00a0dams in the state, with mean water levels rising from 42.5% to 42.6%.[16] Eight fisherman were rescued near the port of Mazatlan when their boat tipped over.[9] Five fisherman were initially reported missing; however, following the passage of the storm, the missing people were later found alive.[17][18] Street flooding was also reported.[19] A total of 150 families were evacuated in two fishing villages along the mainland.[15] Following the storm, a state of emergency was declared for the municipalities of Los Cabos, Angostura, and  Navolato.[20] The remnants of Norman brought record rains to Texas.[21][22] A peak rainfall total of 8.4\u00a0in (210\u00a0mm) fell on La Pryor. At Camp Mabry in Austin, 1.38 inches (35\u00a0mm) of rain fell in a 24\u2011hour period, breaking a daily precipitation record set in 1985. However, across the central portion of the state, rainfall from the system was less than expected. A few roads in Wimberley were temporarily closed due to flooding.[23] One woman was killed in Nacogdoches County after her car was swept off a roadway.[24] A tornado warning was also issued in the Corpus Christi area.[23]"

        "content": "The final tropical cyclone to develop during July\u00a01992, Tropical Storm Irving originated from a distinct but weak low-pressure area embedded in the Western Pacific monsoon trough that extended from the South China Sea to the central Philippine Sea. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) starting following the system at 06:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a030. Thunderstorm activity steadily increased; however, multiple low-level circulations remained present.[1] On July\u00a031, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the system into a tropical depression.[2][nb 3][nb 4] The development of curved cloud lines on satellite imagery prompted to the JTWC to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert at 08:02\u00a0UTC. Following an improvement of the system's structure, the JTWC upgraded the system into a tropical depression, and the first warning was issued.[1] A hurricane hunter aircraft investigated the system and discovered that the low-level circulation was 220\u00a0km (135\u00a0mi) further north than what was inferred from the satellite data. The depression slowly tracked northward near the western periphery of a subtropical ridge.[1] Early on August\u00a02, the JMA classified the depression as a tropical storm.[5] Meanwhile, the JTWC upgraded the depression into Tropical Storm Irving,[6] based on an increase in atmospheric convection near the center and Dvorak satellite estimates.[1] After tracking north-northeast, Irving then turned northeast.[7] On the morning of August\u00a03, the JMA upgraded Irving into a severe tropical storm.[5] According to the JTWC, the cyclone attained typhoon intensity that evening.[6] At the same time, the JMA estimated that Irving attained its peak intensity of 105\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph) and a barometric pressure of 980\u00a0mbar (28.94\u00a0inHg).[2] According to the JTWC, Irving continued to intensify in contrast to forecasts and attained a peak intensity of 145\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph) at 00:00 UTC on August\u00a04, in agreement with surface observations. However, this period of intensification was not observed during real time by the JTWC; operationally, the organization estimated maximum winds of 105\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph), based on Dvorak intensity estimates. At the time of peak intensity, visible satellite imagery showed an elliptic eye 185\u00a0km (115\u00a0mi) in diameter. With a subtropical ridge established to the north, the tropical cyclone began to track west-northwestward. Upon making landfall over southwestern Shikoku at peak intensity,[6] Irving turned sharply to the west and rapidly weakened.[1] The JTWC and JMA downgraded Irving to a tropical storm on August\u00a04 as it interacted with land.[1][5] After weakening to a tropical depression later that day,[2] Irving dissipated over the Korea Strait near Pusan.[1] The JMA ceased watching the remnants of the system midday on August\u00a05.[2]"

The seventh named storm of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, Gordon developed from a tropical wave that was first monitored in the Caribbean Sea on August 30. The wave moved west-northwestward toward the east coast of Florida while gradually organizing. The disturbance was marked as Potential Tropical Cyclone Seven on September 2 while near the Bahamas, and early the next day, it became Tropical Storm Gordon. The system made landfall on the southwest coast of Florida shortly afterwards. Steady intensification began after it moved off the coast of Florida and into the Gulf of Mexico. Gordon reached its peak intensity as a high-end tropical storm late on September 4 before making landfall just east of Pascagoula, Mississippi shortly afterwards. Gordon then rapidly weakened as it tracked inland, and degenerated into a remnant low on September 6. Gordon's remnants lingered over Arkansas for two days, before opening up into a low-pressure trough on September 8. At least three deaths were attributed to the storm, and Gordon caused approximately $200\u2013250 million (2018 USD) in damages.[1]"

        "content": "Tropical Storm Gordon arose from a tropical wave that left the west coast of Africa on August 26. The wave swiftly moved westward across the low-latitudes of the Atlantic, with only a slight amplification of convection occurring within the Intertropical Convergence Zone. As the wave neared the eastern Caribbean Sea on August 30, cloud cover and shower activity increased over the northern Lesser Antilles.[1] The National Hurricane Center (NHC) first mentioned the wave as having potential for tropical development in the evening hours of the same day.[2] The wave split in two soon after, with the northern half generating a surface trough that covered eastern Hispaniola and the nearby Atlantic waters. Although thunderstorms linked to the system increased, strong upper-level winds hindered development over the next two days. After the winds lessened on September 2, the disturbance's convection began to show signs of organization while it was located between eastern Cuba and the central Bahamas. The convection dwindled for a short time late on the same day before rapidly increasing early on September 3.[1] Around that time, the system was located in a favorable environment of 86\u00a0\u00b0F (30\u00a0\u00b0C) sea surface temperatures and low-to-moderate vertical wind shear.[3] Subsequently, the system strengthened into a tropical depression around 06:00 UTC on September 3,[nb 1] while located 90 mi (150 km) southeast of Key Largo, Florida.[1] Continuing to organize, the depression quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Gordon three hours later as its convective structure improved. Meanwhile, the system was traveling northwestward around the edge of a subtropical ridge. Gordon made landfall near Tavernier in the Florida Keys at 11:15 UTC on September 3, with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 km/h). The tropical storm subsequently emerged over the Florida Bay and made a second landfall near Flamingo on the southern tip of Florida peninsula a couple of hours later, at 13:15 UTC, with the same intensity. Gordon then entered the Gulf of Mexico where additional strengthening ensued.[1] The storm briefly displayed a 6 mi (9 km) wide eye-like feature on doppler weather radar around 18:00 UTC, while located off the coast of Marco Island; this feature disappeared a couple of hours later, however, the storm continued strengthening.[1][5] Westerly wind shear temporarily disrupted the core of the system early on September 4; the low-level center was displaced to the southwestern boundary of the convection.[6] The storm's structure primarily consisted of a compact central dense overcast with banding features over the eastern half of the system as a result of the shear.[7] Towards the middle of September 4, Gordon began to improve in appearance, developing a band of deep convection near its distinct center; simultaneously, lightning activity increased significantly in the core of the storm.[8] Gordon reached its peak intensity at 18:00 UTC on September 4 as a high-end tropical storm with maximum sustained winds of 70 mph (110 km/h), while located approximately 130 mi (215 km) south-southeast of Pascagoula, Mississippi.[1] The tropical storm's convection continued to organize around its center as it approached the coastline,[9] however, collected surface and radar data indicated that the wind speed remained the same. Gordon achieved its minimum central pressure of 996\u00a0mbar (29.41\u00a0inHg) as it made landfall between the Alabama/Mississippi border and Pascagoula around 03:15 UTC on September 5. After landfall, Gordon quickly deteriorated, weakening into a tropical depression by 12:00 UTC, while located 35 mi (55 km) southeast of Jackson, Mississippi. Early on September 6, the depression slowed down over southeastern Arkansas while maintaining its northwestward track. The storm degenerated into a remnant low at 18:00 UTC near Pine Bluff, before further weakening into a trough of low pressure by 00:00 UTC on September 8. The remnants of Gordon combined with an extratropical low later on September 8. The new system traveled northeastward during the next few days, generating torrential rainfall over western Kentucky and the Ohio Valley, before dissipating near northern New York on September 11.[1]"

Gordon caused torrential rainfall throughout the area, with a local peak of 6.98\u00a0in (177\u00a0mm) occurring in Homestead.[1] Winds from the storm downed tree limbs, resulting in approximately 8,000 power outages throughout Miami-Dade and Broward counties.[11] A 47-year-old man died on Interstate 95 in Miami after crashing his vehicle into a concrete barrier. Another crash closed lanes on the MacArthur Causeway, and a third accident halted traffic on two westbound lanes of Interstate 395 near U.S. Route 1.[12][11] Gordon also affected the Florida Panhandle, including the city of Pensacola, where the storm's peak rainfall total of 12.73\u00a0in (323.3\u00a0mm) was recorded.[1] In advance of Gordon's landfall, adverse weather conditions prompted flight delays and cancellations at the Pensacola International Airport.[13] A tree fell onto a mobile home in Pensacola, trapping and killing a 2-year-old girl.[14] Significant beach erosion occurred on the southeastern coast near Fort Lauderdale. Sizable portions of sand and numerous sea turtle nests were washed away by waves that Gordon produced; this left some sections in a barren state.[15] Near Panama City in northwestern Florida, a large hole formed near a culvert at the Runaway Island Beach as a result of erosion.[16] Algae blooms along the Gulf Coast of Florida spread further northwest to Tampa Bay in the days following Gordon's passage through the area. The spread killed thousands of fish, leaving carcasses floating in the water.[17][18] The bloom also thickened in Fort Lauderdale, leaving \"green, foul-smelling goop\" in canals throughout the city.[19]"

        "content": " The 1905 Atlantic hurricane season featured five known tropical cyclones, two of which made landfall in the United States. The first system was initially observed near the Windward Islands on September\u00a06. The last system to dissipate, the fourth storm, transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on October\u00a011, while located well southeast of Newfoundland. These dates fall within the period with the most tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic. Between October\u00a05 and October\u00a010, the fourth and fifth system existed simultaneously. Of the season's five tropical cyclones, only one reached hurricane status, the fewest since 1890. Furthermore, that storm strengthened into a major hurricane, which is Category\u00a03 or higher on the modern-day Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale.[1] This storm, which was the fourth and strongest hurricane of the season, peaked at Category\u00a03 strength with 120\u00a0mph (195\u00a0km/h) winds. It was also attributed to at least six fatalities after sending a rogue wave across the steerage of the steamer Campania. The first storm also resulted in two deaths after a schooner wrecked in Barbados. The season's activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 28, the lowest value since 1864. ACE is a metric used to express the energy used by a tropical cyclone during its lifetime. Therefore, a storm with a longer duration will have high values of ACE. It is only calculated at six-hour increments in which specific tropical and subtropical systems are either at or above sustained wind speeds of 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h), which is the threshold for tropical storm intensity. Thus, tropical depressions are not included here.[1]"

The sixteenth named storm of the 1997 season, Olaf formed on September 26 off the southern coast of Mexico. It moved northward and quickly intensified, reaching peak winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) before weakening and hitting Oaxaca as a tropical depression. In Mexico, El Salvador, and Guatemala, the system brought heavy rainfall, which killed 18 people and caused flooding and damage. It was originally thought that Olaf dissipated over Mexico, although its remnants continued westward for a week. It interacted with Hurricane Pauline, which caused Olaf to turn to the southeast and later to the north to strike Mexico again, finally dissipating on October 12."

        "content": "The origins of Olaf were from a tropical wave first noted over Central America on September 22. It moved slowly through the eastern Pacific Ocean, and gradually developed an area of convection. Concurrently, an upper-level low-pressure area moved from the Gulf of Mexico across Mexico into the Pacific, which produced wind shear across the region; wind shear is the difference in wind speed and direction in the atmosphere, and is usually harmful to tropical cyclogenesis. The disturbance associated with the tropical wave persisted and developed outflow. This caused the upper-level low to move away from the system. On September 26, it was sufficiently organized to be classified Tropical Depression Seventeen-E, while located about 345 miles (555\u00a0km) south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec.[1] A few hours after developing, the depression attained tropical storm status, or winds of at least 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h). Upon doing so, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) gave it the name \"Olaf\". The upper-level low, which was moving away from the region, caused the storm to move northward toward the Mexican coast. Olaf quickly intensified, as evidenced by reports from a nearby ship, and the winds reached 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) by late on September 27; the NHC anticipated further intensification to hurricane status, or winds of at least 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h). Instead, interaction with the rough terrain of Mexico caused weakening. Olaf made landfall on Salina Cruz, Oaxaca early on September 29 as a 35\u00a0mph (56\u00a0km/h) tropical depression. Within a few hours, the circulation was not evident on satellite imagery, and the NHC discontinued advisories.[1] Despite being considered dissipated, a re-analysis of satellite imagery indicated the circulation of Olaf persisted as turned to the west toward open waters. Early on September 30, the system reached the Pacific, and it continued westward for about a week, during which it retained some convective activity. On October 5, Olaf turned toward the east, as it interacted with the large circulation of developing Hurricane Pauline. Later that day, the NHC resumed issuing advisories, while it was located about 560 miles (900\u00a0km) southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula.[1] The system turned to the southeast, and, failing to organize, the NHC discontinued advisories on October 8. Three days later, after the remnants of Olaf turned toward the north, the NHC again resumed advisories, when it was just 70 miles (110\u00a0km) south-southwest of Tecom\u00e1n, Colima.[2] Late on October 12, the circulation of Olaf made its final landfall near Manzanillo, Colima, and it quickly dissipated. An associated area of thunderstorms moved over open waters again, but failed to redevelop.[1]"

When Olaf was strengthening faster than anticipated, the advisory was upgraded to a hurricane warning, although it was downgraded to a tropical storm after the intensification did not occur.[1] Upon making its first landfall, Tropical Depression Olaf produced gusty winds and heavy rains along the southeastern coast of Mexico.[1] The peak 24\u2011hour rainfall total was 6.71 inches (17.0\u00a0cm) in Juchit\u00e1n de Zaragoza in Oaxaca;[2] the highest rainfall total throughout Olaf's duration was 27.73 inches (70.4\u00a0cm) at a station called Soyalapa/Comaltepec in Oaxaca.[3] Heavy rainfall was also reported in Guatemala and El Salvador.[1] Across the affected region, the heavy rainfall caused flooding, which resulted in 18 deaths. In Mexico, the flooding damaged 50,000 acres (200\u00a0km2) of coffee, corn, and other crops;[4] in Chiapas, the coffee crop damage represented a severe cut into the yearly total.[5] The precipitation flooded many buildings across the region, including 30 houses in the Chiapas capital of Tuxtla Guti\u00e9rrez, when a river exceeded its banks. In mountainous regions, mudslides left dozens of small villages isolated from the outside world. Along the coast, high waves of up to 16 feet (4.9\u00a0m) forced the closure of all ports in three Mexican states, which affected thousands of fishermen.[4] Further west, three fishing vessels were reported missing near Acapulco, prompting rescue parties.[1] The storm also forced the closure of several airports.[4] In its final landfall, there was no damage reported;[1] precipitation in that region peaked at 2.96 inches (7.5\u00a0cm) in Coquimatl\u00e1n, Colima.[2] Following the storm, the Mexican government sent food, water, and housing supplies to affected families in Oaxaca.[4] Less than a week after Olaf moved through southern Mexico, Hurricane Pauline struck the same region with much stronger winds. Pauline caused heavier rainfall and more damage, killing at least 250 people.[6] Some regions received 10 days of heavy rainfall.[7]"

The United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stated in 2018 that the \u2018runaway climate changes\u2019 is likely to create an irreversible loop of heat, wildfires, storms and floods.[8] The Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East region is believed to be a climate change hot-spot due to its location in a transition zone between the mid-latitude and sub-tropical climates.[9][10] This makes the region vulnerable to increasing temperatures and not only reduced precipitation but also unexpected storms that have the potential to bring torrential rainfalls.[10] As of now, there is limited understanding around how to predict these events with a reasonable degree of accuracy.[9] There is also limited understanding about the extent of potential impact from these events on these countries.[9] As a result it has been difficult to develop specific evidence-based recommendations to lower the impact of these weather events.[9] The Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East Climate Change Initiative (EMME-CCI) was formed in 2019 with a view to tackle these concerns.[11]"

Egypt lacks a comprehensive rainwater drainage system and relies on a drainage network over 100 years old to siphon rainwater. Within homes, towels and buckets became essential household items, to catch water from leaking ceilings.[14] Additional precautionary measures advised against walking near lampposts and parking close to trees.[15]"

Some of the key considerations include the importance of preparedness and emergency response, the need for robust infrastructure to withstand extreme weather events, and the recognition of climate change as the cause of these storms. In addition, we learned about regional coordination and cooperation as countries in the Middle East worked together to support each other after the storms.[19] The events emphasized the need for preventive measures to mitigate the impact of natural disasters and the importance of international cooperation in solving climate-related challenges. Another lesson learned from the Middle East storms of 2020 was the importance of early warning systems and effective communication. These storms caused serious damage and loss of life, and it became clear that timely and accurate information is essential so that people can take the necessary precautions and evacuate if necessary.[4] Furthermore, the storms highlighted vulnerabilities in certain sectors such as transportation, housing and electricity distribution. It emphasized the need to improve the resilience of infrastructure planning and design to face future extreme weather events.\u00a0 The 2020 Middle East storms also served as a wake-up call for the region to strengthen preparedness, response and long-term planning efforts to combat the growing risks of extreme weather events and climate change.[8] In addition to the lessons, the Middle East storms of 2020 drew attention to climate justice. It became clear that storms disproportionately affected vulnerable communities, especially in poor areas, and had greater problems recovering from the damage.[10] This highlighted the need for equitable and inclusive approaches to disasters and recovery. It emphasized the importance of addressing existing social, economic and environmental inequalities to ensure that all individuals and communities have equal access to resources, support and opportunities to build resilience. Many people are becoming more aware of their carbon footprint and are starting to adopt sustainable practices in their daily lives. This includes reducing energy consumption, using renewable energy sources, saving water and supporting local and organic agriculture.\u00a0 Overall, the 2020 Middle Eastern Storms played a significant role in galvanizing action at all levels \u2013 from individual to international. It served as a wake-up call, reminding us of the urgent need to address climate change and build a more sustainable and resilient future for all.[9]"

        "content": " Hurricane Bret was the first of five Category\u00a04 hurricanes that developed during the 1999 Atlantic hurricane season and the first tropical cyclone since Hurricane Jerry in 1989 to make landfall in Texas at hurricane intensity. Forming from a tropical wave on August\u00a018, Bret slowly organized within weak steering currents in the Bay of Campeche. By August\u00a020, the storm began to track northward and underwent rapid intensification on August\u00a021. After this period of strengthening, Bret attained its peak intensity with winds of 145 miles per hour (233\u00a0km/h) and a barometric pressure of 944\u00a0mbar (hPa;\u00a027.9\u00a0inHg). Later that day, the storm weakened to a Category\u00a03 hurricane and made landfall on Padre Island, Texas. Shortly thereafter, the storm weakened further, becoming a tropical depression 24\u00a0hours after moving inland. The remnants of the storm eventually dissipated early on August\u00a026 over northern Mexico. Along the Texas coastline, Bret threatened several cities, prompting 180,000\u00a0residents to evacuate. Numerous shelters were opened throughout the region and prisons were evacuated. Several days prior to the storm's arrival, the NHC issued hurricane watches, and later warnings for areas near the Texas\u2013Mexico border. Several major roads leading to barrier island towns were shut down to prevent residents from crossing bridges during the hurricane. In nearby Mexico, roughly 7,000\u00a0people left coastal areas in advance of the storm. Officials also set up hundreds of shelters in northern regions of the country in case of major flooding. Bret made landfall in a sparsely populated region, resulting in relatively little damage in comparison to its intensity. Nevertheless, seven people were killed in relation to the storm, four in Texas and three in Mexico. Most of the deaths were due to car accidents caused by slippery roads. Upon making landfall, the hurricane produced a maximum storm surge of 8.8\u00a0ft (2.7\u00a0m) at Matagorda Island, Texas. Heavy rains produced by Bret peaked at 13.18\u00a0in (335\u00a0mm) in Texas and were estimated over 14\u00a0in (360\u00a0mm) in Mexico. Numerous homes in the affected regions were damaged or destroyed, leaving roughly 150 people homeless. In all, the storm caused $15\u00a0million (1999\u00a0USD) in damage."

        "content": "Bret originated from a tropical wave that moved off the west coast of Africa on August\u00a05. The wave tracked generally westward, interacting with an upper-level low on August\u00a015 in the western Caribbean Sea, and spawned a low-pressure area. Convective activity developed around the low, and by August\u00a018 the system was over the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. Later that day, the disturbance emerged into the Bay of Campeche and a Hurricane Hunter reconnaissance mission into the system revealed that it had matured into a tropical depression around 1:00\u00a0pm CDT (18:00\u00a0UTC), the third of the 1999 season.[1] Initially, moderate wind shear prevented the depression from strengthening as it moved slowly and erratically in response to weak steering currents over the system.[1][2] By August\u00a019, the wind shear relented, allowing deep convection to develop over the center; later that day, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) upgraded the system to a tropical storm, assigning it the name Bret.[1][3] A small tropical cyclone, Bret gradually strengthened for several days as it tracked towards the north. By the morning of August\u00a020, rainbands began to form.[4] By the evening of August\u00a020, Bret was designated a hurricane following reports of 75 miles per hour (121\u00a0km/h) winds during a Hurricane Hunter mission. At around the same time, Bret established a north-northwest track under the influences of a mid-level ridge.[5] The following day, Bret began to undergo rapid intensification,[1] as a well-defined eye developed.[6] On the morning of August\u00a022, the storm attained its peak intensity as a Category\u00a04 hurricane with winds of 145 miles per hour (233\u00a0km/h) and a barometric pressure of 944\u00a0mbar (hPa;\u00a027.9\u00a0inHg).[1] Shortly thereafter, an upper-level trough to the west of the storm began to erode its cloud pattern.[7] Late on August\u00a022, Bret turned northwestward in response to a mid-tropospheric ridge over the Gulf of Mexico and a mid-tropospheric circulation over the Rio Grande Valley.[1] Several hours before landfall, the hurricane weakened to Category\u00a03 intensity and its forward motion slowed.[8] At around 7:00\u00a0pm CDT (00:00\u00a0UTC; August\u00a023), Hurricane Bret passed over Padre Island, Texas, with winds of 115 miles per hour (185\u00a0km/h) and a barometric pressure of 951\u00a0mbar (hPa;\u00a028.1\u00a0inHg), which marked its landfall.[1] The hurricane rapidly weakened upon moving inland, and roughly 12 hours after landfall, Bret weakened to a tropical storm. It further degenerated into a tropical depression by the evening of August\u00a023. The remnants of Bret persisted until August\u00a026, at which time they dissipated over the mountains of northern Mexico.[1]"

Hours later, the watch was upgraded to a warning as the storm intensified and posed a more direct threat to the area. A tropical storm warning and hurricane watch were subsequently posted from Baffin Bay northward to Port Aransas. The following day, the hurricane warning was extended to include locations through Port O'Connor and the advisories were extended to Freeport. As Bret neared landfall, the hurricane watch between Port O'Connor and Freeport was discontinued. The hurricane warning for Port Aransas to Port O'Connor was discontinued hours after Bret made landfall and began to weaken. By late August\u00a023, all watches and warnings in relation to the hurricane were discontinued.[1] By August\u00a022, city officials in Corpus Christi, Texas, declared a state of emergency as Bret was considered a significant threat to the region. Tens of thousands of residents were urged to evacuate coastal areas and seek refuge in local shelters or with relatives further inland.[9] An estimated 180,000 people in the state left their residences ahead of the storm.[10] The Corpus Christi International Airport closed midday on August 22. Later that day, Texas State Highway 361 and docks in Port Aransas were shut down.[11] Highways throughout the area were congested due to the large-scale evacuations and long lines for gas and emergency items developed. Three schools, two universities and a college were closed on August\u00a023 and remained closed for several days.[9] Eleven shelters were opened in the San Antonio area, collectively able to accommodate 3,525 people. About 325 prisoners were evacuated from a Nueces County jail as the building they were in was deemed unsafe during hurricane conditions. About 1,000 sailors working in the area were evacuated to the USS\u00a0Inchon prior to the storm. Originally, the ship was meant to ride out the storm at sea; however, inadequate repair work inhibited the ship from leaving port. The ship reportedly had enough supplies to maintain the sailors for roughly 45 days. By 12:00 pm CDT on August 22,  Mustang Island and Padre Island were completely evacuated and officials shut down roads leading in and out of the islands to prevent anyone from re-entering them before the area was deemed safe to enter. A strict order against price gouging was put in place by city officials in Corpus Christi.[9]"

The Mexican Army, Red Cross, and firefighters were put on standby to deal with emergency calls during the storm.[13] On August\u00a022, a state of emergency was declared for Tamaulipas.[14] The following day, at least 120 firefighters were dispatched to Monterrey, Nuevo Le\u00f3n, to swiftly respond to emergencies. The Mexican government emphasized the safety of residents in the city, which was anticipated to bear the brunt of the hurricane.[15] Around 7,000 fishermen evacuated coastal regions near the Texas border. In Matamoros an additional 31 shelters were opened.[16] Schools throughout northern Mexico were closed for several days.[17]"

In Nuevo Le\u00f3n, an estimated 14\u00a0in (360\u00a0mm) of rain fell within a 24-hour span and similar amounts likely fell in nearby Tamaulipas.[1] In Tamaulipas, Nuevo Le\u00f3n and Coahuila, ten villages were isolated by floodwaters that washed out roads.[19] Ten people, all members of one family, were injured during a head-on collision.[20] In Nogales, heavy rains caused water to accumulate on streets, leading to traffic jams; high winds also downed power lines.[21] During the evacuation prior to Bret, one person was trampled to death. Following landfall, a man was electrocuted by downed power lines and another drowned in floodwaters.[22][23] At least 150 families were left homeless following a flash flood in Cadereyta that inundated most of the town.[24]"

        "content": " Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm Mala was the strongest tropical cyclone of the 2006 North Indian Ocean cyclone season.[1] In mid-April 2006, an area of disturbed weather formed over the southern Bay of Bengal and nearby Andaman Sea. Over a period of several days, the system became increasingly organized and was classified as a depression on April\u00a024. Situated within a region of weak steering currents, the storm slowly intensified as it drifted in a general northward direction. It attained gale-force winds and was named Mala the next day. Conditions for strengthening improved markedly on April\u00a027 and Mala subsequently underwent rapid intensification which culminated in the cyclone attaining its peak. Early on April\u00a028, the cyclone had estimated winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph). The Joint Typhoon Warning Center considered Mala to have been slightly stronger, classifying it as a Category\u00a04-equivalent cyclone. Steady weakening ensued thereafter and the storm made landfall in Myanmar's Rakhine State on April\u00a029. Rapid dissipation took place once onshore and Mala was last noted early the next morning. In contrast to Mala's intensity, damage was relatively minimal across Myanmar due to adequate early warnings, while timely and effective evacuations minimized loss of life along the coast. The greatest damage resulted from a thunderstorm near Yangon on April\u00a028 that spawned a possible tornado in an industrial zone. A total of 586\u00a0homes were damaged there. Just outside the city in the Hinthada District, a flash flood killed at least 18\u00a0people. Overall, the storm claimed 37\u00a0lives in the country and left US$6.7\u00a0million in damage. In the wake of Mala, the Red Cross distributed relief aid to affected residents while local officials set up shelters to house those left homeless. Government and social organizations donated 5.4\u00a0million kyat (US$4,320) in cash to survivors in the Ayeyarwady Region."

        "content": "In mid to late April 2006, a pulse in the Madden\u2013Julian oscillation, coupled with a Kelvin wave (which later contributed to the formation of Typhoon Chanchu in the western Pacific), enhanced convective activity over the Bay of Bengal.[2] By April\u00a022, a trough developed along an axis from the southern Bay of Bengal eastward to the Andaman Sea.[1] The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began monitoring the system for potential tropical cyclogenesis the following day.[3] By 0600\u00a0UTC on April\u00a024, an area of low pressure formed southeast of the Andaman Islands and the India Meteorological Department (IMD) began monitoring the disturbance.[4] Quickly organizing, the low developed into a tropical depression later on April\u00a024 and the JTWC began writing full advisories on the cyclone without issuing a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert.[3][5] Organization slowed thereafter due to moderate wind shear,[6] but continued at a near-climatological rate as upper-level outflow allowed for continued convective development.[7] Early on April\u00a025, the JTWC estimated the system to have attained gale-force winds.[5] The IMD followed suit later that day and subsequently assigned it the name Mala.[8][nb 1] Weak steering currents prompted slow and erratic movement with an overall northward trajectory.[3][6] Forecasters at this time anticipated little intensification as the system was expected to move into a region of higher shear.[10] However, on April\u00a027, the system moved under a subtropical ridge and conditions quickly became favorable for intensification. The presence of the ridge greatly enhanced the outflow over the cyclone and an eye developed by 1200\u00a0UTC.[1][11] By this time, both the JTWC and IMD estimated Mala to have attained hurricane-force winds with the latter classifying it as a very severe cyclonic storm.[1][5] The previously weak steering currents became more established as well, with the storm now tracking northeast toward Myanmar through a weakness in a ridge over Southeast Asia.[11] Situated in an area with sea surface temperatures of 28 to 29\u00a0\u00b0C (82 to 84\u00a0\u00b0F), the cyclone was able to undergo rapid intensification as wind shear abruptly diminished.[1] The IMD estimated Mala to have reached its peak intensity at 0900\u00a0UTC on April\u00a028 with winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph) and a barometric pressure of 954 mbar (hPa; 28.17\u00a0inHg).[12] Using the Dvorak technique, a method of determining a tropical cyclone's strength via satellite imagery, the agency gave Mala a rating of T#5.5 which yields an intensity of 189\u00a0km/h (117\u00a0mph).[1] The JTWC estimated Mala to have been a stronger system, with peak winds of 220\u00a0km/h (135\u00a0mph) and a pressure of 922\u00a0mbar (922\u00a0hPa; 27.2\u00a0inHg)\u00a0\u2014 equivalent to a Category\u00a04 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale.[5] Their Dvorak values peaked at T#6.5 or 235\u00a0km/h (145\u00a0mph).[13] As the powerful storm approached Myanmar, the combined effects of increasing wind shear and land interaction soon took their toll on Mala.[14] At 0700\u00a0UTC on April\u00a029, Mala made landfall just south of Thandwe in Myanmar's Rakhine State as a very severe cyclonic storm.[1] The JTWC estimated winds at this time to have been 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph).[5] Rapid weakening ensued once the cyclone moved onshore. Within 12\u00a0hours of landfall, Mala weakened to a deep depression and was last noted as a dissipating system earl on April\u00a030.[1] Sea surface temperatures in the wake of Cyclone Mala decreased up to 4\u20135\u00a0\u00b0C (39\u201341\u00a0\u00b0F) due to upwelling.[15] From April\u00a028\u201329, the low-level inflow associated affected much of the northern Bay of Bengal and resulted in northwesterly winds as far away as Hyderabad, India. These winds brought dry, dust filled air over the bay with mean particulate-matter doubling over the region.[16]"

Local donations provided residents in the town with 200,000\u00a0kyat (US$160) worth of blankets, clothes, and cash.[27] A local newspaper, The New Light of Myanmar, claimed that government officials immediately provided assistance to affected residents across the country.[33] Red Cross operations continued through November\u00a030, by which time 3,485\u00a0families were provided with aid.[26] Additionally, though the agency planned to assist 4,000\u00a0families with rebuilding their homes, a lack of necessary funds prevented the operation. Instead, a cash donation was provided to the 1,000\u00a0most affected families.[34]"

        "content": " Hurricane Ike (/a\u026ak/) was a powerful tropical cyclone that swept through portions of the Greater Antilles and Northern America in September\u00a02008, wreaking havoc on infrastructure and agriculture, particularly in Cuba and Texas. Ike took a similar track to the 1900 Galveston hurricane. The ninth tropical storm, fifth hurricane, and third major hurricane of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season, Ike developed from a tropical wave west of Cape Verde on September\u00a01[nb 1] and strengthened to a peak intensity as a Category\u00a04\u00a0hurricane over the open waters of the central Atlantic on September\u00a04 as it tracked westward. Several fluctuations in strength occurred before Ike made landfall on eastern Cuba on September\u00a08. The hurricane weakened prior to continuing into the Gulf of Mexico, but increased its intensity by the time of its final landfall in Galveston, Texas, on September\u00a013 before becoming an extratropical storm on September\u00a014. The remnants of Ike continued to track across the United States and into Canada, causing considerable damage inland, before dissipating on the next day.[1] Ike was blamed for at least 195 deaths. Of these deaths, 74 were in Haiti, which was already trying to recover from the impact of three storms (Fay, Gustav, and Hanna) that had made landfall the same year. Seven people were killed in Cuba.[2] In the United States, 113 people were reported killed, directly or indirectly, and 16 were still missing as of August 2011.[1] Due to its immense size, Ike caused devastation from the Louisiana coastline all the way to the Kenedy County region near Corpus Christi, Texas.[3] In addition, Ike caused flooding and significant damage along the Mississippi coastline and the Florida Panhandle.[4] Damages from Ike in U.S. coastal and inland areas are estimated at $30\u00a0billion (2008\u00a0USD), with additional damage of $7.3\u00a0billion in Cuba, $200 million in the Bahamas, and $500\u00a0million in the Turks and Caicos, amounting to a total of at least $38\u00a0billion in damage. At the time, the hurricane was the second-costliest in United States history.[5] The search-and-rescue operation after Ike was the largest search-and-rescue operation in Texas history.[6]"

        "content": "The origins of Hurricane Ike can be traced back to a well-defined tropical wave, first identified by the National Hurricane Center\u00a0(NHC) just within the western coast of Africa on August\u00a028.[7][8] Despite the development of a low-pressure area associated with the wave and signs of organization within favorable conditions near the Cape Verde Islands,[9] the system was only able to generate intermittent thunderstorm activity. The broad low-pressure continued to track westward and was considered to have become sufficiently organized to be classified as a tropical depression at 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a01. By this time the cyclone had tracked 780 miles (1,260 kilometers) west of Cape Verde. Although post-analysis indicated that the depression reached tropical storm strength at 12:00\u00a0UTC that day,[10] operationally the NHC began issuing advisories on Ike three hours later, by which time the system had already gained numerous curved rainbands and well-established outflow.[11] Over the next few hours, Ike developed additional rainbands,[12] but failed to develop a centralized area of convection due to the presence of dry air to the storm's south and its location in an area with only marginally favorable sea surface temperatures.[13] These factors were also responsible for Ike's slow developmental trend that began after formation.[10] Ike's gradual strengthening began to quicken early on September\u00a03, with the strengthening of an intense rainband around the center of the storm. At roughly 15:00\u00a0UTC that day, microwave imaging indicated that a primordial eye was developing within the intensifying tropical storm.[10] Tracking northwestward, the NHC upgraded Ike to hurricane status at 18:00\u00a0UTC based on objective satellite intensity estimates and the appearance of the eye on visible satellite imagery.[10][14] During this time, Ike was centered 690\u00a0mi (1,110\u00a0km) east-northeast of the Leeward Islands and was tracking west-northwestward as a result of a weakened subtropical ridge to its northeast.[10] Ike's placement in an area with virtually no wind shear allowed for the hurricane to undergo explosive intensification despite unfavorable upper-level winds to its north,[14] reaching major hurricane strength six hours after its designation as a hurricane.[15] At 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a04, Ike peaked with maximum sustained winds of 145 miles per hour (233 kilometers per hour) and a minimum barometric pressure of 935 millibars (27.6 inches of mercury), making the storm a Category\u00a04 on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale. After peaking in strength, a ridge of high pressure to the storm's west strengthened, causing Ike to track towards the southwest\u2014a path unusual for the time of year. However, this track also brought the storm into an area of strong wind shear,[10] causing the storm to become asymmetric in structure late on September\u00a04 and weaken,[16] briefly dropping below major hurricane status on September\u00a06 while 150 miles (240\u00a0km) east of Grand Turk Island.[17] Although wind shear abated and allowed for reintensification, Ike would fluctuate in strength over the next few days. After passing near the Turks and Caicos Islands, Ike made its first landfall on Inagua in the Bahamas at 13:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a07 with winds of 125\u00a0mph (201\u00a0km/h).[18] After passing over Inagua,[18] the development of a double eyewall\u2014a feature that usually denotes the beginning of an eyewall replacement cycle\u2014slightly weakened Ike late on September\u00a07.[19] However, the hurricane was able to reintensify and reach Category\u00a04 intensity for a final time before making landfall near Cabo Lucrecia on the coast of Holgu\u00edn Province in Cuba by 00:00\u00a0UTC the next day.[18] Although Ike remained well-defined for most of its crossing of eastern Cuba,[20] the hurricane's core had become disrupted by the time it had reached the Caribbean Sea after spending a few hours over land.[21] Over the next day, Ike tracked westward, paralleling the southern coast of Cuba without much intensification; at times the center of the hurricane was within 12\u00a0mi (19\u00a0km) of the island. At around 14:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a09, Ike made a second Cuban landfall, this time on Punta La Capitana in Pinar del Rio, with winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h). Roughly six hours later, the hurricane emerged into the Gulf of Mexico as a slightly weakened system.[18] Despite tracking back over water, Ike's prolonged interaction with Cuba had greatly disrupted the system's core, and instead of quickly strengthening and coalescing, the storm's wind field instead grew and only gradual intensification ensued.[18] Due to the storm's comparatively small inner core and intensity of the outer rainbands,[22] an eyewall replacement cycle took place, preventing Ike from rapidly intensifying. At around the same time, a high-pressure area strengthened to the hurricane's north, steering the cyclone further west than initially anticipated. Moving over the warm waters of the Loop Current,[18] Ike reached a secondary minimum in barometric pressure on 00:00\u00a0UTC with an estimate of 944\u00a0mbar (27.9\u00a0inHg); though winds would continue to strengthen afterward, the storm's pressure would rise.[23] By late on September\u00a012, Ike had reached the western edge of the nearby high-pressure area and began to curve northward. The formation of an eye just prior to landfall resulted in a slight increase in winds,[18] and at 0700\u00a0UTC on September\u00a013, Ike made landfall on the northeast end of Galveston Island in Texas, with a minimum barometric pressure of 950\u00a0mbar (28\u00a0inHg) and sustained winds of 110\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h), making Ike a Category\u00a02 hurricane.[23] After tracking inland, Ike weakened as it sped northward and later northeastward, weakening to tropical storm status east of Palestine, Texas late on September\u00a013 and later becoming a powerful extratropical cyclone on September\u00a014 over the Ozarks.[18] A more steady weakening phase ensued, and after tracking across southern Ontario and Quebec, the remnants of Ike were absorbed by another extratropical low near the St. Lawrence River, on September\u00a015.[24]"

Florida Keys officials began evacuations on the low-lying chain of islands in phases, starting at the end in Key West by 8\u00a0am Sunday and continuing throughout the day\u2014at noon for the Middle Keys, and at 4\u00a0pm for the Upper Keys, including Key Largo. Visitors were told to leave on Saturday.[27] Overall 15,000 tourists evacuated, but the storm stayed to the south, only causing minor beach erosion.[1]"

City Manager Steven LeBlanc late Wednesday issued a mandatory evacuation order for the low-lying west end of Galveston Island.[34] Later, the mandatory evacuation order was extended to the entire island of Galveston, as well as low-lying areas around Houston, Texas.[35]  Mandatory evacuations were also ordered for Jefferson, Orange, and Chambers counties located east of Houston. Voluntary evacuations were in effect for Hardin and Tyler as well as Newton and Jasper counties.[36] Residents evacuating ahead of Ike were received by emergency workers in the Dallas/Fort Worth(DFW) Metroplex where they were provided a place of refuge, medical treatment, and provisions. In addition to the orders of local and state officials, federal officials were thoroughly involved in evacuation decisions. On September 10, U.S. President George W. Bush made an emergency declaration for Texas, making more federal help available for preparations and evacuations.[37] More than one million people evacuated in advance of Hurricane Ike, but more than 100,000 people did not.[38] At 8:19\u00a0pm (CDT) September 11, the National Weather Service in Houston/Galveston, Texas issued a strongly worded bulletin, regarding storm surge along the shoreline of Galveston Bay. The bulletin advised that residents living in single-family homes in some parts of coastal Texas faced \"certain death\" if they did not heed orders to evacuate.[39][40][41] Reports said as many as 40 percent of Galveston's citizens did not pay attention to the warnings.[42] It was feared to be much the same in Port Arthur, and it was predicted that low-lying areas between Morgan City, Louisiana and Baffin Bay, Texas, particularly those areas east of Ike's projected eye landfall would experience the greatest damage from storm surges of up to 20 feet (6.1\u00a0m).[43] The price of gas increased in the expectation of damage to some of the numerous oil refineries along the South Texas coast, or at least delays in production from the oil and gas platforms in the Gulf of Mexico.[44] 14 oil refineries shut down production and nearly 150 oil tankers and cargo ships waited off-shore as every port from Lake Charles, Louisiana to Corpus Christi, Texas shut down in preparation for the storm.[1]"

Damage also occurred on other islands, mostly agricultural or the fishing industry, but in general, the damage was minor.[1] Buildings on the islands have been severely weakened and 750\u00a0people have lost their homes.[47] Due to the extent and magnitude of damage and affected the population, the Government of the Turks and Caicos declared Grand Turk and South Caicos Islands disaster areas. In Great Inagua Island, the Bahamas, eighty percent of houses sustained damage with almost a third of them having significant damage. The local Morton Salt factory was damaged and shut down operations.[1] A few outlining islands suffered minor damage and no casualties were reported. Overall damage from the Turks and Caicos and the Bahamas was estimated between $50 million and $200 million.[1]"

The Category\u00a04 hurricane made landfall on September 8 on the north coast of eastern Cuba in the province of Holgu\u00edn near Puerto de Sama, with sustained winds of about 130\u00a0mph (209\u00a0km/h),[1] causing widespread flooding and damage to the eastern provinces.[1] It passed across the central provinces of Holgu\u00edn, Las Tunas, and Camag\u00fcey, emerging over the sea to the south of Cuba during the day. Ike dropped to Category One intensity by the time it crossed the island.[60] It then followed the southern coast of Cuba and crossed the western end of the island in Pinar del R\u00edo Province, close to the path taken by Hurricane Gustav ten days previously. The western areas of Cuba, already devastated by just 10\u00a0days before Ike hit, suffered additional major flooding from the rain and storm surge.[2] The sugar cane crop was devastated, with over 3,400 square kilometres (1,300\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) destroyed. The banana, yucca, coffee, and corn crops also suffered significant damage.[1] Alongside Gustav, they were described as the \"worst ever\" storms by Cuban officials.[61] In total, seven people were killed in Cuba from Ike due to drowning or collapsing structures.[2][1] Over 300,000 houses were damaged, with an estimated 43,000 a total loss.[1] The combined damage estimate from Ike and Gustav, and succeeding Paloma is about $9.7\u00a0billion (USD), with $7.3 billion of that from Ike, making Ike the most destructive hurricane in Cuban history at the time. It was later surpassed by Hurricane Irma almost exactly nine years later.[62]"

Because much of the United States oil refining capacity is located in Texas, the closings caused a temporary increase in the prices of gasoline, home heating oil, and natural gas.[65] Increases were particularly high in North Carolina, especially in the mountains, where average prices were as much as 60 cents higher than the national average.[66] The closing of refineries so soon after Hurricane Gustav, and the time required to restart production, also resulted in shortages of gasoline in such places as the Carolinas and Tennessee, partly as a result of panic buying.[67]  113 direct and indirect deaths have been reported in the US, including 85 in Texas (18 direct), eight in Louisiana, one in Arkansas, two in Tennessee, one in Kentucky, seven in Indiana, four in Missouri, two in Illinois, two in Michigan, seven in Ohio and one in Pennsylvania.[1] As of August 2011, 16 people remain unaccounted for, 11 of them in the Galveston area.[1] On September 15, 2008, the United States Congress held a moment of silence for those who died in the hurricane."

The crew unsuccessfully attempted to repair the engine and requested to be evacuated by the Coast Guard, but the rescue mission was aborted because weather conditions were not within the safety parameters. The crew was forced to ride out the storm but kept in contact with the Coast Guard.[68][69] The ship successfully rode out the storm and all 22 crew members were uninjured.

[citation needed] In regional Texas towns, electrical power began failing on September 12 before 8\u00a0pm CDT,[41]\nleaving millions without power (estimates range from 2.8\u00a0million[79] to 4.5\u00a0million[80] customers). Grocery store shelves in the Houston area were empty for weeks in the aftermath of the storm.[81] In Galveston, by 4\u00a0pm CDT (2100 UTC) on September 12, the rising storm surge began overtopping the 17\u00a0ft (5.2\u00a0m) Galveston Seawall, which faces the Gulf of Mexico;[41] waves had been crashing along the seawall earlier, from 9\u00a0am CDT.[82]\nAlthough Seawall Boulevard is elevated above the shoreline, many areas of town slope down behind the seawall to the lower elevation of Galveston Island. Even though there were advance evacuation plans, Mary Jo Naschke, spokesperson for the city of Galveston, estimated that (as of Friday morning) a quarter of the city's residents paid no attention to calls for them to evacuate, despite predictions that most of Galveston Island would suffer heavy flooding from storm tide.[82]  By 6\u00a0pm Friday night estimates varied as to how many of the 58,000 residents remained, but the figures of remaining residents were in the thousands.[83]\nWidespread flooding included downtown Galveston:[78] six feet (1.8\u00a0m) deep inside the Galveston County Courthouse, and the University of Texas Medical Branch, the primary hospital in Galveston county, was dealt significant damage due to flooding. The wide-scale flooding caused failures to all the facilities systems and allowed mold to invade all the buildings.[84]  Tourist attractions on the island suffered various degrees of damage. The Lone Star Flight Museum suffered massive damage, as the storm surge washed through the airport and hangars with about 8 feet (2.4\u00a0m) of water; however, Moody Gardens was built with storms in mind and was able to withstand the worst of the storm.[85] In Houston, windows also broke in downtown buildings, including the 75-story JP Morgan Chase Tower,[78] and Reliant Stadium lost part of its roof.[1] As a result of the high wind and eyewall that passed directly through the city, power outages were a major problem. Some residents were without electricity for over a month. Because the storm system moved rapidly and did not linger over Houston, flooding was not a major problem for most of the city, as it normally is in a storm event, as a result of the relatively flat topography.[78] On Bolivar Peninsula, Texas, dozens of people were rescued as flood waters exceeded 12 feet (3.7\u00a0m) above sea level in advance of the hurricane. Many residents, some trapped by high water on the road at Rollover Pass and others elsewhere along Bolivar Peninsula were not rescued. The peninsula bore the brunt of Ike's right-front quadrant, historically the worst part of a hurricane, and experienced catastrophic damage with the worst being between Rollover Pass and Gilchrist, Texas \u2013 west of High Island.[86] Estimates of lost homes in the peninsula were around 80%.[87] The Southeast Texas communities of Bridge City on Sabine Lake and large areas of nearby Orange (80 miles or 130 kilometres from the center of landfall) were inundated by the storm surge which traveled as much as 16 miles (26\u00a0km) inland from the coast. Bridge City mayor Kirk Roccaforte estimated that only about 14 homes (later updated to around two dozen) in the city were unaffected by the surge.[88] Ike also caused widespread wind damage throughout southeast Texas, but was not bad due to Hurricane Rita striking the region in 2005 and Hurricane Humberto in 2007. NASA's Johnson Space Center  suffered minor roof damage to Mission Control and minor cosmetic damage to some of its other buildings. NASA's operations at Ellington Field also sustained roof and awning damage,[89] and one hangar was severely damaged."

The St. Louis Metropolitan Area experienced hurricane conditions, with Ike's remnants inflicting severe damage to homes. Several areas in Illinois and Indiana, already flooded by the frontal boundary to the north, saw significant additional rainfall.[90] Due to flooding in Chicago, Todd Stroger declared a state of emergency for Cook County due to flooding of the Des Plaines River. Hurricane-force wind gusts were reported to the east of the centre across parts of Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania with significant wind damage including structural damage to buildings and trees. The Louisville area declared a state of emergency due to major damage and power outages, and the Louisville International Airport was closed temporarily. A LG&E spokesperson said that this was the worst power outage in 30\u00a0years.[91] Later in the day, a statewide state of emergency was declared in Kentucky by Governor Steve Beshear.[92] Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky International Airport was also temporarily shut down, and the control tower was evacuated. In Cincinnati, numerous reports of roof damage and uprooted trees were called in to law enforcement, and on September 15, most of the schools in Hamilton County, Butler County, and Warren County had classes canceled because of power outages, some of which lasted seven days. Wind gusts of 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h) were recorded in both Cincinnati and Columbus, which is equivalent to sustained wind levels found in a Category\u00a01 hurricane.[93]  Additionally, a state of emergency was declared in Ohio.[94] Damages in Ohio were originally estimated at $553 million with 131,000 insurance claims filed in the first few days following the storm.[95] The overall total damage in Ohio exceeded $1.1 billion, tying the 1974 Xenia tornado as the costliest storm in Ohio's history.[1]  Also in Salem, Indiana, and Scottsburg, Indiana, wind gusts up to 81\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) were recorded.

Coming into Indianapolis, on September 14, Ike also caused disruptions to the first-ever motorcycle Grand Prix held in Indianapolis, stopping both the 125cc and MotoGP races after two-thirds of the race distance, and causing the cancellation of the 250cc race. In Arkansas, about 200,000 customers lost power as a result of the winds, the worst power loss in that state since an ice storm in 2000.[96] In the Louisville area, over 300,000 customers were without power\u00a0\u2014 the worst power outage in the utility's history.[91] The Cincinnati metropolitan area was hard hit as well, with over 927,000 customers losing power in that region. A Duke Energy spokesperson said \"We have never seen anything like this. Never. We're talking about 90 percent of our customers without power.\" There were so many power outages and so few workers available Duke Energy was thinking of sending workers from their base in Charlotte, North Carolina.[97] Many homes and business were without power for three\u2013seven days.  Cincinnati Public Schools cancelled classes for students for at least three days for all schools. In the Dayton, Ohio area 300,000 of 515,000 Dayton Power & Light Co. customers lost power at some point following severe wind storms on the afternoon of September 14, according to a company spokesperson.[98] Also hard hit were central Ohio (with over 350,000 customers losing power) and northeastern Ohio (with over 310,000 customers losing power),[99] as well as Illinois (49,000),[100] Missouri (85,000),[101] and western Pennsylvania (with over 180,000 customers losing power).[102] In western Kentucky, outside crews had to be brought in from as far away as Mississippi to restore power.[103] In Indiana, about 350,000 customers lost power statewide, mainly in the southern part of the state.[104] In New York State, over 100,000 customers were reported without power.[105] In total, 28 deaths have been blamed on Ike in the inland states.[1]"

It was closely following a slow-moving frontal system that had drenched the city the day before, dumping 75.2 millimeters (2.96 inches) of rain and breaking the old record of 39.1\u00a0mm (1.54\u00a0in) in 1979, according to Environment Canada. Most damage in the Windsor area with Ike was confined to downed power lines and toppled tree branches with the wind gusts reaching 80\u00a0km/h (50\u00a0mph), with spotty street flooding that made driving completely treacherous in some areas.[106] Highways were washed out in the Bruce Peninsula, and trees were uprooted in London, Ontario. The storm continued to cause wind and rain damage as it continued east along the St. Lawrence River leaving around 25,000 customers without electricity, especially in Belleville, Brockville, Bancroft, Peterborough, Bowmanville, Huntsville, and Timmins.[107] In Quebec, regions to the north of the Saint Lawrence River received 50 to 70\u00a0mm (2.0 to 2.8\u00a0in) of rainfall (Hautes-Laurentides, Haute-Mauricie, R\u00e9serve faunique des Laurentides, Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, Charlevoix and C\u00f4te-Nord). Maximum rainfall was recorded between Lac-St-Jean and the R\u00e9serve faunique des Laurentides with a station recording more than 90\u00a0mm (3.5\u00a0in) of rain[108] Along the river, the amount was more in the 10 and 30\u00a0mm (0.4 and 1.2\u00a0in) range, except in Quebec City area which received almost 50\u00a0mm (2.0\u00a0in), most of it between 7:00\u00a0pm and 8:00\u00a0pm.[108] This rain caused small inundations, storm drain overflows, and closed one major highway.[109] In Montreal, high humidity levels pushed by the system caused electrical malfunction one of the lines of the subway, stranding over 25,000 commuters.[110] High winds up to 78\u00a0km/h (48\u00a0mph) caused, at their worst, over 25,000 households to lose electricity in Montreal, Laval, Estrie and Mont\u00e9r\u00e9gie[111] and when it reached the Magdalen Islands, it had enough strength to cause a sailboat, the Oc\u00e9an, to sink. Its six passengers were rescued by a helicopter of the Canadian Coast Guard.[108][111] The \"Ike Spike\" in gasoline prices was quite severe in Canada, with gas prices rising anywhere from 15 to 20 cents per liter.[112]"

It developed stress restricting victims their basic health services. Orange County had an 88.5 percent capacity loss of intermediate care facilities reducing its overall capacity. By late October five hospitals that usually served the areas that were impacted by the hurricane stayed closed while only one hospital continued to operate but with a limit of patients.[119] The need for mental health services increased after the disaster especially for depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Most individuals will not progress to constant behavioral or mental health problems, but the World Health Organization estimates between five and ten percent of victims will have more long-term issues.[119] Telephone interviews and mental health diagnoses were ordered randomly to households concerning the effects of Hurricane Ike. Post-disaster mental health occurrences were 5.9 percent for post-traumatic stress disorder, 4.5 percent for major depressive episode, and 9.9 percent for general anxiety disorder.[120] A Galveston Bay Recovery Study (GBRS) was a survey distributed through a random stratified cluster sampling of victims in the Galveston Bay area for research on traumatic stress and disaster exposure. When surveyed victims were asked how they felt and what they experienced after the hurricane there was an immediate emotional response to fear of the loss of property, employment, displacement, and damages.[121] Children were targeted for physical abuse by parents and guardians because of loss of property and employment.[119] Results of post-traumatic stress disorder, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, dysfunctions, and disabilities were reported when asked how stressful their lives have been since Hurricane Ike.[121] There was an increase of impairments, interference with social activities and health behaviors such as eating poorly, smoking more, and restlessness.[121] Development of these mental health problems was due to the lack of sufficient clean clothing, electricity, food, money, transportation, or water for at least one week. Victims and workers face numerous residential and occupational hazards during the process of repairing their homes or community. An exposure to hazardous materials through the process created health threats of diseases, air contamination, smoke inhalation, and lead poisoning. As disaster victims return to their damaged homes children were exposed to the debris and other hazards, developing a risk of injury.[119] After the hurricane because of power outages individuals and family misused portable generators causing carbon monoxide poisoning. Eighty-two percent to 87 percent of carbon monoxide were caused by the improper use of generators. The Texas Department of State Health Services issued that gasoline generators should not be used indoors.[122] Fifty-four people were reported by the Texas poison centers to have storm-related carbon monoxide exposure. The Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society and The Center for Disease Control reported 15 people had to undergo hyperbaric oxygen treatment for carbon monoxide poisoning.[122][123] Symptoms from exposure were headaches, nausea, and vomiting with the majority of the treated cases under the age of eighteen.[123][124]"

By late November, production was restored to pre-Ike levels. Despite the hurricane, only 500,000 U.S. gallons (1,900 cubic meters) of crude oil split into the Gulf of Mexico and the marshes, bayous and bays of Louisiana and Texas over a coastline distance of 185 miles (298 kilometres). Much of the spillage occurred in the High Island area of Galveston County, Texas, where storm surge rose over a low-lying oilfield and flooded the marshy area around several producing wells, beam pumps and storage tanks. During the days both before and after the storm, companies, and residents reported around 448 releases of gas, oil and other substances into the environment in Louisiana and Texas. The hardest hit places were industrial centres near Houston and Port Arthur, Texas, as well as oil production facilities off Louisiana's coast.[135] The Coast Guard, with the Environmental Protection Agency and state agencies, has responded to more than 3,000 pollution reports associated with the storm and its surge along the upper Texas coast.

First classified as a tropical depression north of Madagascar, the system moved southwest, crossing the northern part of the nation before entering the Mozambique Channel on 27 February, where it began to deepen. Later that day, the depression was upgraded into a moderate tropical storm. Two days later, Filao attained severe tropical storm intensity as it began to stall. On 1 March, the storm reached cyclone intensity just before turning west.

Based on a 3.0 Dvorak classification, MFR upgraded the storm into a moderate tropical storm on 27 February;[2] the JTWC would follow suit later that day.[7] After reaching the 40th meridian, Filao turned south, which weakened a ridge. The ridge near the system began to re-strengthen, causing Filao to move erratically, first west, and then northwest. The new position of the ridge provided highly favorable conditions aloft, resulting in a period of rapid deepening.[2] By 29 February, MFR upgraded the storm into a severe tropical storm,[1] while the JTWC estimated that Filao attained hurricane-force.[4] Early on 1 March, data from MFR indicated that Filao reached its peak intensity of 85\u00a0mph (135\u00a0km/h) and its minimum pressure of 954 mbar (hPa); 28.17 inHg,[1] in agreement with T4.5 and T5.0 from the Dvorak Technique.[2] Subsequently, the JTWC reported that Cyclone Filao had attained winds equivalent to Category\u00a02 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale, with winds of 155\u00a0km/h (96\u00a0mph).[7] Despite a decrease in satellite intensity estimates,[2] Filao held on to this intensity until 1800\u00a0UTC,[7] when the storm made landfall near Quelimane in Mozambique.[1][6] Cyclone Filao quickly weakened over land; both agencies suggest that the storm dissipated on 2 March[1][4] over the Zambeze Valley and embedded into the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ).[2]"

Throughout the district, some schools were damaged while 800\u00a0homes were destroyed.[13][14]\nWithin the province of Sofala, 14,395\u00a0ha (35,570 acres) of harvest were destroyed, 28,174\u00a0people were rendered homeless, and 1,389\u00a0buildings were destroyed.[2] Elsewhere, many rivers along the southern and central part of the nation were flooded; consequently; 5,500\u00a0ha (13,590 acres) of crops were destroyed. The Pungwe River experienced its worst flood of the 1980s, but the worst flooding took place along the Limpopo River.[15] Near the Pungwe River, a road that connected Mozambique to Zimbabwe was destroyed. Many nearby homes and fields were destroyed, forcing numerous families to seek shelter.[16] Throughout the nation of Mozambique, large portions of the maize, potatoes, tomatoes, cucumber, and pumpkin crops were washed away due to flooding.[17] Overall, the storm brought considerable damage to the nation;[18] it was also the first storm to affect the nation since Tropical Storm Domoina in 1984.[19] Damage totaled to $10\u00a0million (1988\u00a0USD).[2] Property damage alone totaled to $1.5\u00a0million,[20] just under $1\u00a0million of which came from buildings.[13] Moreover, insured losses from the storm totaled $1 million.[14] Even though the death toll was initially believed to be 57;[8] by 14 March, this number had increased to the final death toll of 100 after additional information was received from remote areas of the country.[21][22][23][24] About 90,000 people were directly affected by the system.[25]"

        "content": " Effects Other wikis Hurricane Laura was a deadly and destructive Category\u00a04 hurricane that is tied with the 1856 Last Island hurricane and 2021's Hurricane Ida as the strongest hurricane on record to make landfall in the U.S. state of Louisiana, as measured by maximum sustained winds. The twelfth named storm, fourth hurricane, and first major hurricane of the record-breaking 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, Laura originated from a large tropical wave that moved off the West African coast on August\u00a016 and became a tropical depression on August\u00a020. Laura intensified into a tropical storm a day later, becoming the earliest twelfth named storm on record in the North Atlantic basin, forming eight days earlier than 1995's Hurricane Luis. Laura first hit the Lesser Antilles and brushed Puerto Rico as a tropical storm, then moved across the island of Hispaniola, killing 31\u00a0people in Haiti and four in the Dominican Republic. The storm then moved across the length of Cuba, prompting tropical storm warnings and the evacuation of more than 260,000\u00a0people there. Subsequently, the outer rainbands extended into the Florida Keys and South Florida. Laura then moved across the Gulf of Mexico, strengthening slowly at first, before a period of rapid intensification on August\u00a026. That day, Laura became a major hurricane, and later attained its peak 1-minute sustained winds of 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h), making it a Category\u00a04 hurricane. The approaching storm prompted the issuing of many warnings and watches for Louisiana, as well as the evacuation of many people. Early on August\u00a027, Laura made landfall near peak intensity on Cameron, Louisiana. Measured by windspeed, Laura was the tenth-strongest U.S. hurricane on record to made landfall in the USA. The effects of Laura across Louisiana were devastating. Nearly 10-foot high storm surge was recorded in Cameron Parish. Numerous parishes had severe flooding and extreme damage to houses. Several roads had to be closed, and drivers were advised to use different routes. The storm caused the deaths of 30 people in the state alone. Texas and Arkansas were struck notably hard as well. The storm caused the deaths of at least 41\u00a0people in the United States. An estimated $23.3 billion in damages was inflicted  on southwestern Louisiana and southeastern Texas near the Gulf of Mexico.[1][2] After landfall, Laura caused significant wind damage in southwest and central Louisiana before becoming a tropical storm later that day. It weakened further to a tropical depression over Arkansas the next day. On August\u00a029, Laura degenerated into a remnant low over Kentucky, before being absorbed into another extratropical storm near the East Coast of the U.S. shortly afterward. Overall, Laura caused more than $23.3 billion in damage and 81\u00a0deaths. Areas that were affected by Laura, namely the Gulf Coast, were affected again six weeks later by Hurricane Delta."

        "content": "On August\u00a016, 2020, a tropical wave along the eastern end of a monsoon trough emerged off the west coast of Africa over the Atlantic Ocean.[3] At this time, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) noted the possibility of tropical cyclogenesis over the next five days as environmental conditions gradually became more favorable for development.[4] The system produced disorganized convection over a broad area and steadily consolidated.[5] A surface low accompanied by organizing banding features coalesced about 700\u00a0mi (1,100\u00a0km) west-southwest of the Cape Verde islands.[6] By 03:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a020, the low and accompanying convection became sufficiently organized to be classified as a tropical depression, the thirteenth of the season, about 1,035\u00a0mi (1,666\u00a0km) east-southeast of the Leeward Islands. The depression moved briskly west-northwest in response to the Bermuda High to the north, a high that would steer the system throughout its lifetime.[7][8] After struggling to intensify for over a day, the depression center reformed and an increase an organization and the presence of tropical storm-force winds prompted an upgrade to tropical storm status and storm was named Laura.[9][10] This marked the earliest classification of a season's twelfth named storm since reliable records began in 1851, surpassing the previous record set by Hurricane Luis, on August\u00a028, 1995.[11] Moderate wind shear hampered further development through August\u00a022, displacing the bulk of convection east of the surface circulation.[12] Early on August\u00a022, Laura traversed the Virgin Islands and sideswiped Puerto Rico to the south before making landfall in the southeastern Dominican Republic with maximum sustained winds of 50 miles per hour (80\u00a0km/h) early on August\u00a023.[13][14] Despite interacting with the mountainous terrain of Hispaniola, the overall structure of Laura actually improved with little intensity loss.[15] Laura subsequently traversed Haiti and emerged over the Windward Passage.[16] Once back over water, the storm intensified some and made a brief landfall around 00:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a024 in Santiago de Cuba Province, Cuba, with winds of 60\u201365\u00a0mph (97\u2013105\u00a0km/h) before emerging over the Caribbean along Cuba's southern coast.[17][18][19] Laura's structure briefly degraded on August\u00a024 before it reorganized and traversed Pinar del R\u00edo Province in western Cuba, early on August\u00a025.[20][21][22] Maintaining a west-northwest trajectory, Laura entered the southeastern Gulf of Mexico and quickly organized throughout August\u00a025, reaching hurricane-strength by 12:15\u00a0UTC.[23][24] After moving out of an area of dry air, the hurricane began a period of rapid intensification on August\u00a026.[25][26] The storm grew in size and featured a well-defined eye surrounded by increasingly symmetric deep convection.[27] By 12:00\u00a0UTC, Laura strengthened into a Category\u00a03 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale before becoming a Category\u00a04 hurricane six hours later.[28][29] Continuing to strengthen into August\u00a027, Laura reached its peak intensity of 150 miles per hour (240\u00a0km/h), a high-end Category\u00a04 hurricane, and a minimum pressure of 937\u00a0mbar (hPa; 27.67\u00a0inHg).[30] At this time, the hurricane turned north toward the Texas\u2013Louisiana coastline within a weakness along the western edge of the Bermuda High.[31] Little change in intensity took place in the few hours before Hurricane Laura made landfall near Cameron, Louisiana, around 06:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a027 near peak strength, as its pressure had risen by 2 mbar. Laura matched the strength of the 1856 Last Island hurricane for strongest landfall in the state and was the first Category\u00a04 landfall on record in southwestern Louisiana.[32] Progressing inland across southwestern Louisiana, Laura produced destructive winds over a wide area, although the storm rapidly weakened as it progressed farther inland. Steady filling of the storm and the disappearance of its eye ensued throughout the day, and Laura weakened to a tropical storm by 17:00\u00a0UTC about 50 miles (80\u00a0km) east-southeast of Shreveport.[33][34] Maintaining tropical storm-force winds, the system progressed into southwestern Arkansas.[35] By August\u00a028, Laura degraded to a tropical depression over central Arkansas; heavy rain became the primary threat across the Southeast.[36] Around that time, the NHC issued their final advisory on Laura, passing on the responsibility for issuing advisories to the Weather Prediction Center (WPC).[37] Gradually losing tropical characteristics, the weakening storm accelerated east-northeast within the mid-latitude westerlies.[36][38] The system ultimately degenerated into a remnant low over Kentucky early on August\u00a029, as it began merging with an approaching extratropical storm.[39] Laura's remnant low continued moving eastward, before being absorbed into the approaching extratropical system several hours later over Maryland.[40][41]"

Roads in both Calcasieu and Cameron Parishes in Louisiana were impassable, cutting off road access to both Cameron and Creole. About 200,000 people were left without drinking water after Laura made 80 water systems inoperable. Additionally, some areas saw complete destruction in their power grids, and over a million people lost power. Some areas were expected to be without power for weeks or even months. Multiple homes also were uninhabitable due to air conditioning units being destroyed. Recovery efforts were hampered by additional rainfall in the days after Laura had passed.[229] After the storm, President Donald Trump approved a post-storm major disaster declaration for 23 parishes in Louisiana on August\u00a027. Two days later, he visited the areas most heavily affected by the storm, including Lake Charles in Calcasieu Parish, and Orange County. Trump visited the Cajun Navy, a rescue organization, and met with Governor John Bel Edwards.[230] Post-storm assessments indicated extensive damage and losses to Louisiana's timber industry with some small private forest landowners reporting complete loss of their timber acreage, an outcome which they had not experienced in the aftermath of Hurricane Rita, 15 years earlier.[231] Extensive damage was also reported to Louisiana's industrial facilities with one-third showing some type of damage and nine out of the 138 facilities showing critical damage, causing environmental concerns. Some of the most critically damaged facilities were the BioLab facility in Lake Charles and the Equistar Chemical facility in Westlake, and the Chemical Waste Management facility and the Lotte Chemical plant in Lake Charles.[232] Many of the repairs in Louisiana were undone six weeks later by Hurricane Delta, which made landfall just 12 miles (19\u00a0km) east of where Hurricane Laura did, with many areas in and around hard-hit Lake Charles being damaged again.[233][234] On September 7, 2024, the Capital One Tower was imploded by a demolition crew after the property's owners, Hertz Investment Group, settled with the building's insurance provider, Zurich Insurance Group, for an undisclosed amount.

        "header": "Hurricane Fran",
        "content": "Hurricane Fran caused extensive damage in the United States in early September 1996. The sixth named storm, fifth hurricane, and third major hurricane of the 1996 Atlantic hurricane season, Fran developed from a tropical wave near Cape Verde on August 23. Due to nearby  Hurricane Edouard, the depression remained disorganized as it tracked westward, though it eventually intensified into Tropical Storm Fran on August 27. While heading west-northwestward, Fran steadily strengthened into a hurricane on August 29, but weakened back to a tropical storm on the following day. On August 31, Fran quickly re-intensified into a hurricane. By September 2, Fran began to parallel the islands of the Bahamas and slowly curved north-northwestward. Early on September 5, Fran peaked as a 120\u00a0mph (195\u00a0km/h) Category 3 hurricane. Thereafter, Fran weakened slightly, before it made landfall near Cape Fear, North Carolina early on September 6. The storm rapidly weakened inland and was only a tropical depression later that day. Eventually, Fran curved east-northeastward and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over Ontario early on September 9. In Florida, high tides capsized a boat with five people aboard, though all were rescued. No significant effects were reported in Georgia. The outer bands of Fran produced high winds and light to moderate rainfall in South Carolina. As a result, numerous trees and powerlines were downed, which damaged cars, left over 63,000 people without electricity. Large waves in North Carolina caused significant coastal flooding in some cities. Overall, 27 fatalities and $5\u00a0billion (1996 USD) in damage were attributed to Fran. Fran is also the most recent hurricane to make landfall in the Carolinas as a major hurricane.[1][2]"

        "header": "Meteorological history",
        "content": "Hurricane Fran originated from a tropical wave that moved off the western coast of Africa, entering the Atlantic Ocean, on August\u00a022, 1996. Not long after moving over water, convective banding features formed around a developing area of low pressure. Ships in the vicinity of the system confirmed that a surface circulation had formed later that day. After further development, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) initiated advisories on the system around 8:00\u00a0am EDT on August\u00a023, designating it as Tropical Depression Six. At this time, the depression was situated to the southeast of the Cape Verde Islands. Over the following several days, little development took place as the system moved westward at 17\u00a0mph (27\u00a0km/h). The westward motion and lack of development were attributed to the low-level inflow from Hurricane Edouard located roughly 850\u00a0mi (1,370\u00a0km) west-northwest of the depression.[3] By August\u00a026, the depression had become significantly disorganized, prompting the NHC to issue their initial final advisory on the system.[4] Despite this, the following day, satellite imagery depicted an improved circulation, leading to the re-issuance of advisories.[5] However, post-storm analysis indicated that the system maintained tropical depression status during the 24\u2011hour span. During the afternoon of August\u00a027, the depression intensified further, becoming a tropical storm and receiving the name Fran. At this time, Tropical Storm Fran was located about 1,000\u00a0mi (1,600\u00a0km) east of the Lesser Antilles. Following a similar track as Edouard, the newly named storm maintained a west-northwest track while gaining strength.[3] Following the development of deep convection around Fran's center of circulation on August\u00a029, the NHC upgraded it to a Category 1 hurricane, the lowest ranking on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale, with winds of 75\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h). However, the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm on August\u00a030 as it became less organized, possibly due to an interaction with Hurricane Edouard to the north. During this time, the forward motion of the storm significantly decreased and it took a more northwestward track. However, this weakening was short-lived and Fran re-attained hurricane status the following day as Edouard moved towards the Mid-Atlantic coastline. The storm also resumed its west-northwest movement as a subtropical ridge to the north strengthened.[3] Gradual reintensification took place for the first several days of September, with Fran attaining winds of 90\u00a0mph (145\u00a0km/h) on September\u00a03. By this point, the storm began to develop an eye and a more rapid phase of strengthening took place. Early the next day, Fran attained Category 3 intensity as its maximum sustained winds increased to 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h). A more northwesterly track also began to appear as it approached the Bahamas. Passing roughly 115\u00a0mi (185\u00a0km) east of the Bahamas, Fran attained its peak intensity on September\u00a05 with winds of 120\u00a0mph (195\u00a0km/h) and a barometric pressure of 946 mbar (hPa; 27.94\u00a0inHg). The eye of Fran was roughly 29\u00a0mi (47\u00a0km) in diameter at this time.[3] As a large hurricane, the storm's forward motion increased as it moved northwest towards The Carolinas. Around 7:30\u00a0 PM EDT on Thursday, September\u00a05,[6] the center of Hurricane Fran made landfall near Cape Fear, North Carolina with sustained winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h). Once overland, the storm began to rapidly weaken, degrading to a tropical storm within 12\u00a0hours. As the weakening storm moved through Virginia, the NHC further downgraded it to a tropical depression. Continuing on a northwestern track, the remnants of Fran persisted as a tropical depression through September\u00a08, at which time it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over southern Ontario. After completing this transition, Fran turned northeastward and tracked near the Canadian-United States border before being absorbed by a frontal system on September\u00a010.[3]"

All watches and warnings on the state were discontinued by September 5.[9] Before the hurricane neared the coast, civil defense authorities conducted statewide conference calls in order to create preliminary plans in case Fran caused impacts on Florida.[10] In addition, beach patrols were kept on high alert as Fran generated large waves on the Florida beaches.[11]"

Along the beaches of Palm Beach County, five people aboard an 18\u00a0ft (5.5\u00a0m) fishing boat were knocked into the water by the rough seas. However, the Coast Guard rescued all five persons without incident.[14] As Fran made landfall in North Carolina, the outer bands of the storm brought heavy rains and gusty winds to eastern South Carolina. Several areas reported winds in excess of 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h), leading to numerous downed trees and power lines. Some cars and homes were damaged after being struck by fallen trees.[15] In Dillon County, winds gusting up to 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) caused significant damage to many homes. Debris was left in the wake of Fran across the county than during Hurricane Hugo in 1989. One person was injured and damage to crops and infrastructure reached $6.5\u00a0million.[16] In Marlboro County, roughly 3,200 people were left without power and two sheriffs were injured after their car struck a fallen tree.[17] The most severe damage in South Carolina took place in Horry County where winds reached 77\u00a0mph (124\u00a0km/h). Numerous trees were felled by the winds, leaving roughly 60,000 residents without power. One person was killed after her car fell down an embankment.

Its 12-foot storm surge carried away a temporary North Topsail Beach police station and town hall, housed in a double-wide trailer since Hurricane Bertha's rampage across the same area in July. The Kure Beach Pier was destroyed during the storm as well. Extensive flooding struck the coast around Wrightsville Beach, just up the coast from Cape Fear. In Jacksonville, North Carolina, three schools and several homes were damaged. The storm was most damaging to the barrier islands on the North Carolina coastline. Further inland, the storm caused damage on its way north from Wilmington to Raleigh.  Unexpectedly, high wind damage extended along the I-40 corridor up through Raleigh and points north and as far west as Guilford County, damaging historic buildings and trees throughout the Triangle including at North Carolina State University and the University of North Carolina[21]  Classes were canceled for the day at UNC due to a state of emergency in Chapel Hill, and it was almost a week before the university's water supply was drinkable again. Rain of up to 16 inches (406\u00a0mm) deluged interior North Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia,[22] bringing dangerous river flooding to much of the mid-Atlantic. Hurricane Fran's thrashing of North Carolina aggravated the state's problems caused by numerous weather disasters in 1996. At least six people were killed in the Carolinas; most of them were from automobile accidents and more died as a result of the shock from the damage of the storm. In North Carolina, 1.3\u00a0million people were left without power[citation needed]. In North Topsail Beach and Carteret County, there was over $500\u00a0million (1996\u00a0USD) in damage and 90% of structures were damaged.[23] One male teenager died from drowning caused by flooding of Crabtree Creek at Old Lassiter Mill in Raleigh. Fran also destroyed the basketball gym on the campus of St. Andrews College in Laurinburg, North Carolina as well as 3 piers in Surf City. Total damage in North Carolina amounted to over $2.4\u00a0billion.[24] This was the second hurricane to make landfall on North Carolina that year.

There was severe damage to power lines that left 415,000 people without electricity, making it the largest storm related power outage in history until Hurricane Isabel in 2003.[23] Along the Rappahannock River, a storm surge of 5\u00a0ft (1.5\u00a0m) damaged or sank several small boats and damaged wharfs and bulkheads. This was the highest tide in the state since Hurricane Hazel of 1954.[23] Rain up to 16\u00a0in (410\u00a0mm) fell in the western part of Virginia, making Fran the fourth wettest known tropical cyclone to impact Virginia and causing major flash flooding. The floods shut down many of the primary and secondary roads and closed Shenandoah National Park.[26] Fran destroyed about 300 homes, mostly from flooding, and 100 people had to be rescued. Page County, downslope of the 16\" of rainfall from Big Meadows, was the hardest hit locality in the state of Virginia with regards to damage. Three days after the storm had passed, \"hundreds\" of people were still stranded. Some 78 homes were destroyed and 417 were damaged, however there were no deaths. At one point on Friday every town in the county was isolated due to high water.[27] In the county seat of Luray, the Hawksbill Creek cut the town in half for much of the day, and the strong current forced a house off its foundation and placed in the endzone of Luray High School's football field. Water from the Hawksbill reached 2\u00a0ft (0.61\u00a0m) from the top of the field goal upright\u2014 16\u00a0ft (4.9\u00a0m) of water covered the ground. Bulldog field was flooded for over a week after the storm, until finally the standing water was pumped across U.S. Route 340 back into the Hawksbill Creek. Also in downtown Luray, the large flood-driven waves of the creek demolished three buildings, including the Adelphia Cable building.  The creek, typically less than a foot deep, overtook the downtown Main Street Bridge, which rises some 15\u00a0ft (4.6\u00a0m) above the creek bed.[28] The Shenandoah River crested some 20\u00a0ft (6.1\u00a0m) above flood stage.  The South Fork of the Shenandoah River recorded its highest crests ever,  26.95\u00a0ft (8.21\u00a0m) in Luray  and 37\u00a0ft (11\u00a0m) in Front Royal, Virginia, which was 22\u00a0ft (6.7\u00a0m) above the 15\u00a0ft (4.6\u00a0m) flood stage.[29] In Rockingham County, Virginia, over 10,000 people were evacuated from their homes, however most were allowed to return to their homes after the water subsided.[30]"

The powerful F5 tornado that struck the town of Elie, in the Canadian province of Manitoba (40\u00a0km (25\u00a0mi) west of Winnipeg) was known for its unusual path, how it was during its path, a rope to cone and how it is unique compared to the other F5s/EF5s.[1][3] It was part of a small two-day tornado outbreak that occurred in the area and reached a maximum width of 150 yards (140\u00a0m). The tornado was unusual because it caused the extreme damage during its roping out stage at a mere 35 yards (32\u00a0m) in width and moved extremely slowly and unpredictably. The tornado tracked primarily southeast, as opposed to the usual northeast, and made multiple loops and sharp turns.[4] Because Environment Canada adopted the Enhanced Fujita scale in 2013, there will be no more tornadoes with an F5 rating, making this tornado the first and last confirmed F5 tornado in Canada and in the world.[5] While several houses were leveled, no one was injured or killed by the tornado.[1] A home in the town was swept clean off of its foundation, justifying the F5 classification. One of the strongest twisters on record since 1999, it is one of only ten to be rated F5/EF5 since 1999 in North America. The tornado caused damage of an estimated $39 million."

        "content": "The synoptic situation on June 22 was conducive to a major severe weather event in southern Manitoba. A low pressure system came in from Saskatchewan through the day, and then moved over southern Manitoba throughout the evening. A warm front was positioned north of Elie for much of the day with a trailing cold front residing west of Elie near the Lake Manitoba basin southwest through southeast Saskatchewan. A lake breeze boundary was also present south of Lake Manitoba.[6] Very warm air was situated over Southern Manitoba that day as temperatures climbed into the high 20s \u00b0C (low 80s \u00b0F). The humidity was also uncomfortably high, with dewpoints ranging from 18\u201322\u00a0\u00b0C (64\u201372\u00a0\u00b0F). Strong wind shear was present, reflected in high helicity values. These conditions were favorable for supercells, which are thunderstorms with rotating updrafts, and they developed within the warm sector located in the Red River Valley and areas farther west. The situation was exacerbated by the presence of the lake breeze boundary because the atmosphere was capped through much of the day with little in the way of a trigger. This boundary provided the focus for storms to develop rapidly and become severe, given the high instability present.[6]"

The tornado slowly turned east, took a sharp turn south, and then took another sharp turn east all within roughly 1 mile (1.6\u00a0km). The tornado made another turn south and made an extremely slow loop over the town's flour mill at F2 intensity, causing over $1 million in damage. Multiple semi trucks were overturned and damaged and building walls buckled inward. At this point, the tornado was producing F1 to F2 level damage and had grown to a width of 50 m. From there, it headed south, parallel to Janzen Road, at F0 intensity. It also continued to grow, and reached its peak width of about 140 m. After reaching the intersection of Jansen Road and Road 61 North, the tornado turned east directly towards the southwest edge of Elie. It quickly intensified to F4 strength while it made a loop over Elie Street. Here, it damaged a dozen homes and destroyed four houses, including one which was described as well-built and bolted to its foundation, being lifted completely off its foundation and thrown into the air where it then broke apart, justifying F5 intensity. The tornado was even strong enough to rip some sill plates and snap off bolts that supported them.[4] Trees were debarked as well. The two other houses sustained F4 level damage, with both of them being almost completely lifted off of their foundations. One other house also sustained F2 or F3 level damage, with the entire roof torn off and multiple exterior walls collapsed. The tornado also flipped and threw multiple cars, including a car that was tossed over 100 meters, and even tossed one homeowner's Chrysler Fifth Avenue onto a neighbor's roof.[8][9] The tornado lingered over this area of Elie for approximately four minutes before it exited Elie to the southwest and rapidly dissipated.[4] The tornado traveled about 6\u00a0km (3.7\u00a0mi) and was 150 yards (140\u00a0m) wide at its widest during its 35-minute lifespan. The tornado repeatedly struck essentially the same area of town, destroying most of the structures and vehicles in the area. A video of the tornado shows an entire two-story home swiped off its foundation and tossed 75 feet (23\u00a0m) in the air before rotating around the tornado and then being obliterated. Also seen on the video was a three-quarters-of-a-ton GM van filled with drywall picked up and tossed hundreds of feet. At least three houses are seen being destroyed on the video, with many more being damaged as well as vehicles, and the mill is seen being damaged, with bins and roofs being destroyed there.[10][11]"

It was one of only two F5/EF5 tornadoes that year (the other being in Greensburg, Kansas on May 4, 2007), and there have only been ten confirmed since 1999.

The structural assessments indicated that the homes were well-built and generally well-secured. In particular, one of the destroyed homes met all of the requirements for the highest damage rating.\"[13] The team also noted that the damage would have qualified for an EF5 rating on the Enhanced Fujita scale, which was in use in the United States at the time.[14]"

The Elie tornado was also significant because of how it looked while at F5 intensity. The tornado was reaching the end of its life span and was in its roping out/decaying stage.

The bricks show where the wall was rebuilt after its tornado-caused collapse. Knox Presbyterian, Metropolitan Methodist and First Baptist, all being brick, were rebuilt after the tornado. Knox and Metropolitan both became United Church in 1925, and merged their congregations in 1951 to become the Knox-Metropolitan Church, meeting in the old Metropolitan Church. The Knox building was ultimately demolished."

        "content": " The Edmonton tornado of 1987, an event also known as Black Friday to Edmontonians, was a powerful and devastating tornado that ripped through the eastern parts of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada and parts of neighbouring Strathcona County on the afternoon of Friday, July\u00a031, 1987. It was one of seven other tornadoes in central Alberta the same day.[5] The tornado peaked at F4 on the Fujita scale and remained on the ground for an hour, cutting a swath of destruction 30.8\u00a0km (19.1\u00a0mi) in length and up to 1.3\u00a0km (0.81\u00a0mi) wide in some places.[5][6]  It killed 27 people, and injured more than 300, destroyed more than 300 homes, and caused more than C$332.27\u00a0million (equivalent to $762 million in 2023) in property damage at four major disaster sites. The loss of life, injuries and destruction of property made it the worst natural disaster in Alberta's recent history and the second deadliest in Canada's history, after the Regina Cyclone. Weather forecasts issued during the morning and early afternoon of July\u00a031, 1987, for Edmonton revealed a recognition by Environment Canada of a high potential for unusually severe thunderstorms that afternoon. Environment Canada responded swiftly upon receipt of the first report of a tornado touchdown from a resident of Leduc County which is immediately adjacent to Edmonton's southern boundary."

        "content": "In the week preceding July\u00a031, a low pressure system sitting over southwestern British Columbia fed warm, humid air into central Alberta. Daytime heating along with near-record dewpoints over Alberta triggered a series of strong thunderstorms that persisted throughout the week. On July\u00a031, a cold front developed over western Alberta, colliding with the warm moist air that persisted over the region. Forecasters recognized the elevated risk for severe weather early in the day.[7] Weatheradio broadcasts and interviews with the media stressed \"vicious thunderstorms\" and \"extremely strong and violent thunderstorms\".[8]\nSevere thunderstorms developed rapidly over the foothills early in the day and quickly moved eastward. The first severe weather watches were issued over central Alberta late in the morning and continued early in the afternoon. At 1:40\u00a0pm, a severe weather watch was issued for the Edmonton area, including Leduc County, Parkland County, and Strathcona County. The watch was later upgraded to a warning at 2:45\u00a0pm as the line of storms approached the area. As the cluster of storms approached the Leduc area, a violent cell rapidly developed ahead of the main line of storms and sharply turned northward. The storm passed east of Leduc, where the first tornado was reported by a weather spotter at 2:59\u00a0pm. The tornado was on the ground briefly before dissipating. Shortly after 3:00\u00a0pm, the tornado again touched down in the Beaumont area, tossing granaries and farm equipment as it grew in size and strength.[9] At 3:04\u00a0pm, a tornado warning was issued for the city. The tornado moved into the southeast portion of the city as a multiple-vortex tornado, and tracked north along the eastern portions of Mill Woods, causing F2 to F3 damage. The tornado continued northward crossing the Sherwood Park Freeway and eventually hitting the Refinery Row area at F4 intensity. The tornado tossed several large oil tanks, levelled several industrial buildings, and several trailers were picked up and scattered at Laidlaw and Byers Transport.[10] Grass scouring and windrowing of debris occurred, and damage in that area may have been borderline F5, but was never officially ranked as such.[11] The tornado weakened slightly as it passed over an open area between Baseline Road and the North Saskatchewan River. Still, it maintained F2 to F3 intensity as it tore through eastern parts of Clareview toward 4:00\u00a0pm, causing heavy damage to several homes in Kernohan, Bannerman and Fraser neighbourhoods.[10] The tornado persisted as it headed northeast toward the Evergreen Mobile Home Park. There, the tornado completely destroyed nearly 200 mobile homes in the area, killed 15 people and injured numerous others."

Twenty-two minutes after the first tornado touchdown an F1 tornado touched down in Southeast Edmonton in an area that was mostly farmland. It travelled 7.26\u00a0km (4.51\u00a0mi). There were also three F0 tornadoes in the Edmonton Area (to the north, northwest, and southwest) but too far away to be seen from the city.[5][12] Farther from the Edmonton area, an F2 tornado touched down in farmland between Millet and Vegreville and remained on the ground for 52\u00a0km (32\u00a0mi), causing $40,000 in damages.[13][5]"

At the onset of the storm Emergency Preparedness Canada established contact with the Government of Alberta Emergency Response Centre. EPC established a liaison office at the response centre at approximately 1800 hours that same day. As emergency personnel responded to the industrial area, potential threats from dangerous goods came to light. Alberta's Compliance Information Centre dispatched its dangerous goods inspectors and the provincial environmental response team to the area. The emergent post-disaster response period lasted for approximately three weeks including immediate disaster assistance for victims. At the end of August 1987 details of the overall damage costs were gathered and the Government of Alberta announced an extensive disaster recovery program with the assistance of the Government of Canada. The Emergency Public Warning System, later replaced by Alberta Emergency Alert, was developed as a result of the 1987 tornado disaster.[14] The warning system breaks into private and public broadcasts on radio, television and cable systems. It alerts the public for all disaster hazards that threaten to strike with little or no warning. The warning system is also used for issuing Amber Alerts.[15] The tornado had also resulted in the first implementation of the Doppler weather radar concept in Canada in the early 1990s. Edmonton's Carvel radar was one of only three Dopplers to exist in Canada at the time. It later became part of the Canadian weather radar network, which was Dopplerized starting in 1998.[16]"

        "content": " The 1928 Fort Pierce hurricane devastated areas of Florida and the Southeastern United States in August\u00a01928. The first tropical cyclone and hurricane of the annual hurricane season, the storm developed from a tropical wave first identified on August\u00a03, 1928, north of the Virgin Islands. Slowly intensifying as it moved west-northwest, the system paralleled the Greater Antilles throughout much of its early existence. On August\u00a05, the tropical storm strengthened to the equivalent of a Category\u00a01 hurricane, while positioned over The Bahamas. The hurricane continued to intensify, and after reaching Category\u00a02 hurricane strength, attained its peak intensity on August\u00a07 with winds of 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 971\u00a0mbar (971\u00a0hPa; 28.7\u00a0inHg). Shortly after, the hurricane made landfall as a slightly weaker storm just southeast of Fort Pierce, Florida at 0700\u00a0UTC on August\u00a08. Weakening as it moved across the Florida peninsula over the course of the next day, the storm briefly moved over the Gulf of Mexico before recurving northwards. Thus, it made a second landfall on the Florida Panhandle on August\u00a010 as a tropical storm. Once inland, the system continued to weaken, degenerating to tropical depression strength before transitioning into an extratropical storm later that day. The extratropical remnants progressed outwards into the Atlantic Ocean before entirely dissipating by August\u00a014. In its early developmental stages north of the Greater Antilles, the storm caused minor damage to shipping in The Bahamas and generated rough seas offshore Cuba. At its first landfall on Fort Pierce, the hurricane caused extensive property damage, particularly in coastal regions, where numerous homes were unroofed. Central Florida's citrus crop was hampered by the strong winds and heavy rain. Several of Florida's lakes, including Lake Okeechobee, rose past their banks, inundating coastal areas. Damage to infrastructure was less in inland regions than at the coast, though power outages caused loss of communication statewide. At the hurricane's second landfall, wind damage was relatively minor, though torrential rainfall, aided by orthographic lift, caused extensive flooding as far north as the Mid-Atlantic states. Overall, the hurricane caused $235,000\u00a0in damages, primarily in Florida,[nb 1] and two deaths."

        "content": "A tropical disturbance was first identified north of the Leeward Islands near the Virgin Islands at 0000\u00a0UTC on August\u00a03. Due to a lack of conclusive weather reports from nearby areas at the time, the origins of the tropical storm were initially unknown, but listed the system as forming near Trinidad and Barbados in the HURDAT\u2014the database listing all tropical cyclones in the Atlantic basin since 1851. However, the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project analyzed the storm to have formed north of the Leeward Islands based on reports from San Juan, Puerto Rico, and as such revised the storm's HURDAT listing.[1] Moving to the west-northwest, the tropical storm maintained its intensity without any intensification early in its existence.[2] Ships in the region reported tropical storm-force winds and low barometric pressures.[1] The ship S.S. Sixaola sent a telegraphic report of the storm's location and existence west of Acklins Island on August\u00a05, the first ship to explicitly do so.[3] Beginning to accelerate as it paralleled the Cuban Atlantic coast the following day, the storm intensified to reach an intensity equivalent to a modern-day Category\u00a01 hurricane at 1200\u00a0UTC.[2] The hurricane continued to intensify, and attained Category\u00a02 hurricane intensity by 0600\u00a0UTC on August\u00a07.[2] At around the same time, the S.S. Lempira reported a minimum pressure of 971\u00a0mbar (971\u00a0hPa; 28.7\u00a0inHg), while 30 miles (48\u00a0km) southeast of Jupiter, Florida.[3] At the time, maximum sustained winds were estimated at 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h); this would be the hurricane's peak intensity.[2] The hurricane weakened slightly before making landfall on central Florida, just southeast of Fort Pierce, Florida, at 0700\u00a0UTC the following day. Winds at landfall were estimated at 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h), with a minimum central pressure of 977\u00a0mbar (28.9\u00a0inHg) recorded in Fort Pierce within the hurricane's eye. At the time, the system's maximum winds extended up to 10\u00a0mi (16\u00a0km) from the center of circulation.[1] The storm then slowly crossed the Florida peninsula, before entering the Gulf of Mexico the next day near Tampa, Florida, after having weakened down to tropical storm strength.[3] Despite remaining over water, its close proximity to the continent prevented further strengthening. The tropical storm recurved to the north in the gulf, before making a second landfall near Apalachicola, Florida at 0400\u00a0UTC on August\u00a010 with winds of 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h).[1] Moving inland, the system rapidly weakened as it continued to recurve to the northeast, further degenerating to tropical depression strength at 0000\u00a0UTC on August\u00a011 while situated over Georgia.[2] Based on weather station observations, the storm was analyzed to have transitioned into an extratropical cyclone later that day.[1] The extratropical storm strengthened slightly over the Mid-Atlantic states,[2] before exiting into the Atlantic Ocean near the Virginia Capes.[3] The storm system progressed eastward across the ocean before dissipating at 1800\u00a0UTC on August\u00a014.[2]"

The plane and crew were later found north of Andros Island by a Miami relief plane and a boat from Nassau three days later.[6] Cuba, located south of the storm throughout its duration, reported minimal effects from the hurricane, other than a lowering of barometric pressures as reported by Jos\u00e9 Carlos Mill\u00e1s, then-chief of the Cuban National Observatory.[7] However, occasional thunderstorm activity fueled by the hurricane dropped rainfall over the island, and the storm generated heavy seas at the Cuban coast.[8]"

        "content": "Upon notification that a newly formed tropical cyclone was approaching the Florida coast, the Weather Bureau posted storm warnings for coastal areas between Key West and West Palm Beach, Florida. Later on August\u00a06, warnings were lowered in Key West, but the warning area was extended north to Titusville, Florida. Vessels and small craft located offshore north of Miami, Florida were notified to advise caution for the oncoming tropical disturbance. As the storm approached the coast, more accurate forecasts allowed vessels to be cautioned as far north as Hatteras, North Carolina. Storm warnings between Jupiter and Daytona, Florida were upgraded to hurricane warnings on August\u00a07, in accordance with the storm's upgrade to hurricane intensity. After moving inland, hurricane warnings were lowered, but emergency warnings for the storm's potential effects were posted for the interior of the Florida peninsula north of 28\u00b0N the following day. Northwest storm warnings were issued in Tampa, while northeast storm warnings were issued from Tampa north to Apalachicola, Florida. All warnings were eventually lowered following the storm's dissipation.[3] Approaching the Floridian coast as an intensifying hurricane, the storm initially turned away from the peninsula for a short period of time on August\u00a07, after nearly making landfall on West Palm Beach. Strong gusts of at least 30\u00a0mph (48\u00a0km/h) and squally weather impacted the city, but did not cause any damage. However, telecommunications in the city were temporarily disrupted due to the storm. In Jupiter, stronger gusts reaching 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) were reported, but did not cause any damage as well.[9] However, the hurricane's recurvature offshore was short lived, and the system eventually made its landfall near Fort Pierce, Florida early on August\u00a08.[2] Offshore, the USAHS Algonquin, a cruise ship belonging to the Clyde-Mallory cruise line, was caught in the storm, but managed to reach its destination of New York, New York without any major problems.[10] The Honduran freighter Lempira, which had also recorded the lowest barometric pressure associated with the hurricane, experienced considerable damage due to the strong seas. The ship lost all of its lifeboats, and as a result the United Fruit Company line was sent to accompany the damaged ship.[11] Inland, damage was concentrated in an area extending from Jupiter to the border between Florida and Georgia.[3] The hurricane's landfall on the peninsula was attended by torrential rainfall, which damaged crops, particularly citrus.[1] Rainfall peaked at 14.5\u00a0in (370\u00a0mm) in St. Cloud over a five-day period from August\u00a07\u201312.[12] There, the nearby East Lake Tohopekaliga began to overflow, threatening property and crops.[10] Losses to the citrus crop were estimated by the Florida Citrus Exchange to be equivalent to 1\u00a0million\u00a0boxes of citrus.[3] However, damage to citrus in the Kissimmee area was comparatively less, and was limited to unripe fruit.[13] Lake Okeechobee's water level rose by 2\u00a0ft (0.61\u00a0m) as a result of floodwater rushing into the lake.[14] Damage along the lake's shores mostly occurred to the north. To the south, in Clewiston, minor damage was confined to trees and windows.[13] Two deaths occurred in the vicinity of the Indian River; these were the only deaths associated with the hurricane in the state.[15] Numerous highways were also washed out by the rains, especially on Florida's south-central east coast.[16] Portions of State Road 4 were covered in debris strewn by strong winds.[17] Damage to the state's road systems was estimated at $100,000 by the former Florida State Highway Commission.[3] Bridges were also badly damaged, with some needing replacement.[16] Alongside the heavy rainfall, strong winds were reported.[1] Large live oak trees were uprooted,[16] especially in Osceola, Brevard, Orange, and Marion counties in Florida.[3] Initial estimates of property damage in several cities on Florida's mid-eastern coast reached $5\u00a0million, though this was later drastically scaled down.[1] In Sebastian, winds were estimated at 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h).[18] Due to the high winds, rail service on the Florida East Coast Railway was halted 3\u00a0mi (4.8\u00a0km) north of Jupiter after winds became unsuitable for continued travel. Portions of the railway were also flooded in water.[17] The train station in Fort Pierce was later unroofed.[19] Many of the state's coastal beaches suffered from window damage and damage to vegetation caused by strong winds. An estimated 75%\u00a0of structures in Fort Pierce and 50%\u00a0of structures in Vera were estimated to have been damaged by the strong winds, particularly in the form of torn roofs.[17] A report suggested that damage from those two cities reached at least $1\u00a0million.[20] The strong winds also hampered telephone and telegraph networks across the state, with losses as a result in excess of $1,000.[3] Power transmission lines belonging to the Florida Power & Light Company were downed, causing a widespread power outage along the coast from Titusville to West Palm Beach. Thus, services requiring electric power were postponed until power was later restored. In Stuart, failure of the electric pumps led to loss of telecommunications and the local water supply. In Melbourne, additional power lines were downed, and buildings experienced awning damage.[17] Portions of Central Florida also saw considerable damage.[21] In Winter Haven, winds were reported to have reached 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h), before power was cut.[10] A hotel in the city collapsed, and numerous houses were unroofed.[22] Property damage in Kissimmee and Haines City was severe, with many collapsed buildings. In Haines City, a large garage collapsed, destroying automobiles parked within. Nearby in Lakeland, there was less damage, though winds estimated at 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) tore signs and awnings.[21] Effects of the storm in Tampa were comparatively less, though a lack of communications between the city and other locations led to speculation that Tampa had been severely hit.[20] At nearby Clearwater, Florida, boats were run aground at the harbor, causing some damage.[23] Similar conditions were felt in Ocala, though in some suburban areas trees were felled by the strong winds. Bus service in the area was delayed due to debris covering roadways.[24]"

        "content": "Upon the hurricane's second landfall on the Florida Panhandle on August\u00a010, wind effects were much less significant, though the storm dropped widespread rainfall throughout its remaining path. Aided by orthographic lift from the Appalachian Mountains, the rainfall caused numerous reports of flood damage across the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic states. For any given 50,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (130,000\u00a0km2) area of land affected by the storm, the maximum average rainfall was 6.4\u00a0in (160\u00a0mm).[12] In southern and central Georgia, flood warnings were issued due to the potential for flood impacts late on August\u00a010. In Macon, Georgia, 8.5\u00a0in (220\u00a0mm) of rain was recorded in a 16-hour period. The Ocmulgee River, which runs through Macon, began to rise past flood stage as a result, causing the lower areas of the city to be inundated. Trees were also downed due to strong winds. Portions of the Central of Georgia Railway were washed out, forcing trains to be redirected. In Thomasville, Georgia, highways leading to Florida were rendered impassable due to blocking debris. In Valdosta, Georgia, a torn roof cut through several power lines, causing electrical disruptions in the city.[25] Similar impacts were felt in Augusta, Georgia, where strong winds toppled trees, damaged cottages, and severed telecommunication lines. Five people there were injured.[26] In addition, a tornado occurred nearby, damaging houses and flattening trees.[27] Further east in the Carolinas, five people were killed in the Piedmont region due to floods caused by the passing storm.[28] Torrential rainfall in the area resulted in disruption of power, communications, and traffic. Precipitation in those two states peaked at 9\u00a0in (230\u00a0mm) in western North Carolina.[12] In South Carolina, the heavy rainfall forced the issuance of flood warnings on the rising Santee River and its tributaries.[29] The Broad and Congaree Rivers in South Carolina later set high water level records due in part to the saturated soils caused by the storm.[15] The storm reached Virginia by August\u00a012, resulting in additional flooding. A weather station in Richmond, Virginia recorded a minimum barometric pressure of 1,000\u00a0mbar (1,000\u00a0hPa; 30\u00a0inHg).[29] There, the James and Rivanna Rivers exceeded their respective flood stages, washing out peripheral crops.[30] Offshore the Mid-Atlantic states, over 100\u00a0people were rescued after rough waves swept them away.[31] Moderate gales associated with the storm were reported as far north as New York.[1]"

        "content": " Hurricane Darby was a strong tropical cyclone which affected Hawaii as a tropical storm. The fifth named storm of the busy 2016 Pacific hurricane season, Darby originated from a low pressure area that developed in the Eastern Pacific well southwest of Mexico during July\u00a02016. It gained sufficient organization to be declared a tropical depression on July\u00a011, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Darby the next day. Further intensification ensued, and Darby became a hurricane on July\u00a013. Over the next three days, Darby slowly strengthened to Category 3 status on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale, becoming a major hurricane. Cool waters and dry air caused Darby to weaken over the next three days, although Darby managed to restrengthen slightly on July\u00a021 before weakening once again as the storm neared Hawaii. Just after midnight on July\u00a024 (UTC; 2:00\u00a0p.m. on July\u00a023 HST), Darby made landfall on the Big Island. Darby weakened into a remnant low two days later. Darby was the second tropical storm to make landfall in Hawaii in two years. Before landfall, tropical storm watches and warnings were issued for all of Hawaii, and were only discontinued after Darby weakened to a tropical depression on July\u00a025. Over the period of July\u00a023 to July\u00a025, Darby brought heavy rain and widespread flash floods to the windward sides of the Hawaiian Islands, with storm rainfall totals exceeding 5\u00a0in (130\u00a0mm) on the Big Island and 7\u00a0in (180\u00a0mm) in Oahu. This resulted in some road closures, sewage spills, numerous flight cancellations, and minor property damage. Overall, no fatalities occurred during the passage of Darby."

        "content": "In the first two weeks of July, a series of low pressure areas formed off the coast of Mexico.[2] The fourth of these was spawned by a tropical wave several hundred miles south-southeast of Acapulco, Mexico, first noted by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) on July\u00a09.[3][4] Amid favorable conditions, convection associated with the low developed and increased in organization,[5] and a tropical depression formed on the afternoon of July\u00a011 centered 290\u00a0mi (470\u00a0km) south-southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico.[2] Despite moving over sea surface temperatures of at least 82\u00a0\u00b0F (28\u00a0\u00b0C), moderate northeasterly wind shear hindered development; however, the depression soon obtained sufficient organization to be upgraded to a tropical storm and given the name Darby.[6] On July\u00a013, the shear decreased, and as a result Darby began to intensify quickly, strengthening into a hurricane 30\u00a0hours after becoming a tropical storm.[7] At that time, Darby was located about 570 miles (920\u00a0km) south-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula.[8] Tracking steadily west-northwestward along the southern periphery of a subtropical ridge, Darby continued to intensify albeit at a slower rate due to its proximity to dry air.[1] On July\u00a015, Darby became a Category\u00a02 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale.[9] Despite decreasing ocean temperatures, Darby intensified further to attain winds of 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h).[10] Strengthening was no longer expected as Darby moved over sea temperatures of less than 79\u00a0\u00b0F (26\u00a0\u00b0C), but on July\u00a016, Darby managed to develop an annular structure. Convection became more symmetric, outer rainbands dissipated, and the 25\u00a0mile-wide (35\u00a0km) eye became increasingly well defined.[1][11] Darby reached its peak intensity as a Category\u00a03 hurricane with winds of 120\u00a0mph (190\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 958\u00a0mbar (958\u00a0hPa; 28.3\u00a0inHg).[1] However, twelve hours later, Darby weakened back to a Category\u00a02 hurricane as convection deteriorated.[1] Embedded in cool sinking air and moving over decreasing sea surface temperatures,[12] Darby began a gradual weakening trend, degrading to a Category\u00a01 hurricane by July\u00a018.[1] Despite warming cloud tops, Darby exhibited a well-defined circulation and a ragged eye feature, remaining a minimal hurricane through the rest of the day.[13] However, Darby finally weakened to a tropical storm on July\u00a019.[14] Darby continued to degrade as it crossed 140\u00b0W into the Central Pacific, and entered the jurisdiction of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) on July\u00a020 with winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h).[15] Soon after, Darby turned west-southwestwards as it continued to weaken, but the shear diminished slightly on July\u00a021, allowing Darby to restrengthen to winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h).[16] The reprieve was short-lived, however, as an approaching upper-level low once again increased shear over the system the next day.[17] Darby began to curve back to the west on July\u00a023 as it approached a weakness in the aforementioned subtropical ridge, all the while weakening slowly.[18] Just after 00:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a024 (2:00\u00a0p.m.\u00a0HST on July\u00a023), Darby made landfall on the Big Island near the village of Pahala in the Ka\u02bb\u016b District, with winds of 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h).[19] This marked one of only six occurrences of a tropical cyclone of tropical storm intensity or higher making landfall on one of the major islands in the state of Hawaii since record keeping began in 1949. The others were an unnamed tropical storm in 1958, Hurricane Dot in 1959, Hurricane Iniki in 1992, Tropical Storm Iselle in 2014, and Tropical Storm Olivia in 2018.[20] After crossing the Big Island, Darby began to accelerate northwestwards in earnest while maintaining as a minimal tropical storm.[21] On July\u00a025, Darby weakened into a depression,[22] and degenerated into a remnant low on the next day 265\u00a0mi (426\u00a0km) west-northwest of Honolulu.[23]"

Heavy rainfall occurred along the windward slopes within the range of 5 to 8\u00a0in (130 to 200\u00a0mm), peaking at 7.41\u00a0in (188\u00a0mm) near the Kawai Nui Marsh. Flash flooding occurred in the South Kohala, Kau, and Hamakua districts which forced the closure of numerous roads. However, Hilo, located between these heavily impacted districts, recorded a relatively modest 1.77 inches of rain on July 23 and 24. After passing over the Big Island, Darby proceeded northwestward via the Kauai Channel, while resulting in heavy rains over southern slope of Haleakala on Maui. These rains forced the closure of Highway 11, as well as parts of Interstate H-1 and the Kamehameha Highway. Island-wide, a peak 24-hour rainfall total, 8.51\u00a0in (215\u00a0mm), was measured in Wailuaiki. In Oahu, rainfall, sometimes at rates of 3 to 4\u00a0in (75 to 100\u00a0mm) per hour, caused flash flooding in several areas within the urban core of Honolulu and along windward slopes. A stream in Kalihi inundated several properties and spilled over a bridge located further downstream.[37] Several sewage spills occurred on Oahu due to the heavy rain, including 42,000\u00a0gallons (160,000\u00a0litres) at the Kailua Wastewater Treatment Plant and 4,100\u00a0gallons (15,500\u00a0litres) from a private residence on Liliha Street. This resulted in the issuance of a brown water advisory.[38][39] In all, peak storm totals on Oahu during the night of July\u00a024 exceeded 7\u00a0in (180\u00a0mm), including 10.8\u00a0in (275\u00a0mm) in Kaneohe.[37] Across the entire state of Hawaii, there was no loss of life during the passage of Tropical Storm Darby, and overall the islands experienced only minimal impacts from the storm.[37][38]"

The nineteenth named storm and twelfth hurricane of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season, Tomas developed from a tropical wave east of the Windward Islands on October 29. Quickly intensifying into a hurricane, it moved through the Windward Islands and passed over Saint Lucia. After reaching Category\u00a02 status on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale, Tomas quickly weakened to a tropical storm in the central Caribbean Sea, due to strong wind shear and dry air. Tomas later reintensified into a hurricane near the Windward passage. Along the hurricane's path, 44 fatalities occurred, 8 of whom were in Saint Lucia. In the wake of the storm in Haiti, flooding exacerbated a cholera outbreak, indirectly causing more fatalities. However, direct impacts from the hurricane in Haiti were less than anticipated. Overall damage from the storm was $463.4\u00a0million."

        "content": "A tropical wave exited the western coast of Africa on October 24.[1] It moved hastily westward across the tropical Atlantic at a comparatively low latitude, becoming embedded within the Intertropical Convergence Zone.[2][3] During this time the wave's structure retained a vigorous appearance;[1] the western portion contained scattered convection, with strong thunderstorms, as well as a broad area of rotating winds.[3] On October 27, when the system was about 1,200 miles (1,900\u00a0km) east-southeast of the Windward Islands, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) noted favorable atmospheric conditions for tropical cyclogenesis, namely light wind shear.[4] The wave and its expansive convection amplified over the next two days, featuring hints of spiraling rainbands.[1][5] A Hurricane Hunters aircraft investigating the disturbance on October 29 observed a developing circulation with tropical storm-force winds at sea level.[6] In light of those features, the NHC estimated that the system became a tropical depression by 06:00 UTC that day, about 460\u00a0mi (740\u00a0km) southeast of Barbados, and further upgraded it to Tropical Storm Tomas six hours later.[1][7] On its inception, Tomas turned toward the northwest and decelerated[1] within a region of low wind shear and high tropical moisture\u2014two of the prime prerequisites of rapid intensification. A misalignment between the cyclone's low- and upper-level circulations impeded this strengthening potential, however, and at that time the NHC did not expect Tomas to attain hurricane status until 36 to 48\u00a0hours later.[7] Steered along high pressure to its north, the storm retraced slightly west-northwestward on its approach to the Windward Islands.[1][8] Despite the prior forecasts of moderated strengthening, Tomas' winds sharply increased to 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) by late October 29;[9] moreover, the outflow aloft became well established in all quadrants as the convection consolidated into a prominent rain band.[10] The center of the intensifying storm crossed southern Barbados the next morning, around 09:00 UTC.[1] Radar images from Martinique soon revealed the formation of an eye-like feature;[8] Tomas attained hurricane status a couple of hours later, about 35 miles (56\u00a0km) east of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, after Hurricane Hunters recorded surface winds of 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h). By that time, the eye measured 35\u201346\u00a0mi (56\u201374\u00a0km) in diameter.[11] Tomas continued to strengthen through October 30 as it moved generally west- to west-northwestward. Around 20:00\u00a0UTC, the eye traversed the northern shores of Saint Vincent, while the northernmost ring of the severest winds skirted Saint Lucia.[1] Subsequent reports from Hurricane Hunters and post-storm reanalysis indicated that Tomas had reached a peak intensity with wind speeds of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 982 mbar (hPa; 29.00 inHg) during its trek across the islands, making it a Category\u00a02 on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale.[1][12] Although the NHC noted the potential for Tomas to become a major hurricane, the agency conversely observed that the hurricane had begun to suffer from southwesterly wind shear, which computer models forecast to increase in the long term.[12] On October 31, a combination of this shear and pockets of dry air dispersed the convection surrounding the eye, initiating a weakening trend.[13] Tomas diminished to a tropical storm early on November 1, when the strongest thunderstorms became dislocated from the low-level wind vortex by more than 115\u00a0mi (185\u00a0km).[1][14] Tomas meandered slightly south of west for a while, passing north of the ABC Islands overnight.[1][15] Although the upper wind regime relaxed into the next day, with an area of deep convection briefly reblossoming near Tomas' center,[15] the shear appeared to have already taken its toll on the storm. With an increasingly diffuse and elongated structure, Tomas further weakened to a tropical depression at 00:00\u00a0UTC, November 3, about 325 miles (523\u00a0km) southeast of Kingston, Jamaica.[1][16] Following its deterioration, Tomas diverged toward the northwest over the central Caribbean.[1] The circulation lost further definition, adjoining a wide stretch of low pressures spanning the western Caribbean. A Hurricane Hunters mission to determine whether Tomas retained its status as a tropical cyclone found that the mean low-level circulation had reformed to the northeast of the previous center. Tomas reattained tropical storm strength late on November 3,[17][18] and although the low- and mid-level centers were initially nonaligned, slow restrengthening ensued into the next day.[19] Tomas turned northward ahead of an unseasonably strong deep-layered trough, circumnavigating the western periphery of the subtropical ridge.[1][20] Over a six-hour period, the cyclone's core thunderstorm activity became much more concentrated, with a corresponding quick drop in central pressure.[21] While turning northeastward into the Windward Passage, Tomas regained hurricane status around 0600\u00a0UTC on November 5, just 36 miles (58\u00a0km) west-southwest of the western tip of Haiti.[1][22] Over the course of November 5, the hurricane accelerated northeastward in response to the approaching trough, passing right between eastern Cuba and western Haiti. Due to its proximity to land, the convection became disrupted near the center;[23] Tomas reweakened to a tropical storm near the Turks and Caicos Islands during a spell of moderate shear on November 6.[1] After moving through that island nation, Tomas briefly became a hurricane for a final time before hostile wind shear from the nearby trough fully began to take effect. In conjunction with increasingly dry air, the cyclone steadily weakened to a tropical storm on November 7. Tomas lost its tropical characteristics the next day, though it retained gale-force winds as an extratropical cyclone. It turned sharply eastward before curving northward, accelerated by a broad cyclonic steering flow over the western Atlantic the next couple of days. Tomas' extratropical remnant subsequently raced off into the north Atlantic, until it was absorbed by another extratropical system a few hundred miles south of Newfoundland, Canada, on November 11.[1]"

Additionally, a large Creole festival was canceled due to the storm.[28] Officials in Trinidad and Tobago closed beaches across the country.[29]\nIn St. Vincent, the National Emergency Management Organization (NEMO) issued advisories that a tropical system was approaching the country. The rapid intensification of Tomas caught many citizens in St. Vincent off guard. Early on October 30, the Prime Minister addressed the nation and informed the country of the situation it was facing. Following the west-southwesterly motion of the storm, swells generated by Tomas produced breaking waves on coastal sections of the ABC islands during the morning of November 1. Consequently, a small craft advisory was issued at 1415 UTC for all three islands.[30] In addition, a state of severe weather was declared for Bonaire and Cura\u00e7ao during the passage of Tomas.[31] In Haiti, the country which was devastated earlier in the year from a deadly January 12 earthquake, government officials began preparing for possible impact from Tomas by October 30. One United Nations spokesperson remarked that a hurricane strike would be \"the last thing Haiti needs\".[27] The Haitian government issued an orange storm alert, one level short of the highest state of alert, and warned for the possibility of winds, thunderstorms, and flooding.[28]"

Cura\u00e7ao experienced its most extreme rain event in 40\u00a0years; as many as 10.4 inches (260\u00a0mm) were recorded over a 24-hour period in the eastern part of the island.[42] The majority of the rain fell overnight in a heavy downpour, accompanied by a severe thunderstorm that triggered large-scale power, TV and radio outages.[43][44] Lightning strikes sparked three large fires in a major oil refinery in Willemstad. The fires inflicted severe damage to several tanks, estimated at US$10\u00a0million.[45] Flights from Cura\u00e7ao International Airport were delayed due to the hazardous conditions.[46] Following hours of heavy rainfall, widespread floods made most roads in the region impassable, with dozens of cars swept away or stranded.[43] The rains filled dams and overwhelmed drains, causing them to overflow and exacerbating the flooding.[47] The towns of Sali\u00f1a, Brievengat and Mahaai were among the hardest hit; hundreds of homes, gardens and businesses were inundated.[43][48] At the height of the rainstorm, a rescue worker assisting in the evacuation of a hospital was killed by the collapse of a wall. An elderly man suffering a heart attack drowned while unable to exit his flooded car.[49] Overall, Cura\u00e7ao suffered some of its worst flooding in history; insured losses across the island exceeded NA\u0192110\u00a0million (US$63\u00a0million), though total damage costs from Tomas were estimated at NA\u0192200\u00a0million (US$115\u00a0million).[50] Damage on the other two islands was much more limited. Parts of Bonaire experienced heavy but brief periods of rain, with a maximum of 3 inches (76\u00a0mm) at Flamingo International Airport, causing localized flooding of property.

In earthquake-ravaged Port-au-Prince, one of the largest refugee camps set up near the ruins of the capitol building was flooded following heavy rains.[52] By the evening of November 8, 20 people had been confirmed dead, 7 others were listed as missing and more than 30,000 people were in shelters.[53] Health workers also feared damage related to Tomas on the island could exacerbate the ongoing cholera outbreak.[54][55][56] Tomas passed just to the east of Cuba hours later, but no significant damage was reported on the island.[57] As the outer bands of Hurricane Tomas began to impact Cuba, Aero Caribbean Flight 883, an ATR-72-212 aircraft, crashed near the town of Guasimal in Sancti Sp\u00edritus province. All 68 people on board the plane were killed on impact. Although the plane was the last to leave the airport in Santiago de Cuba before it closed due to Tomas, it is unknown what role, if any, the storm played in the crash.[58][59] Following a review of the crash, it was determined that severe ice accumulation, at an altitude of 20,000\u00a0ft (6,100\u00a0m), along with errors by the crew caused the incident.[60]"

The system started out as a weak area of low pressure (an Aleutian Low), that formed in the northern Gulf of Alaska on October 7. Late on October 11, the system quickly absorbed Melor's remnant moisture, which resulted in the system strengthening significantly offshore, before moving southeastward to impact the West Coast of the United States, beginning very early on October 13.[7] Around the same time, an atmospheric river opened up (the Pineapple Express), channeling large amounts of moisture into the storm, resulting in heavy rainfall across California and other parts of the Western United States.

On October 12, the system began moving southeastward towards the West Coast of the United States, while slowly strengthening.[9] The system began moving ashore on October 13, part of the storm complex split off and accelerated eastward across the United States,[7] which ended up being absorbed by a nor'easter on October 15.[10] Soon after the initial split on October 13, the storm complex's low pressure center split, with the northern low quickly dominating the system.[11] Later on the same day, the storm complex reached a peak intensity of 966 millibars (28.5\u00a0inHg), even as the system began looping back northwestwards, towards the Gulf of Alaska.[3] On October 14, the storm system continued to looped back northwestward while weakening, but another part of the storm split off from the main system, which headed westward across the northern states.[12] The two main lows merged again, even as the eastern chunk of moisture continued to accelerate eastward across the U.S., reaching the Central United States.[13] On October 15, the eastern chunk of moisture began exiting the Northeastern United States, while the main system continued to move northwestward in the Gulf of Alaska, weakening into a 988 mbar storm.[10] On October 17, the main low stalled just south of Alaska, while steadily weakening, even as the eastern chunk of moisture began a well-defined extratropical cyclone off the coast of Nova Scotia.[14] On October 18, the storm system moved to the south of Alaska, and absorbed a weak low to the south of the system, while the former eastern chunk of the system began to accelerate northeastward into the Labrador Sea,[15] and received the name Yannick from the Free University of Berlin.[16] On October 19, the central low of the storm system stalled just south of Alaska once again, and rapidly weakened to a disorganized 1010 mbar system.[17] On October 20, the main system was absorbed by another powerful extratropical cyclone in the Gulf of Alaska, to the west of the system.[2] On October 20, Windstorm Yannick reached a minimum low pressure of 970\u00a0mbar (29\u00a0inHg), while south of Iceland.[18] During the next two days, Yannick slowly moved northeastward, while steadily weakening. On October 23, Yannick split into 2 storms just northeast of Ireland, with the main system weakening into a 980 mbar storm.[19] On October 24, Yannick was absorbed by another approaching extratropical cyclone from the east.[20]"

        "content": "The storm system, which was powered by the remnants of Melor, became one of the most intense storms to impact the state of California during October on record. Numerous locations recorded rainfall in excess of 10\u00a0in (250\u00a0mm) in a 24-hour span, with a maximum of 21.34\u00a0in (542\u00a0mm) falling at Mining Ridge, Monterey County.[21] This amount surpassed the previous rainfall record from a tropical cyclone or its remnants in the state by nearly 7\u00a0in (180\u00a0mm). Hurricane Kathleen in 1976 held the record prior to Melor, producing a maximum of 14.76\u00a0in (375\u00a0mm) at San Gorgonio Mountain.[22] In San Francisco, an all-time record was set of 2.49\u00a0in (63\u00a0mm) in a 24-hour span, greater than any other total since records began in 1849. At higher elevations, significant amounts of snow fell; exact totals are not known, but estimated to be at least several feet. Strong winds also accompanied the record rainfall. Hurricane-force wind gusts, recorded up to 87\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h), were associated with Melor's remnants. Similar winds were likely felt in higher elevations, resulting in blizzard conditions. Although the rainfall was record-breaking, it significantly helped to alleviate one of California's worst droughts on record, spanning several years.[21] Rainfall from the storm system also helped extinguish several wildfires that were burning in California at that time, including the large Station Fire. At San Marcos Pass, rainfall from the storm surpassed the all-time record October rainfall in a single day, with 10.31\u00a0in (262\u00a0mm) falling at the pass.[23] In areas near San Francisco, hundreds of car accidents occurred due to wet roads and high winds. On the Richmond Bridge, a tractor-trailer was blown on its side, landing on a passing car; however, the two passengers of the car and the truck driver were uninjured. This accident resulted in all east-bound lanes on the bridge being shut down from 3:00\u00a0pm to 5:30\u00a0pm. The California Highway Patrol stated that they received over 3,000 calls during the first half of the day concerning accidents, against the normal 1,000 calls during an entire day without rain. A crash in the Caldecott Tunnel, requiring emergency repairs to the structure, led to a temporary closure and creating more traffic issues. A three car collision on state Highway 1 resulted in the death of one person. The section of the highway near the crash was shut down for near four hours also. Over 200 accidents occurred throughout the day around San Francisco due to the storm.[24] Throughout the Santa Cruz Mountains, several roads were closed due to flooding. Along Swanton Road, emergency officials issued a mandatory evacuation of 60 residents due to the flooding. Schools in San Lorenzo Valley were closed for the day due to the rising waters. Some residents were trapped by waters reaching a depth of 6\u00a0ft (1.8\u00a0m), leading to emergency rescues. High winds resulted in major air traffic delays, with officials noting average delays of three or more hours.[24] At the height of the storm, more than 35,000 residences were without power initially due to heavy rain; however, wind eventually worsened power issues, as branches began to fall on power lines. A transmission emergency was declared on the evening of October\u00a012 as a 500,000 volt power line was blown down.[24] In northern portions of the state, winds exceeding 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) left hundreds of thousands of people without power and sparked several power line fires. The storm was described as \"just phenomenal\" by meteorologists.[25] In response to the storm, flood disaster agencies allocated 20,000 sandbags for immediate deployment. All state and emergency operation centers in the state were activated on October\u00a014, and support from electric companies in Arizona and Nevada was received to assist in power restoration.[26] In California, the storm caused a total of at least $8.856 million (2009 USD) in damages, including $300,000 in agricultural damage.[4]"

Maximum rainfall associated with the system was around 1\u00a0in (25\u00a0mm), making the remnants of Melor the third known tropical cyclone, or remnants of a cyclone, to impact state.[22][27] Minor effects were recorded in terms of damage: one rockslide took place on Highway 101 and large swells affected the coastline.[27] In mountainous areas of Nevada, the storm produced upwards of 1\u00a0ft (0.30\u00a0m) of snow and winds over 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h). Several accidents took place on slick roadways during the storm; however, no fatalities or major injuries were reported. The highest winds were at the peaks of the Sierra mountains, which reached 135\u00a0mph (217\u00a0km/h), equivalent to a strong Category 4 hurricane. At least 2\u00a0in (51\u00a0mm) of rain fell along the foothills of the mountains, making the remnants of Melor one of the wettest former tropical cyclones to impact the state of Nevada.[22][28] In Minnesota, a region rarely affected by the remnants of tropical cyclones,[29] the jet stream carried moisture from the system into the state, causing the region to receive moderate rainfall from the storm system. On October\u00a014 and 15, moisture from the storm affected the state, with estimated rainfall totals peaking at 0.85\u00a0in (22\u00a0mm).[30] Heavy snow fell in parts of Pennsylvania between October 15 and 16. State College, Pennsylvania saw ten inches (25.4\u00a0cm) of wet snow, causing a very memorable Penn State homecoming game, and breaking numerous records, such as earliest recorded snowfall, most severe October snowstorm, and most snow in the month of October. Moderate snow fell between October 15 and 18 in the Northeastern United States, as far as the suburbs of New York City, with light snow being reported in the city itself. In Walpack, New Jersey, temperatures during the system dropped to 25\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22124\u00a0\u00b0C).[31] Boston suburbs saw moderate, wet snow fall on the morning of October 16, in spots accumulating up to 0.5 inches (1.3\u00a0cm). The area was then hit on October 18, when in the afternoon, heavy rain turned to heavy snow and almost white-out conditions. The ground was too warm for any significant accumulation, but up to 2 inches (5.1\u00a0cm) were reported at spots between Boston and Lowell. All of the snow melted by October 20.[citation needed]"

A long-lived Cape Verde hurricane, David was the fourth named storm, second hurricane, and first major hurricane of the 1979 Atlantic hurricane season. David formed on August\u00a025, in the eastern tropical Atlantic Ocean near Cape Verde off the coast of West Africa. Two days later, the storm reached hurricane strength, then underwent rapid intensification, strengthening into a Category\u00a05 hurricane and reaching peak sustained winds of 175\u00a0mph (282\u00a0km/h) on August\u00a028. By the time the system dissipated on September\u00a08, it had traversed the Leeward Islands, Greater Antilles, The Bahamas, the East Coast of the United States, and Atlantic Canada. David was the first hurricane to affect the Lesser Antilles since Hurricane Inez in 1966. With winds of 175\u00a0mph (282\u00a0km/h), David was one of only 2 storms of Category\u00a05 intensity to make landfall on the Dominican Republic in the 20th century, the other also being Inez, and the deadliest since the 1930 San Zen\u00f3n hurricane, killing over 2,000\u00a0people in its path. In addition, David was the deadliest tropical cyclone to hit the island of Dominica since the 1834 Padre Ru\u00edz hurricane, which killed over 200 people.[1]"

Becoming a hurricane on August 27, it moved west-northwestward before entering a period of rapid intensification which brought it to an intensity of 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h) on August 28. Slight fluctuations in intensity occurred before the hurricane ravaged the tiny windward Island of Dominica on the following day.[3] David continued west-northwest, and intensified into a Category\u00a05 hurricane in the northeast Caribbean Sea, reaching peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 175\u00a0mph (282\u00a0km/h) and minimum central pressure of 924\u00a0mbar (27.3\u00a0inHg) on August\u00a030. An upper-level trough pulled David northward into Hispaniola as a Category\u00a05 hurricane on the August 31. The eye passed almost directly over Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic. David crossed over the island and emerged as a weak hurricane after drenching the islands.[3] After crossing the Windward Passage, David struck eastern Cuba as a minimal hurricane on September\u00a01. It weakened to a tropical storm over land, but quickly re-strengthened as it again reached open waters. David turned to the northwest along the western periphery of the subtropical ridge, and re-intensified to a Category\u00a02 hurricane while over the Bahamas, where it caused heavy damage. Despite initial forecasts of a projected landfall in Miami, Florida, the hurricane turned to the north-northwest just before landfall to strike near West Palm Beach, Florida, on September\u00a03. It paralleled the Florida coastline just inland until emerging into the western Atlantic Ocean at New Smyrna Beach, Florida, later on September\u00a03. David continued to the north-northwest, and made its final landfall just south of Savannah, Georgia, as a minimal hurricane with 80 miles per hour (130\u00a0km/h) winds on September\u00a05. It turned to the northeast while weakening over land, and became extratropical on September\u00a06 over New York. As an extratropical storm, David continued to the northeast over New England and the Canadian Maritimes.[3] David intensified once more as it crossed the far north Atlantic, clipping northwestern Iceland before moving eastward well north of the Faroe Islands on September\u00a010.[4]"

However, on August 29 a turn in the hours before moving through the area caused the 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h) hurricane to make a direct hit on the southern part of Dominica.[5] Even as it became increasingly clear that David was headed for the island, residents did not appear to take the situation seriously. This can be partly attributed to the fact that local radio warnings were minimal and disaster preparedness schemes were essentially non-existent. Furthermore, Dominica had not experienced a major hurricane since 1930, thus leading to complacency amongst much of the population. This proved to have disastrous consequences for the island nation.[5][6] Some 400,000\u00a0people evacuated in the United States in anticipation of David,[3] including 300,000\u00a0people in southeastern Florida due to a predicted landfall between the Florida Keys and Palm Beach. Of those, 78,000\u00a0fled to shelters, while others either stayed at a friend's house further inland or traveled northward.

Strong winds from Hurricane David destroyed or damaged 80\u00a0percent of the homes (mostly wood) on the island,[6] leaving 75 percent of the population homeless,[9] with many others temporarily homeless in the immediate aftermath.[5] In addition, the rainfall turned rivers into torrents, sweeping away everything in their path to the sea.[6] Power lines were completely ripped out, causing the water system to stop as well. Most severely damaged was the agricultural industry. The worst loss in agriculture was from bananas and coconuts, of which about 75 percent of the crop was destroyed.[9] Banana fields were completely destroyed, and in the southern portion of the island most coconut trees were blown down. Citrus trees fared better, due to the small yet sturdy nature of the trees.[5] In addition, David's winds uprooted many trees on the tops of mountains, leaving them bare and damaging the ecosystem by disrupting the water levels.[6] In all, 56\u00a0people died in Dominica and 180 were injured.[3][9] Property and agricultural damage figures in Dominica are unknown.[3]"

At the height of the storm, up to 50,000\u00a0people in Broward and Miami-Dade County (then Dade County) lost electricity due to downed and damaged power lines. Storm surge and abnormally high tides caused significant erosion damage to State Road A1A in the vicinity of Sunrise Boulevard in Fort Lauderdale.[16] Four fatalities occurred in Broward County, two directly and two indirectly.[17] In Palm Beach County, sustained winds peaked at 58\u00a0mph (93\u00a0km/h) at the Palm Beach International Airport and wind gusts reached up to 92\u00a0mph (148\u00a0km/h) in Jupiter. Winds shattered windows in stores near the coast and caused some property damage, including blowing the frame off the Palm Beach Jai alai fronton in Mangonia Park and downing the 186-ft (57-m) WJNO AM radio tower in West Palm Beach into the Intracoastal Waterway.[7] Around 70,000\u00a0people in or near West Palm Beach lost electricity after falling trees downed around one-third of Florida Power & Light's main feeder lines.[18] Abnormally high tides damaged docks and piers,[7] while also flooding portions of South Ocean Boulevard between Lake Worth and Lantana. In Palm Beach, several boats moored in the Lake Worth Lagoon capsized.[18] Damage in the county totaled approximately $30\u00a0million, most of it incurred to crops.[7] Farther north, the storm deroofed a few structures and flooded some buildings in the Treasure Coast, including the Stuart City Hall. A 450-ft (140-m) crane was snapped in two at the St. Lucie Nuclear Power Plant.[7] In Vero Beach, a tornado caused major damage to a restaurant and deroofed a condominium and apartment building.[19]:\u200a3\u200a Some clapboard-style homes in the county suffered major damage, especially in Gifford and other low income communities. Heavy rains inundated portions of State Road 60 with up to 4\u00a0ft (1.2\u00a0m) of water between Interstate 95 and Yeehaw Junction because the St. Johns River marsh had difficulty draining.[20] Two tornadoes in Brevard County caused damage. The first twister severely impacted or destroyed about 50\u00a0mobile homes and a condominium complex in Melbourne Beach and a shopping center in Palm Bay after crossing the Indian River. The shopping center alone sustained about $1.5\u00a0million in damage. Another tornado was spawned in Cocoa, damaging a few roofs.[19]:\u200a3"

Its inner core remained away from major cities, though Savannah recorded sustained winds of 58\u00a0mph (93\u00a0km/h) and wind gusts of 68\u00a0mph (109\u00a0km/h).[3] Although no major damage occurred in Savannah,[21] high winds downed numerous power lines, leaving approximately 70,000\u00a0electrical customers without power,[22]:\u200a14\u200a some for up to two weeks after the storm.[23] Many trees were downed along downtown streets.[24] Tybee Island and its vicinity may have experienced hurricane-force wind gusts.[22]:\u200a14\u200a Several homes on the island were partially deroofed.[24]  In Darien, the storm severely damaged a nursing home, flooded some streets, and downed tree limbs.[25] Offshore, strong seas disrupted a portion of the coastal reef by moving a sunken ship 300\u00a0ft (91\u00a0m).[26] Tides produced by the storm also inundated the Jekyll Island Causeway and the F.J. Torras Causeway, which links Brunswick to St. Simons Island. Overall, David was responsible for approximately $5\u00a0million in damage in Georgia, much of it in Chatham County, while two people drowned at Jekyll Island due to heavy surf.[22]:\u200a14"

The first such twister, spawned in Georgetown, demolished five beachfront homes and severely damaged eight other homes and a condominium complex. A tornado touched down in North Myrtle Beach destroyed a few roofs and caused damage to utilities. Minutes later, a second tornado in the city demolished some fishing piers, substantial damaged several dwellings and a motels, and ignited a few fires, which destroyed a condominium complex. A third tornado in North Myrtle Beach caused some degree of roof damage to about 80\u00a0percent of oceanfront homes in the Windy Hill Beach section of the city. The twister also demolished three piers and a motel. David caused approximately $10\u00a0million in damage in South Carolina.[19]:\u200a10 Similar winds occurred in North Carolina, and lesser readings were recorded throughout the northeastern United States, excluding a 174\u00a0mph (280\u00a0km/h) wind gust on Mount Washington in New Hampshire. In addition, David dropped heavy rainfall along its path, peaking at 10.73\u00a0in (273\u00a0mm) in Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, with widespread reports of over 5\u00a0in (130\u00a0mm). Storm surge was moderate, peaking at 8.8\u00a0ft (2.7\u00a0m) in Charleston and up to 5\u00a0ft (1.5\u00a0m) along much of the eastern United States coastline.[3] Overall, damage was light in most areas, though it was very widespread. High winds and rain downed power lines in the New York City area, leaving 2.5\u00a0million people without electricity during the storm's passage. Had David not taken an unexpected very late turn, it would have likely toppled the Citicorp Building (53rd and Lexington), which was in the process of being fortified because the building could not withstand hurricane-level winds; a major tragedy affecting a square mile of Midtown Manhattan (including Grand Central Station, the UN, and Rockefeller Center), was avoided.[3] David also caused minor to moderate beach erosion, as well as widespread crop damage from the flooding.[27] In addition, the hurricane spawned numerous tornadoes while moving through the Mid-Atlantic and New England, with associated prominent wind damage occurring even in inland communities.[28] In Virginia eight tornadoes formed across the southeastern portion of the state, of which six were F2's or greater on the Fujita scale, including two rated F3 in Fairfax County and Newport News. The tornadoes caused 1\u00a0death, 19\u00a0injuries, damaged 270\u00a0homes, and destroyed 3\u00a0homes, amounting to $6\u00a0million in damage. In Maryland, David's outer bands formed seven tornadoes,[29] including an F2 in Kingsville.[30] In New Castle County, Delaware, an F2 tornado damaged numerous homes and injured five.[31]"

A citizen named Fred White ended that by using a battery-operated ham radio to contact the world.[5] In response to the severe agricultural damage, the government initiated a food ration. By two months after the storm, assistance pledges amounted to over $37\u00a0million from various groups around the world. Similar to the aftermath of other natural disasters, the distribution of the aid raised concerns and accusations over the amount of food and material, or lack thereof, for the affected citizens.[5] The Hurricane destroyed some important landmarks, including a significant part of the ruins of the Fort Young which had stood since the 1770s.[32] The looting was practiced in supermarkets, seaports, and homes; what was not destroyed by the hurricanes was stolen in the weeks after the storm.[6] The destroyer HMS\u00a0Fife\u00a0(D20) was on its way back to the United Kingdom when the hurricane struck, and was turned back to provide emergency aid to the island. Sailing through mountainous seas, Fife docked in the main harbor at Roseau without assistance, and was the only outside help for several days. The crew provided work details and medical parties to offer assistance to the island and concentrated on the hospital buildings, the airstrip, and restoring power and water. The ship's helicopter (called Humphrey) took medical aid into the hills to assist people who were cut off from getting to other help by fallen trees. The ship also used its radio systems to broadcast news and music to the island to inform the population of what was being done and how to get assistance. This was the first time a Royal Navy ship had provided a public broadcast news service.[citation needed]"

Tropical Storm Frederic struck the Dominican Republic only about a week after David, exacerbating recovery efforts. In September\u00a01979, the Civil Defense Secretariat of the Dominican Republic provided assistance to approximately 1.8\u00a0million people via international organizations such as Care International (CARE), the Catholic Relief Services (CRS), the Church World Service (CWS), and the Peace Corps. Prior to David, these organizations had staged over 16,500,000\u00a0lb (7,500,000\u00a0kg) of P.L. 480 food commodities, which suffered little damage from the storm. CARE and CRS distributed an additional 20,003,000\u00a0lb (9,073\u00a0t) of P.L. 480 food commodities between October 1979 and September 1980. The Civil Defense Secretariat also ordered nearly all privately owned construction equipment be used to clear blocked roadways. Approximately 500,000 sheets galvanized roofing, manufactured locally, was purchased by the government of the Dominican Republic. Within two months, the National Housing Institute and private firms repaired over 12,000\u00a0homes. The Secretariat of Agriculture provided assistance with replanting 60\u201390-day crops. Businesses, non-governmental organizations, and volunteers within the Dominican Republic also contributed significantly, providing construction materials and bedding, clothing, and shoes. Thousands of family-sized food parcels were packed by volunteered and shipped to devastated areas.[33] The United Nations and intergovernmental organizations, including the European Economic Community, Food and Agriculture Organization, Inter-American Development Bank, Organization of American States, Pan American Health Organization, United Nations Development Programme, United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, United Nations Children's Fund, World Food Programme, and World Bank, provided more than $139.2\u00a0million in material and monetary donations.[33] Cash donations and relief supplies were contributed from Red Cross agencies throughout the world, including from Australia, the Bahamas, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Honduras, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Monaco, New Zealand, Norway, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Yugoslavia. Additionally France's M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res and Action d'urgence internationale and the United Kingdom's Oxfam also provided money and supplies. Overall, contributions from these non-governmental organizations totaled nearly $203.13\u00a0million.[33] The United States Congress and president Jimmy Carter approved legislation appropriating $15\u00a0million in aid to the Dominican Republic. By 1980, the United States government contributed funds and materials with a monetary value totaling just over $10.1\u00a0million. Aside from CARE, CRS, and CWS, non-governmental organizations based in the United States with significant donations of funds and supplies were the American Institute for Free Labor Development, Assemblies of God, Baptist World Alliance, Brother's Brother Foundation, Catholic Medical Mission Board, Compassion International, Direct Relief, Lutheran World Relief, MAP International, Michigan Partners of the Americas, Missionary Enterprises, Redemptorists (Baltimore Province), Roman Catholic Episcopate of Puerto Rico, Salesians of St. John Bosco, Salvation Army, Save the Children USA, Seventh-day Adventist World Service, Sister Cities International, Southern Baptist Convention, World Relief, and World Vision International. These organizations combined gave over $2.5\u00a0million in aid.

Because of this, then NHC Director Neil Frank was accused of overly stirring up panic before the arrival of David. Two local psychiatrists even claimed that the experience would make residents more complacent towards future storms. However, the NHC defended their methods, with Frank stating: \"If we hadn't [raised public alarm] and our predictions had been more accurate, the consequences would have been disastrous.\"[7]\nOne reporter who covered Hurricane David was Dick Baumbach, a journalist with TODAY newspaper, now known as Florida Today. He along with news photographer Scott Maclay followed the path of the hurricane from Miami to Central Florida. In Cocoa Beach, Baumbach decided to ride out the hurricane in his home with two other journalists. While it was a difficult and trying experience, all three reporters survived and ended up winning numerous awards.[15] The hurricane also interrupted the filming of the movie Caddyshack that was taking place at the Rolling Hills Country Club in Fort Lauderdale.[34]"

        "content": " Hurricane Idalia was a powerful and destructive Category\u00a04 hurricane that caused significant damage across parts of the southeastern United States, especially in North Florida, in late August 2023. The ninth named storm,[a] third hurricane, and second major hurricane of the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season, Idalia formed from a low-pressure area that crossed Central America from the eastern Pacific Ocean. Gradual development ensued as it meandered in the western part of the Caribbean Sea; the system was upgraded to a tropical depression on August 26, 2023, and strengthened into a tropical storm a day later, receiving the name Idalia. It traversed the Gulf of Mexico where it underwent rapid intensification, briefly becoming a Category\u00a04 hurricane before making landfall in the Big Bend region of Florida as a low-end Category\u00a03 hurricane on August\u00a030. Idalia remained a hurricane as it moved through Northern Florida and crossed into Southeast Georgia; it then pushed into the Carolinas as a tropical storm. On August\u00a031, Idalia emerged into the Atlantic, where it transitioned into a post-tropical cyclone that same day. Later, it passed south of Bermuda, made a counterclockwise loop, then meandered off the coast of Nova Scotia while winding down. Idalia caused significant damage to thousands of homes, businesses, and other infrastructure along its inland path, primarily in Florida, where winds and the resulting floodwaters were highest. Its storm surge was record-breaking from the Big Bend region south to Tampa Bay. In Tampa Bay roads were flooded over, and high waters submerged hundreds of cars. The system also spawned a tornado outbreak with around 12 confirmed tornadoes. Idalia was the most powerful hurricane to hit Florida's Big Bend region since Hurricane Easy in 1950.[1] Five people died in storm-related incidents in the two states. The NCEI claims that Hurricane Idalia did $3.5\u00a0billion in damages. The hurricane's remnants produced dangerous rip currents across the Eastern United States during Labor Day Weekend, resulting in several additional deaths and numerous rescues."

        "content": "On August\u00a024, 2023, a trough of low pressure formed in the Eastern Pacific basin offshore of the Central America coast.[3] The disturbance crossed over into the Atlantic basin the following day, and began to organize as it moved northward through the western Caribbean Sea. The pace of organization quickened on August\u00a026, while the disturbance was located near the northeastern Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, and at 21:00\u00a0UTC it was upgraded to Tropical Depression Ten.[4] Later that day, and into the next, the depression drifted due to weak surrounding steering currents, with its center moving in a small counterclockwise loop.[5][6] The depression became Tropical Storm Idalia at 15:15\u00a0UTC on August\u00a027, after a NOAA Hurricane Hunters flight reported that the storm's winds had increased to 40\u00a0mph (65\u00a0km/h).[7] Early the next morning, Idalia began moving northward[8] toward the Yucat\u00e1n Channel west of Cuba, intensifying along the way despite being impacted by moderate northwesterly wind shear.[9] By 09:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a029, after passing near the western tip of Cuba, Idalia had developed an inner core and almost complete eyewall and the NHC upgraded the storm to a Category\u00a01 hurricane.[10] Later that day, Idalia began to rapidly intensify, reaching Category\u00a02 strength[11] as it benefited from exceptional conditions, with sea-surface temperatures of 88\u00a0\u00b0F (31\u00a0\u00b0C), generally low wind shear, and high relative humidity levels.[12] Idalia continued to rapidly intensify as it accelerated northward off the Florida Suncoast and approached the Big Bend region, reaching its peak intensity of Category\u00a04 strength on the morning of August\u00a030, a few hours prior to landfall, with maximum sustained winds of 130\u00a0mph (215\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 940\u00a0mbar (27.76\u00a0inHg).[1] This marked a wind increase of 55\u00a0mph (89\u00a0km/h) during the 24\u00a0hour period ending at 09:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a030, making it one of fastest rates of tropical cyclone intensification ever observed in the Atlantic basin 24\u00a0hours before landfall. At its peak, the NHC described the system as having \"a small eye surrounded by very cold clouds tops, especially in the western quadrant\".[13] Idalia's intensification was then halted by an eyewall replacement cycle, which caused it to weaken slightly prior to landfall.[14] Idalia made landfall at 11:45\u00a0UTC, about 20 miles (30\u00a0km) south of Perry, Florida, as a Category\u00a03 hurricane, with sustained winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 950\u00a0mbar (28.05\u00a0inHg).[1] The system quickly weakened inland as it pushed through North Florida, becoming a tropical storm later that day after crossing into Georgia.[15][16] Strong southwesterly wind shear then pushed the storm's convection well north and east of its center as it moved off the northeastern South Carolina coast and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean on the morning of August\u00a031.[17] That afternoon, Idalia transitioned into a post-tropical cyclone about 65 miles (105\u00a0km) southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina.[18] As the storm moved to the east-southeast the following day, light wind shear along its path enabled the system to maintain its structure and intensity despite the lack of convection.[19] The storm impacted Bermuda with tropical-storm-force winds on September\u00a02, as it passed just to the south. Idalia's remnant low then absorbed Tropical Storm Gert on September\u00a04[20] and lingered off the coast of Atlantic Canada for several days, before dissipating on September\u00a08.[21]"

On September\u00a04, Moody's Analytics reported private insured losses at $3\u20135\u00a0billion with a \"best estimate\" of $3.5\u00a0billion. They indicated losses attached to the National Flood Insurance Program would reach $500\u00a0million. Verisk Analytics placed the same metric at $2.5\u20134\u00a0billion. Karen Clark & Co. estimated losses at $2.2\u00a0billion on September\u00a01.[69] Of this, $2\u00a0billion was from wind-related damage and $210\u00a0million from storm surge.[70] Regularly improving building codes across Florida are attributed with lesser damage as structures are more able to withstand the effects of hurricanes. Homes built on stilts and with properly secured roofs suffered minimal damage while older structures were severely affected.[71] At least twelve people were killed in incidents related to the hurricane: four in Florida, three in New Jersey and North Carolina, and one each in Delaware and Georgia.[1][72][73][74][75][76][77][78][79]"

While flamingos are native to South Florida, they have not existed in significant numbers since the 19th century, when hunting drove them out of the state, but according to Audubon who conducted a census on the flamingo population in February, finding 101 birds, they have a chance to reassert themselves in Florida.[123][124][125]"

        "content": "  Hurricane Debby was a slow-moving and erratic Category 1 hurricane that caused widespread flooding across the Southeastern United States in early August 2024. The fourth named storm and second hurricane of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, Debby developed from a tropical wave that was first noted by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) on July\u00a026. After crossing the Greater Antilles, the system began to organize over Cuba and was designated a potential tropical cyclone on August\u00a02. After exiting off the southern coast of Cuba, the disturbance organized into a tropical depression early on August\u00a03. Later that day, it became a tropical storm in the Florida Straits, being named Debby. It moved northwards and gradually intensified into a Category\u00a01 hurricane before making landfall near Steinhatchee, Florida, early on August 5. Debby weakened once inland and began to slow down over the Southeastern United States, causing widespread flooding from heavy rain. It re-emerged in the Atlantic on August\u00a07 before slowly moving northwards again, making landfall in South Carolina early on August\u00a08 before weakening and becoming post-tropical the next day. States of emergency were declared for the states of Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia ahead of the storm. Heavy rains fell as a result of the storm moving slowly, with accumulations peaking near 20 inches (510\u00a0mm) of rain near Sarasota, Florida as of August\u00a07. Two dozen tornadoes were confirmed as the storm also moved up the East coast of the United States. Ten fatalities have been attributed to the storm, and preliminary damage reports are estimated to $1\u20132 billion.[3]"

        "content": "The National Hurricane Center (NHC) began to monitor a tropical wave over the tropical Atlantic for potential tropical cyclogenesis at 18:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a026, as it moved eastward towards the Lesser Antilles and Greater Antilles.[4] As the disturbance moved westward it crossed over the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico,[5] and Hispaniola, becoming increasingly defined by August\u00a01.[6] As the system moved over southeastern Cuba, it developed a broad circulation center and disorganized convective bands. Due to the potential threat of the storm to Florida, the NHC designated it as Potential Tropical Cyclone Four at 15:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a02.[7] after that, the disturbance moved off the southern coast of Cuba and formed a closed circulation, allowing the NHC to upgrade and designate it as Tropical Depression Four at 03:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a03.[8] The depression than crossed over the western part of Cuba and entered the Gulf of Mexico, where it further intensified into Tropical Storm Debby later on August\u00a03.[9] Debby was a large system with a small core, initially inhibiting its ability to develop rapidly.[10] Despite that, it continued to organize as it traversed the Gulf; though, intruding dry air slightly hindered development.[11] As a result, late on August\u00a04, Debby intensified into a hurricane.[12] Turning northeastwards slightly in response to a trough in the Northeastern United States, Debby approached the Big Bend area as it peaked with sustained winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 979 millibars (28.9\u00a0inHg) early on August\u00a05.[13] At 11:00\u00a0UTC that day, it made landfall in the Big Bend region near Steinhatchee, Florida.[14] Tracking inland, just a few hours later, Debby weakened into a tropical storm.[15] The forward speed of the cyclone began to slow as the aforementioned trough moved off shore and left Debby in light steering currents.[16] Debby moved offshore the coast of Georgia early on August\u00a06 as a weak tropical storm, but eventually strengthened slightly to a secondary peak of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) as its broad nature prevented much in the way of intensification. Turning slowly northwards again by late on August\u00a07, Debby made landfall again near Bulls Bay, South Carolina, at 05:45 UTC on\u00a0August\u00a08.[17] Steadily weakening once inland, later that day, Debby weakened into a tropical depression, causing the NHC to pass responsibility for warnings to the Weather Prediction Center (WPC).[18] Early the next day, Debby became a post-tropical cyclone.[19] The remnants of Debby moved into Canada on August\u00a010.[20]"

This was after heavy rains fell in the region from August\u00a06\u20137.[107] Heavy rainfall prompted flash flood emergencies for several towns in Steuben and Allegany counties in New York, where over 4\u00a0in (100\u00a0mm) of rain fell; those same alerts extended into Westfield, Pennsylvania as well. In addition, multiple impassable roadways were reported in Binghamton, New York.[108] A high-end EF1 tornado struck the eastern part of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, severely damaging structures and knocking down trees.[109] Another EF0 tornado uprooted trees near New Paltz, New York as well.[87] Significant flooding also occurred in northeast Ohio, as an outer rain band associated with Debby dumped over 7\u00a0in (180\u00a0mm) of rain in just three hours.[110][111] This caused the Cuyahoga River to flood and prompted a closure of I-76 near Barberton due to high water.[112] On Long Island, tropical moisture enhanced by Debby resulted in flooding on August\u00a06, with over 4\u00a0in (100\u00a0mm) of rain falling down. Three days later, when the actual storm crossed through, winds gusted to 46\u00a0mph (74\u00a0km/h) in Islip.[113] LaGuardia Airport imposed a ground stop during the storm.[114] Flight cancellations reached 227 at LaGuardia, 174 at Newark Liberty International Airport and 173 at John F. Kennedy International Airport. Rail service was suspended on portions of Metro-North Railroad and on the Morris & Essex Lines.[115] As the remnants of Debby passed through the inner United States on August\u00a010, portions of the New England coastal region faced dangerous rip currents and swells, with the entire coastlines of Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island being issued a rip current statement by the National Weather Service.[116] A tornado watch was issued in Litchfield County and Hartford County in Connecticut. Multiple trees were downed in Greenwich. Over 9,000 people were left without power in the state.[117][118] In Vermont, winds of 60 miles per hour (97\u00a0km/h) affected the state. In Alburgh, a large tree was knocked down and into a house, with the fire department needing to rescue 3 people.[119] Owners of shops used sandbags and plastic to protect their businesses from the rainfall. Governor Phil Scott placed a Federal Emergency Declaration in the state prior to the arrival of Debby's remnants.[120] By August\u00a010, over 170,000 people were still left without power across Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, and Vermont.[20]"

        "content": " Hurricane Bonnie was a strong tropical cyclone that survived the crossover from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean, the first to do so since Hurricane Otto in 2016.[3] The second named storm of the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season, it originated from a strong tropical wave that moved off the west coast of Africa on June 23. Moving with little development despite favorable conditions, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) started advisories on it as Potential Tropical Cyclone Two late on June 27, due to its imminent threat to land. The disturbance finally organized into Tropical Storm Bonnie at 13:15 UTC on July 1, and made brief landfalls on the Costa Rica\u2013Nicaragua border with winds of  50 miles per hour (80\u00a0km/h). It later became the fourth named storm, third hurricane, and first major hurricane of the 2022 Pacific hurricane season after crossing Nicaragua and Costa Rica from east to west on July 2 and intensifying to a Category 3 hurricane on July 5. Bonnie rapidly weakened, dissipating over the North Pacific. Bonnie was the first of two tropical cyclones in 2022 to cross from the Atlantic to the Pacific, the second being Hurricane Julia. At least 3,572 individuals were evacuated in Costa Rica. Heavy rains led to flooding and numerous mudslides, with 40 homes flooded in Trinidad and Tobago. A total of 5 people were killed, and damage was estimated at $25\u00a0million.[2][1]"

        "content": "Hurricane Bonnie's origins can be traced to a tropical wave that emerged off the west coast of Africa on June 23, tracked by the NHC.[4] By June 25, the wave had become better defined: its limited shower and thunderstorm activity increased as it moved to the west-northwest toward the southernmost Windward Islands.[5][6] Due to the threat the disturbance posed to the Windward Islands, it was designated as Potential Tropical Cyclone Two at 21:00 UTC on June 27.[7] Around this time, NOAA Hurricane Hunters reconnaissance aircraft found an area of tropical storm-force winds, despite not finding a closed circulation.[7] As the system approached the Windward Islands, the mid-level circulation was displaced and convection was disoriented onto an east\u2013west line.[8] As it crossed the Windward Islands on the morning of June 29, the disturbance appeared like a tropical cyclone on conventional satellite data, displaying large bursts of convection near the center and prominent rainbands, speeding westward at 23 knots (26\u00a0mph; 43\u00a0km/h). However, observations from microwave data still displayed the wave as lacking a well-defined center or low-level structure.[9] The disturbance then moved along the ABC Islands and northern coast of South America, producing heavy rainfall throughout the region from spiral rainbands.[10] It then crossed the Guajira Peninsula of South America around 09:00 UTC on June 30. During and after this, the mid-levels of the disturbance became better defined,[11] deep convection associated with the system persisted,[12] and Air Force Hurricane Hunter reconnaissance data confirmed that the circulation had become well-defined.[13] Hence, the disturbance became a tropical storm, receiving the name Bonnie on July 1 at 13:15 UTC.[14] According to satellite imagery, the storm became better organized with deeper convection at the center.[15] At 03:00 UTC on July 2, Bonnie made landfall just south of the Costa Rican border with Nicaragua.[16] At the time, it had sustained winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h).[17] Following landfall, Bonnie moved through Central America, with the coldest clouds over the center.[18] At 15:00 UTC on July 2, Bonnie crossed over into the Pacific basin, becoming the first to survive the crossover from the Atlantic to the Pacific since Hurricane Otto in 2016.[19][20] The well-defined center of circulation and banding persisted in the storm several hours later.[21] Microwave imaging indicated that an inner core developed.[22] Bonnie continued to organize, with satellite images showing a strong convective band on the western portions of the storm.[23] Bonnie strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale by July 4 just south of Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, making it the third hurricane of the Pacific hurricane season.[24] Nine hours later, the ragged eye of the cyclone developed that was visible on satellite imagery.[25][26] Later that day, Bonnie intensified into a Category 2 system as an inner core and distinct eye became apparent and upper-level outflow became fairly well-defined.[27][28] Further intensification was briefly halted by an increase of northerly to northeasterly wind shear overnight on July 4\u20135, but soon resumed, and at 15:00 UTC on July 5, Bonnie reached peak intensity as a Category 3 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 964\u00a0mbar (28.5\u00a0inHg).[29][30] Shortly afterward, Bonnie's cloud pattern deteriorated and its eye started to become less defined, causing the cyclone to weaken to a Category 2 strength by 03:00 UTC on July 6.[31][32] Bonnie began to rapidly weaken due to wind shear and cooler waters.[33] As a result, the hurricane weakened to Category 1 strength as it passed south of Clarion Island on July 7.[34][35] The circulation center became embedded with a small central dense overcast to the north early on July 8, marking Bonnie's degradation to a tropical storm.[36] At 21:00 UTC on July 9, Bonnie degenerated into a post-tropical cyclone.[37] The remnant low moved westward and dissipated in the northern Pacific on July 11.[38]"

        "content": " The 1916 Gulf Coast hurricane was a destructive tropical cyclone that struck the central Gulf Coast of the United States in early July 1916. It generated the highest storm surge on record in Mobile, Alabama, wrought widespread havoc on shipping, and dropped torrential rainfall exceeding 2\u00a0ft (0.6\u00a0m). The second tropical cyclone, first hurricane, and first major hurricane \u2013 Category 3 or stronger on the modern-day Saffir\u2013Simpson scale \u2013 of the highly active 1916 Atlantic hurricane season,[nb 1] the system originated in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on June 28 and moved generally toward the north-northwest. Crossing the Yucat\u00e1n Channel on July 3 as a strengthening hurricane and brushing Cuba with gusty winds, the cyclone reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 120\u00a0mph (195\u00a0km/h) prior to making landfall near Pascagoula, Mississippi, at 20:00 UTC on July 5. Over land, the hurricane rapidly weakened to a tropical storm, but then retained much of its remaining strength as it meandered across interior Mississippi and Alabama for several days, its northward progress impeded by a sprawling high-pressure area to the north. The system weakened into a tropical depression on July 9 and dissipated late the next day over southern Tennessee. The United States Weather Bureau first took notice of the developing storm on July 2, issuing tropical cyclone watches and warnings for much of the central Gulf Coast on July 4 and 5. Upon moving ashore, the cyclone produced sustained Category 3 winds over coastal Mississippi and Alabama, with the worst damage mainly confined to east of the storm's center. In Mobile, an 11.6\u00a0ft (3.5\u00a0m) storm surge destroyed wharves and severely flooded the business district, while high winds unroofed or otherwise damaged many buildings. Boats of all sizes in Mobile Bay were sunk or blown ashore, and despite efforts to prepare warehouses for the tidal flooding, $500,000 in merchandise was lost.[nb 2] Farther east, Pensacola, Florida, endured several days of gale-force winds after the initial passage of the storm's core; though wind damage to homes, businesses, and trees was extensive, the worst damage resulted from storm tides along the immediate coast. Throughout the region, the hurricane severed telephone and telegraph communications. Numerous ships were lost in the Gulf of Mexico, some with their entire crews. As the storm slowly proceeded inland, days of downpours caused rivers to rise precipitously from Mississippi to Georgia, overflowing their banks for several miles in each direction; the Chattahoochee River exceeded flood stage by 23.7\u00a0ft (7.2\u00a0m). In Alabama alone, 350,000 acres (140,000\u00a0ha) of farmland was submerged, leading to millions of dollars in crop damage. Railroads were flooded, washed out, or blocked by debris, and many sawmills and other industrial facilities were disrupted. In addition, the hurricane's outer bands spawned multiple tornadoes that each caused severe but localized damage to residential areas. Steady rainfall in western North Carolina primed the French Broad River watershed for a catastrophic flooding event when another hurricane from the Atlantic coast moved over the same area just days later. The resulting disaster, the worst in Asheville, North Carolina's history, killed 80 people. Including property damage, shipping losses, and crop failures, the hurricane cost the Gulf Coast about $12.5 million,[nb 3] and at least 34 people died in the region.[2]"

        "content": "The second tropical cyclone of the 1916 season formed as a tropical depression in the southwestern Caribbean Sea around 12:00 UTC on June 28. The depression drifted northwestward, and on June 30 it passed just east of Cabo Gracias a Dios.[3] The system swept across the Swan Islands beginning on the morning of July 1, punctuating two days of unsettled weather there. Operationally, this was the first confirmation of the storm's existence.[4] Around 00:00 UTC on July 2, the depression intensified into a tropical storm while centered just west of the Swan Islands.[3] On the afternoon of July 3, USCGC Itasca encountered easterly gale-force winds while located 25\u00a0mi (40\u00a0km) south of Cape San Antonio, Cuba; late that night, USS Monterey also endured gales generally from the east while situated roughly 90\u00a0mi (140\u00a0km) northwest of the cape. As a result, it was determined that the system,[4] after intensifying into a hurricane at 18:00 UTC on July 3,[3] passed west of the ships through the Yucat\u00e1n Channel and into the Gulf of Mexico. No further radio reports were received from ships near the hurricane, apparently because of effective shipping advisories. Upon entering the Gulf of Mexico, the hurricane began to strengthen more quickly and accelerated toward the north-northwest.[4] As the storm approached the central Gulf Coast of the United States, it possessed maximum sustained winds of 120\u00a0mph (195\u00a0km/h), making it a Category 3 major hurricane on the modern-day Saffir\u2013Simpson scale.[3] This is officially listed as its peak intensity, but because observations of the storm over the open Gulf of Mexico were sparse, it may have previously been stronger. At 20:00 UTC on July 5, the hurricane made landfall near Pascagoula, Mississippi, while at its strongest known intensity.[5] At the time, this represented the earliest recorded U.S. major hurricane landfall in any season.[6] While the eye passed overhead, Pascagoula experienced a 20-minute lull in the storm's force.[7] At landfall, the radius of maximum wind was likely 17 to 23\u00a0mi (27 to 37\u00a0km) and minimum central barometric pressure was estimated at 950\u00a0hPa (28.05\u00a0inHg), the latter of which was used to derive the storm's peak winds.[5] Moving inland, the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm by the morning of July 6, and it rapidly slowed as its northward progress was suppressed by a large high-pressure area over the Great Lakes.[8] For several days the storm meandered across Mississippi and Alabama,[5] and it continued to produce tropical storm-force winds through July 8. It finally deteriorated into a tropical depression around 00:00 UTC on July 9, while centered over central Alabama. The depression persisted for nearly two more days before losing its characteristics as a tropical cyclone over southern Tennessee, late on July 10.[3] By the next morning, the disturbance had become indistinct.[9] Recent reanalysis efforts have produced multiple changes to the hurricane's track in the Atlantic hurricane database, including an earlier formation and a slower initial intensification rate.[5]"

Across the Florida Straits, Key West, Florida, recorded 36\u00a0mph (58\u00a0km/h) winds.[4] The strongest sustained winds measured in association with the storm were 107\u00a0mph (172\u00a0km/h) in Mobile, Alabama, corresponding to a one-minute average of 87\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) adjusted for modern recording techniques. Although not directly recorded, sustained winds of Category 3 intensity probably affected coastal Mississippi and Alabama, with Category 2 winds affecting Florida.[5] Throughout the affected region, telephone and telegraph infrastructure was blown down, crippling communications.[12] The storm continued to drop flooding rains as it drifted around the Deep South for five days, resulting in significant damage to agricultural sectors of southeastern Mississippi, southern to central Alabama, and southwestern Georgia.[13][14] As waterways were at seasonably low levels prior to the tropical cyclone, the prolonged downpours caused some rivers to rise by more than 50\u00a0ft (15\u00a0m).[9] Vast fields of cotton and corn were submerged, and in areas where the cotton crop survived intact, the abundant moisture was expected to result in an outbreak of harmful boll weevils.[15] Numerous lumber companies suffered damage or interruptions to business resulting from the storm.[16] Along the Gulf Coast of the United States, the hurricane wrought more than $1.5 million in losses to shipping, including approximately $800,000 to vessels based in Pensacola, Florida, and $750,000 in Mobile.[17] Numerous ships fell victim to the hurricane, some being lost with all crew members and passengers. Several ships went down off Ship Island, including the three-masted schooner Mary G. Dantzler, which sank with her crew of around 12.[17] The ship, owned by a Gulfport, Mississippi, lumber company, was loaded with phosphate rock when the hurricane struck.[16] The Bay St. Louis-based Champion, crewed by four, the Norwegian schooner Ancenis, worth $150,000, and an unidentified ship were also lost near Ship Island;[17][18] only the crew of the Ancenis was rescued.[18] The four-masted barquentine John W. Myers was blown aground on Ship Island and severely damaged.[17] \"Probably a score\" of small vessels were wrecked or heavily damaged,[17] including the schooner Emma Harvey, which dragged anchor across the Chandeleur Islands and drifted eastward at the height of the storm. She was found floating upside-down off Pensacola on August 12, with no trace of her captain and five crewmen. After being towed into port and salvaged, the schooner survived for decades more until it was likely destroyed during Hurricane Frederic in 1979.[19] The Beulah D. was dismasted and heavily damaged, but her crew survived, and the vessel was towed into port along with the wrecked Lagoda on July 14. Another small schooner, the Cambria, was blown out to sea from Deer Island and overturned, eventually being recovered near the Dog Keys.[20] Her sole occupant was reportedly saved.[17] The total death toll from the hurricane is unknown, with estimates ranging from as low as 34[2] to \"into the hundreds\".[17]"

Winds and rain were both light in New Orleans.[11] The storm's winds damaged roughly half of the buildings in Pascagoula, Mississippi,[7] where multiple industrial facilities were destroyed. Similarly extensive damage occurred just to the north in Moss Point.[21] The storm's effects diminished to the west of Pascagoula, though significant property damage was still reported in Biloxi and Gulfport; one person was killed by the storm in the former city,[7] and a handful of homes along that stretch of coast were destroyed.[15] Property damage in Mississippi coastal towns was estimated at $130,000,[7] and generally proved less severe than initially feared.[15] By one estimation, potentially $3 million worth of standing timber in southeastern Mississippi was destroyed,[22] though sources in Hattiesburg suggested the damage to timber locally was less severe than initially feared. In particular, it was reported that most of the trees toppled by the storm were weak and of little value. Regardless, many sawmills lost their stock or were otherwise damaged, with fires breaking out in several plants. Lumber processing companies in Laurel alone sustained around $200,000 in damage,[15] and in that town, \"not more than a dozen\" out of 2,400 houses in Laurel escaped the storm unscathed.[21] Greater than 5\u00a0in (130\u00a0mm) of rain fell over most of eastern Mississippi,[8] peaking at 21.53\u00a0in (547\u00a0mm) in Leakesville.[9] The entire length of the Pascagoula River in Mississippi overflowed to an average of 3\u00a0mi (4.8\u00a0km) from each bank.[9]"

C. Smith and the barge Harry T. Morse\u2014resulting in the deaths of about a dozen people.[7][29] Overall damage in Mobile was estimated at $2\u20133 million, and four drowning deaths were reported in and around the city. To the south, the storm produced severe property damage in Fort Morgan.[7] Days of downpours in the state flooded approximately 350,000 acres (140,000\u00a0ha) of land;[9] the most prolific freshwater flooding followed the Cahaba and Alabama rivers through Perry, Dallas, Wilcox, and Monroe counties, where collectively 250,000 acres (100,000\u00a0ha) of farmlands was inundated and $2.5 million worth of crops were destroyed,[22] contributing to an estimated statewide total of $5 million in lost crops. In the same area, at least 2,000 families were forced to evacuate their homes.[21] Residents along the Coosa River faced destitution and fears of famine, resulting in a rush to slaughter cattle for food.[21] For 170\u00a0mi (270\u00a0km) of its course, the Tombigbee River flooded 1.25\u00a0mi (2.01\u00a0km) of land on both sides.[9] Multiple people drowned in floodwaters in Birmingham and Tuscaloosa,[30] and in some communities, residents clung to treetops to escape raging floodwaters. In Birmingham, the flooding closed manufacturing plants.[31] Railways and train trestles were washed out or blocked by landslides,[13] with one railroad in particular, the Southern Railway, having service interrupted on a total 140\u00a0mi (230\u00a0km) of track, mostly south and west of Birmingham.[32] In addition to the flooding, strong winds persisted over land;[22] around Montgomery, numerous houses were destroyed by strong winds and many individuals were injured.[13] Nearby, more than 100 convicts became stranded on a prison farm after it was flooded by the Tallapoosa River.[21] While moving inland on July 6, the hurricane spawned at least four damaging tornadoes in Alabama, including one in Dallas County that leveled five small houses, injuring eight people, and toppled hundreds of trees on a plantation west of Selma. Two tornadoes in Lowndesboro and Clanton destroyed some buildings and each caused two injuries, and one in western Tallapoosa County destroyed a church and a barn.[33]"

At their strongest, the winds overturned automobiles and made standing impossible. As the storm slowly progressed inland, southwesterly gale-force winds continued through July 8. In addition to the exceptionally long duration, the winds were abnormally steady, not dominated by gusts as in most tropical cyclones. Numerous homes were unroofed, smokestacks toppled, and sheds torn apart, while damage to trees and other vegetation was extensive, leaving some roads impassable with debris. However, as most weaker buildings had already been demolished by the 1906 hurricane, structural damage was relatively light. Wind-inflicted property damage was estimated at $150,000.[34] A relatively modest 6.57\u00a0in (167\u00a0mm) of rain fell in Pensacola,[9] but Bonifay to the northeast recorded the storm-maximum amount of 24.5\u00a0in (620\u00a0mm), making the hurricane the wettest on record in northwestern Florida and one of the rainiest in the state as a whole.[8][35] Along the coast, a 5\u00a0ft (1.5\u00a0m) storm surge and accompanying high waves did $850,000 in damage to shipping, wharves, and coastal structures at Pensacola.[34] The city lost electricity when the Pensacola Electric Company's engine room was flooded by the rising tide.[2] In Pensacola Harbor, two schooners carrying 70 Gulf Coast Military Academy cadets on their annual cruise were beached and severely damaged, but no passengers were harmed.[17] At a seaplane base, seven canvass seaplane hangars collapsed in the storm, and four seaplanes were battered.[17] No storm-related deaths occurred reported in Pensacola, though four lives were lost elsewhere in the state.[2]"

Other major rivers in Georgia exceeded flood stage, but generally to a lesser extent than the Chattahoochee.[9] Nonetheless, the widespread loss of crops and livestock was reported.[21] In Georgia, Decatur County bore the brunt of the flooding, with the entire tobacco crop there ruined and many bridges washed out. In neighboring Miller County, a dam at the Babcock Lumber Company plant failed, flooding the community of Babcock.[37] The flooding inflicted at least $1 million in damage in southwestern Georgia.[38] North of Cairo, a tornado cut a swath of damage 450\u00a0ft (140\u00a0m) wide on the night of July 5\u20136, killing a farmer and injuring his wife and son.[13] Their home was blown 150\u00a0ft (45\u00a0m) afield and then its debris strewn across a wide area. Later on July 6, another tornado in the same area destroyed two more houses. In Early County, a tornado demolished two small houses and uprooted multiple trees just south of Blakely.[33] Heavy rainfall extended into southern Tennessee, amounting to nearly 12\u00a0in (300\u00a0mm) in Chattanooga from July 5\u201313.[9] Flooding on the Tennessee River left 400 people homeless in Dayton.[21] A general 3 to 6\u00a0in (75 to 150\u00a0mm) of rain fell over the French Broad River watershed of western North Carolina, causing the river to rise 4\u00a0ft (1.2\u00a0m) above flood stage at Asheville on July 11. The resulting damage to crops, homes, and industrial plants was severe,[39] costing an estimated $500,000, and although water levels quickly receded, saturated soil and swollen waterways set the stage for a catastrophic flooding event when a second hurricane moved inland from the Atlantic Coast and dropped exceptionally heavy rain over the same area on July 15 and 16. The French Broad River crested at an estimated 23.1\u00a0ft (7.0\u00a0m), 19.1\u00a0ft (5.8\u00a0m) above flood stage, contributing to the worst flood in western North Carolina's history; some 80 people died in the catastrophe and total damage reached $21 million.[40][41]"

        "header": "Hurricane Elena",
        "content": " Hurricane Elena was a strong and destructive tropical cyclone that affected eastern and central portions of the United States Gulf Coast in late August and early September 1985. Threatening popular tourist destinations during Labor Day weekend, Elena repeatedly deviated from its forecast path, triggering evacuations of unprecedented extent. The hurricane wrought havoc to property and the environment between southwestern Florida and eastern Louisiana, though lesser effects were felt well beyond those areas. Elena developed on August 28 near Cuba, and after traveling lengthwise across the island with little impact, it entered the Gulf of Mexico and continued to strengthen. Initially projected to strike the central Gulf Coast, the hurricane unexpectedly veered toward the east on August 30, then stalled just 50\u00a0mi (80\u00a0km) west of Cedar Key, Florida. Despite predictions that Elena would continue eastward across Florida, the cyclone remained nearly stationary for about 48 hours, causing damage all along the eastern gulf with high winds and waves, before slowly moving northwest and ultimately making landfall near Biloxi, Mississippi, on September 2 as a Category 3 major hurricane. The storm quickly weakened upon moving ashore and dissipated on September 4. The hurricane's unpredictable shifts in direction created what was considered the largest peacetime evacuation in the nation's history. Evacuations occurred in sequence to follow the storm's forecast positions, and many residents and tourists along portions of the Gulf Coast were forced to leave twice in a matter of days. Preparations were generally timely and efficient, though accommodations and resources at storm shelters were stretched thin, and many refugees tried to return home against officials' orders. About 1.25 million people fled the storm in Florida alone, contributing to a region-wide total of nearly 2 million evacuees. Tropical cyclone warnings and watches were continuously issued and adjusted, and forecasters stressed the storm's destructive potential for days. Elena's slow movement off western Florida resulted in severe beach erosion and damage to coastal buildings, roads, and seawalls, especially to those of old or inadequate construction. Destruction was greatest near the shore and on islands such as Cedar Key and Dog Island, though tornadoes spawned by the hurricane swept through communities and mobile home parks well inland. The hurricane devastated the Apalachicola Bay shellfish industry, killing large quantities of oysters, destroying their reefs, and leaving thousands of workers unemployed. Farther west, Dauphin Island in Alabama endured wind gusts as high as 130\u00a0mph (210\u00a0km/h) and a significant storm surge. The island sustained some of the most significant damage inflicted by Elena, including several hundred damaged or demolished homes. The rest of the state's coast also sustained considerable damage, and the inland pecan and soybean crops were severely diminished in Alabama and Mississippi. Over 13,000 homes were damaged in Mississippi, and 200 were destroyed. Cities close to the Alabama border\u2014including Pascagoula\u2014experienced widespread damage to residences, schools, and businesses, and the community of Gautier was effectively isolated from the outside world. Several apparent but unconfirmed tornadoes appear to have exacerbated the damage in the Gulfport area. Wind damage extended into portions of eastern Louisiana. Overall, nine people died as a result of the hurricane: two in Texas due to drownings in rip currents, three in Florida, two in Louisiana, one in Arkansas, and one in a maritime accident in the Gulf of Mexico. Damage totaled about $1.3 billion,[1] and power outages from the storm affected 550,000 people. In Elena's wake, President Ronald Reagan declared parts of Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida federal disaster areas, making storm victims eligible for financial aid and temporary housing. The name Elena was later retired from the cyclical list of Atlantic hurricane names because of the storm's effects."

        "header": "Meteorological history",
        "content": "The origins of Hurricane Elena trace to an easterly tropical wave that was first identified off the western coast of Africa on August 23, 1985. The system sped westward across the Atlantic at up to 35\u00a0mph (56\u00a0km/h). Its rapid motion, combined with the presence of an unusually hostile Saharan Air Layer, prevented tropical cyclogenesis for several days. Driven by a strong subtropical ridge to its north, the wave quickly approached North America as it began to show signs of organization. At 00:00 UTC on August 28, the disturbance developed into a tropical depression while over the Windward Passage. The newly designated depression began to track west-northwestward over Cuba, which is known to disrupt tropical cyclone development. Despite that, its central barometric pressure continued to deepen, and reconnaissance aircraft found winds exceeding 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) near the center. In response, the National Hurricane Center upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Elena over northern Cuba later on August 28.[2][3] After passing north of Havana, Cuba, Elena emerged into the Gulf of Mexico. At 12:00 UTC on August 29, Elena intensified into a Category 1 hurricane.[3] Analysis of steering currents through the morning of August 30 suggested that Elena would continue on its northwestward track, striking the area between New Orleans, Louisiana, and Biloxi, Mississippi, within 30 hours.[4] Unexpectedly, a mid-to-upper-level trough of low pressure diving in from the northwest created a weakness in the easterly currents, allowing Elena to recurve and slow drastically in forward speed.[2][5] Roughly 24 hours after attaining hurricane intensity, the storm abruptly turned east in response to the trough.[2] Having defied initial forecasts, Hurricane Elena drifted on its new course toward the coast of northwest Florida. Forecasters now called for the trough to direct the hurricane across the Florida Peninsula and into the western Atlantic. However, the relatively weak trough moved rapidly, and instead of fully engaging Elena, its axis passed over the storm's center. Further, post-storm analysis of water vapor imagery suggested that the hurricane split the trough into two distinct segments.[4] Extrapolation from the storm's eastward progress yielded a projected landfall location near Levy County.[6] However, after the passage of the upper-level system early on August 31, steering currents slackened, and Elena became nearly stationary in the extreme northeastern Gulf of Mexico. At its closest, the center of the storm was around 50\u00a0mi (80\u00a0km) from Cedar Key, Florida,[2][5] with maximum sustained winds estimated at 105\u00a0mph (170\u00a0km/h).[7] Elena's intensity remained consistent, and the cyclone was able to continue strengthening as soon as movement resumed. Early on September 1, Elena reached Category 3 major hurricane status.[3] An area of high pressure soon began to build over the eastern United States, causing Elena to slowly retrograde westward.[7] For much of September 1, the center of the hurricane was within range of the WSR-57 radar station in Apalachicola, Florida, enabling extensive study of small features within the eye and surrounding eyewall. During that period of observation, the previously unobstructed eye became cloud-filled.[8] The hurricane accelerated on a trajectory toward the central U.S. Gulf Coast, sliding south of the Florida Panhandle. During the afternoon of September 1, the hurricane attained its peak intensity, with winds of 125\u00a0mph (205\u00a0km/h) as confirmed by reconnaissance aircraft.[7] On the morning of September 2, Elena approached coastal Mississippi from the east-southeast, still at major hurricane status. It came ashore close to Biloxi,[7] which was coincidentally within the hurricane's first forecast destination range before its extended detour.[4] Once inland, the hurricane immediately deteriorated, weakening to a tropical storm just hours after landfall,[3] and its center rapidly filled.[9] The system curved northwestward over Mississippi and Louisiana, and despite weakening, it continued to ignite thunderstorm activity which spawned heavy rains. Elena persisted for several days before degenerating into a remnant area of low pressure on September 4. Its associated cloud structure became distorted on September 5, and dissipated over Kentucky that same night.[5]"

        "header": "Preparations",
        "content": "The unpredictable nature of the hurricane, in conjunction with its arrival at popular tourist destinations on the Labor Day holiday weekend, severely complicated preparations along the Gulf Coast.[6] Evacuations and the hoisting of weather advisories inadvertently occurred in stages to keep up with Elena's shifts in direction; hurricane warnings were in effect at one point or another for every coastal location between Morgan City, Louisiana, and Sarasota, Florida. Much of the northern Gulf Coast was under a hurricane warning on two separate occasions for two different trajectories of the storm.[10] Evacuations of residents and vacationers also overlapped in many cases.[6] Collectively, this led to the \"largest number of people ever evacuated\", according to Robert Case.[11] Some evacuees moved inland to meet relatives, but many stayed relatively local, filling hotels and designated shelters such as schools and churches.[6] Despite the unusually fluid scenario, officials were well aware of the storm's destructive power days before its actual landfall. National Hurricane Center hurricane expert Bob Sheets cautioned on August 30 that Elena \"will be over a $1 billion storm\".[12] During Elena's initial approach, the first series of hurricane warnings were issued between Grand Isle, Louisiana, and Apalachicola, Florida. The storm's projected path quickly nudged westward, prompting the warnings to be extended to Morgan City, Louisiana, and truncated to Pensacola, Florida on their eastern reach.[13] Heeding the advisories, nearly one million residents and vacationers fled the storm's path.[6] Personnel on offshore oil rigs in the northern Gulf of Mexico began leaving as early as August 29.[14] The governors of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida declared states of emergency by August 30.[15] Huge crowds formed at stores as individuals searched for emergency supplies, and simultaneously, lines grew at gas stations. Due to the impending danger, many businesses closed and fortified their buildings. Across the Gulf Coast, classes at schools were cancelled, and residents in the New Orleans area were particularly wary of what was being called the first serious hurricane threat in 20 years (Hurricane Betsy caused catastrophic flooding in and around New Orleans in 1965).[16] In Mississippi, the mass exodus created bumper-to-bumper traffic on crucial highways, such as the west\u2013east U.S. Route 90.[17] In Florida, then-Governor Bob Graham activated 250 National Guard troops on August 30 to facilitate efficient evacuations, stating that 1,600 more were on standby.[18] By that time, it became evident that Elena would head farther east than initially expected, stirring more concern for the eastern Gulf Coast. Accordingly, hurricane warnings were dropped for coastal Louisiana west of Grand Isle and replaced eastward to Apalachicola, Florida.[12][19] By the evening of August 30, after Elena's sharp turn to the east, hurricane warnings along most of the northern Gulf Coast were discontinued. In accordance, evacuees between Louisiana and the four westernmost counties of the Florida Panhandle returned home as shelters closed.[19][20] With the storm's new course, the area of highest threat translated east to the remainder of the Panhandle and the western Florida Peninsula.[6][20] As such, Governor Graham recommended evacuations south to the Tampa area late on August 30.[19] A mandatory evacuation was then issued overnight for ten more coastal counties, encompassing 573,000 affected individuals.[6][20] On August 31, Governor Graham advised residents in vulnerable areas of 15 inland counties to find safer ground.[21] In response to the heightening danger, most of the National Guard troops previously on standby were sent to block access to certain areas, and an additional 3,000 were placed on standby.[22] In the greater St. Petersburg, Pinellas County, area alone, 320,000 people evacuated ahead of the storm in what was a national record for the largest evacuation of a single county in history.[23][24] The large number of refugees from the storm put a strain on facilities, highways, and contingencies. Although the number of people required to leave far exceeded the capacity of Pinellas County shelters,[20] only 120,000 of the 300,000 or more refugees made use of the shelters.[24] Still, official shelter usage was considered to be higher than average, possibly due to shortened lead times limiting the ability of individuals to make arrangements with friends and relatives, or increased awareness of available resources. Post-storm phone surveys indicated that evacuation order compliance rates were as high as 90% in Pinellas County,[25] and the entire evacuation there took just 9 hours, rather than the expected 15.[24] With over 200,000 individuals recorded to be in more than 120 shelters along the coast of west-central Florida, evacuees became restless as a result of the duration of the storm. Supplies such as food ran short, and many people ignored orders and tried to return home prematurely.[22] The threat of Hurricane Elena also triggered an unprecedented mass transfer of medical and nursing home patients. Tampa General Hospital, at 84% of patient capacity, was evacuated; four more hospitals and around 19 nursing homes in Pinellas County were also cleared. Overall, nearly 2,000 nursing home patients were transported to safety. Although successful, the process encountered issues such as time constraints and staffing shortages.[26] Late on September 1, when the storm began to retrograde, hurricane warnings were reinstated westward along the coast to Grand Isle, Louisiana,[27] as advisories along the west coast of the Florida Peninsula were allowed to expire. By the time officials lifted evacuation orders, the number of evacuees staying in shelters already decreased significantly due to the rampant eagerness and anxiety.[28] Roughly 250,000 people in the Florida Panhandle, 175,000 in Alabama, 70,000 in Mississippi, and 50,000 in Louisiana\u2014a total of 545,000\u2014were ordered to leave.[29][30] Several hundred thousand of the people affected by the new string of evacuation orders had also been forced to leave just days earlier, and in extreme cases had one day or less reprieve.[28] Governor Graham's office reported that during the entire storm event, 1.25 million people from Florida evacuated at some point,[31] and state police in Louisiana estimated that figure in their state to be around 400,000.[32] In total, nearly 2 million people fled the storm over its entire course.[33]"

        "content": "According to the Hurricane Research Division of the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory, Hurricane Elena produced Category 3 winds (111\u00a0mph (179\u00a0km/h) or greater) in Florida, Alabama, and Mississippi.[34] The American Red Cross reported that in addition to the hundreds of single-family homes demolished by the hurricane, over 17,000 sustained some degree of damage; thousands of mobile homes, apartments, and condominiums were also damaged or destroyed. A forecaster at the National Hurricane Center determined the worst of the hurricane's effects were focused around Dauphin Island, Alabama, and Pascagoula, Mississippi,[35] though noteworthy damage occurred across large areas of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida, with effects documented as far west as South Padre Island, Texas, and as far north as Kentucky. Nine deaths were attributed to the hurricane in four states and on the waters of the Gulf of Mexico, and 134 people along Elena's path were hospitalized, many of them due to storm-related stress.[36] Power outages plagued the entire region, affecting about 550,000 customers.[37] The National Climatic Data Center compiled a total monetary damage figure of $1.3 billion.[38] In addition to its effects over land, Elena also affected offshore interests. When a cargo ship close to the hurricane's center rolled in high seas on August 29, two unsecured storage containers collided, crushing a man to death.[39] An oil platform operated by Exxon and anchored off the coast of Pensacola, Florida, was ripped from its moorings and reported missing on September 2. The oil rig drifted 14\u00a0mi (23\u00a0km) away before it was spotted by a Coast Guard aircraft. Exxon previously evacuated the platform after rough seas snapped the first two of its eight anchoring cables.[40] Damage was reported on four other offshore platforms,[41] and a 6\u00a0in (150\u00a0mm) oil pipeline broke during the hurricane at an estimated cost of $1.6 million (the same pipeline broke two more times during the 1985 hurricane season).[42] A large aspect of the hurricane's devastation was the havoc it wrought on the eastern Gulf of Mexico oyster industry, particularly in the Apalachicola Bay area and off the coast of Alabama.[43][44] Elena subjected the Apalachicola Bay reefs to high winds, strong tidal action, and moderate to heavy rainfall, churning up huge quantities of silt and mud which suffocated up to 90% of live oysters and virtually destroyed the most important harvesting sites.[43][45] Commercial harvesting was suspended until May 1986, at which time some of the prominent reefs of the eastern Apalachicola Bay system were deemed able to sustain oyster-catching.[46] Low astronomical tides amplified the effects of severe turbulence in the water.[44] Thousands of individuals relying on the Apalachicola Bay oyster industry soon found themselves struggling to make a living;[43] losses in production at two major reefs were expected to surpass $30 million.[45] All of Alabama's major reefs were affected by the hurricane, and its most productive was nearly destroyed.[42] The problem was later confounded in November by Hurricane Kate, which, according to the National Hurricane Center, \"[dealt] the final blow\" to certain oyster beds.[47]"

In Key West, on the east side of Elena's strengthening center, wind gusts exceeded 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h), accompanied by 1.8\u00a0in (46\u00a0mm) of rain and higher-than-normal tides.[11] Several boats washed ashore at Smathers Beach. Similarly adverse conditions occurred throughout rest of the Keys and across the southern Florida Peninsula; 60\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h) wind gusts and modest rainfall stretched as far east as the Miami area.[48] Easterly winds produced significant wave heights of 5.2\u00a0ft (1.6\u00a0m) at West Palm Beach and 10.5\u00a0ft (3.2\u00a0m) at Jacksonville, along the Atlantic coast of Florida, by August 31.[49] Outer rainbands of the large hurricane produced squally weather over parts of northern Florida as early as the morning of August 30. By then, the low-lying coastline near Apalachicola already began to flood.[50] Elena would continue to affect the state for several days as it meandered offshore, resulting in moderate to heavy rainfall. Upwards of 10\u00a0in (250\u00a0mm) accumulated in many locations, peaking at 15.67\u00a0in (398\u00a0mm) near Cross City and reaching 11.31\u00a0in (287\u00a0mm) at Apalachicola. Farther south in the Tampa area, the precipitation was less significant, exceeding 5\u00a0in (130\u00a0mm) at Clearwater. Parts of the state's northeastern coast\u2014farther away from the hurricane's center\u2014also saw formidable rainfall, with a local maximum of 10.57\u00a0in (268\u00a0mm) at Jacksonville.[5][11] Still, those totals represented a relatively dry storm, considering its long duration.[51] Despite initial hopes that the hurricane would help alleviate drought conditions across interior portions of southern Florida, precipitation there was generally inconsequential.[52] Storm-heightened tides extended along the Florida coast as far south as Sarasota and generally ran a modest 3 to 6\u00a0ft (0.91 to 1.83\u00a0m) above normal, though their duration and extent proved noteworthy. The highest recorded storm surge associated with the hurricane was 10\u00a0ft (3.0\u00a0m) at Apalachicola.[7] The combination of raised water levels and strong waves resulted in severe erosion along many beaches. Many homes near the water were destroyed by the surge, and shoreline structures such as docks, causeways, bridges, low-lying roads, and seawalls sustained substantial damage.[27] Several large fishing piers were either partially or totally destroyed; notably, the city pier at Cedar Key and the popular 1,500\u00a0ft (460\u00a0m) Big Indian Rocks Fishing Pier were both demolished by the hurricane.[53][54] Debris from the Big Indian Rocks Fishing Pier drifted northward toward Clearwater Pass and accumulated along private beaches at Belleair Shore.[53] The storm's strongest winds remained largely over open waters, although severe gusts still brushed coastal cities and barrier islands.[55] The strongest winds were observed in two areas of the coast: from Cedar Key to Clearwater, and from Apalachicola to Pensacola.[55] Official gust reports included 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h) at Cedar Key and nearly 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) at Clearwater; later, on September 2, a gust of 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) was observed at Pensacola along the Florida Panhandle, with sustained winds exceeding 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h).[7][11] Winds in Franklin County approached 125\u00a0mph (201\u00a0km/h) by unofficial estimates. The storm's effects were not limited to the shore, however, as fallen trees in the inland Tallahassee area damaged around 50 vehicles.[27] Although Hurricane Elena never crossed Florida's coast, its drawn-out interaction with land agitated large swaths of the state's western shore.[56] Winds along and around the Pinellas County coast generally blew from the south or southwest for several days, creating persistent onshore flow that built up heavy seas.[57] Near Clearwater, waves reached 8.2\u00a0ft (2.5\u00a0m) in height, marked by a period of 13 seconds on August 31.[49][58] One study determined that the storm removed an average of 10 cubic yards of coastal material per linear foot of shoreline in Escambia County, Gulf, Franklin, and Pinellas counties, with values peaking at 15.6 cubic yards per foot.[56] Along the predominantly marshy coasts of Pasco, Hernando, and Citrus counties, erosion and structural damage were much more limited, partly due to the local southerly or southeasterly wind direction.[59] In some cases, the hurricane left quasi-permanent alterations on beaches and small islands. For example, North Bunces Key\u2014an island of southern Pinellas County\u2014lost most of its vegetation to the storm, and overwashing shifted the southern part of the island up to 330\u00a0ft (100 m) from its original settlement. More extensive changes were seen on and near Caladesi Island, which formed in 1921 after a hurricane split a larger barrier island into two by a new channel. The inlet became dominant over Dunedin Pass to the south, which grew narrower very gradually until Elena rearranged the dynamics of the beach, allowing Dunedin Pass to fill completely with sand within a couple years of the hurricane's passage. As a result, Clearwater Beach became connected to Caladesi Island.[60] Elena also created a new inlet known as Willy's Cut, which existed until 1991.[61] Interest in artificially reopening Dunedin Pass prompted an official study in 1994 on the engineering and financial merits of such a project. Due to the high cost of dredging and the likelihood of nearly continuous maintenance, no action was taken.[62] The hurricane tore two barges from their moorings in Tampa Bay and blew them into Gandy Bridge,[27] leaving the bridge with unspecified damage.[63] Throughout the area, rising waters inundated streets, washed boats ashore, and destroyed numerous homes along the coast.[64] At low-lying Cedar Key to the north, storm surge exceeded 9\u00a0ft (2.7\u00a0m).[27] There, and at Alligator Point to the northwest, the surge values represented return periods of 25 to 30 years; elsewhere, they were equivalent to about 10-year events.[65] Floodwaters in Cedar Key rose to 8\u00a0ft (2.4\u00a0m) in depth, with 2\u00a0ft (0.61\u00a0m) waves atop the standing water. The extent of structural damage was largely dependent on construction type, as newer, elevated buildings fared much better than older structures nearer sea level. Waterfront restaurants were especially susceptible; winds blew out several large sliding-glass doors at one establishment, allowing both the winds and the tide to enter its interior.[49] Elena severed the sole bridge to Cedar Key, temporarily isolating the city and stranding several residents. The Florida Department of Transportation hurriedly worked to make the bridge passable long enough to rescue the stranded individuals.[66] The hurricane compromised several other roads, destroying a 75\u00a0ft (23\u00a0m) section of State Road 24. Monetary losses in Cedar Key alone were estimated at $2 million,[67] and all major aspects of local infrastructure were severely affected, initially preventing residents from returning home to the island.[68] At least 34 homes and businesses on the island were damaged or destroyed.[69] Pinellas County suffered some of the worst damage from Hurricane Elena in Florida.[55] At the height of the storm, over 500,000 of its residents were without electricity.[21] Forty-four single-family homes were destroyed, 31 more were damaged, and several condominiums, townhouses, and commercial buildings were damaged or destroyed. The hurricane also wrecked or irreparably compromised nearly 2.7\u00a0mi (4.3\u00a0km) of coastal bulkheads and inflicted minor damage on 2.15\u00a0mi (3.46\u00a0km) more.[70] Most of the affected seawalls were degrading or poorly reinforced.[71] Seawalls with higher standards of construction generally remained intact, though even in those cases, overwash from the Gulf of Mexico topped the barriers and deposited large volumes of sand.[72] The hurricane cost roughly $100 million in Pinellas County.[24] Elena's track parallel to the Florida Panhandle subjected the coastline between Apalachicola and Pensacola Beach to particularly severe conditions that resulted in \"significant\" property damage there.[73] In Apalachicola proper, winds tore large roofs off buildings,[74] and data from Florida's Department of Natural Resources indicate that 20 residences and one community building in Franklin County were damaged or destroyed.[75] Structural failure was prevalent along the county's waterfront and on islands such as Dog Island; however, it was mainly limited to poorly constructed buildings.[72] Several miles of roadways in the county sustained significant damage, and about 1\u20442 mile (800\u00a0m) of bulkhead was destroyed.[75] Low seawalls allowed crucial points of the causeway to St. George Island to erode, causing it to fail.[72] In Escambia County, the hurricane left $2 million in damages. Throughout much of the remainder of the Florida Panhandle, structural damage was limited, though 100,000 people in the Pensacola area lost power.[76] The configuration of the southern tip of Cape San Blas in Gulf County was changed by the storm.[77] The hurricane wiped out eagle nests, generated freshwater fish kills, and affected other species of wildlife at the St. Vincent and St. Marks National Wildlife Refuges.[56] St. George Island and Honeymoon Island State Parks were heavily affected, with appreciable but lesser damage in numerous other protected areas.[78] U.S. Route 98, which closely follows the coast in this region, required extensive repairs after being undermined in nearly two dozen locations.[79] When tropical cyclones move over land, they often produce the wind shear and atmospheric instability required for the development of weak, embedded supercell thunderstorms, which can produce tornadoes. These tornadoes are usually weak and short-lived, but still capable of producing significant damage.[80] While centered over the Gulf of Mexico, the eastern side of Hurricane Elena's circulation spawned several such tornadoes over central Florida.[9] A tornado struck just east of Leesburg on September 1, destroying 64 single-family houses and mobile homes, and damaging another 118; seven people were treated for non-life-threatening injuries.[81] Later that same day, another tornado touched down over downtown Leesburg, with much less damage.[82] In nearby Marion County, tornadic activity destroyed six mobile homes, compromised another 50 residences, and inflicted as much as $500,000 in total losses, though only minor injuries were reported.[83] At Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39 in Cape Canaveral, a weak tornado struck two vehicles near the location where Space Shuttle Atlantis was being prepared for its first flight.[84] A tornado in New Port Richey tore parts of the roof off at least one building and brought down trees,[68] and tornadic activity was also identified in Sumter County.[84] The hurricane took one life in the state and indirectly contributed to two additional deaths. In Daytona Beach, a tree struck a parked vehicle, killing a person inside. The exact cause of the tree's uprooting was unknown, although it may have been hit by lightning or a short-lived tornado.[85] Elsewhere, two individuals died of heart attacks: one while installing storm shutters on his home, and another at a designated shelter.[32]"

        "content": "The center of Elena passed 30\u00a0mi (50\u00a0km) south of mainland Alabama as it accelerated toward the Gulf Coast, affecting the state's two-county coast and offshore islands. Wind gusts at Dauphin Island, situated much closer to the hurricane's eye, were estimated to have reached 130\u00a0mph (210\u00a0km/h); these velocities represented some of the highest experienced on land from the storm,[11] and were strong enough to snap hundreds of large pine trees.[86] Dauphin Island received an 8.4\u00a0ft (2.6\u00a0m) storm surge that resulted in substantial flooding and areas of total overwash.[86][87] Rainfall amounted to just 3\u00a0in (76\u00a0mm) on the island.[11] With its location close to the storm's center, Dauphin Island saw the greatest damage in Alabama. Access to the island was shut down during and immediately after the hurricane, slowing the progression of damage assessments.[88] Additionally, the storm cut power and phone services.[89] Post-storm surveys revealed discernible patterns in structural damage on the island; these included a nearly complete lack of destruction on the heavily wooded eastern end, and damage concentrated closer to the western side and along areas exposed to strong easterly winds.[90] First-hand accounts relayed that in the most severe cases, entire elevated homes were torn from their pilings and swept into the Gulf of Mexico.[91] The number of homes demolished in that manner was informally placed at 50,[92] though such total building collapses were typically confined to poorly secured buildings.[90] In total, the hurricane destroyed 190 residences on Dauphin Island, accounting for nearly 25% of all homes, and a further 235 sustained substantial damage.[92] An unofficial and early estimate of losses on the island was $30 million.[86] Windspeeds were markedly lower over mainland Alabama;[93] Mobile recorded winds of over 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h),[11] with gusts as high as 84\u00a0mph (135\u00a0km/h).[87] The storm's angle of approach created strong offshore winds along the mainland, which depressed water levels and limited the extent of positive surge once winds shifted to onshore.[94] Winds from the hurricane took a toll on crops, ruining 8,000,000\u00a0lb (3,600,000\u00a0kg) of pecans and reducing soybean production by 10%. Farms were still in the process of recovering from Hurricane Frederic in 1979 when Elena struck.[87] Wave action took a toll on the foundations of waterfront structures along the coasts of Baldwin and Mobile counties,[93] where Elena inflicted about $715,000 worth of damage to roadways.[95] Most damage was concentrated near the shore, where extensive erosion took place, and on islands and minor peninsulas. Farther inland, Elena's impact was generally limited to downed trees and power lines.[87] The storm destroyed the city boardwalk at Gulf Shores, with the cost of rebuilding expected to approach $300,000. Alabama Power reported extensive power outages affecting up to 100,000 customers.[86][88] According to the Insurance Information Institute, storm-related damages in Alabama totaled about $100 million.[96] An estimated 300 homes in the state were destroyed by Hurricane Elena, and another 1,345 sustained lighter damage.[87]"

        "header": "Mississippi",
        "content": "Along the coast of Mississippi, where Elena made landfall, the most significant effects of the storm stemmed from its strong winds gusting to over 120\u00a0mph (190\u00a0km/h). Recorded gusts included 121\u00a0mph (195\u00a0km/h) at Gulfport, 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h) at Pascagoula, and 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) at Biloxi.[7][97] Several other weather stations clocked sustained winds at over 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h).[11] Consistent with the storm's dry nature, rainfall in the state was mainly light and confined to southern and western areas.[5] Gulfport picked up more than 4.5\u00a0in (110\u00a0mm),[98] while just over 3 in (75\u00a0mm) of rain fell at Natchez.[11] Some streets in Gulfport and Biloxi flooded at the height of the storm.[98] The highest tides ran 6 to 8\u00a0ft (1.8 to 2.4\u00a0m) above normal along the coast,[51] reaching 7.9\u00a0ft (2.4\u00a0m) above average at Pascagoula and Ocean Springs.[11] As in Alabama, negative surge values were recorded at the storm's onset. The tide gauge at Gulfport recorded a water level of 5.6\u00a0ft (1.7\u00a0m) below average early on September 2, before quickly swelling to 5.43\u00a0ft (1.66\u00a0m) above normal.[94] Air pressure reportedly fell so rapidly at Pascagoula that car windows began to shatter.[84] The barometer there bottomed out at 953 mb, the lowest pressure recorded on land in association with the cyclone.[9] The worst of the damage occurred along a 40\u00a0mi (64\u00a0km) stretch of coastline, centered on the Pascagoula area.[98] Elena's winds damaged most of the schools in Jackson County, and more specifically, every school in Pascagoula was structurally compromised to some degree. Damages to schools in Ocean Springs totaled $3 million.[99] In the same city, the overall conditions following the hurricane were described as worse than those in the prior hurricanes Frederic or Camille. Elena destroyed 20 houses and two supermarkets in Ocean Springs, and several buildings on every city block sustained severe roof damage due to fallen trees. Two shopping centers were destroyed in nearby Gautier, possibly by short-lived tornadoes. A fire captain in Gautier remarked immediately after the storm that he had not yet seen an unharmed building in the city. The community became essentially isolated from the outside world, and quickly began to run short of food, clean water, and gasoline supplies.[100] Initial reports from Pascagoula also indicated that most, or all, of that city's buildings were damaged.[101] Nearly every business in the city was damaged to the extent that none were able to open when the storm cleared.[35] A post-storm assessment by the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency revealed over 900 businesses in Jackson County sustained damage, contributing to a total of nearly 1,500 in the state's three coastal counties.[102] Harrison and Hancock counties were generally not affected quite as severely as communities closer to the Alabama border, but the entire area still suffered extensively. In sections of Gulfport, large fires were sparked by downed power lines and fed by broken natural gas pipes. Debris on roadways prevented firefighters from reaching the fires, allowing them to spread. Similar destruction was seen to the east at Biloxi, where the hurricane's winds tore the roofs off many buildings. Beachfront communities were in a state of disarray, with large trees uprooted, debris littering the ground, and accumulations of sand on parts of roads like U.S. 90.[98] Damage to schools in Harrison County\u2014particularly in Gulfport and Biloxi\u2014was extensive.[103] Most homes in the area survived the storm, which was locally estimated to have been a once-in-50-year event, with relatively little damage. Several buildings along the coast in the Biloxi area sustained severe damage, but many of the older houses near the Gulf of Mexico there fared remarkably well.[98][104] Winds brought down large highway signs, in some cases striking nearby buildings.[105] Along the coast, Elena caused beach erosion, damaged coastal structures and recreational beach facilities,[106] and dislocated navigational buoys and markers in various ports, several of which were closed pending Coast Guard inspection.[107] Winds over inland Pearl River County damaged 350 permanent and mobile homes, and as in Alabama, the hurricane took a large toll on pecan and soybean crops and farms.[108] There were numerous reports in southern Mississippi of embedded tornadoes that exacerbated the hurricane's effects.[36] Reports in Gulfport indicated that three schools actively being used as hurricane shelters were struck and damaged by tornadoes. At one location, almost 400 people being housed in a school had to rush to safety before part of its roof collapsed. Another apparent tornado sideswiped a senior citizens' center, endangering nearly 200 people in a structure that sustained damage to windows, doors, and part of its roof; about 20 people required rescue by paramedics. Only minor injuries occurred in association with the possible tornadoes.[98][109] Teams of experts tasked with reviewing the validity of tornado reports were largely unable to prove that a significant portion of the damage in southern Mississippi had been done by tornadoes. As a result, few tornadoes were confirmed,[9] and it is likely that most of the damage in the region resulted from squall-like winds that are part of an intense hurricane's nature, or potentially localized microbursts.[36][108] Any unconfirmed tornadoes would have been no stronger than the hurricane's synoptic winds.[108] The storm left 80,000 Mississippi Power Company customers without electricity; most of Jackson County's 126,000 residents were affected by the outage.[102][110] Operations at Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula were halted due to the power outage and widespread damage to the shipyard's buildings and cranes,[110] and at least two other shipyards in the state were affected by the hurricane.[111] Additionally, the storm forced the temporary closure of the Chevron USA refinery at Pascagoula.[107] Facilities at Horn Island in the Gulf Islands National Seashore, Buccaneer State Park, and the Mississippi Sandhill Crane National Wildlife Refuge required repairs following the storm; at the latter, damages included the cost of healing a Florida sandhill crane's injured leg. Thirty seafood processing plants were damaged, and one was destroyed.[111] The Red Cross estimated that 200 single-family houses in the state were destroyed, and some 13,200 were damaged, 1,200 of them heavily. Additionally, the hurricane demolished 390 mobile homes and damaged another 2,290.[112] The overall cost of damage in Mississippi alone approached $1 billion.[108]"

        "content": "After moving inland, the storm's northwestward track brought it over the Louisiana border on two separate occasions,[5] first reaching Washington Parish as a minimal hurricane. Winds there were strong enough to bring down hundreds of trees, damaging houses and knocking out power to over 15,000 customers in the process.[113][114][115] The hurricane also overturned mobile homes and strew debris throughout communities such as Bogalusa and Franklinton in Washington Parish, the hardest-hit area in the state.[31] Downed trees caused damage to 200 homes and another 200 businesses, chiefly near Bogalusa.[113] Winds across the rest of the state were moderate, gusting to around 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) at Slidell on the northeastern shore of Lake Pontchartrain,[11] so damage outside of Washington Parish was sporadic.[113] Throughout the state, at least 40,000 electric customers lost power.[101] Located southwest of the storm's core, New Orleans escaped with little damage and relatively benign weather conditions; still, the hurricane triggered minor flooding and brought down tree limbs around the city. Levees along the shores of Lake Pontchartrain were able to contain the lake's large waves, despite initial fears to the contrary.[30][31] Still, the adverse conditions forced the temporary closure of the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway.[116] The storm led to the deaths of two individuals in the state: one due to a drowning in St. Tammany Parish and another in a traffic accident attributed to the weather.[31] Insured and uninsured damages were worth near $17 million combined, with an additional $500,000 in agricultural losses.[113] Elena subjected the Chandeleur Islands to a 6.5\u00a0ft (2.0\u00a0m) or greater storm surge. The island chain is an important buffer to parts of mainland Louisiana against storms, but is frequently reshaped or shrunken by intense hurricanes. Hurricane Danny and Hurricane Juan also affected the islands in 1985. Elena eroded away at least 20% and possibly up to 40% of the Chandeleur Islands' total land mass and cut 30 significant channels into the island chain. Parts of the islands left intact suffered extensive loss of vegetation.[113][117][118] The hurricane, along with Danny and Juan, also affected several other barrier islands, and Elena itself removed as much as 112\u00a0ft (34\u00a0m) of beach along the island of Grand Isle, Louisiana.[119]"

        "content": "Precipitation from Hurricane Elena reached into southern Georgia and parts of South Carolina,[5] with little impact aside from meager drought relief.[120] For several days after landfall, the weakening tropical cyclone produced moderate to heavy rainfall across portions of central and northern Arkansas. Rainfall totals were generally 2 to 4\u00a0in (51 to 102\u00a0mm), with locally higher amounts; Mountain Home, Arkansas received 8.95\u00a0in (227\u00a0mm) of rain,[11][121] including 6.6\u00a0in (170\u00a0mm) in just three hours on September 4.[122] Clinton to the south recorded 8.6\u00a0in (220\u00a0mm). At the state capital of Little Rock, under 3\u00a0in (76\u00a0mm) of liquid fell.[11][121] Listed by the National Weather Service among \"some of the most significant tropical cyclones to affect Arkansas\", the remnants of Elena triggered flash flooding in parts of four counties; 2\u00a0ft (0.61\u00a0m) of standing water submerged streets in downtown Hot Springs.[121] In Mountain Home, floodwaters forced 10 families to evacuate their homes, and one person died after a swollen creek swept her car off a bridge spanning it.[122] Significant rainfall also occurred over parts of western Kentucky, with lighter precipitation in several adjacent states.[5] Over 8\u00a0in (200\u00a0mm) fell at Paducah, where urban streets and low-lying terrain experienced freshwater flooding Floodwaters 4\u00a0ft (1.2\u00a0m) deep submerged cars to their windows and infiltrated 40 homes, several businesses, a hotel, and a high school.[123][124] Localized evacuations and road closures were required, and a person wading in an active creek had to be rescued after the creek swept him downstream. Around 10,000 customers lost electric service for a short period due to the storm. Shelters were opened to those displaced by the flooding, but scarcely used.[124] Early in its formative stages, Elena triggered rainshowers and thunderstorms over parts of Cuba, The Bahamas, and Hispaniola.[125] Later, the mature hurricane generated strong rip currents as far away as South Padre Island, Texas, where two swimmers drowned in separate incidents over the Labor Day weekend. Both victims were male Texas residents.[100][126]"

        "content": "The state of Florida received a federal Major Disaster Declaration on September 12.[127] Franklin, Levy, Manatee, and Pinellas counties\u2014where the storm left 5,000 individuals without work\u2014became eligible for federal aid after President Ronald Reagan visited the state and determined that residents in those areas would benefit from assistance such as temporary housing, low-interest loans for rebuilding efforts, and monetary grants.[69] Disaster centers were opened in those four counties as centralized locations for federal, state, and volunteer agencies to operate relief programs.[128] President Reagan later included Hillsborough, Wakulla, and Dixie counties, bringing the total number of Florida counties eligible for federal aid to seven. The deadline for residents of all seven counties to apply for either state or federal assistance was set for November 12.[129] Several major corporations\u2014including Texaco, Exxon, and J.C. Penney\u2014contacted customers in the affected areas and offered to make special arrangements for their monthly payments if they had been financially affected by the storm. While only a small number of customers took advantage of the assistance, the companies' actions were met with highly positive feedback.[130] In the days following the storm, residents of Cedar Key were forbidden from returning to their homes and businesses while washed-out roadways underwent repairs and debris was cleared. Portable toilets were delivered and clean water trucked in for use while the city's infrastructure was being stabilized.[131] After the city of Cedar Key dropped its participation in the National Flood Insurance Program in early 1984, leaving residents unable to purchase flood insurance for their property, the city council voted unanimously to return to the program after Hurricane Elena.[69] Tourism decreased significantly in some areas due to prospective travelers' concerns about the extent of the damage. The hurricane created a 13% drop in visitors between October 1984 and October 1985 in Pinellas County, marking an early end to the annual \"tourist season\", which generally ends after Labor Day weekend; tourist spending fell accordingly.[132] After the storm, residents were allowed to return to their neighborhoods on a by-town basis. Once authorized to enter their communities, many individuals inadvertently gained access to other municipalities in the area that were not ready for the return of civilians. In turn, dangerous situations arose amid preliminary cleanup operations. In Pinellas County, laws were proposed to unify the municipal decisions to accept residents after future disasters. As part of the proposed laws, the county sheriff, as opposed to local officials, would become responsible for allowing cities to reopen.[133] Despite extensive resistance, county commissioners approved the change, giving the sitting sheriff power to override municipal evacuation orders.[134] An additional ordinance was proposed to allow banning of alcohol sales during emergencies. During Hurricane Elena, intoxicated individuals created disorder at shelters and impeded evacuations by refusing to leave hurricane parties.[133][134] To help the Apalachicola Bay shellfish industry recover, special regulations were put in place to monitor harvests, and $2 million was designated toward rehabilitation efforts. Using a portion of the funds, out-of-work oyster catchers were employed to repopulate crucial reefs.[44] The state of Florida also issued a grant to help individuals in the crippled seafood industry make necessary payments.[135] Efforts to help newly unemployed individuals in the shellfish industry continued in the months following the storm; local Tallahassee musicians organized a benefit concert in January 1986 to raise money for families of oystermen in Franklin County.[136] On September 1 and 2, Florida Power Company received help from Gulf Coast companies to return power to 170,000 customers before the assisting companies' home areas were struck by the hurricane. Power was restored to most areas by September 4, with an exception being St. George's Island; service was expected to be restored after several additional days.[37] More broadly, owners of heavily damaged homes in the state faced new regulations on coastal construction in the state, which went into effect less than a month after the storm. The new rules entailed more rigorous study of factors such as a property's prior history and surrounding buildings before approval to rebuild a demolished structure would be granted. Governor Graham preliminarily advised that houses more than halfway destroyed not be rebuilt.[137] Recovery efforts after Hurricane Elena continued to a small degree for years after its passage; for example, beach replenishment at Indian Rocks Beach in Pinellas County began in the summer of 1990.[138]"

Power was fully restored to Central Louisiana Electric customers by September 4.[37] Alabama's two coastal counties were declared federal disaster areas on September 7.[139][140] Special loan assistance was made available by the Small Business Administration and the Farmers Home Administration, the latter of which sought to help commercial growers who lost their crops to the storm.[140] Mississippi Governor William Allain sent 500 members of the National Guard to partner with 200 law enforcement officers along Mississippi's coast in minimizing crime, and nighttime curfews were established in several cities.[40] On September 4, President Reagan declared Mississippi's coastal counties a Major Disaster area.[141][142] The Federal Emergency Management Agency estimated that as many as 3,000 homes in the state were uninhabitable, their occupants forced to find temporary living arrangements. The Small Business Administration approved special loans up to $500,000 for owners of damaged businesses.[142] Mississippi Power Company's system was the hardest-hit,[37] and restoration of service was slow; 50,000 of 80,000 customers were still without electricity by September 5.[102] By September 5, the Salvation Army, Red Cross, and other organizations had served 100,000 meals to those displaced by the hurricane in Mississippi, and federal food stocks became available for the state to distribute to storm victims.[143] Still, resources such as food and ice started to run short in the hardest-hit locations, and long lines formed at the first few stores and gas stations to reopen. With dwindling supplies, the Salvation Army had to procure food from other parts of the region to serve to victims.[102] In the days after the hurricane, an increase in heart attack deaths in the Harrison County area was noted.[143]"

The storm was named by Agencia Estatal de Meteorolog\u00eda (AEMET) on 5 November, with the agency issuing wind and rain alerts to the Balearic archipelago and other areas reaching the eastern coasts of Spain, as Blas approached from the east. It then turned eastward after moving slowly westward, and the storm meandered across the western Mediterranean for the next several days, before eventually dissipating to the west of Italy on 18 November. Heavy rainfall and gusty winds impacted the Balearic Islands as a result of Blas, with trees being damaged and many water basins overflowing. A rescue was conducted on 10 November in Mallorca for a stranded crew member of a sailboat. No deaths were reported on the island, but the storm brought property damages on the archipelago. Algeria was also affected by the storm, with numerous landslides being documented over the country, especially Algiers. Six fatalities were reported in the region, with two additional people being injured. Three more deaths occurred in Sicily, along with reported heavy wind gusts in France. A total of 9 deaths were reported from the storm; the total damage is still currently unknown."

        "content": "Blas originated from an extratropical low of the coast of Algeria on 5 November. At 10:15\u00a0UTC that same day, Blas was named by the Agencia Estatal de Meteorolog\u00eda (AEMET), due to the potential for the storm to bring strong wind gusts to the Balearic Islands.[4] However, the weather map of the Free University of Berlin (FUB), along with satellite imagery available at that time indicated that the storm had no evident circulation at that time.[5] According to AEMET, the storm formed from the process of \"Mediterranean cyclogenesis\" from a trough that crossed through the Mediterranean Sea from the Atlantic Ocean.[4] On the next day, a synoptic map published by the FUB indicated that Blas had become better-defined between the Balearic Islands and the island of Sardinia.[6] For the next three days, Blas slowly moved west-southwestward, affecting the Balearic Archipelago and the nearby Algeria. On 8 November, Blas initiated a slow clockwise loop for the next five days, looping towards Corsica and then back towards the Balearic Islands, while gradually strengthening. A peak pressure of 1,010\u00a0mbar (30\u00a0inHg) was reported by the FUB's weather map on 8\u20139 November, with the storm peaking on 10 November.[7][2][3][8][9] Around 11 November, Blas exhibited compact convection over its center, resembling a tropical cyclone in appearance, though this was short-lived.[10][11] On 12 November, Blas' center split into two lows, though they recombined by the next day.[12][13][14] The AEMET noted that Blas continued moving towards the east, moving across the Mediterranean and Tyrrhenian Sea, where it caused impacts that were described by the agency as \"important\".[4] On 13 November, the storm developed a spiral structure similar to those of tropical cyclones while situated near the Balearic Islands,[15] and the storm also shed its frontal structure.[14] The storm then slowly weakened while executing another clockwise loop, with the storm moving southeastward.[14] On 14 November, the cyclone turned northward, moving over Sardinia and Corsica, before curving back southwestward on 15 November and moving over Sardinia again, while restrengthening in the process.[16][17] On 16 November, Blas turned eastward once again, passing just south of Sardinia and moving towards Italy, before dissipating over the Tyrrhenian Sea on 18 November.[18][19][20][21]"

Menorca has also been placed on an orange rain alert.[33] Due to the storm-induced strong waves, the Port of Valencia was also closed to sea activities.[34] According to AEMET, Blas had the potential to acquire subtropical or tropical features while moving across the Mediterranean Sea and become a Medicane, according to AEMET.[35][36]\nThe forced closure of the ports of Mah\u00f3n and Ciutadella cut Menorca off from the rest of Spain.[11] A wind gust of 72\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph) was recorded at the island's airport, while Es Mercadal recorded a wind gust of 75\u00a0km/h (47\u00a0mph).[33] A wave height of 3.7\u00a0m (12 feet) was also recorded by a buoy due to Blas.[34] About 5 metres (16\u00a0ft), meanwhile was registered at Mallorca's north and northeastern portions. The island's Far de Capdepera reported the highest wind gust from the system at the country, at 95\u00a0km/h (59\u00a0mph) while Serra d'Alfabia at 88\u00a0km/h (55\u00a0mph).[37] Several trees were uprooted and felled as a result of these, with firefighters responding to several requests for tree blockages.[38] A wave height of 7.9\u00a0m (26 feet) was also recorded at a port in the Balearic Islands.[39] The heaviest rainfall was received at Escorsa, Son Torella with 118.8\u00a0mm (4.68\u00a0in) on 11 November.[28] In addition, a small vessel sank off the coast of El Fonduco due to high seas, although no one was injured. Across the archipelago, 143 tree, electrical line, and street lamp blockage occurrences were recorded.[40] Disruption in transportations of fresh products in Menorca was also seen due to the closure of ports leading to the island.[41] The seaports connected to Menorca eventually opened again on 9 November.[42] Minor flooding was also seen over Fornalutx, forcing the cancellation of classes there.[43] Blas also affected Barcelona with heavy rains and rough seas, with beach stores closing and emergency plans activating in the city. Waves up to 2.3\u20133.3\u00a0m (7.5\u201310.8 feet) also breached some sand on a beach while surfers were prohibited to undergo surfing activities.[44][45] By 10 November, a sailboat crew was rescued by the emergency authorities in Mallorca as the mast of his vessel broke up. Many river basins also overflowed due to the heavy rains in the island, prompting several alerts for wind and rain.[46]"

Many homes in Chlef Province were also devastated by landslides, and some structures were damaged. Cars were also drowned in the floods, with Civil Protection authorities successfully rescuing two individuals each on Oum El Bouaghi Province and an unnamed street. Three people were also rescued from their homes in Mazouna, Relizane Province, where they were stuck. Snowfall was also reported around the country, causing one motorway to be closed.[49][50][51] Due to Blas' rains, a building collapse due to a landslide in a wilaya at Bologhine in the country's capital caused two people to be injured and three more people to be trapped in the establishment's remains; they were later confirmed to be killed.[52][53] The latter fate also happened to three more individuals at Ra\u00efs Hamidou, bringing the death toll from the storm at Algeria at 6.

        "content": " Tropical Storm Ivo was a tropical cyclone that brought heavy rainfall to five states in Mexico, causing severe flooding during August 2019. The tenth tropical cyclone and ninth named storm of the 2019 Pacific hurricane season,[2] Ivo arose from a low-pressure area that spawned south of Guatemala on August 16. The low-pressure system gradually organized over the next several days as it tracked west-northwestward. The system coalesced into a tropical depression early on August 21 and strengthened into Tropical Storm Ivo several hours later. Located within a favorable environment of moist air and warm sea surface temperatures, the cyclone quickly intensified, peaking the next day with 1-minute maximum sustained winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) and a pressure of 990\u00a0mbar (29.23\u00a0inHg). Increasing wind shear caused the storm's intensification to level off later that day, as the system turned towards the north-northwest. Ivo passed by Clarion Island midday on August 23, generating winds of 60\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h) on the island. Wind shear caused Ivo to significantly degrade in structure and intensity during the next couple of days. Cold sea surface temperatures, as well as dry and stable air, caused the cyclone to degenerate into a remnant low early on August 25. The low meandered over the eastern Pacific before opening up into a trough of low pressure early on August 27. Ivo prompted the issuance of blue alerts for multiple municipalities in Sinaloa and Sonora, signifying minimal danger. The Marine plan was activated in several states to prepare for heavy rainfall and flooding. Schools were canceled across over a dozen Sinaloan municipalities and at the Autonomous University of Sinaloa. Severe rainfall and flooding occurred, mostly across Baja California Sur and Sinaloa, forcing the evacuation of hundreds of people. Over a hundred shelters were established for victims of the storm. Hundreds of homes and streets were inundated by floodwaters and mud, as a result of torrential rainfall and multiple rivers overflowing. The rainfall worsened damage to infrastructure, roads, and bridges, which had been damaged during Hurricane Willa in 2018. At least 5 people were killed in Nayarit after being swept away by the El Cangrejo river. Heavy rainfall and hail occurred in Zacatecas, flooding two dozen businesses and homes and stranding nearly a dozen vehicles. Three landslides occurred in Mexico State, blocking streets and damaging houses. Three rivers spilled their banks, flooding several neighborhoods in the Mexico City suburbs. In the aftermath of the storm, Plan DN-III-E, a disaster relief and rescue plan, was activated in five states. Military troops assisted with rescue and cleanup operations in multiple states. Collection sites were opened to receive food and supplies for victims of the storm."

        "content": "A tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa on August 4, while a second wave reached the eastern tropical Atlantic Ocean a few days after. The waves tracked westward and entered the eastern Pacific Ocean, starting on August 14.[1] The National Hurricane Center first forecast on August 13 that a low-pressure area would form southeast of Mexico's southeastern coast later in that week.[3] A low-pressure area spawned south of Guatemala early on August 16 from the first wave. This wave proceeded westward while the low-pressure area tracked towards the west-northwest. Thunderstorm activity associated with the latter system significantly increased during the next two days. By August 19, the system was located approximately 230\u00a0mi (370\u00a0km) south of Mexico's southeastern coast. The second tropical wave tracked through the region during this time, sparking a further increase in convective activity.[1] The low-pressure system became more organized on August 21,[4] with wind data from satellites showing an improved circulation.[1] A tropical depression developed 290 miles (465\u00a0km) south of Manzanillo, Mexico, at 06:00 UTC, and further strengthened into Tropical Storm Ivo six hours later.[1] The nascent tropical storm was located in a favorable environment, with warm sea surface temperatures of 86\u00a0\u00b0F (30\u00a0\u00b0C), moist air, and moderate northeasterly vertical wind shear. At the time, Ivo possessed a curved rainband spiraling into its low-level center. Meanwhile, a mid-level ridge located to the north was causing the cyclone to track towards the west-northwest.[5] Ivo continued to strengthen over the next day, with the cyclone's cloud pattern improving and a mid-level, banded eye developing underneath its central dense overcast.[1][6][7] Ivo peaked at 12:00 UTC on August 22, with maximum sustained winds of 70\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 990\u00a0mbar (29.23\u00a0inHg).[1] Shortly after peaking, Ivo's forward crawl slowed down to 12\u00a0mph (19\u00a0km/h),[1] about half the speed it was travelling at one day prior,[8] as the western edge of the ridge weakened. The cyclone's intensification came to a halt as northeasterly wind shear increased. Convection was largely concentrated in the southern half of the storm,[1] and the low-level center was partially exposed along the northeastern edge of the cloud cover.[9][10] Ivo quickly turned towards the northwest and later the north-northwest early on August 23, as it rounded the western edge of the mid-level ridge.[1][10] Wind shear continued to batter the cyclone, causing the latter's low-level center to separate from the central dense overcast.[11] Ivo passed just offshore Clarion Island around 12:00 UTC on August 23,[1] producing sustained winds of 60\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h) on the island.[12] Afterwards, Ivo's low-level center became separated from the convection as the cyclone decayed.[13] Continuous wind shear bombarded Ivo, causing the mid-level circulation to separate and leaving only a small area of convection near the center.[14] Cold 75\u00a0\u00b0F (24\u00a0\u00b0C) sea surface temperatures below and dry and stable air aloft caused all remaining convection to dissipate, with Ivo becoming a 35\u00a0mph (65\u00a0km/h) remnant low-pressure system around 06:00 UTC on August 25, located 445\u00a0mi (715\u00a0km) west of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula.[1][15] The low continued to track northwestward to north-northwestward while slowing down and weakening. The low became stationary on August 26 and turned towards the southeast, under the influence of a low-level steering flow, which was located west of the Baja California peninsula. The low opened up into a trough of low-pressure around 00:00 UTC on August 27.[1]"

Homes were flooded in Comond\u00fa, and people were rescued by boats. Minimal damage was inflicted to roadways in Los Cabos. Multiple landslides occurred around San Jos\u00e9 del Cabo and Cabo del Este.[24] Torrential rainfall from Ivo caused flooding throughout Sinaloa; the municipalities of El Rosario, Mazatl\u00e1n, Elota, Mocorito, and Guasave were the most severely affected,[25] with rainfall ranging from 70\u2013244\u00a0mm (2.8\u20139.6\u00a0in) occurring there.[22] A sinkhole formed in a section of the Mazatl\u00e1n-Culiac\u00e1n highway in the Elota Municipality.[25] The hole was at least 6.1\u00a0m (20\u00a0ft) long and 0.61\u00a0m (2\u00a0ft).[26] Another section of the highway was flooded after a canal overflowed, forcing a partial closure of the road at that point.[27] At least 180 homes were flooded in El Rosario.[25] Four bridges collapsed in El Rosario municipality, isolating nine rural villages.[28][29] Damage to the Monte Alto and La Batanga bridges was worsened as a result of heavy rainfall during Ivo, isolating communities along one bank of the Baluarte River.[30] Ivo worsened the damage to many roads, bridges, and other infrastructure that had previously been damaged by Hurricane Willa in 2018.[31] One temporary shelter was established, and the state government set up health and cleaning service groups during the storm.[28] Around 200 homes were inundated with 1\u00a0m (3.3\u00a0ft) of water in Mazatl\u00e1n.[25][19] The Jabalines river spilled its banks near the edge of Mazatl\u00e1n. Floodwaters and mud inundated homes in the Jacarandas and Lico Velarde neighborhoods.[29] At least 50 people were evacuated in the El Rosario, Indeco, Jacarandas, and Villa Jaraco neighborhoods and taken to shelters.[32][27] A canal overflowed in the Jacarandas neighborhood, inundating a school with 1 metre (3.3\u00a0ft) of water and mud. Furniture, technology, and records within the building were almost completely ruined.[33] One family in the neighborhood lost everything after floodwaters and mud inundated their house.[34] In the Lico Velarde neighborhood, heavy rainfall from Ivo worsened existing sewage problems.[35] The Guadalupe drain overflowed in Guasave, flooding dozens of homes.[29] Floodwaters damaged at least 200 homes in Guasave and 46 in Ahome.[36][37] In Los Mochis and Ahome, sewage systems collapsed.[28] At least fifteen neighborhoods were flooded throughout Los Mochis.[38] The storm caused flooding up to 12.5\u00a0mm (0.49\u00a0in) deep in the city, most severe in the Las Ma\u00f1anitas neighborhood. Three pumps were working to remove water from that neighborhood.[39] Several streets and the main access road to the neighborhood were flooded.[40] Streets were closed to traffic in the city to prevent waves, and 108 shelters were established for victims of the storm.[39] The Ju\u00e1rez drain overflowed near Los Mochis after Ivo clogged its sea outlet, flooding streets and fields, the latter of which damaged 800\u20131,000 hectares (2,000\u20132,500 acres) of crops.[41] At least five ejidos were inundated in Guasave.[28] The Culiac\u00e1n Water Park was entirely flooded as a result of heavy rainfall during Ivo, resulting in its closure. The nearby Black Bridge was closed by authorities, and a road in the Derivadora Dam was closed before the Culiac\u00e1n river overflowed.[42] In the Hacienda Alameda subdivision, Culiac\u00e1n, Ivo caused water pipes to rupture and washed away rubble from houses.[43] At least 180 homes were inundated by floodwaters in the town of Las Brisas.[44] In the Angostura Municipality, the towns of Chinitos and  Melchor Ocampo were left isolated, after water from an irrigation channel significantly damaged the Ford bridge. A shelter was established for people who lived on the banks of the channel.[45] In Acaponeta, Nayarit, five people were swept away by the overflowing El Cangrejo river.[28] The storm caused flooding and hail and in the state of Zacatecas.[22][23] Floodwaters up to 1\u00a0m (3.3\u00a0ft) were reported in the downtown region of Fresnillo. Six businesses and 25 homes were inundated, and 11 cars were stranded.[46][23] Torrential rainfall affected Naucalpan Municipality, Mexico State, flooding 16 homes and vehicles and streets. A landslide occurred in the San Lorenzo Totolinga neighborhood, near the Totolinga river, damaging a house and requiring the rescue of two children. At least 30 residences were flooded in Toluca.[47] The Hondo, Chico de Los Remedios, and Los Cuartos rivers spilled their banks, causing damage in several neighborhoods. Floodwaters damaged Calle 4 in San Rafael Chamapa. The Chico de Los Remedios river spilled its banks in Ribera de Echegaray, causing floodwaters and garbage to collide with a bridge on San Agust\u00edn avenue. This in turn caused additional flooding. The September 16 ravine also overflowed in Ribera de Echegaray.[48][49] The overflowing Chico de Los Remedios river inundated 12 houses in the Colon neighborhood, 10 in the Pastores neighborhood, and 8 in the El Conde neighborhood with water and mud. A landslide occurred in the Valle Dorado neighborhood, and another occurred on Rivera Street.[49] Heavy rainfall occurred in Iztapalapa, flooding streets in the neighborhoods of Lomas de Zaragoza, Santa Martha Acatitla, Chilpancingo Sur, and Ni\u00f1o Artillero Popular Ermita Zaragoza. The Water System of Mexico City requested that motorists avoid the eastern side of the city due to flooding.[50]"

Military vehicles helped to evacuate citizens to shelters.[51] Two shelters were set up at schools in Comond\u00fa.[52] At least 230 people were evacuated from their homes and taken to shelters.[53] Emergencies were declared for the cities of Los Cabos and Comond\u00fa in Baja California Sur.[28] Food was distributed to victims of the storm at a temporary shelter located at a school in Comond\u00fa.[54] The Baja California Sur state government requested funds from FONDEN, a natural disaster relief fund, to help with cleanup and repair efforts in Ciudad Insurgentes.[53] The commencement of school for 2019 in Ciudad Insurgentes was delayed for one day, as a result of heavy rainfall.[55] Municipal officials in Loreto, Baja California Sur, set up a collection site which stockpiled donations of medicine, blankets, clothes, diapers, canned food, powdered milk, and bottled water.[56] At least 56 families had to leave their homes in Mazatl\u00e1n as a result of torrential rainfall. Relief programs were established to support these families and small businesses that were impacted by the storm.[31] The Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources prevented the usage of backhoes to clear off beaches in Mazatl\u00e1n after strong waves from Ivo deposited algae there.[57] The governor of Sinaloa and the mayor of Los Mochis provided MX$80 million (US$4 million) in funds for 26 separate projects in order to fix drainage problems caused by Ivo throughout Ahome municipality.[58][59] Farmers in Los Mochis, Topolobampo, and Villa de Ahome worked to drain their fields to prepare for the next agricultural season, after the storm inundated the fields with up to 170\u00a0mm (6.7\u00a0in) of water.[60] Officials warned residents in Los Mochis not to drink tap water after Ivo damaged chlorine injectors, lowering the chlorination of the water.[61] The Autonomous University of Baja California Sur hosted a collection site for the victims of the storm, collecting food such as canned goods, water, pasta, and beans and items such as pallas, brooms, rakes, machetes, pickers, mops, hygiene products, cleaning products, medicine, and clothing. Collection sites were also established in Ciudad Constituci\u00f3n and Los Cabos municipality.[62] The Mazatl\u00e1n municipal government provided citizens affected by the storm in the November 20 neighborhood with over 200 household appliances and furniture items, including mattresses and bed bases, washing machines, stoves, and refrigerators.[63]  In Choix, Sinaloa, the mayor provided 12 schools with a collective total of 84 student desks, 230 chairs, 165 armchairs, 26 teacher chairs, and 30 teacher desks.[64] The Water Commission of the State of Mexico sent six suction-pressure trucks, two squadrons, and six bilge pumps to clear floodwaters from homes and streets in Naucalpan.[47] In Mexico City and Mexico State, military personnel assisted with draining water, cleaning residences, clearing debris, and assisting stranded motorists.[48][49] At least 250 people and 50 vehicles worked to remove mud and garbage from roads, houses, and the San Agust\u00edn bridge in Ribera de Echegaray.[49]"

The fifth named storm of the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, Emily formed from a small area of low pressure that developed along a cold front in late July 2017. Unexpectedly, the low rapidly organized and strengthened into a tropical depression on July 30, and then into a tropical storm early the next day. Emily continued to intensify as it moved eastward, peaking with maximum sustained winds of 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h) as it made landfall near Longboat Key on the western Florida coast. The cyclone weakened quickly into a tropical depression shortly after landfall as its circulation became increasingly disrupted. Emerging into the Atlantic Ocean on August 1, Emily continued to weaken as it accelerated northeastward, becoming post-tropical early on August 2. Heavy rainfall produced by Emily caused widespread flooding in southwest Florida, causing road closures and water damage to homes and buildings. An EF0 tornado spawned by the storm destroyed two barns and numerous greenhouses, as well as causing an engineered wall to collapse. Overall damages are estimated at $10 million (USD)."

        "content": "On July 30, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring an area of low pressure that was expected to develop along a dissipating cold front off the Louisiana coast for possible tropical cyclogenesis. Due to the low's proximity to land and only marginally favorable upper-level winds, development was expected to be slow to occur.[1] Unexpectedly, a period of rapid organization occurred during the following few hours, and the low became a tropical depression at 18:00\u00a0UTC on July 30. Although the NHC did not forecast the depression to strengthen further, it instead rapidly strengthened into Tropical Storm Emily just four hours after formation.[2] Despite environmental conditions being only marginally favorable for development, Emily continued to strengthen as it tracked eastward across the Gulf of Mexico. At 14:45\u00a0UTC, Emily made landfall near Longboat Key, Florida at peak intensity.[2] Operationally, Emily was assessed to have peaked with maximum sustained winds of 45\u00a0mph (75\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 1005\u00a0mbar (hPa, 29.68\u00a0inHg).[3] In post-season analysis, it was determined that it peaked with winds of 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 1001\u00a0mbar (hPa, 29.56\u00a0inHg).[2] Shortly after landfall, Emily rapidly weakened into a tropical depression, and its structure degraded significantly.[4] The small, disorganized system turned northeast and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean early on August 1; its center had become completely exposed by that time.[2] Despite periodic bursts of deep convection near its center, Emily failed to restrengthen. By 00:00\u00a0UTC on August 2, Emily no longer possessed a warm core, and it was declared a post-tropical cyclone.[5] Shortly afterward, the remnants of Emily dissipated off the Southeastern United States.[2]"

The tornado was on the ground for about 1.3\u00a0mi (2.1\u00a0km) and destroyed two barns and a few greenhouses, while an engineered wall collapsed, leaving about $96,000 in damage.[9] Torrential rains impacted parts of Miami Beach, with accumulations reaching 6.97\u00a0in (177\u00a0mm) in 3.5\u00a0hours, of which 2.17\u00a0in (55\u00a0mm) fell in just 30\u00a0minutes.[10] Coinciding with high tide the deluge overwhelmed flood pumps, with three of them shutting down due to lightning-induced power outages, and resulted in significant flash floods. Multiple buildings suffered water damage, with some having 2.5\u00a0ft (0.76\u00a0m) of standing water. One person was hospitalized after becoming stuck in flood waters.[11][12] Portions of Downtown Miami, such as Brickell, were also heavily affected; numerous vehicles became stranded in flooded roadways.[13] The NHC later assessed the flooding in Miami to be indirectly related to Emily, as the storm was losing tropical characteristics at the time.[2] Total damages from Emily are estimated to be about $10 million.[2]"

        "content": "Tropical Storm Cindy was a tropical storm in the Atlantic basin which became the first tropical cyclone to make landfall in Louisiana since Hurricane Isaac in 2012. The third named storm of the extremely active 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, Cindy formed out of a broad area of low pressure that developed in the northwestern Caribbean Sea near the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in mid-June 2017. The disturbance gradually organized as it drifted northwards into the Gulf of Mexico, and was first designated as a potential tropical cyclone by the National Hurricane Center on June 19, before organizing into a tropical storm the next day. While slowly moving to the northwest, Cindy's intensification was slow due to the effects of dry air and moderate to strong wind shear. After peaking with sustained winds of 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h) on June\u00a021, Cindy weakened slightly prior to making landfall in southwestern Louisiana on June 22. The storm quickly weakened after moving inland and degenerated into a remnant low on June\u00a023, dissipating over the Mid-Atlantic on the following day. Upon making landfall in Louisiana, the storm generated a peak storm surge up of 4.1\u00a0ft (1.2\u00a0m) and tides up to 6.38\u00a0ft (1.94\u00a0m) above normal in Vermilion Parish. However, coastal flooding mainly consisted of roads being inundated, while some beach erosion occurred. Due to Cindy's weak nature, only a few locations observed sustained tropical storm force winds. Consequently, wind damage was generally minor. Because the cyclone had an asymmetrical structure, heavy rainfall was observed over southeastern Mississippi, southwestern Alabama, and the far western Florida Panhandle, while lesser precipitation amounts fell over Louisiana and Texas. The storm and its remnants spawned 18\u00a0tornadoes throughout the Eastern United States, which caused just over $1.1\u00a0million (2017\u00a0USD) in damage.[nb 1] Overall, damage from Cindy totaled less than $25\u00a0million. Three fatalities were attributed to the cyclone, two direct and one indirect."

        "content": "In the second week of June, a large cyclonic gyre developed in the western Caribbean Sea during a positive phase of the Madden\u2013Julian oscillation. Convection was enhanced by two tropical waves, with the first emerging into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa on June\u00a04 and reached the gyre between June\u00a014 and June\u00a015.[1] As early as June\u00a013, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) anticipated that a broad low pressure area would develop in the northwestern Caribbean Sea, which had the potential for tropical cyclogenesis.[2] The second tropical wave began interacting with the gyre on June\u00a017,[1] resulting in the development of a broad low pressure area later that day.[3] The system moved north-northwestward over the eastern Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula on June\u00a018, accompanied by gale-force winds in its eastern periphery, but no well-defined circulation. On the next day, the low moved into the Gulf of Mexico with a large area of disorganized convection.[1] At 21:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a019, the NHC started issuing advisories on Potential Tropical Cyclone Three, due to the system's threat along the United States Gulf coast. At the time, the system had multiple circulations and no distinct center.[4] Early on June\u00a020, the Hurricane Hunters observed that multiple centers merged into a single circulation about 325\u00a0mi (525\u00a0km) south of Louisiana. The system moved to the north-northwest around a large ridge over the southeastern United States.[5] With these observations, the disturbance was designated as Tropical Storm Cindy, which developed at 18:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a020 about 240\u00a0mi (390\u00a0km) south-southwest of the mouth of the Mississippi River, based on the increased organization of the center.[6] The nascent Tropical Storm had its strongest winds northeast and northwest of the center in the primary area of convection. The thunderstorms were well north of the circulation due to strong wind shear and dry mid-level air.[7] Early on June\u00a021, despite a ragged satellite appearance, observations from the Hurricane Hunters and ships indicated that the storm intensified to reach maximum sustained winds of 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h) at 00:00\u00a0UTC. Cindy's broad structure and relatively unfavorable conditions prevented further strengthening. Around that time, the cyclone began moving north-northwest.[1] At 09:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a021, the NHC noted that Cindy \"does not look like a tropical cyclone\" and rather resembled a subtropical cyclone, with a large circulation and most of the convection displaced to the east.[8][9] The pressure bottomed out around 991 millibars (29.3\u00a0inHg) early on June\u00a022, despite its atypical appearance on satellite; the only thing maintaining it at tropical characteristics was a burst of convection that occurred near the center which wrapped into the southwestern quadrant of the storm.[10] Around 07:00\u00a0UTC that day, Cindy made landfall in extreme southwestern Louisiana just east of Sabine Pass with winds of 50\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h),[1] making Cindy the first named storm to strike the state since Hurricane Isaac in 2012.[11] Rapid weakening ensued once it moved inland, and it weakened to a depression shortly afterwards.[1] At 21:00\u00a0UTC, the NHC issued their last advisory on Cindy and announced that further advisories would be issued by the Weather Prediction Center (WPC).[12] Cindy continued to lose its tropical characteristics as it weakened gradually inland, and transitioned into a remnant low over western Kentucky at 18:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a023. The remnant low moved east-northeast across the Appalachia region and dissipated over the Mid-Atlantic states on the following day.[1]"

At 09:00\u00a0UTC on the next day, the tropical storm watch between Interacoastal City and Cameron, was upgraded to a tropical storm warning. The tropical storm warning was extended westward to High Island at 15:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a020, while the tropical storm watch was modified to stretch from High Island to San Luis Pass. Six hours later, the tropical storm watch was replaced with a tropical storm warning. Early on June\u00a021, the tropical storm warning was extended eastward to the Alabama\u2013Florida state line. Thereafter, parts of the warning were gradually lifted, until the last remaining portion was discontinued at 15:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a022.[1] Alabama Governor Kay Ivey and Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards declared state of emergencies for their respective states.[15] The Louisiana National Guard strategically placed 33\u00a0boats and about 100\u00a0high-water vehicles in 14\u00a0parishes.[16] About 125,000\u00a0meals and 200,000\u00a0liters were moved into Louisiana by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.[15]"

As a result of its asymmetrical structure, Cindy produced less rainfall in Louisiana and Texas, in the vicinity of where the storm moved ashore. Due to the weak nature of the cyclone, sustained winds reached tropical storm force at only a few locations, and consequently, wind damage was generally minor.

Consequently, wind impacts overall were minor. Rainfall was heavy in some areas, peaking at 7.82\u00a0in (199\u00a0mm) in St. Martinville. In Cameron Parish, low-lying areas were generally inundated with about 1 to 3\u00a0ft (0.30 to 0.91\u00a0m) of water, including portions of Highway 27 near Hackberry and Highway 82 near Grand Chenier and between Oak Grove and the Mermentau River. A number of roads were flooded in Calcasieu Parish, particularly in the vicinity of Lake Charles. Along the coast,\nstorm surge peaked at 4.1\u00a0ft (1.2\u00a0m) and tides reached 6.38\u00a0ft (1.94\u00a0m) above normal; both observations occurred at the Freshwater Canal in Vermilion Parish.

In Iberia Parish, coastal flooding caused several roads to be closed \u2013 including Highway 83 near Lydia \u2013 and damaged some equipment at the Port of Iberia. Although well inland, portions of Calcasieu Parish, especially Lake Charles, Sulphur, and Westlake, experienced tidal flooding due to wind-driven storm surge traveling up the Calcasieu River.[17] Near Leakesville, Mississippi, heavy rainfall caused the Chickasawhay River to rise nearly 9\u00a0ft (3\u00a0m) past flood stage and overflow its banks, collapsing an abandoned bridge.[18] In coastal Hancock County, Mississippi, over 300 streets were flooded. A shrimp trawler taking on water was rescued by the Coast Guard about 80\u00a0mi (130\u00a0km) offshore Galveston, Texas.[19] Numerous streets were flooded across Alabama, and statewide power outages topped out near 4,300. Flash flooding increased bacteria levels in rivers and streams, with E. coli detected in the Coosa River. Multiple trees were downed in Walker County.[20] The Tennessee Valley Authority lowered water levels in nine lakes across the state to limit the chances of flash flooding. Dozens of crashes were reported around Memphis, Tennessee, from the strong winds and heavy rainfall; a driver was killed after going off the road and slamming into a pole. Over a half dozen fires may have been caused by Cindy. At the height of the storm, at least 10,000\u00a0residents in the city were left without power. Arkansas State Highway 44 and State Highway 1 were forced to shut down.[19] In South Bend, Indiana, strong winds peeled off part of the roof to a high school, damaging ten classrooms. Nearby low-lying roads were flooded, and emergency crews rescued people from stranded vehicles.[21] In the Northeastern United States, heavy rainfall occurred with 1.08\u00a0in (27\u00a0mm) in Wilmington, Delaware, 1.37\u00a0in (35\u00a0mm) in Philadelphia,2.04\u00a0in (52\u00a0mm) in Staten Island, 2.78\u00a0in (71\u00a0mm) in Accident, Maryland, 3.2\u00a0in (81\u00a0mm) in Hopewell, New Jersey and 3.66\u00a0in (93\u00a0mm) in Bernville, Pennsylvania.[22]"

        "content": " Hurricane Donna, known in Puerto Rico as Hurricane San Lorenzo, was the strongest hurricane of the 1960 Atlantic hurricane season, and caused severe damage to the Lesser Antilles, the Greater Antilles, and the East Coast of the United States, especially Florida, in August\u2013September. The fifth tropical cyclone, third hurricane, and first major hurricane of the season, Donna developed south of Cape Verde on August\u00a029, spawned by a tropical wave to which 63\u00a0deaths from a plane crash in Senegal were attributed. The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Donna by the following day. Donna moved west-northwestward at roughly 20\u00a0mph (32\u00a0km/h) and by September\u00a01, it reached hurricane status. Over the next three days, Donna deepened significantly and reached maximum sustained winds of 130\u00a0mph (210\u00a0km/h) on September\u00a04. Thereafter, it maintained intensity as it struck the Lesser Antilles later that day. On Sint Maarten, the storm left a quarter of the island's population homeless and killed seven people. An additional five deaths were reported in Anguilla, and there were seven other fatalities throughout the Virgin Islands. In Puerto Rico, severe flash flooding led to 107\u00a0fatalities, 85\u00a0of them in Humacao alone. Donna further intensified to a Category\u00a04 hurricane early on September\u00a06, and attained peak winds of 145\u00a0mph (233\u00a0km/h) twenty-four hours later. The storm then weakened over the next few days, making multiple landfalls in The Bahamas as a Category\u00a03 hurricane. Donna generated severe wind gusts of up to 173\u00a0mph (278\u00a0km/h) over southern portions of the archipelago nation, and prolific rains affected the country and the nearby Turks and Caicos Islands. Several small island communities in the southern regions of The Bahamas were leveled, but no damage total or fatalities were reported. As it neared the United States, Donna encountered weaker steering currents, turned northwestward, and re-intensified. Early on September\u00a010, Donna made landfall on the Florida Keys with winds of 145\u00a0mph (233\u00a0km/h), the most severe observed there since 1935. Donna then weakened as it paralleled the southwestern Florida peninsula, making landfall south of Naples with winds of 120\u00a0mph (190\u00a0km/h). In the Florida Keys, coastal flooding severely damaged 75% of buildings, destroyed several subdivisions in Marathon. On the mainland, 5,200\u00a0houses were damaged, which does not include the 75% of homes damaged at Fort Myers Beach; 50% of buildings were also destroyed in the city of Everglades. Crop losses were also extensive. A total of 50% of the grapefruit crop was lost, 10% of the orange and tangerine crop was lost, and the avocado crop was almost destroyed. In the state of Florida alone, there were 13\u00a0deaths and $300\u00a0million in losses. Donna weakened over Florida and was a Category\u00a01 hurricane when it re-emerged into the Atlantic from North Florida. By early on September\u00a012, the storm made landfall near Topsail Beach, North Carolina, as a Category\u00a02 hurricane. Donna brought tornadoes and wind gusts up to 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h), damaging or destroying several buildings in Eastern North Carolina, while crops were damaged as far as 50 miles (80\u00a0km) inland. Additionally, storm surge caused significant beach erosion and structural damage at Wilmington and Nags Head. Eight people were killed and there were over 100\u00a0injuries. Later on September\u00a012, Donna reemerged into the Atlantic Ocean and continued to move northeastward. The storm struck Long Island, New York, late on September\u00a012 and rapidly weakened inland. On the following day, Donna became extratropical over Maine."

        "content": "On August 29, a tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa near Dakar. That day, it is estimated a tropical depression developed along the wave southeast of Cape Verde. There was a lack of data for several days, but it is estimated that the system gradually intensified. On September\u00a02, ships in the region suggested there was a tropical storm after reporting winds of over 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h). That day, the Hurricane Hunters flew into the system and observed a well-defined eye, along with winds of 140\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h).[1] Based on the data, the United States Weather Bureau office in San Juan, Puerto Rico, initiated advisories on Hurricane Donna at 22:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a02,[2] about 700 miles (1,100\u00a0km) east of the Lesser Antilles.[3] It is estimated that the storm attained hurricane status a day prior. The Azores High to the north was unusually powerful, which caused Donna to move to the west-northwest.[1] When advisories began, Donna was intensifying into a major hurricane, which is the equivalent of a Category\u00a03 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale; it would ultimately maintain this status for nearly eight\u00a0days.[4] Continuing to the west-northwest, Donna strengthened further, attaining maximum sustained winds of 125\u00a0mph (201\u00a0km/h) at 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a04\u2014an intensity it maintained for two more days.[4] Operationally, winds were estimated to be 145\u00a0mph (233\u00a0km/h).[5][6] Late on September\u00a04, the eye of Donna moved over Barbuda, Saint Barth\u00e9lemy, Saint Martin, and Anguilla, and passed just south of Anegada. Donna was then well-organized, described in the Monthly Weather Review as akin to \"an intense, idealized hurricane.\" A weakening trough to the north turned the hurricane more northwesterly, bringing it within 85 miles (137\u00a0km) of the north coast of Puerto Rico.[1] The storm then underwent further intensification to Category\u00a04 status on September\u00a06, and reached its first peak of 145\u00a0mph (233\u00a0km/h) by 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a07.[4] At that time, Donna began turning more to the west as a ridge built to its north, and it soon weakened back to Category\u00a03 status. Over the next few days, the intense hurricane moved slowly through the southern Bahamas without defined steering currents, and the eye passed near or over Mayaguana, Acklins, Fortune Island, and Ragged Island.[1] While passing through the Straits of Florida, Donna brushed the northern coast of Cuba on September\u00a09 with gale-force winds. Subsequently, a cold front moved eastward through the United States and weakened the ridge, causing the hurricane to turn more to the northwest. It re-intensified over warm sea surface temperatures,[1] and the hurricane's minimum barometric pressure dropped to 930\u00a0mbar (27\u00a0inHg) on September\u00a010.[4] Between 02:00 and 03:00\u00a0UTC that day, the 21-mile-wide (34\u00a0km) eye of Donna crossed through the Florida Keys at Conch Key, just northeast of Marathon, with sustained winds of 145\u00a0mph (233\u00a0km/h) and gusts to 178\u00a0mph (286\u00a0km/h). The hurricane continued to the northwest along the southwest coast of Florida, weakening due to interaction with the peninsula, before making landfall on Goodland, a short distance east of Marco Island, with winds of 120\u00a0mph (190\u00a0km/h).[4][1] Donna then traversed Naples and Fort Myers before turning inland to the northeast. At 0800\u00a0UTC on September\u00a011, Donna exited Daytona Beach into the western Atlantic with winds of about 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h), still as an organized hurricane. Accelerating to the northeast due to an approaching trough, the hurricane re-intensified slightly before making landfall near Wilmington, North Carolina, early on September\u00a012 with winds of 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h). At 0900\u00a0UTC that day, Donna again emerged over open waters near Virginia, although it had weakened, and the eye expanded to over 50 miles (80\u00a0km) in diameter. Late on September\u00a012, the hurricane made landfall near Brookhaven, New York, as a low-end Category\u00a02 hurricane with sustained winds of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h).[4][1][7] On September\u00a013, Donna became extratropical over northern Maine before entering eastern Canada, having become associated with the approaching cold front. After moving across Quebec and Labrador, Donna reached the Labrador Sea and dissipated early on September\u00a014.[1][4]"

        "content": "At noon on September 3, a hurricane watch was issued for the Leeward Islands, which at 6 p.m. was upgraded to a warning. Also at 6 p.m., hurricane watches were raised for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, which at 6 a.m. on September 4, were upgraded to warnings. By 6 a.m. on September 5, hurricane warnings were dropped for the Leeward Islands, and at 9 a.m., southwest Puerto Rico and the Virgin Island's hurricane warnings were downgraded to gale warnings. By noon, all remaining hurricane warnings for Puerto Rico were changed to gale warnings.[8] In Puerto Rico, flood warnings were issued on September\u00a05, although some residents in the region did not heed the notice; many returned to their homes after the hurricane passed to the north.[1] On Vieques Island, about 1,700\u00a0United States Marines evacuated to naval ships.[9] Officials advised small boats to remain at port, and thousands of residents evacuated to schools set up as Red Cross shelters.[10] Along the Cuban coast, about 3,000\u00a0people evacuated inland or to churches and schools;[11][12] while in the Bahamas, stores closed and boats were sent to port.[13] Beginning on September\u00a07, hurricane watches were put in place for the Florida coast from Key West to Melbourne. The next day, the watches were upgraded to hurricane warnings from Key West to Key Largo, with hurricane watches raised on the west coast northward to Fort Myers, and gale warnings issued from Key Largo to Vero Beach. By September\u00a011, hurricane warnings were in effect for southern Florida from Daytona Beach on the east coast to Cedar Key on the west coast, including Lake Okeechobee. Gale warnings were in place northward from Cedar Key to St. Marks, as well as from Daytona Beach northward to Savannah, Georgia.[8] Evacuations in the Florida Keys disrupted traffic along the Overseas Highway.[11] The Air Force evacuated 90\u00a0Boeing B-47 Stratojets from Homestead Air Reserve Base (At that time Homestead AFB). At Cape Canaveral, the threat of the storm caused the launching of two missiles to be postponed.[13] Most flights out of Miami International Airport were canceled during the storm's approach. Officials closed schools in Miami and the Florida Keys,[12] and recommended residents in low-lying areas of the Florida Keys and southwestern Florida to evacuate. Ultimately, about 12,000\u00a0people in southern Florida sought refuge in storm shelters, two of which were damaged during the storm.[14] In Miami-Dade County alone, there were 77\u00a0storm shelters housing 10,000\u00a0people.[15] At 5 p.m. on September 10, gale warnings were extended northward to Myrtle Beach. At 11 p.m., hurricane warnings were lowered in the Florida Keys but extended northward from Daytona Beach to Savannah, Georgia.[8] At 11 a.m. on September 11, all warnings were lowered south of Vero Beach and along the Florida west coast, while hurricane warnings were extended northward from Savannah to Myrtle Beach. At 5 p.m., hurricane warnings were lowered south of Fernandina Beach, while they were extended northward to include the entire North Carolina coast. Gale warnings were issued northward to Cape May. At 9 p.m., hurricane warnings were extended northward to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, while gale warnings and a hurricane watch were issued northward to Eastport, Maine.[16] Ships at dock in Newport, Rhode Island were towed out into the bay to weather the storm.[17] On September 12 at 5 a.m., hurricane warnings were extended northward to Eastport, and dropped south of Cape Hatteras. At 7 a.m., hurricane warnings were lowered south of Cape Charles. At 2 p.m., hurricane warnings were dropped south of Cape May. At 5 p.m., hurricane warnings were discontinued south of Manasquan, New Jersey. At 8 p.m., hurricane warnings expired south of Block Island. By 11 p.m. on September 12, all hurricane warnings had been lowered.[16]"

A weather station in Sint Maarten reported sustained wind gusts of 125\u00a0mph (201\u00a0km/h) and a 952\u00a0mbar (28.1\u00a0inHg) pressure reading in the main airport.[1] \nDonna killed two people on Antigua.[21] During the passing of Hurricane Donna, Anguilla recorded five deaths, including a woman who died when the roof of her house collapsed. Despite passing only 35\u00a0mi (56\u00a0km) north of the island, Donna caused only minor damage on St. Thomas in the United States Virgin Islands. A station there reported a wind gust of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h).[1] Some fences were toppled, while several houses were reported to have been damaged or destroyed. Electrical and telephone services were also disrupted. The highest daily rainfall total on the island was 8.78 inches (223\u00a0mm), causing minor local flooding. On Saint John, several small boats capsized. While passing to the north of Puerto Rico, Donna produced winds of 38\u00a0mph (61\u00a0km/h) in San Juan. Along the north coast of the island, high tides of around 6\u00a0ft (1.8\u00a0m) and strong waves caused coastal flooding.[1] The hurricane dropped torrential rainfall, peaking at 16.23\u00a0in (412\u00a0mm) at Naguabo in the central portion of the island. Large areas of eastern Puerto Rico received over 10\u00a0in (250\u00a0mm) of precipitation.[22] The hurricane left about 2,500\u00a0people homeless on the island.[13] Despite advanced warning of the floods, the hurricane killed 107\u00a0people on the island, of which 84 were in Humacao.[1] In Haiti, the southern periphery of the hurricane killed three people in Port au Prince.[21] Later, Donna brushed the north coast of Cuba with strong winds and heavy rainfall,[1] causing damage along much of the coast.[11] In Gibara, the storm wrecked 80\u00a0houses.[12]"

At Mayaguana, where residents evacuated to a missile tracking base, hurricane-force winds raged for 13\u00a0hours.[1] The winds largely destroyed the village of Abraham's Bay on the island.[23] Andros experienced hurricane-force winds for a few hours, and winds on Fortune Island were estimated at 173\u00a0mph (278\u00a0km/h) before the anemometer blew away. The strongest winds remained south of the northwestern Bahamas, which limited damage there.[1] Donna cut communications between several islands.[13] Several small island communities in the southern Bahamas were leveled.

Portions of southern and western Florida received over 10\u00a0in (250\u00a0mm) of rainfall from the hurricane, peaking at 13.24\u00a0in (336\u00a0mm).[22] Strong winds were observed in the state, with a sustained wind speed of 120\u00a0mph (190\u00a0km/h) in Tavernier and a gusts up to 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h) at Sombrero Key Light.[28] In Miami, winds reached 97\u00a0mph (156\u00a0km/h). Southeast of the city, high waves washed a 104-foot (32\u00a0m) freighter onshore an island.[14] The highest observed storm surge of 13\u00a0ft (4.0\u00a0m) was reported at Marathon. The hurricane also lashed Southwest Florida, where tides were 4 to 7 feet (1.2 to 2.1\u00a0m) above normal.[28] In the Florida Keys, some areas experienced \"almost complete destruction\".[28] In Key West, one death was confirmed, and 71\u00a0people were injured. About 564\u00a0homes were demolished, and an additional 1,382 were damaged, 583 of them severely.[29] Farther north, an estimated 75% of buildings were extensively damaged between Marathon and Tavernier. In the former, tides inundated the city and destroyed several subdivisions. Storm surge inundated parts of the Overseas Highway.[28] Six bridges between Marathon and Craig Key had been nearly or entirely swept away.[30] Many boats and docks were severely damaged or destroyed. Additionally, the pipeline supplying water to the Florida Keys was wrecked in three places.[28] In Miami-Dade County (then Dade County), thousands of low-lying homes in the Homestead area were flooded.[31] The storm also overturned 25\u00a0mobile homes and caused one death in the city. While telephone service remained mostly uninterrupted, approximately 152,000\u00a0people lost electricity.[32] Donna was the first hurricane to affect Miami, Florida, since Hurricane King in October 1950.[31] Although structural damage in and around Miami was generally light, winds shattered windows and uprooted trees. Heavy precipitation inundated streets.[32] Overall, 857\u00a0houses in Dade County were destroyed, while about 2,317\u00a0others suffered damage. Significant agricultural losses were also reported.[31] About 100\u00a0homes in Broward County reported minor damage.[33] In Boca Raton and Delray Beach, damage was mostly limited to downed billboard signs and shattered windows.[34]:\u200a6\u200a Boynton Beach observed wind gusts up to 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) at the inlet.[34]:\u200a1\u200a Storm surge covered State Road A1A with mud and sand.[34]:\u200a6\u200a In North Palm Beach, winds shattered a few windows and destroyed a shopping center sign.[34]:\u200a1\u200a A fire destroyed a cocktail lounge in Juno Beach after response teams were unable to extinguish the blaze due to high winds.[35] Large tracts of mangrove forest were lost in the western portion of Everglades National Park, while at least 35% of the white heron population in the park were killed.[36] The lodge and marina at Flamingo, as well as a ranger's way station near Cape Sable, were virtually destroyed.[30] Tides from Fort Myers Beach southward ranged between 4 and 7\u00a0ft (1.2 and 2.1\u00a0m) above normal. In Everglades City, about 50% of buildings were destroyed due to strong winds and coastal flooding, and roofs were blown off or damaged.[28] Floodwaters reached about 7\u00a0ft (2.1\u00a0m) in height inside the historic Collier County Courthouse, forcing refugees taking shelter in the building to evacuate to the second floor.[37] The city briefly became inaccessible due to inundated roads. Thousands of trees were toppled,[28] blocking portions of the Tamiami Trail.[14] Approximately half of the homes in Chokoloskee were destroyed, while floodwaters entered a number of homes in Ochopee. The community of Immokalee reported about $3\u00a0million in damage. In Naples, storm surge entered many high-priced homes, while the 900\u00a0ft (270\u00a0m) fishing pier was wrecked. A total of 19\u00a0cottages and 12\u00a0mobile homes at Gordon Pass were damaged beyond repairs. Throughout Naples, Donna demolished 87\u00a0homes and damaged 614\u00a0others in Everglades City. The Miami News described Vanderbilt Beach as being reduced to \"another welter of splintered homes.\"[37] Throughout Collier County, strong winds and coastal flooding combined destroyed 153\u00a0homes, severely damaged 409\u00a0others, and caused minor damage to 1,049\u00a0dwellings.[33] Donna left about $3\u00a0million in property damage and two deaths in Fort Myers. A new church in Bradenton was destroyed, while much of the city was left without power.[32] In Winter Haven, 13\u00a0homes were destroyed, 100\u00a0others suffered major damage, and 2,400\u00a0dwellings experienced minor damage. One person was killed in the city.[33] The turn into southern Florida lessened damage in the Tampa area.[38] High winds deroofed in armory building in Dade City sheltering 150\u00a0people.[32] In Volusia County, Donna destroyed 10\u00a0homes, severely damaged 112\u00a0homes, and caused minor damage to 1,100\u00a0others, while 25\u00a0buildings were demolished, 400\u00a0substantially damaged, and inflicted minor damage to 750\u00a0others. One fatality occurred in the county.[33][39] Throughout the state of Florida, the storm destroyed 2,156\u00a0homes and trailers, severely damaged 3,903, and inflicted minor impact on 30,524 others. Approximately 391\u00a0farm buildings were destroyed, an additional 989\u00a0suffered extensive impact, and 2,499 others received minor damage. Roughly 174\u00a0buildings were demolished, 1,029 received major impact, and 4,254 suffered minor damage. Additionally, 281\u00a0boats were destroyed or severely damaged. A total of 50% of grapefruit crop was lost, 10% of the orange and tangerine crops were ruined, and the avocado crop was almost destroyed. With at least $350\u00a0million in damage in Florida alone, Donna was the costliest hurricane to impact the state, at the time. Additionally, there were 14\u00a0confirmed fatalities: six from drowning, four from heart attacks, two from automobile accidents, and two from electrocution. About 1,188 others were injured.[40]"

Wind gusts of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) along the coast felled trees and tree limbs, resulting in electrical and telephone-service outages. In Brunswick, GA, a power outage at the power plant caused a minor explosion. Heavy rainfall temporarily flooded some streets in the city. Further north in South Carolina, gale-force winds were reported along the coast, but caused little damage. An F3 tornado struck areas just north of Downtown Charleston, destroying several houses and severely damaging a number of others. There were 10 injuries, some of which were caused by flying glass. Damage from this tornado was over $500,000. An F1 tornado also touched down in Garden City Beach, destroying or extensively damaging six buildings.[28][41] In Beaufort County, many trees were uprooted, power lines were downed, homes were unroofed, piers were destroyed, and there was significant damage to corn and soybean crops.[42] In North Carolina, Donna brought two tornadoes to the state. An F1 tornado damaged several small buildings in Bladen County. An F2 tornado in Sampson County destroyed a dwelling with eight occupants, all of whom were hospitalized.[41] Along the coast, wind gusts as high as 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) damaged or destroyed several buildings. Additionally crops were damaged as far as 50 miles (80\u00a0km) inland. Storm tides ranging from 4 to 8 feet (1.2 to 2.4\u00a0m) above normal caused significant beach erosion and structural damage at Wilmington and Nags Head.[28] Additionally, Topsail Beach was reported to have been 50% destroyed. In Southport, the town docks were almost completely demolished.[43] There were eight deaths, including three from drowning, two from falling trees, two from weather-related traffic accidents, and one from electrocution. At least 100\u00a0people were injured enough to require hospitalization.[28] Damage in North Carolina exceeded $5\u00a0million, with the worst impact occurring in New Hanover County.[43] In Virginia, the east coast of the state reported hurricane-force winds, while gusts reached up to 89\u00a0mph (143\u00a0km/h) in Virginia Beach.[19] Strong winds toppled trees and electrical wires, which blocked streets. Additionally, buildings suffered roof damage and broken windows; some structures were completely destroyed. Offshore, rough seas sank or destroyed numerous small crafts, while a 12,000 tonnes (26,000,000\u00a0lb) vessel was driven aground. The storm killed three people in Virginia; two of the deaths occurred when a barge collided with a freighter and later sank, and another after a man attempted to safeguard his boat. Strong winds and heavy rains were observed in eastern Maryland. Ocean City suffered the worst impact, with over $300,000 in property damage. The storm also damaged crops in the area, especially corn and apples. Effects from the storm in Delaware were similar, with property damage and considerable losses to corn and apple crops. In Pennsylvania, wind gusts up to 59\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h) in the southeastern portions of the state toppled many trees and utility wires. Heavy rains and poor drainage in some areas flooded basements, lawns, and streets. Low-lying areas in Bucks and Montgomery counties were inundated with up to 3 feet (0.91\u00a0m) of water after many streams and creeks nearby overflowed. One death in the state was reported after a boy was swept into a swollen creek behind his home in Sharon Hill.[28] Winds as strong as 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) were observed along the coast of New Jersey. Rainfall in the state was generally between 5 and 6 inches (130 and 150\u00a0mm),[28] with a peak of 8.99 inches (228\u00a0mm) near Hammonton.[44] Damage from the storm was most severe in Atlantic, Cape May, Monmouth, and Ocean counties, where numerous boats, docks, boardwalks, and cottages were damaged or destroyed.[28] A resort area in Cliffwood Beach, New Jersey saw its boardwalk and tourist attractions destroyed by the hurricane, and the area has never recovered. Losses to agriculture were significant, with damage to apple and peach trees \"considerable\", the former of which lost about one-third of its crops. Wind damage to corn, Sudan grass, and sorghum resulted in a delay in their harvest. Nine deaths were reported in the state of New Jersey. In southeastern New York, the eye of Donna crossed 10 miles to the eastern tip of Long Island. Heavy rains, hurricane-force winds, and \"unprecedented\" high tides were observed. Severe small stream flooding caused significant damage, especially on Long Island, the waterfront of New York City, and further north in Greene County. The storm caused three fatalities in the state, two from drowning and another from a person crushed by a falling tree.[28] The eye of Hurricane Donna crossed near the Connecticut and Rhode Island state line, thus much of the damage in Connecticut was in far eastern sections. Strong winds left 15,000\u00a0people without telephone service, while 88,000\u00a0homes lost electricity. Along the coast, tides caused beach erosion, inundated streets, and weakened foundations. Four seaside cottages were destroyed. Crop damage was isolated and mainly limited to apples and corn. In Rhode Island, the storm brought a wind gust as strong as 130\u00a0mph (210\u00a0km/h) to Block Island. Telephone and electrical services were severely disrupted. Along the coast, high tides significantly damaged or destroyed about 200\u00a0homes at Narragansett Bay and Warwick cove. Damage to these vessels collectively totaled to over $2\u00a0million. Agriculture also suffered impact, particularly to fruit, timber, and poultry, especially in Newport and Portsmouth.[28]"

Widespread telephone and power outages were reported.[28] The strong southwest winds associated with Donna, in combination with very little rainfall, led to a significant deposit of salt spray, which whitewashed southwest-facing windows. Many trees and shrubs saw their leaves brown due to the salt.[45] However, in other areas, 4 to 6 inches (100 to 150\u00a0mm) of precipitation fell, causing some washouts and local flooding. Waves along the coast ripped small boats and pleasure craft from their moorings and subsequently smashed them against rocks or seawalls.[28] In Vermont, winds damaged trees, tree branches, and power lines, causing telephone and electrical service outages in a few communities. Rainfall totals ranged 2\u20135 inches (51\u2013127\u00a0mm), resulting in washouts in some areas. Damage to apple orchards totaled $50,000. Along the coast of New Hampshire, many boats were smashed or damaged in some way. Strong winds felled trees and power lines, causing residents in the southern portions of the state to lose telephone service and electricity. Additionally, apple orchards suffered $200,000 in damage. Rainfall in the state peaked at 7.25 inches (184\u00a0mm) near Peterborough, resulting in local flooding and washouts.[28] Along the coast, large waves damaged 15 to 20\u00a0boats in Falmouth, Maine harbor. Total boat damage was estimated at $250,000. Coastal residents in low-lying beach areas of Cumberland and York counties were evacuated in Maine. Several counties lost power during the storm. In Southwest Harbor, lightning struck the Dirigo Hotel, causing a fire that resulted in $100,000 in damages. Winds caused a loss of telephone and electrical services in the Auburn-Lewiston area due to falling trees or tree branches. Television antennas were damaged, as were several signs, including a Sears sign. In addition, 25% to 40% of the apple crop was destroyed.[46] After becoming extratropical, the remnants of Donna continued northeastward into New Brunswick, Quebec, and then Labrador. Wind gusts of 53\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h) in Quebec snapped electrical poles and trees. One death occurred when a man suffered a heart attack when his home was threatened by a fire. Additionally, weather-related traffic accidents in the province resulted in two injuries.[47]"

Eisenhower issued a disaster declaration for Florida and North Carolina, allowing residents of those states to be eligible for public assistance.[48][49] The United States military sent a plane carrying doctors and food from Patrick Air Force Base to Mayaguana in the Bahamas.[23] Crews of doctors and workers with food and supplies left from Key West and Miami to traverse the Florida Keys, bringing aid to affected residents.[14] In Marathon, a large reconstruction program rehabilitated the key by Christmas.[50] Coral reefs were damaged in the Key Largo National Marine Sanctuary by the hurricane.[51] Donna caused a significant negative impact on aquatic life in north Florida Bay. Marine life was either stranded by retreating salt water which had been driven inland or killed by muddied waters in its wake. Oxygen depletion due to animals perishing in the hurricane caused additional mortality. Although salinity levels returned to normal within six weeks, dissolved oxygen concentrations remained quite low for a longer time frame. Marine life was scarce for several months in areas of greatest oxygen depletion. Sports fishing in the area took a few months to recover. Juvenile pink shrimp moved from their estuarine nursery grounds into deeper water about 60 miles (97\u00a0km) offshore, where they were subsequently captured by fishermen.[52] A Caspian tern was swept up the North American coast well to the north of its traditional breeding grounds, to Nova Scotia, which was witnessed four hours after the storm went by Digby Neck.[53] Because of storm's devastating impact, the name Donna was retired following the 1960 season, and will never again be used for another Atlantic hurricane. The name was replaced with Dora for the 1964 season, which was also retired after the said season.[54][55]"

        "content": "Nobel Prize-winner John Steinbeck wrote about Hurricane Donna in his 1962 non-fiction memoir Travels with Charley: In Search of America. Steinbeck had had a truck fitted with a custom camper-shell for a journey he intended to take across the United States, accompanied by his poodle Charley. He planned on leaving after Labor Day from his home in Sag Harbor, Long Island, New York. Steinbeck delayed his trip slightly due to Donna, which made a direct hit on Long Island. Steinbeck wrote of saving his boat during the middle of the hurricane, during which he jumped into the water and was blown to shore clinging to a fallen branch driven by the high winds. It was an exploit which foreshadowed his fearless, or even reckless, state of mind to dive into the unknown.[56] The winds of Donna can be seen in the feature film Blast of Silence (1961); the final scenes on Long Island had been previously scheduled, and the filmmakers decided to go ahead and shoot the exterior scene despite the hurricane.[57]"

        "content": " Hurricane Isbell was the final hurricane to affect the United States during the 1964 season. The eleventh tropical storm and sixth hurricane of the season, Isbell developed from a dissipating cold front in the southwestern Caribbean on October 8. The depression initially remained disorganized as it track northwestward, but strengthened into Tropical Storm Isbell on October 13. Re-curving northeastward, Isbell quickly strengthened further and reached hurricane status by later that day. Late on October\u00a013, Isbell made landfall in the Pinar del R\u00edo Province of Cuba. The storm continued strengthening and peaked as a Category 3\u00a0hurricane on the following day. Isbell moved northeastward and made landfall near Everglades, Florida, late on October\u00a014. After reaching the Atlantic on the following day, the storm began to weaken. Isbell turned northward and continued weakening, before transitioning to an extratropical cyclone while located just offshore eastern North Carolina on October\u00a016. The storm produced strong winds throughout western Cuba. Hundreds of homes were destroyed, as were several tobacco warehouses. There was at least $20\u00a0million in damage and four deaths in Cuba, three of them caused by collapsing houses in the Guane area. Several tornadoes in Florida caused significant damage. Throughout the state, 1 house was destroyed, 33 were severely damaged, and 631 suffered minor impact. Additionally, 66 trailers were destroyed and 88 were inflicted with major damage. Three deaths occurred in the state, one due to a heart attack and two from drowning in Florida Keys when their shrimp boat sank. Because the storm weakened considerably, impact in North Carolina was generally minor. The storm also spawned at least nine tornadoes in the state, which demolished trailers and unroofed homes and other buildings in several communities. Damage throughout the United States totaled $10 million."

        "content": "Hurricane Isbell was first identified as a weak tropical disturbance on October\u00a07, 1964 over the western Caribbean. Situated to the south of a diffuse trough, the system remained weak and relatively disorganized as it moved generally northwest near Honduras and Nicaragua. Despite the presence of an upper-level anticyclone, which promotes favorable outflow for tropical cyclones and aids in tropical cyclogenesis, a lack of distinct low-level inflow inhibited intensification. Additionally, an area of warm mid-tropospheric air was present within the cyclone. Though a disheveled system,[1] it is analyzed to have become a tropical depression by 12:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a08. The following day, the depression skirted the eastern coast of Honduras.[2] Operationally, it was not until October\u00a010 that the Weather Bureau initiated advisories on the depression.[1] On that date, a weather reconnaissance mission into the system found a weak low-level circulation with a barometric pressure of 1007.3\u00a0mb (hPa; 29.75\u00a0inHg) and winds of 20\u201330\u00a0mph (32\u201348\u00a0km/h) in squalls.[3] Throughout October\u00a011 and 12, the depression slowly executed a tight cyclonic loop over the northwestern Caribbean Sea. It finally organized into a tropical storm and was given the name Isbell by 00:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a013 after completing the loop and acquiring a north-northeast trajectory.[2] Throughout October\u00a013, marked intensification of the cyclone occurred.[1] Over a 24\u2011hour span, ending at 18:00\u00a0UTC, its central pressure fell from 1005\u00a0mb (hPa; 29.68\u00a0inHg) to 979\u00a0mb (hPa; 28.91\u00a0inHg) which was reflected in Isbell's winds more than doubling from 35 to 90\u00a0mph (56 to 145\u00a0km/h).[2] Shortly thereafter, the storm made landfall in extreme western Cuba, near Guane, before emerging over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico.[1] Isbell's brief stint over land did not hinder development, which continued unabated until 12:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a014 at which time it reached its maximum intensity. Situated to the south of Key West, Florida, Isbell attained winds of 125\u00a0mph (201\u00a0km/h) which ranks it as a Category\u00a03 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale. Additionally, its central pressure bottomed out at 964\u00a0mb (hPa; 28.47\u00a0inHg).[2] Around this time, a new low-pressure area formed 300\u00a0mi (480\u00a0km) to Isbell's northwest over the Gulf in response to a powerful cold-core low over the Mississippi Valley. The cyclonic flow of this second system brought cool, dry air from the north and circulated it into the hurricane. This in turn caused the storm to become asymmetric in structure with radar imagery indicating little to no reflectivity along the western periphery of the hurricane.[1] The degrading structure of Isbell resulted in some weakening as it accelerated toward Florida. At 22:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a014, the hurricane made landfall near Everglades City as a Category\u00a02 with sustained winds between 100 and 110\u00a0mph (160 and 180\u00a0km/h).[1][4] Within five hours, the system cleared the Florida Peninsula and emerged over the western Atlantic Ocean north of West Palm Beach.[5] The storm's passage over land resulted in notable weakening, though Isbell remained of hurricane-strength. During the afternoon of October\u00a015, the low that had formed the previous day induced a northward turn of the cyclone and directed it toward North Carolina, a result of what is known as the Fujiwhara effect.[1] Thereafter, the two systems began to intertwine as Isbell began transitioning into an extratropical cyclone; rapid weakening accompanied this phase.[6] Isbell completed this process by 12:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a016 as it moved onshore near Morehead City, North Carolina.[2][6] On October\u00a017 the two non-tropical systems merged into a single storm over the Outer Banks.[6] Isbell's remnants emerged back over the Atlantic Ocean on October\u00a018 near the Delmarva Peninsula before accelerating northeast. The system was last noted on October\u00a019 as it moved over Atlantic Canada.[7]"

        "content": "In Cuba, thousands were evacuated due to flooding lowlands.[8] Advisories were broadcast and issued warning of the possibility of heavy rains and winds, isolated small hail, and possible isolated tornadoes in Florida from 21:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a014 to 02:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a015. The aviation severe weather forecast also warned residents in south and central Florida of up to 0.75\u00a0in (19\u00a0mm) of hail, gusts of up to 53\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h), and the potential for tornadic activity. Flood warnings were also issued, with predictions of flooding 4\u00a0ft (1.2\u00a0m) above flood stage.[9] Emergency preparations at Key West's weather office were made. In the morning hours of October\u00a013, the office alerted city, county, and military officials. In the afternoon, they completed office preparations and scheduling. On October\u00a014, the office requested radio stations to stay on the air and relayed hourly reports.[10] In North Carolina, some tidal flooding was also forecast. People were warned to tune to television and radio broadcasts.[11] On October\u00a015, as Isbell rapidly crossed Florida, forecasters at the Charleston, South Carolina Weather Bureau warned of high tides of up to 12\u00a0ft (3.7\u00a0m), 5\u00a0ft (1.5\u00a0m) above flood-stage, from South Carolina into North Carolina. Owing to the continued northeastward movement of the storm, tides ultimately did not exceed 2\u00a0ft (0.61\u00a0m) in South Carolina.[12] Across coastal areas of North Carolina, alerts for severe thunderstorms, tornadoes, and high tides were raised; however, the storm greatly diminished before reaching shore and little damage materialized.[13] Moderate rains along the lower Neuse River basin were expected to prolong flooding triggered by Hurricane Hilda and its remnants earlier in October.[14] Small craft advisories were raised northward to Provincetown, Massachusetts, through October\u00a018.[15]"

Additionally, pressures at the city fell to 979 mbar (hPa; 28.91\u00a0inHg).[1] Heavy rains caused rivers to over-top their banks, forcing thousands of people to evacuate.[17] Three fatalities occurred in Guane due to collapsing homes.[1][18] A fourth fatality took place elsewhere in Cuba.[19] Numerous homes were damaged or destroyed by the storm, with exact numbers unknown. The region's tobacco crop also sustained considerable losses with fields and warehouses destroyed.[16] The damage to agriculture compounded economic losses in Cuba that resulted from Hurricane Flora in September 1963, which devastated the nation, as well as impacts from Hurricanes Cleo and Hilda earlier in 1964.[20] The combined effects of Cleo, Hilda, and Isbell resulted in economic losses of approximately $100\u00a0million in the country, of which at least $20\u00a0million was directly attributed to Isbell.[21]"

        "content": "Though Isbell struck the state as a Category\u00a02 hurricane,[4] no winds in excess of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) were reported. Measurements peaked at 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) at both Everglades City and Indiantown. Hurricane-force gusts were measured in Belle Glade, Fort Lauderdale, Key West, Pompano Beach, and West Palm Beach. Atmospheric pressures fell to 970.7\u00a0mb (hPa; 28.67\u00a0inHg) in the Dry Tortugas and 977.5\u00a0mb (hPa; 28.87\u00a0inHg) on the mainland in Juno Beach.[1] Rainfall in the state was relatively limited owing to the brisk movement of the storm, though a frontal system immediately preceding the hurricane brought heavy rains to the state. A peak total of 9.46\u00a0in (240\u00a0mm) was measured in West Palm Beach, though an estimated 80% of this was attributable to the front.[7] Amounts from the hurricane itself were likely around 5\u00a0in (130\u00a0mm). No major storm surge was reported during Isbell's passage due to greatly weaker winds in the back half of the storm. Tides in Key West rose 4 to 5\u00a0ft (1.2 to 1.5\u00a0m) above normal.[1] Throughout Florida, three people were killed in relation to the storm and no more than $10\u00a0million in damage occurred, with more than half of which was attributed to agricultural losses.[1] In addition, 76\u00a0people were injured, 12\u00a0of whom required hospitalization. Structural damage was relatively limited, with only 63\u00a0homes and businesses, mostly trailers, being destroyed; 159\u00a0other structures sustained major damage while a further 631\u00a0experienced minor damage.[22] The majority of damage from Isbell was not from the hurricane itself but rather tornadoes spawned by its outer bands.[1] At least nine, and as many as twelve, tornadoes affected the state with the greatest effects being felt in the Miami metropolitan area. All storm-related injuries were attributed to these tornadoes as well as the majority of structural damage.[23] According to the National Climatic Data Center, four of these tornadoes were of F2 intensity.[24] Despite the close passage of the storm to the Florida Keys, damage in the area was light and amounted to $175,000.[1] Of this, $125,000 was attributed to structural damage. Hurricane-force winds in the archipelago only lasted 15\u00a0minutes and gale-force winds occurred over a 5-hour span. The brevity of damaging winds limited the effects of the storm. Most damage was constrained to downed trees, signs, and power poles. Two trailers were overturned, however, and an oil barge sank in the Key West Harbor.[25] Two people drowned after their shrimp boat was destroyed.[1] In and around the Fakahatchee Strand Preserve State Park, Royal Palms, and Royal Poincianas were defoliated by the hurricane's winds. Downed trees and power lines in Collier County temporarily left many customers without phone and electrical service. Residents in nearby Lee Cypress stated that the effects from Isbell were worse than Hurricane Donna which struck the region as a Category\u00a04 in September 1960.[26] Palm Beach County was the most affected area, accounting for more than half of the losses,[22][27] and approximately $700,000\u00a0in damage.[28] One indirect death occurred when a man suffered a heart attack in Lake Worth while installing storm shutters.[1][28] At least three tornadoes were spawned in Palm Beach County. The strongest was an F2 that struck a trailer park in Briny Breezes, damaging numerous trailers and injuring 22\u00a0people. Shortly thereafter the same tornado or possibly a second one struck Boynton Beach, injuring three people and damaging several structures.[23][24] The event lasted roughly 20\u00a0minutes and the tornadoes moved along a path 10\u00a0mi (16\u00a0km) long.[29][30] Another tornado in Boca Raton caused a number of minor injuries. In West Palm Beach, a twister that crossed the intersection of State Roads 802 and 809 damaged adjacent properties and injured several people.[23] Throughout Palm Beach County, 492\u00a0homes suffered damage, while 36\u00a0mobile homes were demolished and 60\u00a0others were inflicted major impact. Additionally, 33\u00a0farm buildings and 9\u00a0small businesses were severely damaged or destroyed.[22] In Martin County, an F2 was spawned in Hobe Sound and affected the area near U.S. Route 1.[23] About 39\u00a0homes and 13\u00a0mobile homes were damaged, while two farm buildings and two businesses also received impact.[22] The fourth F2 tornado was spawned in Brevard County near Eau Gallie. It caused extensive damage and injured 17\u00a0people in the Orange Court trailer park.[23][24] Collectively, 35\u00a0homes in Flagler and Volusia counties were damaged.[22]"

In and around the Columbia, South Carolina area, 3 to 6\u00a0in (76 to 152\u00a0mm) of rain fell, with a peak of 6.11\u00a0in (155\u00a0mm) in the city itself. Significant flooding took place along all rivers in the state;[31] the Broad River crested at 32.1\u00a0ft (9.8\u00a0m), its highest level since 1940, in Blair. The Pee Dee River rose to 39\u00a0ft (12\u00a0m) at Cheraw by October\u00a018, roughly 9\u00a0ft (2.7\u00a0m) above flood-stage.[32] The cotton crop sustained the greatest losses during the event, with damage estimated in excess of $1\u00a0million.[31] Along the coast, tides rose to 6.2\u00a0ft (1.9\u00a0m), 2.1\u00a0ft (0.64\u00a0m) above normal, in Charleston Harbor. What little coastal flooding took place mostly resulted from wave run-up rather than tidal flooding. Some beach erosion occurred in exposed areas.[33] Much of North Carolina was affected by Isbell with rain extending into interior parts of the state. Totals were generally light, however, and peaked at around 5\u00a0in (130\u00a0mm) in eastern areas. Some flash flooding took place in the Piedmont, though overall effects were minimal.[34] In the Blue Ridge Mountains, the French Broad River topped its banks and prompted evacuations in Hot Springs and Marshall.[15] The greatest impacts were felt along the Neuse River in Kinston within Lenoir County. Rains from Isbell exacerbated ongoing floods in the area, resulting in heavy damage to many homes.[32] A man was swept away by swift currents near a Duke Energy steam plant in Cliffside; however, it is unknown if he perished or was later rescued.[35] Losses to the peanut crop were extensive, though no monetary value is available.[1] With the storm arriving at low-tide, no notable coastal flooding occurred.[34] The significant weakening of Isbell prior to landfall also lessened the effects from wind as gale-force winds were mostly constrained to coastal areas; a peak gust of 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h) was measured in Elizabeth City.[1] Elsewhere along the East Coast, the remnants of Isbell produced generally light to moderate rain. A localized maximum of around 5\u00a0in (130\u00a0mm) occurred in Massachusetts as the system began to dissipate.[7] Immediately following the storm, an unseasonably strong cold front brought near-freezing temperatures to Virginia, resulting in frost. The combination of the cold air and the hurricane prevented any peanut bumper crop harvesting in the state.[36]"

        "content": " The 1933 Outer Banks hurricane lashed portions of the North Carolina and Virginia coasts less than a month after another hurricane hit the general area. The twelfth tropical storm and sixth hurricane of the 1933 Atlantic hurricane season, it formed by September\u00a08 to the east of the Lesser Antilles. It moved generally to the north-northwest and strengthened quickly to peak winds of 140\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h) on September\u00a012. This made it a major hurricane and a Category 4 on the Saffir-Simpson scale.[nb 1] The hurricane remained at or near that intensity for several days while tracking to the northwest. It weakened approaching the southeastern United States, and on September\u00a016 passed just east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina with winds of about 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h). Turning to the northeast, the hurricane became extratropical on September\u00a018 before moving across Atlantic Canada, eventually dissipating four days later. The threat of the hurricane prompted widespread tropical cyclone warnings and watches along the eastern United States and prompted some people to evacuate. Damage was heaviest in southeastern North Carolina near New Bern, where the combination of high tides and swollen rivers flooded much of the town. Across North Carolina, the hurricane caused power outages, washed out roads, and damaged crops. Several houses were damaged, leaving about 1,000\u00a0people homeless. Damage was estimated at $4.5\u00a0million,[nb 2] and there were 21\u00a0deaths in the state, mostly from drowning. Hurricane-force winds extended into southeastern Virginia, where there were two deaths. High tides isolated a lighthouse near Norfolk and covered several roads. Farther north, two people on a small boat were left missing in Maine, and another person was presumed killed when his boat sank in Nova Scotia."

        "content": "Beginning on September\u00a07, there was an area of disturbed weather near and east of the Lesser Antilles,[3] by which time there was a nearly closed circulation. At 0800\u00a0UTC the next day, a ship reported winds of about 35\u00a0mph (56\u00a0km/h); on that basis, it is estimated a tropical depression developed eight hours earlier and into a tropical storm by the time of the report. The storm tracked generally to the north-northwest,[4] passing about 300\u00a0mi (480\u00a0km) northeast of Saint Martin. Based on continuity and subsequent reports, it is estimated the storm intensified into a hurricane on September\u00a010. Early on September\u00a012, a ship reported a barometric pressure of 947\u00a0mbar (28.0\u00a0inHg) in the periphery of the storm while reporting winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h). This suggested winds of 140\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h), making it the equivalent of a modern Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale.[4] For over two days, the hurricane remained near peak intensity while tracking to the northwest, and during that time several ships reported low pressure and strong winds. The hurricane weakened as it turned to the north-northwest toward the eastern United States. At around 1100\u00a0UTC on September\u00a016, the eye of the hurricane passed over Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, around which time a pressure of 957\u00a0mbar (28.3\u00a0inHg) was recorded. The eye also passed over Diamond Shoals, where a pressure of 952\u00a0mbar (28.1\u00a0inHg) was recorded. Based on the reading, it was estimated the hurricane remained about 15\u00a0mi (24\u00a0km) east of the Outer Banks, with winds of about 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) occurring along the coast. By that time, the size of the storm had greatly increased, and hurricane-force winds also extended into southeastern Virginia.[4] The hurricane turned to the northeast, ahead of an approaching cold front,[5] producing tropical storm force winds along the eastern United States through New England. After passing southeast of Cape Cod, the storm increasingly lost its tropical characteristics, and was an extratropical cyclone by 1100\u00a0UTC on September\u00a018 when it made landfall on eastern Nova Scotia. Continuing to the northeast, the former hurricane crossed the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and subsequently near Newfoundland, eventually dissipating on September\u00a022 between southern Greenland and Iceland.[4]"

        "content": "While the hurricane was approaching the Carolinas, the Weather Bureau issued storm warnings from Jacksonville, Florida to Beaufort, North Carolina at 2100\u00a0UTC on September\u00a014. Six hours later, these were extended northward to Virginia Capes. By 1530\u00a0UTC on September\u00a015, forecasters predicted that the hurricane would hit North Carolina in 12\u00a0hours and ordered hurricane warnings from Wilmington, North Carolina to Cape Hatteras. At the same time, the storm warning was expanded northward to Boston, Massachusetts, and later to Eastport, Maine. The early warnings gave ample time for preparation for the storm in Norfolk, reducing damages considerably.[3] Residents in Virginia evacuated farther inland to escape the storm.[6] The outer rainbands of the hurricane dropped moderate to heavy rainfall, peaking at 12.6\u00a0in (320\u00a0mm) in Cape Hatteras.[5] Due to the storm remaining offshore, damage was much less than another hurricane less than a month prior. Damage from this hurricane was heaviest near New Bern, North Carolina, where the storm surge reached 3 to 4\u00a0ft (0.91 to 1.22\u00a0m), which was 2\u00a0ft (0.61\u00a0m) higher than the record set in 1913.[3] Much of the town was flooded due to the high tide and swollen nearby rivers.[6] Strong winds in the city uprooted several trees and damaged roofs. Morehead City suffered similar but slightly lesser damage, including hundreds of downed trees, and Beaufort experienced one of its worst storms in the memory of its residents.[3] Across the region, the storm downed telephone and telegraph lines. Several roads were washed out, and there was moderate agriculture damage, including hundreds of drowned livestock and flooded cotton crop. There were 21\u00a0deaths, mostly related to drownings, and damage was estimated at $4.5\u00a0million. About 1,000\u00a0people were left homeless.[7] After the storm, relief agencies provided food and medical crews for the storm victims.[8] In southeastern Virginia, winds reached 79\u00a0mph (127\u00a0km/h).[4] At Sewell's Point in Norfolk, the storm produced 8.3\u00a0ft (2.5\u00a0m) high tides, which turned the peninsula containing New Point Comfort Light into an island.[9] Several roads were flooded, which disrupted traffic and forced residents to travel by rowboat.[7] About 2,000\u00a0people lost power, and due to well-executed preparations, there were two deaths in the state.[10] Damage was estimated at $250,000.[7] Outside of Virginia, damage was minimal north of Cape Henry. Wind peaks included 48\u00a0mph (77\u00a0km/h) in Atlantic City, New Jersey and 52\u00a0mph (84\u00a0km/h) on Block Island.[3] A boat required rescue in the Delaware Bay.[6] Precipitation fell on the western periphery of the hurricane, associated with an approaching cold front. In Provincetown, Massachusetts, the storm dropped 12.3\u00a0in (310\u00a0mm) of rainfall it passed the region.[5] In New England, high waves damaged waterfront properties. On Block Island, two boats were damaged, and another sank.[7] In Maine, the rainfall flooded cellars and damaged roads. Two people were reported missing in Boothbay Harbor after venturing into the storm in a small boat.[11] Still maintaining strong winds by the time it struck Canada, the former hurricane washed one boat ashore, left three missing, and capsized one. One person was presumed killed when his boat sunk in Lockeport, Nova Scotia. The storm dropped heavy rainfall across the region, including 1.1\u00a0in (28\u00a0mm) in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, and about 3\u00a0in (76\u00a0mm) in 15\u00a0hours in Gagetown, New Brunswick; there, the rains flooded roads and damaged crops. At Harvey Station in the same province, high rainfall washed out a 75\u00a0ft (23\u00a0m) portion of a rail line.[12]"

New England was most affected, though so were the Outer Banks, Mid-Atlantic states, and the Canadian Maritimes. The storm's ferocity and path drew comparisons to the 1938 Long Island Express, one of the worst storms in New England history. Its precursor was first identified well east of the Lesser Antilles on September\u00a04, but the disturbance only became well organized enough to be considered a tropical cyclone on September\u00a09 northeast of the Virgin Islands. Tracking west-northwest, the storm gradually intensified, curved northward, and reached peak intensity as a Category\u00a05 hurricane on September\u00a013 north of the Bahamas. A day later, the storm passed the Outer Banks and later made landfall on Long Island and Rhode Island as a weaker hurricane on September\u00a015. The storm eventually became an extratropical cyclone, moving northeast, and merged with another extratropical system off Greenland on September\u00a016."

        "content": "The origins of the 1944\u00a0hurricane can be traced back to a tropical wave first identified well east of the Lesser Antilles on September\u00a04. Over the next few days, the disturbance slowly traversed west-northwestward without producing any significant weather that would hint at tropical cyclogenesis. On September\u00a07, an area of low pressure, albeit disorganized, formed in association with the tropical wave east of Barbados.[1] The following day, the barometric depression became more well-defined, prompting the Weather Bureau in San Juan, Puerto Rico to issue advisories on the tropical disturbance. As a result of the sparseness of available surface observations east of the Lesser Antilles, a reconnaissance flight was dispatched to investigate the storm late on September\u00a09; the flight reported that the disturbance had strengthened into a newly formed but fully-fledged hurricane.[2] Due to the seemingly rapid development of the storm, the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project concluded that the storm likely began earlier and as a weaker system; thus, HURDAT\u2014the official track database for hurricanes in the North Atlantic dating back to 1851\u2014lists the tropical cyclone as having begun a tropical storm with winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) at 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a09.[3] After formation, the tropical cyclone gradually intensified as it slowly moved west-northwestward, reaching the threshold for hurricane intensity at 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a010 while north of the Virgin Islands. Strengthening continued thereafter, and by September\u00a012, the storm reached an intensity equivalent to a Category\u00a03\u00a0hurricane on the modern-day Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale. Later that day, the cyclone strengthened further into a Category\u00a04-equivalent and was given the moniker of \"Great Atlantic hurricane\" by the Weather Bureau in Miami, Florida.[2][3] Concurrently, the tropical cyclone began to curve and accelerate towards the north.[2] At 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a013, the hurricane reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 160\u00a0mph (260\u00a0km/h),[3], and five hours later, a ship in the eye documented a minimum barometric pressure of 919\u00a0mbar (hPa; 27.14\u00a0inHg) alongside 15-knot (17\u00a0mph; 28\u00a0km/h) winds, suggesting a central pressure of 918\u00a0mbar (918\u00a0hPa; 27.1\u00a0inHg). The storm's pressure may have been lower during its lifespan, though the 909\u00a0mbar (909\u00a0hPa; 26.8\u00a0inHg) pressure suggested by meteorologist Ivan Ray Tannehill was considered too low.[1] The hurricane began to gradually weaken after reaching peak intensity on September\u00a013.[3] In the morning hours of September\u00a014,[2] the storm passed just east of Cape Hatteras and eastern Virginia as a small but powerful hurricane with winds of 125\u00a0mph (201\u00a0km/h).[1] Afterwards, the cyclone curved slightly further towards the northeast and continued to accelerate;[2] at 02:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a015, the hurricane made landfall near Southampton in eastern Long Island with winds of 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h).[1] The storm then crossed the island and Long Island Sound before making a second landfall two hours later near Point Judith, Rhode Island as a slightly weaker storm with winds of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h).[1][2] After crossing Rhode Island and Massachusetts, the tropical system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone off the coast of Maine on September\u00a015;[1] these extratropical remnants continued to track towards the northeast and across the Canadian Maritimes before they were last noted merging with another extratropical cyclone off of Greenland at 12:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a016.[2][3]"

In Miami, Florida, the American Red Cross began preparing its resources for a potential regional calamity; however, the Weather Bureau did not necessarily anticipate the storm striking Miami.[6] Royal Air Force aircraft stationed in Nassau were flown to Miami in order to avoid the storm.[7] Although tropical cyclone naming was not in practice at the time,[8] the Weather Bureau in Miami, Florida, began naming the system the \"Great Atlantic hurricane\" in their public advisories on September\u00a012 to better convey the life-threatening risks associated with the powerful hurricane.[2] The following day, storm warnings were issued for areas from the United States East Coast from Savannah, Georgia to Cape Hatteras. Small craft in offshore areas further south were advised to remain in port.[9] As Morehead City, North Carolina was forecast to be submerged under several feet of water, the city's entire population was evacuated; other resort locales along the coast of North Carolina were also evacuated. Similarly, the 3000\u20134000\u00a0personnel constituting Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point were evacuated inland; U.S. Army and Navy aircraft were also sent inland.[10] As the hurricane was passing near the Outer Banks, hurricane warnings were extended as far north as Portland, Maine, and storm warnings were issued as far north as Eastport, Maine.[11] Precautions across New England and Mid-Atlantic states began in earnest once the storm began tracking northwards. Sixty buses were readied in Ocean City, Maryland to evacuate the seaside resort's permanent and tourist residents.[12] The 3,000\u00a0residents of Fire Island, one of the barrier islands off of Long Island, were ordered to evacuate the islet. Nearby, the Brooklyn Red Cross Chapter began readying for possible relief work, stocking five mobile canteens with emergency rations.[13] The United States First Naval District were directed to have personnel and rescue craft on standby to respond to emergencies. The Massachusetts State Police began relaying Weather Bureau bulletins to local public services via telecommunications. Personnel on duty were called back to barracks for later deployment in relief operations.[11] The Massachusetts National Guard were ordered to standby and prepare for potential assistance of regional emergency services.[14] Other Massachusetts state agencies were also allocating resources to aid in relief operations.[11]"

The highest reported wind speeds in the state occurred at Hatteras, where 5-minute sustained winds peaked at an estimated 85\u00a0mph (135\u00a0km/h).[1] With the eye remaining mostly offshore, the resulting impacts of the hurricane in the state were limited to areas east of the 77th meridian west.[15]:\u200a72\u200a[16] The hurricane inflicted about $1\u00a0million in crop damage and $450,000 in property damage in North Carolina, with wind-related impacts accounting for most of the damage toll.[16] More than 600\u00a0buildings were damaged in the central and northern coastal areas of the state, of which 108 were destroyed.[17] The Weather Bureau enumerated 3,279\u00a0damaged buildings and 389\u00a0destroyed buildings across the state.[2]:\u200a189\u200a Telecommunications were also disrupted throughout the North Carolina coast between Morehead City and the state border with Virginia.[18]:\u200a1\u200a One person was killed and 28 were injured statewide.[2]:\u200a185 The Outer Banks were particularly hard-hit by the passing storm; while the strong southeasterly winds accompanying the hurricane's approach pushed water from Pamlico Sound westward, opposing winds that followed the storm's passage caused the backed up water to surge back east, flooding villages in the Outer Banks.[15]:\u200a73\u200a Storm surge along unprotected coastline destroyed hundreds of boats, damaged boardwalks, and deposited debris along the Carolina beaches.[13] At Hatteras, the tide level crested at 7\u00a0ft (2.1\u00a0m) above the mean low tide.[2]:\u200a189\u200a The raised seas inundated coastal farmland and homes with 2\u20134\u00a0ft (0.61\u20131.22\u00a0m) of water.[13][15]:\u200a73\u200a At Avon, this surge of water accumulated between sand barriers surrounding the community, separating homes from their foundations and sending them adrift; 96\u00a0homes in Avon either sustained severe damage or were washed away.[15]:\u200a73\u201374\u200a Rodanthe was also hard-hit, with the storm destroying the community's cistern water systems destroyed and leaving only two of its homes standing.[19] At Roanoke Island, the storm tides reached 1\u00a0ft (0.30\u00a0m) higher than any previous storm on record there. Manteo was inundated under 6\u00a0ft (1.8\u00a0m) of water while Wanchese at the southern end of the island experienced tides reaching 10\u00a0ft (3.0\u00a0m).[20]:\u200a1\u200a The island was also subjected to wind gusts as strong as 120\u00a0mph (195\u00a0km/h), contributing to widespread damage to homes and transportation infrastructure.[21] Many summer cottages along the beach at Nags Head were unroofed and all telecommunications and power lines along a 15\u00a0mi (24\u00a0km) stretch of the beach were blown down. One person was killed at Nags Head after being electrocuted by a fallen power line. Surge and winds washed out 3,000\u00a0ft (910\u00a0m) of pavement along the causeway connecting  Roanoke Island and the North Carolina mainland; a second bridge crossing the same stretch of water was also heavily damaged.[20]:\u200a7\u200a[21]:\u200a9\u200a A towed barge was set adrift during the storm and collided with another highway bridge crossing an inland waterway at Coinjock, severely damaging the bridge.[21]:\u200a9\u200a Gusts at Cape Hatteras reached approximately 110\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h),[15]:\u200a74\u200a with the accompanying sustained winds reaching record-high velocities at Hatteras.[2]:\u200a189 Winds of around 75\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h) brought down power and telephone lines in the Elizabeth City area,[22] leaving the city without power for 10\u00a0hours.[23] The strong winds razed homes in the region and along nearby beaches, though no deaths or injuries resulted from the hurricane's forces there.[18]:\u200a1\u200a The winds also broke aircraft away from their moorings at a Consolidated Vultee airbase.[23] The Elizabeth City area incurred around $25,000 in damage while nearby Edenton incurred $10,000 in damage.[22] Substantial crop damage occurred around the Albermarle area.[23] Homes were unroofed as far south as Morehead City; trees and business signage in the city were also blown down by the winds.[23] Power outages impacted New Bern, North Carolina.[12]"

In Bath, Maine, a 10-year-old boy was electrocuted when he came into contact with downed wires. In Augusta, Maine, a 40-year-old woman was run over by a bicyclist who was blinded by heavy rains. 4.34\u00a0inches of rain fell during the storm at Bates College. Many tree limbs were downed by high winds during the storm, and in Androscoggin County, Maine, 40% of the apple crop was destroyed.[29] Hey Bonnie Hall, the mansion built by Russell Warren for the DeWolf family in Bristol, Rhode Island, was damaged beyond repair and demolished later in 1944.[30]"

The hurricane was one of the most powerful to traverse the Eastern Seaboard, reaching Category\u00a04 when it encountered Warrington, and producing hurricane-force winds over a diameter of 600 miles (970\u00a0km).[31] The hurricane also produced waves in excess of 70 feet (21\u00a0m) in height. The hurricane and the sinking of USS Warrington are documented in the 1996 book The Dragon's Breath - Hurricane At Sea, written by Commander Robert A. Dawes, Jr. (a former Commanding Officer of Warrington), and published by Naval Institute Press. In addition to Warrington, the Coast Guard cutters USCGC Bedloe (WSC-128) and USCGC Jackson (WSC-142) both capsized and sank off Cape Hatteras. Seventy-five men managed to escape onto life rafts from Bedloe and Jackson, but only 32 survived the rough seas and subsequent hours of exposure to be rescued two days later.[32] The 136-foot (41\u00a0m) minesweeper YMS-409 foundered and sank killing all 33 on board, while the lightship Vineyard Sound (LV-73) was sunk with the loss of all twelve aboard.[33] YAG-17, a full sized attack transport simulator permanently moored in Lynnhaven Roads, near Little Creek, Virginia, was wrecked.[34] Finally, the hurricane drove the SS Thomas Tracy aground in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware."

Barry originated from a tropical wave that developed in the southern Caribbean Sea. The wave tracked northwestward and began to develop in marginally favorable conditions. On June\u00a017, the disturbance was upgraded to Tropical Depression Two by the National Hurricane Center. Due to its close proximity to land, the system failed to intensify before crossing the southern Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. The depression emerged over the Bay of Campeche late on June\u00a018 and became increasingly organized. During the afternoon of June\u00a019, data from Hurricane Hunters revealed the system had intensified into a tropical storm. The newly named Barry attained peak winds of 45\u00a0mph (75\u00a0km/h) before making landfall in Veracruz, Mexico on June\u00a020. Once onshore, the storm quickly weakened and degenerated into a remnant low that night. Areas from northern Nicaragua to South-Central Mexico experienced heavy rains from the storm, with notable flooding occurring in many areas.

Despite moving over land, the circulation and convection became better organized, and after it emerged over open waters, the system developed into Tropical Depression Two at 1200\u00a0UTC on June\u00a017 about 25\u00a0mi (45\u00a0km) north-northwest of La Ceiba, Honduras.[1] Located about 60\u00a0mi (95\u00a0km) east of Monkey River Town, Belize,[4] the depression was not expected to undergo significant strengthening.[5] Failing to intensify, the depression made landfall in southern Belize near Big Creek late on June\u00a017 with winds estimated at 35\u00a0mph (55\u00a0km/h).[1][6] Despite a waning structure, the NHC noted that if the system emerged into the Bay of Campeche, re-development and intensification was plausible.[7] While traversing the southern Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, the system nearly degenerated into a remnant low during the afternoon of June\u00a018; however, as it neared water, sufficient convection redeveloped to maintain the system as a tropical depression.[8] The circulation contracted over land and emerged into the warm waters of the Bay of Campeche that day.[1] The system became increasingly organized as it turned westward in response to a mid-level ridge over the northwestern Gulf of Mexico.[9] A Hurricane Hunter reconnaissance mission into the depression during the afternoon of June\u00a019 revealed gale-force winds, prompting the NHC to upgrade and name the system Tropical Storm Barry.[10] Based on a reconnaissance flight and Dvorak estimates, it was estimated that Barry attained peak winds of 75\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph) late on June\u00a019.[1] At 1115\u00a0UTC on June\u00a020, Barry made landfall at Laguna La Mancha, just north of Veracruz, Mexico.[1][11] Hours after moving inland, Barry weakened to a tropical depression as it interacted with the high terrain of Mexico.[12] The center of circulation became increasingly ill defined, with the majority of convection located well away from the center.[13] Late on June\u00a020, Barry dissipated over the Mexican state of Puebla.[1]"

        "content": "Hurricane Eloise was the most destructive tropical cyclone of the 1975 Atlantic hurricane season. The fifth tropical storm, fourth hurricane, and second major hurricane of the season, Eloise formed as a tropical depression on September 13 to the east of the Virgin Islands. The depression tracked westward and intensified into a tropical storm while passing to the north of Puerto Rico. Eloise briefly attained hurricane intensity soon thereafter, but weakened back to a tropical storm upon making landfall over Hispaniola. A weak and disorganized cyclone, Eloise emerged into open waters of the northern Caribbean Sea; upon striking the northern Yucatan Peninsula, it turned north and began to re-intensify. In the Gulf of Mexico, the cyclone quickly matured and became a Category 3 hurricane on September 23. Eloise made landfall along the Florida Panhandle west of Panama City before moving inland across Alabama and dissipating on September 24. The storm produced torrential rainfall throughout the islands of Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, causing extensive flooding that led to severe damage and more than 40 deaths. Thousands of people in these areas became homeless as flood waters submerged numerous communities. As Eloise progressed westward, it affected Cuba to a lesser extent. In advance of the storm, about 100,000 residents evacuated from the Gulf Coast region. Upon making landfall in Florida, Eloise generated wind gusts of 155\u00a0miles per hour (249\u00a0km/h), which demolished hundreds of buildings in the area. The storm's severe winds, waves, and storm surge left numerous beaches, piers, and other coastal structures heavily impaired. Wind-related damage extended into inland Alabama and Georgia. Further north, torrential rains along the entire East Coast of the United States created an unprecedented and far-reaching flooding event, especially into the Mid-Atlantic States. In that region, an additional 17 people died as a result of freshwater flooding from the post-tropical storm; infrastructural and geological effects were comparable to those from Hurricane Agnes several years prior. Across the United States, damage amounted to approximately $560\u00a0million. The storm killed 80 people along its entire track; due to the severe damage, the name \"Eloise\" was retired from the Atlantic tropical cyclone naming lists."

On September 13, a ship called the Gulf Hansa recorded winds of around 25\u00a0mph (40\u00a0km/h) and 10 feet (3.0\u00a0m) seas in association with the system. Shortly thereafter, a reconnaissance aircraft found a center of circulation 575 miles (925\u00a0km) east of the Virgin Islands, and it is estimated that the storm became a tropical depression at 0600 UTC.[1][2] The depression continued moving towards the west as it gradually strengthened. On September 16, the system attained tropical storm status and was designated Eloise;[2] accordingly, the first advisory on the system was issued by the San Juan Weather Bureau office. While in the vicinity of a strengthening anticyclone aloft, Eloise became better organized, and the storm rapidly intensified and reached Category 1 hurricane status 18 hours after being named.  The cyclone soon made landfall on the Dominican Republic, inhibiting further development.[1] Although initially predicted to remain north of land, the storm moved across northern Hispaniola and then tracked across southeastern Cuba. After 36 hours with much of its circulation over mountainous terrain, Eloise deteriorated to a tropical storm on September\u00a017.[1] The cyclone emerged over the open waters of the northern Caribbean on September 19, passing Jamaica to the north as it moved away from Cuba. Despite favorable upper-level conditions, its interaction with land\u2014combined with the weakening of a ridge to the north\u2014left the storm's center distorted. Eloise remained a fairly disorganized tropical storm until September 20, when it approached the Yucatan Peninsula and began to re-intensify. The storm crossed over the northern tip of the peninsula as it began to turn northward in response to an approaching trough. Between September 17 and September 21, however, reports on the storm were scarce, leading to uncertainty in its exact location and strength. Upon entering the Gulf of Mexico, Eloise quickly organized. The trough enhanced the wind divergence over the storm's center,[1] allowing it to strengthen once again to reach hurricane force about 345 miles (555\u00a0km) south of New Orleans, Louisiana.[2] On September 22, the cyclone intensified to attain Category 2 strength, and became a major hurricane of Category 3 status shortly thereafter as it turned towards the northeast.[2] Several ships penetrated the storm's center during its passage through the gulf. The hurricane also moved over two experimental buoys which recorded data on the storm, aiding meteorologists in their forecasts.[1] Hurricane Eloise continued to strengthen until it reached its peak winds of 125\u00a0mph (205\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of about 955 mbar (hPa; 28.2 inHg).[2] It moved ashore along the Florida Panhandle near Panama City on September 23. Shortly after making landfall, the hurricane rapidly degenerated. Just six hours later, it had weakened into a tropical storm, while situated over eastern Alabama.[1] It further weakened into a tropical depression at 0000 UTC on September 24. The depression transitioned into an extratropical storm over Virginia, and became indistinguishable by later that same day. The remnant moisture, however, merged with a weather front to produce widespread and heavy precipitation.[1][2]"

        "content": "In advance of Hurricane Eloise, warnings for heavy rainfall and potential flooding were issued for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. A hurricane warning was declared for parts of the Dominican Republic about 12 hours before landfall.[1] A \"hurricane emergency\" was put into effect for the Oriente Province of Cuba, while a \"state of alert\" was issued for the Camag\u00fcey Province. Cubana de Aviaci\u00f3n suspended all flights to Oriente.[3] On and before September 15, there was still uncertainty as to whether Eloise would impact the United States. However, officials in Florida began taking precautionary measures.[4] When the storm entered the Gulf of Mexico, forecasters suggested that the storm would continue northward and strike the area near Mobile Bay. Contrary to predictions, by late on September 22, the storm had turned northeast, and some residents of Florida were still unaware of the storm's threat despite the issuance of hurricane warnings 24 hours in advance.[5]  As a result, evacuations were delayed to an extent.[1] During the morning hours of September 23, civil preparedness workers drove through coastal towns with loudspeakers advising people to seek shelter. Due to the intensity of the approaching hurricane, evacuations along the coast were ultimately thorough, despite the initial delay. It was reported that 99% of Pensacola residents along the beach had left their homes, and overall, 100,000 people evacuated from areas in Louisiana through Florida.[5] A statement issued by the National Weather Service advised people in nine Florida counties to complete hurricane preparations, which included securing loose objects and moving watercraft to safety.[6] Homes along the coast were boarded up by their owners,[7] while offshore, workers were removed from oil platforms. A spokesman for Royal Dutch Shell reported that 800 workers were to be evacuated.[8] In New Orleans, emergency equipment was readied and inspected. The New Orleans Levee Board went into a second-stage alert on September 21, and cleared debris from floodwall openings.[9]"

        "content": "As a weak tropical depression, the storm brought 5 to 10 inches (130 to 250\u00a0mm) of rainfall to portions of the Leeward Islands, including St. Kitts and St. Martin. More minor amounts of precipitation fell over the northernmost islands, and winds were light in these areas.[1] Despite being only a tropical storm while passing by Puerto Rico, Eloise produced extreme amounts of rainfall on the island, peaking at 33.29 inches (846\u00a0mm) in Dos Bocas. Other totals of 10 to 20 inches (250 to 510\u00a0mm) were common.[10] The heavy rains resulted in severe flash flooding which killed 34 people, mostly from drownings, and left $60 million in damages.[11] Several hundred people were injured, and the storm forced over 6,000 residents from their homes. Dozens of towns and villages were flooded, though Utuado, with a population of 35,000 at the time, was hit the hardest. The situation in that town was described as a \"total disaster\"; four housing developments were under water, and dozens of vehicles were washed away.[12] The flood waters submerged thousands of miles of roads and put several bridges out-of-service.[13] As the storm proceeded westward, it dropped heavy rainfall throughout eastern and southern Hispaniola. Widespread flooding impacted Haiti and the Dominican Republic, leaving a total of 25 people dead. Although the most intense winds remained offshore, a gust of 50 miles per hour (80\u00a0km/h) was recorded at Cape Enga\u00f1o.[1] Puerto Plata on the northern coast of the Dominican Republic was also battered by high winds and heavy rain. Following the storm, electricity was turned off due to the danger of electrocutions.[13] Despite the storm's effects across Hispaniola and Puerto Rico, no monetary damage totals are available. Rain and wind from the storm affected the southern Bahamas, Cuba, Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, and the northern Yucatan Peninsula. Since the storm was primarily weak while passing by these areas, no significant damage was reported.[1] Eloise brought torrential rainfall and winds of 20\u00a0mph (32\u00a0km/h) to the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in southeastern Cuba, inflicting $65,000 in damage. Personnel on the base were moved to designated hurricane shelters in advance of the storm.[14]"

        "content": "Eloise came ashore along the coast of northern Florida as a Category 3 storm producing winds of 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) with gusts that reached 155\u00a0mph (249\u00a0km/h).[1] Sustained winds were likely higher, but due to the sparsity of recording stations, few official records exist. The winds in the area were reportedly the strongest of the century.[5] Hurricane-force winds occurred from Fort Walton Beach through Panama City. Along the coast, tides ran 12 to 16 feet (3.7 to 4.9\u00a0m) above normal, peaking at 18 feet (5.5\u00a0m). Hurricane Eloise spawned several tornadoes as it pressed inland.[1] In general, rainfall ranged from 4 to 8 inches (100 to 200\u00a0mm); at the Eglin Air Force Base near Valparaiso, however, the hurricane dropped 14.9 inches (380\u00a0mm) of precipitation.[10] The heaviest rainfall was usually confined to northwest of the storm's track, and a number of locations to the east of Eloise's center picked up less than 1 inch (25\u00a0mm) of rain.[1] Damage from the hurricane was widespread. Fort Walton Beach, where hundreds of structures were damaged or destroyed, was hit particularly hard. In some areas, the storm surge washed away buildings demolished by the strong winds. The winds cleared certain locations of trees and buried properties and roads under sand. Throughout northwest Florida, an estimated 8,000 people suffered storm-related losses, and 500 businesses were completely destroyed. An article in the Tallahassee Democrat reported that \"Cottages, motels, restaurants, convenience stores and other beach businesses were strewn across the highway in a tangle of down power poles, lines and busted mains.\"[5] A 2,100-acre (850\u00a0ha) shrimp farm at Panama City, the first of its kind, was effectively lost. The storm destroyed the farm's prospective initial harvest, 1,500,000 pounds (680,000\u00a0kg) of shrimp enclosed in a system of nets and enclosures. The president of the company described the subsequent events as six months of extreme turmoil in an effort to recover, followed by a quick and steady rebound. By the spring of 1976, the company became confident in financial success and full recovery.[11][15] The storm caused severe beach erosion in Bay County; approximately 801,000 cubic yards (612,000\u00a0m3) of sand was removed.[16] Storm-related changes in the coastal topography resulted in extensive structural damage in the Panama City Beach area. The most severe damage was concentrated in a 22 miles (35\u00a0km) area of the shore east of the hurricane's eye, and storm surge peaked in intensity for no more than a half hour according to preliminary estimates. Much of the resultant damage came as a result of foundation undermining, which was compared to that of the New England hurricane of 1938. Although Eloise was not abnormally strong, the geographicy setting and building standards in the area were blamed for the destruction of many homes and businesses.[17] Monetary losses from property damage in Panama City Beach alone totaled about $50 million.[18] The first major storm to strike the region in 40 years, Hurricane Eloise did not directly kill anyone in the state of Florida.[19] However, four deaths of an indirect nature were attributed to the hurricane;[1] two of them were related to heart attacks. Numerous people sustained injuries, largely from broken glass or cleanup efforts. Overall property damage from the storm in Florida amounted to $150 million.[11] In the storm's aftermath, a study of the hurricane's effect on aquatic animals living in the swash zone (the immediate area where land and the ocean meet) of Panama City Beach was conducted.[18] The study concluded that compared to 11 consecutive months of data prior to the storm, the swash zone experienced a brief influx of animal species normally found offshore. However, the number decreased to near normal shortly thereafter.[18] Also along the shore, the hurricane dismantled or severely impaired several piers, including the total destruction of a 300 feet (91\u00a0m) extension of the Okaloosa Island Pier built just three years earlier and part of its original span. A fishing pier at St. Andrews State Park also suffered vast damage, along with another wooden pier at Mexico Beach and the M.B. Miller Pier at Panama City Beach, which lost its end section to the storm.[20]"

        "content": "As the hurricane progressed inland, it passed over eastern Alabama, generating strong winds. A gust of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) was recorded northeast of Ozark. Winds elsewhere in the state ranged from around 35\u00a0mph (56\u00a0km/h) to 88\u00a0mph (142\u00a0km/h). Precipitation in Alabama peaked at 5.54 inches (141\u00a0mm). The high winds resulted in severe damage to property and crops, amounting to $100 million.[1] Eloise cut power and telephone service in the area,[21] and in Geneva County, several people sustained storm-related injuries. As in Florida, the weakening hurricane spawned a number of tornadoes in Alabama and Georgia.[22] Preliminary reports indicated that every county in southeastern Alabama received some damage from the storm. The strong winds uprooted trees and knocked down powerlines. Heavy rain associated with the storm caused a leak in the Alabama State Capitol building roof.[23] Gusty winds, moderate to heavy rainfall, and low pressures extended into Georgia, Louisiana, and to a lesser extent, Mississippi.[1] The remnants of Eloise interacted with another weather system, producing widespread precipitation across the Eastern United States, including portions of the Ohio Valley, the Mid-Atlantic states, and New England.[10]  The deluge was \"almost continuous\" during the period between September 22 and 26 according to a statement by the National Weather Service.[24] One of the highest rainfall totals in association with the storm occurred in Westminster, Maryland, where 14.23 inches (361\u00a0mm) of rain were recorded. Elsewhere, 7 to 10 inches (180 to 250\u00a0mm) or more of precipitation fell throughout parts of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York and Connecticut. At least 22 states received rainfall from Hurricane Eloise and its remnant moisture.[10] Nearby Hurricane Faye may have also contributed to the heavy rainfall, although this connection was never confirmed.[25] In Washington, D.C., 9.08 inches (231\u00a0mm) of rain contributed to the wettest September on record since 1934.[26] The excessive rainfall led to extensive flooding throughout the region, in some areas exceeding 50- to 100-year levels.[27] Pennsylvania and New York bore the brunt of the flooding, which culminated in loss of life and severe property damage.[25] Along the central Southern Tier region of New York, the storm damaged or destroyed over 700 structures.[28] Flooding throughout the Northeastern United States disabled over a dozen water plants and at least 16 sewage treatment plants, prompting a boil-water advisory in Pennsylvania's capital city of Harrisburg. Infrastructure further south also suffered; in Maryland, the Monocacy River\u2014a tributary of the Potomac\u2014swelled to 14 feet (4.3\u00a0m) above flood stage, inundating the city of Frederick and compromising the city's supply of fresh drinking water.[24] A final downpour of rain on the night of September 25\u201326 led to an additional 4 inches (100\u00a0mm) of rain in central Maryland triggered severe flash flooding. In some cases, this onslaught affected the same areas that were still recovering from Hurricane Agnes several years earlier, including Ellicott City, Elkridge, and Laurel, where two major rivers breached their banks and engulfed nearby areas. Many homes and businesses were lost, along with numerous vehicles; in the aftermath, looters entered on boats to access the devastated cities. The floodgates at the Rocky Gorge Dam in Laurel were opened, forcing 500 residents downstream to leave their homes.[29] The consequences of the flooding rains were the worst seen in areas of the interior Mid-Atlantic states since Agnes, and comparisons were often drawn between the two hurricanes.[24] In Pennsylvania alone, flooding from the remnants of Eloise forced 20,000 residents out of their homes;[30] thousands further south in the Washington, D.C. area, where severe flooding impacted the city's southern suburbs,[31] also fled to seek refuge. Further, many motorists throughout the region became stranded on highways inundated by floodwaters.[30] Four Mile Run and nearby streams overflowed and \"tumbled through residential neighborhoods\". Hundreds of families in the Alexandria and Arlington, Virginia area suffered flood-related losses.[31] Across the Northeastern U.S., the storm system killed 17 people and inflicted $300 million in damage.[25] An instance of a storm-induced fatality is the death of a man in White Plains, New York, who was killed by waters raging across the Hutchinson River Parkway. Agriculturally, the extended period of wet weather threatened a range of crops, including the Rhode Island apple crop, of which 35% was feared to have been destroyed, and corn and sweet potato fields in North Carolina. With ground too moist for farm machinery to operate on, harvests were postponed.[32]"

        "content": "After touring the disaster area, Florida Governor Reubin Askew noted, \"I think we're going to have to take a long, close look at some of the construction [...] Some of the structures simply won't be able to be built back in the exact location where they were.\"[11] Governor Askew recruited 400 National Guard troops to prevent looting following the storm.[33] He also requested the initial declaration of five counties along the Florida panhandle as national disaster areas, and stated that he would consider adding two more counties. The declaration would make residents in the counties recognized as disaster areas eligible to receive federal aid.[34] Immediately following the storm, the mayor of Panama City criticized the state of Florida for failing to provide sufficient post-storm aid.[35] Despite the destruction, the storm reportedly had some economic benefits; in the midst of rebuilding and recovery, business grew, especially in and around Panama City, and people began to move into the area.[36] In at least one instance, the hurricane and its associated storm surge had a lasting effect on local geography, breaching Crooked Island in Bay County to create an inlet 0.75 miles (1.21\u00a0km) wide referred to as Eloise Inlet.[37] Eloise provided a comprehensive base of information on beach and dune erosion along the Florida panhandle, which aided in the programming of certain erosion prediction numerical models. In 1995, reports from the aftermath of Hurricane Opal created a more extensive collection of data.[38] On September 26, President Gerald Ford approved the declaration for Florida,[39] and later issued a separate declaration for 30 counties in Pennsylvania as the storm's flooding rains progressed northward.[40][41] Pennsylvania Lieutenant Governor Ernest Kline assigned 600 National Guardsmen to assist in the evacuation of flood victims and maintain security in storm-ravaged areas.[42] Over $430 million in federal disaster relief was spent overall in 1975 and distributed to 92,000 families; the bulk of the funds went to recovery for areas affected by Hurricane Eloise along its entire course.[43] In Maryland, Governor Marvin Mandel placed 10 of the state's 23 counties under a state of emergency.[24] On account of the severe damage caused by the hurricane, the name Eloise was retired at the end of the 1975 season. It will never again be used to name a tropical storm in the Atlantic basin.[44][45]"

        "content": "Hurricane Opal was a large and powerful Category\u00a04 hurricane that caused severe and extensive damage along the northern Gulf Coast of the United States in October 1995. The fifteenth named storm, ninth hurricane and strongest tropical cyclone of the unusually active 1995 Atlantic hurricane season, Opal developed from the interaction of a tropical wave and a low-pressure area near the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula on September\u00a027 as Tropical Depression Seventeen. The depression crossed the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula and intensified into a tropical storm on September\u00a030. Opal intensified into a hurricane on October\u00a02 after entering the Gulf of Mexico. The cyclone turned northeastward and strengthened significantly. By October\u00a04, Opal was an intense 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h), Category\u00a04 hurricane. With a minimum pressure of 916 mbar (hPa), Hurricane Opal was the most intense category 4 Atlantic hurricane on record. However, the cyclone abruptly weakened to a low-end Category\u00a03 hurricane prior to making landfall on the Florida Panhandle near Pensacola later that day. The storm quickly unraveled as it moved inland and became extratropical on October\u00a05. The remnants of Opal moved northward and dissipated over Ontario the following day. The precursor and initial stages of Opal brought heavy rainfall and flooding to Guatemala and Mexico. In the former, flooding and landslides left about 34,000\u00a0people homeless and damage to infrastructure and agriculture. A total of 31\u00a0deaths occurred in Guatemala. In Mexico, a number of rivers overflowed in the states of Campeche and Tabasco, forcing more than 42,000\u00a0people to evacuate. The storm left hundreds of millions of dollars in damage to agriculture in Campeche alone. Nineteen people were killed in the country. In Florida, high winds and storm surge left extensive damage in the panhandle. The majority of structures were swept away or experienced some degree of damage, particularly from Wakulla County westward. In Escambia, Okaloosa, Santa Rosa and Bay counties, nearly 300\u00a0homes were destroyed and 1,000\u00a0others suffered major damage. The storm left at least $2.1\u00a0billion in damage in Florida alone. Several other states were impacted by the storm, especially Alabama, where the storm spawned many tornadoes and strong winds downed numerous trees and left about 2.6\u00a0million people without electricity. A total of 27\u00a0deaths were attributed to Opal in the United States. The hurricane overall left about $4.7\u00a0billion in damage, much of which took place in the US. Due to its destructive effects, the name Opal was retired in the spring of 1996 and replaced with Olga for the 2001 season."

        "content": "The origins of Hurricane Opal were linked using satellite imagery and synoptic analyses to a tropical wave that left the western coast of Africa on September\u00a011.[1]  Ten days later, the disturbance reached the Lesser Antilles after crossing the tropical Atlantic.[2] Continuing westward, the disturbance showed little signs of organization before entering the western Caribbean Sea on September\u00a023. There, the wave became entangled with a broad area of low-pressure east of Nicaragua, and the combined system drifted west-northwestward toward the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula; but even then, the disturbance lacked significant development. However, a burst of thunderstorm activity occurred near the storm's center on September\u00a027, prompting the National Hurricane Center\u00a0(NHC) to declare the system a tropical depression at 18:00\u00a0UTC that day. At the time, the depression was centered 80\u00a0mi (130\u00a0km) south-southeast of Cozumel, Mexico.[1] The primordial depression meandered across the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula during the three days following tropical cyclogenesis due to the lack of dominant steering currents. Despite remaining over land for an extended period, the depression developed organized rainbands, and ships in the region reported weather conditions that were suggestive of a stronger system. As a result, the NHC upgraded the disturbance to tropical storm intensity at 12:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a030 while the storm was over the north-central coast of Yucat\u00e1n; this classification resulted in the tropical cyclone being named Opal, which also made it the first Atlantic storm to be given a name starting with the letter O.[3] Over the next two days, Opal entered the Gulf of Mexico before tracking slowly west-southwestward into the Bay of Campeche. There, the storm strengthened into a hurricane at 12:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a02. Shortly afterward, a primitive eye began to form. At the same time, a strong trough tracking across the United States caused Opal to slowly turn northeastward.[1] After clearing the Bay of Campeche, Opal accelerated towards the United States Gulf Coast. The combination of warm sea surface temperatures associated with an unusually warm pocket of ocean waters and an upper-level high pressure area over the Gulf of Mexico resulted in a highly conducive environment for intensification.[1][4] After a significant reorganization in Opal's internal structure, the hurricane was able to rapidly intensify in these favorable conditions. At 12:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a04, Opal reached peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h), making it a Category\u00a04 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale, and a minimum barometric pressure of 916 hPa (27.05\u00a0inHg), a pressure typical for a Category 5 hurricane. The tropical cyclone's eye measured 12\u00a0mi (19\u00a0km) at peak intensity as the storm was beginning an eyewall replacement cycle. The progression of this cycle resulted in Opal's gradual weakening thereafter. At 22:00\u00a0UTC that day, Opal made landfall between Pensacola Beach, Florida and Navarre Beach, Florida, on a stretch of beach now known as \"Opal Beach\", as a weakened Category\u00a03 hurricane with winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h). Weakening quickened as Opal moved further inland, degenerating into a tropical depression over Tennessee less than a day after landfall. The diffusing cyclone transitioned into an extratropical cyclone shortly afterwards; these extratropical remnants tracked towards the northeast before they were last noted along the northern shore of Lake Ontario in Eastern Ontario.[1]"

        "content": "Although Opal was a weak system located over the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula at the time, 350\u00a0people evacuated from Grand Isle, Louisiana on September\u00a028 after rough surf associated with the distant cyclone began to threaten Louisiana Highway 1\u2014the only thoroughfare connecting Grand Isle with the Louisianan mainland.[5] The following day, oil companies operating offshore oil drilling platforms in the Gulf of Mexico began evacuating workers from the rigs to land.[6] On October\u00a01, a coastal flood watch was issued for portions of the United States Coast due to the risk of storm surge from Opal. The United States Coast Guard issued an advisory for boaters in the Gulf of Mexico to use caution or remain in port where possible. The next day, the Galveston, Texas, emergency operations center opened to monitor the tropical cyclone and deliberate upon potential preparations for the city.[7] Meanwhile, the launch Space Shuttle Columbia's STS-73 mission set for October\u00a05 was postponed due to Opal's anticipated effects.[8] On October 3, a voluntary evacuation order was placed on Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, due to the risks of potential storm surge. Schools were also closed by noon that day across the parish.[9] Voluntary evacuation orders for the Florida panhandle, which would ultimately be the most heavily affected area, also began the same day with several counties giving evacuation orders. Farther west, a mandatory evacuation order was placed on Mobile County, Alabama, by then-Governor Fob James. Just before noon on October 4, with the hurricane near landfall, Escambia, Okaloosa and Santa Rosa counties halted evacuations, instead ordering those still within vulnerable areas to seek shelter instead. However, the large number of evacuees led to severe traffic congestion; Escambia County officials estimated that \"tens of thousands\" were still on evacuation routes within the county only a few hours before Opal made landfall. Mass evacuations in some other counties concluded during the afternoon of October 4, though many evacuees in other locations were unable to reach safe areas prior to the onset of gale-force winds.[10] An estimated 100,000\u00a0people evacuated from the United States Gulf Coast ahead of Opal, with 5 percent of evacuees seeking public shelters and over half of evacuees seeking shelter out of their home counties; in their post-storm assessment the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u00a0(FEMA) noted that the landfalls of Hurricane Allison and Hurricane Erin on the Florida panhandle earlier in the year produced a dichotomous mood toward preparations for Hurricane Opal\u2014some people may have taken a \"wait and see\" approach that resulted in complacency, while others affected by the widespread power outages caused by Erin may have acquired a greater sense of readiness toward the approaching hurricane. Regardless, the overall evacuation process was described as chaotic, and the failure to clear hurricane evacuation routes of casual or communal traffic was blamed for the relative unease during evacuations for Opal. Traffic congestion on these routes caused some evacuees to return to vulnerable areas along the coast while raising fears that stranded evacuees on highways could be subjected to potentially fatal hurricane-force winds.[10] The post-landfall watches and warnings released in accordance with Opal were a flash flood warning released on October 5 for portions of Alabama, northern Georgia, and the western parts of North Carolina and South Carolina.[11] The warning also included eastern Tennessee. A flash flood watch was also in effect for portions of the Upper Ohio Valley, the Mid-Atlantic region, the central Appalachians, and the lower Great Lakes. Wind warnings were in effect for northwestern South Carolina all the way to western New York.[11] A gale watch was also in effect for Lake Erie, Lake Ontario, and the southern sections of the St. Lawrence Seaway. Six hours later, the gale warnings over Lake Erie, Lake Ontario, and the southern sections of the St. Lawrence Seaway were upgraded into a storm warning for Erie alone. The gale warning for the other two sections remained. The shoreline of Lake Erie was under a beach erosion warning from Buffalo, New York to Ripley, New York.[12] The Storm Prediction Center released a tornado watch for northern and central New Jersey and portions of New York and Connecticut on October 6.[13] Significant non-surge areas of Escambia County, Florida, south of US 98 were included in evacuation areas because of the potential for isolation by flooding.[14]"

Governor Jorge Salomon ordered the closure of all government offices, businesses, and schools by October\u00a02 in light of the extensive flooding.[19] At least 60\u00a0towns across the state were isolated by the extreme rainfall. By October 3, agricultural losses in Campeche alone were estimated in the billions of pesos (hundreds of millions of USD).[20] At least 19 people perished across Mexico while another 31 were killed in Guatemala.[15]"

        "content": "About 200 miles (320\u00a0km) of Florida's coastline felt the impact of Hurricane Opal.[21] Rainfall in Florida peaked at 15.45 inches (392\u00a0mm) in Ellyson, 7.27 inches (185\u00a0mm) at Pensacola, and 6.64 inches (169\u00a0mm) at Hurlburt Field. The highest gust recorded was a 145\u00a0mph (233\u00a0km/h) gust at the latter. Lower gusts were 115 miles per hour (185\u00a0km/h) at Eglin Air Force Base and an 88\u00a0mph (142\u00a0km/h) gust at Pensacola P.N.S. The highest sustained winds were 84\u00a0mph (135\u00a0km/h) at Hurlburt Field and 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) at Eglin Air Force Base. Opal brought heavy surge to the area, 8 to 15 feet (2.4 to 4.6\u00a0m) in some places, comparing itself to Hurricane Eloise, which struck the same area at near equal strength in 1975.The two reported storm surges were 5 to 6 feet (1.5 to 1.8\u00a0m) above normal at Apalachicola and 2 to 4 feet (0.61 to 1.22\u00a0m) above normal at Sarasota.[1] Opal caused about US$4.7\u00a0billion (1995\u00a0dollars) in damage,[22] making it the third costliest hurricane at the time. Most of the structural damage occurred near the coastline on the Florida Panhandle, due to intense surge. Nearly a mile of U.S. Highway 98 near Eglin Air Force Base was completely destroyed. The pavement was nearly replaced by mounds of sand left behind after storm surge.[23] Opal also spawned an F2 tornado that killed a young woman in Florida. None died as a direct result of storm surge. This was quite unusual, considering the strength and landfall location of Opal. Okaloosa Island, Fort Walton Beach, was overwhelmed by storm surge. Numerous homes were under 3 to 10 feet (0.91 to 3.05\u00a0m) of water. Residents were not allowed to return to the island until the homes could be secured. A Humvee tour was arranged by the National Guard so home owners could 'see' the damage, but the homeowners were not allowed off the bus. Sand dunes along the stretch of US 98, normally 25 feet (7.6\u00a0m) high, were removed by wind and surge. Where once the ocean was obscured from view by the dunes for miles, a flat open space opened up along U.S. Highway 98."

The highest gust reported was a 95\u00a0mph (153\u00a0km/h) gust in Fort Rucker and a secondary one at Maxwell Air Force Base with a gust of 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h). The highest sustained winds reported from Opal was 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h) at Fort Rucker, 55\u00a0mph (89\u00a0km/h) in downtown Mobile and 47\u00a0mph (76\u00a0km/h) at Maxwell Air Force Base and Montgomery.[1] Numerous downed trees across much of the southeastern United States left over 2\u00a0million people without power. Alabama reported that 476,000\u00a0residents were without power, which was a record at the time; however, this number was surpassed by Hurricane Ivan in 2004.[26] Damage was heavy far inland, all the way to Montgomery, where sustained winds reached 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h). Highest rainfalls in Mississippi were 5 inches (130\u00a0mm) throughout the eastern side of the state with lower amounts going westward.[25]  Tropical-storm-force winds were reported along the Gulf Coast during the afternoon and early evening of October 4. Wind damage was mainly limited to downed tree limbs, power lines, and signs. One minor injury was reported in Harrison County due to flying debris. Damage in Mississippi totaled up to $75 thousand.[27] In Louisiana, the only significant wind damage occurred in extreme south Plaquemines Parish where winds were estimated around 60 miles per hour (97\u00a0km/h) with gusts to hurricane force, with wind damage reported to some mobile homes and roofs of a few other structures. Tropical storm force winds were reported in extreme south Lafourche Parish and Jefferson Parish, as well as extreme east St. Bernard Parish. Property damage cost estimated. Tides were generally 2 feet (0.61\u00a0m) above normal in Lake Pontchartrain, and three to five feet above normal along the southeast Louisiana coast from Grand Isle eastward. Some low-lying coastal roads were flooded.[28] Approximately 10,000\u00a0people evacuated from the southern, or lower, portions of Plaquemines, St. Bernard, Lafourche, and Jefferson Parishes. The only significant gathering of persons in public shelters occurred in Plaquemines Parish, where 1,600\u00a0people were placed in public shelters.[28] Although no direct injuries occurred from the hurricane, an indirect injury is attributed to the hurricane in a freak accident. A Jefferson Parish employee was injured while attempting to lower a large flag on October 4. The employee, who was holding onto a rope attached a flag, was tossed high into the air, and suffered severe injuries when he fell back to the ground. Total damage in Louisiana totaled out to US$200,000 (1995\u00a0dollars).[28] Breaking swells from Opal in Texas caused water to spill across at the usual wash-over points which damaged several vehicles.[29]"

The damage was worst in Rabun County where numerous trees were blown down. The wind damage was described as being worse than the March Superstorm of 1993. Power was out for some people for at least a week.[31] More than 4000 trees were knocked down within the city of Atlanta alone. These trees fell across roads, and on power lines, homes, mobile homes, and automobiles. More than a half a dozen people were injured from falling trees in the early morning hours of October 5. There were more than 1200 telephone poles knocked down and almost 5,000 power lines snapped. Power crews from surrounding states helped to restore power to many, however, thousands of residences remained without power through the weekend. An 80-foot (24\u00a0m) gash was torn out of Interstate 285 between Roswell Road and the Glenridge Connector in Atlanta. Schools were closed on October 5 and October 6 throughout the cities of Atlanta, Marietta, and in Fulton, Coweta, Carroll and Douglas counties. A total of 47 of 101 schools were closed in Dekalb County alone. Four state parks were closed after Opal: Moccasin Creek Park, Black Rock Mountain, Vogel State Park, and Fort Mountain State Park. 273 stations reported many falling traffic lights. Agricultural experts estimated that damage to the pecan crop was about $50\u00a0million. Several rivers and creeks overflowed their banks.[32] Beginning the evening of October 4, numerous power outages were reported in metro Atlanta, where sustained tropical storm conditions overnight (including gusts to nearly 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h)) felled thousands of trees. Oaks were particularly susceptible, as their root systems were loose. Around 7 inches (180\u00a0mm) of rainfall was recorded in extreme northwestern South Carolina and came in reducing amounts around the rest of the state.[25] Heavy rainfalls closed roads and bridges, causing $24\u00a0million in crop and property damage.[33] A tornado in Chesterfield, South Carolina caused many trees to be blown down in the Carolina Sandhills National Wildlife Refuge. Trees were blown down in Orangeburg, one of those trees fell onto a car and totaled it. An F0 tornado spawned by one of Opal's bands downed a number of trees and power lines. Campers, vehicles, structures and boats were damaged in Greenville.[34] In North Carolina, over 17 inches (430\u00a0mm) of rain fell. The rainfall included 9.89 inches (251\u00a0mm) in Robinson Creek and 8.95 inches (227\u00a0mm) in Highlands. The Robinson Creek rains spawned flash flooding.[35] Officials in the state had the citizens boil their water before drinking it because of a possibility that floodwater may have entered purification plants.[36] A landslide triggered by Opal and damaged the Blue Ridge Parkway.[37] Opal triggered a debris flow in the Poplar Cove area of Macon County.[38] A flash flood from rainfall amounts typically ranged from four to six inches (100 to 150\u00a0mm) and closed roads and bridges were the result. The most serious flooding apparently occurred in Avery County where evacuations were required and tanks of propane were found floating in the Banner Elk River.[39] Three deaths also occurred in the state. A man in Candler was killed when a falling tree destroyed his mobile home. Another man was killed near Marshall when a tree was blown onto him while he was helping cut other trees out of the roadway. 10\u00a0people were also injured by wind blown debris and from falling trees. Damage from high winds totaled up to $15\u00a0million.[40]"

Over 7000\u00a0people were without power and damage in Virginia totaled to $5000. The National Park Service reported dozens of trees blown down along Skyline Drive in two counties.[41] In the Great Smoky Mountains, power and phone service were out in many areas of the park. Newfound Gap road closed for several days due to trees and a rockslide that were lying across it. Campers were asked to leave Elkmont Campground near Gatlinburg because of high water.[42] Many sections of the Blue Ridge Parkway were closed because of trees that fell across the road. Flooding occurred in the northern portion of the parkway. Linville Falls was evacuated; the Asheville and Gillespie Gap Districts were closed. Rockslides and mudslides had also been reported due to Opal.[42] In West Virginia, 0.5\u20131.5 inches (13\u201338\u00a0mm) of rain were reported causing some schools to let out early.[43] High winds associated with the remnants of Opal moved through southeast West Virginia on the 5th. High winds ranged between 35 and 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h) with some gusts to near 55\u00a0mph (89\u00a0km/h). Numerous trees, large branches, power lines and shingles off the roofs of homes were ripped off in the wind. The vast majority of damage occurred at elevations above two thousand feet. Damage from the wind totaled out to $2000.[44] Large limbs were downed by high wind across from the remnants of Hurricane Opal in Preston County. Damage there totaled out to $1000.[45] Damage in West Virginia totaled out to only $5,000. In Maryland, a large tree and its limbs along Maryland Route 495 near Bittinger were downed by high winds associated with the remnants of Opal. The damage from the fallen tree and its limbs totaled out to one thousand dollars.[46] Mesocyclones moving around Opal's eastern periphery within Maryland spawned three tornadoes in Charles, Prince George's, and Anne Arundel County. The first tornado tracked along State Route 425 between the towns of Ironside and Grayton. Along the tornado's path, several trees were uprooted or snapped; two sheds were destroyed and two others sustained roof damage. Windows were blown out of a barn and several vehicles. Ten thousand dollars in damage occurred.[47] The second and strongest tornado hit ground in Temple Hills, injuring three\u00a0people after reaching a peak wind of 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h). 100 homes were damaged with 15 being condemned. The Potomac Electric Power reported 9000\u00a0people without power. Damage from the second tornado totaled out to $5\u00a0million.[48] The third and final tornado touched down in Odenton, became an F1 tornado and doing $250,000 in damage to the area.

A total of over 20,000\u00a0people were without power from Opal's wrath. The most damage occurred in Hamilton County, which had damage was estimated over a total of $1\u00a0million. Damage in Hamilton County include a circus was left stranded at a campground and needed to be evacuated. A number of residences and businesses were also surrounded by water and occupants were to be evacuated. Total damage in Tennessee totaled out at $2.02\u00a0million.[50] In Kentucky, 1 to 5 inches (25 to 127\u00a0mm) of rain was reported throughout the state from Opal.[25] Total rainfall across Jefferson County, where Louisville is located ranged from 2.4 inches (61\u00a0mm) at the Louisville International Airport to 3.5 inches (89\u00a0mm) at Fern Creek Road south of the Gene Snyder Freeway. Several trees were knocked down and soils were saturated after Opal passed through.[51] A bridge washed out over Sulphur Creek and minor flooding was reported across Kentucky Route 80.[52] Elizabethtown and the Fort Knox area had several roads closed after Opal washed them out.[53] In Michigan, Opal produced 2 to 3 inches (51 to 76\u00a0mm) of rain over the Middle Rouge River Basin from late afternoon through the evening on the 5th. As a result, the Middle Rouge River crested one foot over flood stage, causing the Edward Hines Drive to be closed off to traffic.[54] High winds associated with the remains of Hurricane Opal affected the area during the late afternoon and early evening on the 5th. Strong northeast winds destroyed a new 200-foot (61-m), two-story pole barn on the Marine City Highway in Marine City. The storm also cut power to several areas, resulting in some school closings. The maximum wind gust at Detroit Metro Airport was a 38-mph (61-km/h) gust, which was from the northeast. The damage from this incident totaled out to $15,000.[55] The remnants of Opal passed across northeast Ohio and caused wind gusts up to 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h) and sustained winds of 20 to 30\u00a0mph (32 to 48\u00a0km/h) all across northern Ohio. Several automobiles were damaged by falling trees or limbs. Crops were damaged from the strong winds. A number of farms reported fields of corn blown over and ripe apples and other fruit being stripped from trees. Rainfall of 3.4 inches (86\u00a0mm) in less than 24\u00a0hours was measured at Mansfield, and most areas averaged 1.5 to 2.5 inches (38 to 64\u00a0mm) during the same period. Flooding was localized and not significant since very dry conditions preceded the storm.[56] Sustained northeast winds ahead of the storm reached 55\u00a0mph (89\u00a0km/h) all across the lake with gusts to 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) producing waves of 10 to 14 feet (3.0 to 4.3\u00a0m). Minor to moderate beach and shore erosion occurred in many areas, especially the western end of the lake. Localized flooding occurred in communities with low-lying areas along the lake.

The heavy rain was represented as the first significant dent in the drought that had affected northern New Jersey since September 1994. Storm totals included 6.7 inches (170\u00a0mm) in Wawayanda, 5.3 (135\u00a0mm) in Hackettstown, 4.5 inches (110\u00a0mm) in Oak Ridge, 4.2 inches (110\u00a0mm) in Clinton and 4.10 inches (104\u00a0mm) in Pequannock. The remnants of Opal caused severe thunderstorms that uprooted trees near Belvidere. Trees and wires were down in scattered parts of the county including Route 57 near the Tri-county Firehouse. Downed wires caused power outages in Hackettstown and Mansfield Township.[59] The remnants of Hurricane Opal passed over northwest Pennsylvania on Thursday night (5th/6th) and caused wind gusts up to 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) and sustained winds of 20 to 30\u00a0mph (32 to 48\u00a0km/h). Heavy rains accompanied the storm and averaged 1.5 to 2.5 inches (38 to 64\u00a0mm). Flooding was localized and not significant since drought conditions preceded the storm. The prolonged period of strong winds brought down trees and limbs along with some power lines. At least one automobile was damaged by a downed tree in Erie. Several farms reported fields of corn blown down and apples and other fruit being stripped from trees. The actual crop damage estimate was unknown.[60] The remnants of Opal passed just to the west of Buffalo, New York on October 5 and 6. Two to 3\u00a0inches (38\u201364\u00a0mm) of rain fell over much of the area with isolated amounts of near four inches (100\u00a0mm) over parts of the western Southern Tier. Sustained winds were estimated between 35 and 40\u00a0mph (56 and 64\u00a0km/h), but the easterly winds did down some trees and power lines. In Oneida County, the high winds downed trees and wires in New York Mills, Waterville, Sylvan Beach, North Bay, Lee Center, Rome, McConnellsville and Verona. In Saratoga County a large tree limb was downed in Saratoga Springs which damaged four cars. Total damage in New York totaled to $35,000.[61][62] A low pressure area which used to be Opal moved across western and northern New York late and into Vermont on the night of October 5 and the morning October 6. Damaging winds occurred across parts of central and northern Vermont but especially along the western slopes of the Green Mountains. Damaging winds downed trees and power lines across Essex, Orleans, Addison, Caledonia and Rutland counties. In Essex County damage occurred in Canaan and Concord. Damage was also reported in Caledonia County, in Rutland County, in Clarendon and Chittenden and in Orleans County in Derby Center. Total damage in Vermont totaled out to $135,000.[63] Heavy winds and rain associated with the remnants of Opal brought down trees and knocked out power in southwestern and northern New Hampshire. One person was injured in Marlborough when a large tree blew onto his moving pickup truck.[64] In Maine, heavy winds and rain associated with the remnants of Opal brought down trees and knocked out power in coastal areas of southern Maine.

The ship registered a minimum barometric pressure of around 985\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.1\u00a0inHg) during the encounter, though a later assessment of the ship's barometer found that the instrument underestimated pressures by about 8\u00a0mbar (hPa; 0.25\u00a0inHg).[1]:\u200a392\u2013393 Observations from Martinique and Trinidad on the morning of September\u00a010 tentatively indicated the presence of a tropical disturbance southeast of the Windward Islands, and falling pressures in Barbados later that day provided conclusive evidence of an approaching storm.[2]:\u200a16\u200a The hurricane passed near Barbados on the night of September\u00a010.[1]:\u200a392\u200a No period of calm was reported in Bridgetown, suggesting that the storm's eye missed the city.[8]:\u200a25\u200a An analysis of the storm presented to the Royal Meteorological Society (RMS) in December\u00a01898 determined that the centre of the hurricane passed 18\u00a0mi (29\u00a0km) south of the island.[8]:\u200a28\u200a HMS Alert encountered the storm while evacuating from Barbados on September\u00a010, recording a minimum barometric pressure of 1002.4\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.60\u00a0inHg) at 9:00\u00a0p.m. while the hurricane's centre was some 25\u00a0mi (40\u00a0km) to the northeast.[8]:\u200a25\u200a The storm reached the vicinity of St. Lucia and St. Vincent during the day on September\u00a011.[1]:\u200a392\u200a The calm eye of the storm traversed southern St. Vincent, passing directly over Kingstown at around local noon.[8]:\u200a26\u200a A minimum air pressure of 965.43\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.509\u00a0inHg) was recorded at the Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Botanic Gardens at 11:40\u00a0a.m.[1]:\u200a393\u200a Based on this measurement, the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project estimated that the hurricane had maximum sustained winds of approximately 110\u00a0mph (175\u00a0km/h), an intensity equivalent to a Category 2 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir\u2013Simpson scale.[4] Partag\u00e1s described the storm as nearly a major hurricane based on the pressure observation at St. Vincent.[2]:\u200a21 After moving west past the Lesser Antilles, the hurricane curved northwest towards Aves Island with a forward speed of around 7.5\u00a0mi (12.1\u00a0km). The areal extent of the storm's winds expanded significantly during its passage of the Windward Islands: the region of strong winds spanned 35\u00a0mi (56\u00a0km) in diameter on approach to St. Vincent but subsequently extended outward to 170\u00a0mi (270\u00a0km) from the centre.[8]:\u200a28\u200a The Weather Bureau noted that \"after September\u00a011 [the] storm lost strength rapidly, and there is no evidence at hand to show that during its subsequent northwesterly course over the eastern Caribbean Sea and the ocean to the northward it exhibited destructive violence.\"[1]:\u200a394\u200a The bureau assessed the storm to have taken a track through the Mona Passage before the storm eventually dissipated east of the Bahamas on September\u00a014.[1]:\u200a391\u200a[9] However, the RMS analysis disputed this description of the storm's path, instead depicting a track that took the storm northward between Puerto Rico and the Windward Islands.[8]:\u200a28\u200a Compendiums of storms affecting Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic do not suggest impacts from the hurricane.[2]:\u200a19\u200a The centre of the storm likely passed near Sombrero Island on September\u00a013, where a minimum air pressure of 998\u00a0mbar (29.48\u00a0inHg) was measured.[8]:\u200a32\u200a According to the RMS analysis, the hurricane continued northward before curving to the northwest upon reaching the 23rd parallel north. On September\u00a017, the storm reached the 30th parallel north and began accelerating to the northeast at an average forward speed of around 24\u00a0mph (39\u00a0km/h). The storm spanned around 400\u00a0mi (640\u00a0km) in diameter when it passed near Bermuda and expanded to around 450\u00a0mi (720\u00a0km) in diameter when it tracked east of Nova Scotia. The RMS analysis located the storm at around 42\u00b0N 42\u00b0W\ufeff / \ufeff42\u00b0N 42\u00b0W\ufeff / 42; -42 on September\u00a020.[8]:\u200a28\u200a However, the Atlantic hurricane database depicts the storm completing extratropical transition by September\u00a020 and taking a track across Newfoundland before dissipating in the Labrador Sea later that day.[7]"

The ship lost all sail and nearly all of its rice cargo, and over the course of two days it was blown 60\u00a0mi (97\u00a0km) off course.[1]:\u200a392\u2013393\u200a Rain showers were frequent in Barbados between September\u00a01 and September\u00a010, but such weather conditions were typical for the island.[1]:\u200a392\u200a More inclement weather began to prevail in Barbados ahead of the hurricane on September\u00a06, continuing for several days with showers and thunderstorms.[8]:\u200a24\u200a Despite the frequent rainfall, the air pressure held steady for several days.[d] The existence of an approaching hurricane remained inconclusive until September\u00a010, when observations suggested a tropical cyclone was present southeast of Barbados, and the air pressure began to fall rapidly.[1]:\u200a392\u200a These findings were transmitted to the U.S. Weather Bureau in Washington, D.C. at 12:40\u00a0p.m. that day by P. McDonough, a Weather Bureau Observer stationed at Bridgetown.[1]:\u200a392\u200a[11]:\u200a116\u200a In response, the U.S. Weather Bureau communicated hurricane warnings to the bureau's stations in the Lesser Antilles, requesting the stations to disseminate warnings to those in their purview. Additional advisories were transmitted throughout the Caribbean Sea to support observation of the storm. Initial forecasts from the U.S. Weather Bureau projected that the hurricane would track slowly northwest with increasing strength.[1]:\u200a392\u200a Ships moored at the Bridgetown harbour and Carlisle Bay either left or were secured further in advance of the hurricane.[1]:\u200a393\u200a The hurricane warning efforts of the newly established West Indian Weather Service of the U.S. Weather Bureau were later lauded by the press, including the Daily Gleaner, the New York Times, and the Times-Democrat.[1]:\u200a394\u200a However, McDonough wrote that the many locals \"pooh-poohed the information given out,\" believing that the island was \"immune\" from hurricanes due to the long period of time elapsed since the last destructive storm.[1]:\u200a393 The hurricane impacted Barbados on the night of September\u00a010\u201311, a night that the Barbados Agricultural Reporter described as one that would \"live forever in the memory of the present generation of Barbadians.\" The storm's forces were experienced for around ten hours, with the strongest winds buffeting the island from around 7:30\u00a0p.m. on September\u00a010 to 4\u00a0a.m. on September\u00a011.[1]:\u200a392\u200a Gale-force winds were experienced after 6:30\u00a0p.m. and hurricane-force winds set in after 9\u00a0p.m.[8]:\u200a25\u200a[1]:\u200a392\u200a McDonough recorded a peak one-minute sustained wind of 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h) at 10:18\u00a0p.m. The shelter housing the associated anemometer and other weather instruments was subsequently destroyed by the wind, damaging the instruments or leaving them unusable. McDonough believed that winds were at their strongest between 11\u00a0p.m. and midnight.[1]:\u200a392\u200a Winds in Bridgetown peaked at 62\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h).[2]:\u200a15\u200a McDonough also recorded a minimum air pressure of 997.7\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.462\u00a0inHg) at 9:20\u00a0p.m. and a total rainfall accumulation of 11.42\u00a0in (290\u00a0mm) between 6\u00a0p.m. September\u00a010 and 10:30\u00a0a.m. September\u00a012. The September\u00a017 issue of The Barbados Advocate provided the following summation of the storm's impact:[1]:\u200a392 Fiercer and more destructive hurricanes may have visited the West Indies in years past, but taking into consideration the general condition of her industry and its gloomy prospects, never has a more appalling calamity fallen on this island since first it rose out of these western seas, than the fearful hurricane that ravaged it from shore to shore on [the night of September 10]. The hurricane killed 83\u00a0people and injured 150 on Barbados according to the U.S. Weather Bureau,[1]:\u200a391\u200a though a report published in the Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society documented 115\u00a0fatalities on the island.[8]:\u200a29\u200a McDonough reported that 5,062\u00a0houses were completely destroyed and another 2,359 sustained at least partial damage, displacing some 40,000\u201345,000\u00a0people.[1]:\u200a393\u200a The RMS report enumerated 11,400\u00a0destroyed homes and 50,000\u00a0displaced people.[8]:\u200a29\u200a Property damage resulting from the hurricane amounted to US$2.5\u00a0million according to the U.S. Weather Bureau.[1]:\u200a391\u200a Impacts from the hurricane were experienced throughout Barbados, though the most severe effects occurred along the eastern and southern areas of the island. Despite being secured by additional anchors, several ships harboured at Carlisle Bay were severed from their anchorage and blown out to sea by the hurricane and marooned on reefs near Bridgeport and 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km) to the west along reefs near St. Vincent.[1]:\u200a393\u200a Five ships were driven out to sea with their anchors dragged along the seafloor, losing all sail and drifting broadside for a distance of roughly 105\u00a0mi (169\u00a0km) over the course of 15\u00a0hours before beaching near Georgetown, St. Vincent.[8]:\u200a26\u200a The crews of the vessels Grace Lynwood, Lapland, and Loando were rescued after being blown onto the St. Vincent reefs. The vessels Florence, Florence B. Parr, Kate Florence, and Lovdahl were all blown out to sea with no subsequent correspondence. The Campania, Elmo, Ocean Traveller, and many lighters were beached on reefs near Bridgeport and deemed total losses. Smaller ships were destroyed by the heavy surf.[1]:\u200a393 A section of the Bridgetown wharf was severed by the rough seas, and waves crashed over the wharf onto the city streets. The streets were rendered impassable by the storm, snarling vehicle traffic and streetcar service; the Bridgetown streetcar service was restored in limited capacity on September\u00a012. The suburbs of Bridgetown sustained considerable damage, with trees snapped or uprooted and frame houses razed. Strong winds blew down thousands of telephone poles, incapacitating the island's entire telephone system.[1]:\u200a393\u200a St. Michael and Belleville also suffered extensively, with The Times reporting them as \"totally demolished\".[2]:\u200a17\u200a The sugar cane crop also experienced significant losses.[1]:\u200a393"

Strong winds destroyed almost every church and chapel on the island and uprooted numerous trees.[8]:\u200a29\u200a Nearly all of the large trees at the Botanic Gardens were downed. Trees and homes that withstood the northerly winds accompanying the initial approach of the hurricane were destroyed by the opposing winds that followed.[1]:\u200a393\u200a Heavy rain from the hurricane produced floods that cascaded down mountainsides, razing entire villages and estates.[8]:\u200a29\u200a Shipping in Kingstown was wrecked by the rough seas.[8]:\u200a29\u200a The villages of Richmond and Wallibou were a \"complete wreck\", with no houses remaining. In Chateaubelair, many houses were demolished, while a few were still standing after the storm, albeit with severe damage. Forty-five deaths occurred in the village. Similar impact was reported in Cumberland, with one death. Only one house was not destroyed at Barrouallie. Thirty fatalities were reported, eleven of which occurred after a church which people sought refuge in was wrecked. In Layou, only the police barracks remained standing.[citation needed] Much of the damage in St. Lucia was inflicted by a ten-hours-long rainfall that led to floods and landslides.[2]:\u200a17\u200a Valleys in St. Lucia temporarily became lakes after accumulating floodwaters. A landslide triggered by heavy rain in St. Lucia engulfed homes within a 3\u00a0mi (4.8\u00a0km) stretch of a valley. Castries Harbour suffered heavy damage due to the heavy seas.[8]:\u200a29"

        "content": "The storm system that eventually spawned the Wallingford tornado produced damaging winds and at least one tornado far before it reached the town. The first tornado from this storm system touched down in South Kent, unroofing houses, blowing down barns, and uprooting and tossing trees into the air. It moved steadily southeast for 12\u00a0mi (19\u00a0km), moving just south of New Preston, and then through Washington, before turning north and dissipating. The next path of damage started further north along the Shepaug River. It is unknown whether this was a tornado or straight-line winds, but the damage path continued southeast for three miles before disappearing again. More damage was reported near Waterbury, where a house was unroofed two miles west of the town. In the town itself, branches and chimneys were damaged.[3][4] As the storm approached Wallingford, observers described a black, rolling funnel, with clouds blowing in from all directions. This system passed directly over Cheshire, producing a strong wind at the surface which caused some minor damage. The storm then moved directly towards Wallingford.[4]"

At around 6 p.m., the air at the surface was calm, but lightning began to fill the sky, and the clouds began moving at a very rapid pace, frightening some residents into shelter. The tornado started at 6:15\u00a0p.m. local time[1] as a waterspout over Community Lake, just west of town. It then moved through the center of town along Christian Street, damaging almost every structure as it went. The tornado tore houses from their foundations, throwing some more than 600 feet (180 meters). A receipt from the town was later found 65 miles (105\u00a0km) east in Peacedale, Rhode Island.[4] Large trees were uprooted and snapped, and those that were still standing were stripped of small limbs and leaves. The Catholic Church was blown to bits, and heavy tombstones in the nearby cemetery were tossed around. The brand-new brick high school building was almost completely destroyed.[6] The tornado's path through town was only two miles long, but the damage path was up to 600 feet (180 meters) wide.[7] More tornadic damage was reported in southern Durham and Killingworth, with some homes severely damaged, but there were some minor injuries, one young woman in Killingworth was injured by shards of glass from a breaking window. Some sources insist that the Wallingford tornado dissipated a few miles west of the town, and this was an entirely separate tornado, but without a modern damage survey it is impossible to tell. The parent storm finally moved out over the ocean around 8 PM.[1][4]"

One person was found dead 3,300 feet (1.0\u00a0km) from where he had been standing.[8] The tornado brought down telegraph lines and poles around the area, so assistance from physicians in nearby towns took more than an hour.[8]  More than 50 special police were sworn in to prevent looting, and to control the crowds of curious onlookers who had come by train from surrounding cities.[9] Thirty five homes were completely destroyed, with many more being unroofed or receiving some sort of damage. Damage estimates were around $150,000 from buildings alone; utilities and railway facilities received a lot of damage as well.[8] Final estimates were around $250,000 ($5.3 million when adjusted for inflation).[4][10] Tornadoes are not very uncommon in the state of Connecticut, but tornadoes of this power are rare. Though tornadoes have only been officially rated on the Fujita scale since 1950, this tornado has been estimated to be of F4-intensity on the scale.[1] This would make it one of only three tornadoes of this intensity to ever affect the state, as of 2008.[11] Thirty-four people were killed by the tornado\u2014thirty-one more than the second-deadliest Connecticut tornado\u2014and 70 others injured.[1][12] The tornado also devastated a branch of the Oneida Community that had operated in Wallingford from 1851[13] through 1878.[14] The subsidiary community closed down and the members consolidated with the main community.[15][16]"

        "content": "The first storm damage occurred in Litchfield, Connecticut, where a strong northwest wind and hail stones weighing more than 1 ounce (28\u00a0g) damaged crops and broke windows. Four men were struck by lightning, but survived.[4] The first tornado touched down near New Britain, Connecticut, between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m., moving east-northeast. A barn roof was blown 2 miles (3.2\u00a0km) away. The tornado then passed through Newington on its way to Wethersfield. The tornado there was described as \"[whirling] with amazing velocity and a most tremendous roar.\"[1] It passed through a mostly-uninhabited part of the town; if the path were more than 0.5 miles (0.8\u00a0km) further north or south, the tornado \"would have been fatal to a large number of families.\"[5] The tornado traveled slightly north of east, and struck just one home. The inhabitants fled the house upon the sight of the tornado: two young boys, a laborer, and a mother and baby were overtaken by the tornado in a nearby field. The two boys were found amid some rubble, one dead and one was \"feared mortally wounded.\" The mother was killed as well, but the baby who was in her arms survived with only minor injuries. The laborer was thrown over a fence but only slightly injured.[5] Their house was unroofed, and several outbuildings were \"leveled with the ground\". Clothes from the house were found three miles away, and trees and boards were carried 0.5 miles (0.8\u00a0km) or more.[1] The tornado continued east-northeast from Wethersfield, leveling almost all trees in its path, until it reached Glastonbury.[5] There it damaged several homes and barns, including an unroofing of a large brick home, but only injured two people slightly. The damage continued into at least Bolton and Coventry, where more damage was done, but any specific damage done or human casualties are unknown.[1][5] The second tornado was spotted west of East Windsor. It moved northeast away from the center of town, but did damage to a home and a barn. Trees 2.5 feet (0.76\u00a0m) in diameter were twisted down, and even sod and stones \"of a considerable size\" were torn up.[5][6] No injuries were reported, however. The third tornado of the outbreak was a long-tracked tornado, first spotted in Killingly, Connecticut. It moved northeast into Rhode Island to near Glocester. Orchards were destroyed there, and a house and barn were \"torn to pieces\" while the family took shelter in the cellar.[7] Several other homes were unroofed, and a woman was carried some distance, but only suffered minor injuries.[7] The tornado continued northeast into Massachusetts as far as Mendon, 20 miles (32\u00a0km) from where it touched down.[8] The fourth known tornado was first spotted near Northborough, Massachusetts. The tornado caused more severe damage along the border between Marlborough and Southborough. In Marlborough, a barn was thrown from its foundation. A house's roof was destroyed, with pieces scattered 0.75 miles (1.2\u00a0km) away. In Southborough and Framingham, many structures were damaged. A house in Framingham was destroyed while two women were inside, but they suffered only bruises. The tornado dissipated east of Framingham.[6] Many crops were destroyed by winds and floods.[9] Observers reported seeing pieces of buildings, furniture, and trees thrown about in the air. Severe tree damage was reported all along the tornado's path. Along the tornado's route, the damage was not more than 40 rods (660\u00a0ft; 200\u00a0m) wide, and in some places was much narrower, though the damage was greatest in these areas.[6][10] The final tornado of the day occurred much further north in the town of Rochester, New Hampshire. A house was lifted from its foundation with eight people inside, but only two were injured. Pieces of the house were found 3 miles (4.8\u00a0km) distant. A barn was \"taken and entirely carried off\" by the tornado, and was not found. Trees, fences, and crops were leveled along the tornado's path, which was around 20 rods (330\u00a0ft; 100\u00a0m) wide.[11] Considerable damage also occurred in Dunbarton, New Hampshire and Concord, New Hampshire, but it is not known if this was not directly connected to the tornado.[12]"

However, they most often occur in the Southern and Central United States, and are comparatively rare in New England. However, no region is immune to tornadoes if the weather conditions are right.[3] While tornadoes have been recorded in almost every county in New England, there is a region just east of the Berkshires with a much higher concentration of tornado occurrences. This area is analogous to the Tornado Alley of the Great Plains, but on a much smaller scale.[1][2] On average (1950\u20132008), more than two tornadoes per year strike the state of Massachusetts alone, with New England as a whole recording more than 8.[1][2] Most tornadoes reported in the region are \"weak\", rated EF0 or EF1 on the Enhanced Fujita scale (the Fujita scale prior to 2007). Around 30% are \"significant\" tornadoes (rated EF2 or greater), and only 1% are violent (rated EF4 or EF5, the highest damage rating). Weak tornadoes occur in all areas of New England, but EF3 or greater tornadoes have been reported only in New England's practical \"Tornado Alley\" of Massachusetts, Connecticut, and southern New Hampshire.[2] Peak tornado activity in New England occurs during the summer months of June, July and August. Tornadoes typically strike between 3 and 9 pm local time, and move at a forward speed of around 30 miles per hour (48\u00a0km/h).[4]"

        "content": "The storm system that caused the tornado had produced severe weather, including two weak tornadoes, in eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey that morning.[2] This was an unusual setup for a significant tornado, associated with a warm front near a low-pressure center. A thunderstorm cell formed south of Long Island around 10:20 am, and became a supercell sometime later after interacting with a surface low-pressure center.[2] It turned north as a left-moving supercell, meaning it moved left with respect to the mean atmospheric flow. Left-moving supercells are very rare, as cyclonic storms usually turn to the right of the mean flow.[3] It is unknown whether this leftward movement was due to an atmospheric interaction or terrain-induced movement, as the storm moved straight up the Connecticut River valley.[2] No tornado watches or warnings were issued before the storm struck. This was later determined to be because of missing atmospheric sounding data, as well as an incorrect assessment of the height of the tropopause, which led to an underestimation of the strength of the thunderstorm which produced the tornado.[2] Although a severe thunderstorm warning was issued at 2:57 pm, very few people received the warnings in time.[4] Eyewitness reports have the tornado ripping the roof off a grocery store in Wethersfield, Connecticut. Trees were uprooted in East Hartford, Connecticut. The tornado then touched down in Poquonock, Connecticut, a village in the town of Windsor, just north of Hartford. Poquonock Elementary School was heavily damaged; fortunately, students were sent home early at 1:30 pm on Wednesdays.[5] Students at a Brownie meeting were led into a hallway just before the auditorium they had been in was destroyed.[6] The historic Poquonock Community Church building had its roof ripped off. All but one of the stained glass windows from the old church was salvaged.[7] The tornado traveled almost due north, an unusual direction for a tornado. The most severe damage occurred along River Road, Hollow Brook Road, Pioneer Drive and Settler Circle, where large frame houses were left \"in splinters\".[4] The tornado roughly followed Connecticut Route 75 just east of Bradley International Airport. The airport's weather station recorded a wind gust of 39\u00a0m/s (87\u00a0mph; 140\u00a0km/h) as the tornado passed nearby.[2] A United Airlines flight with 114 passengers was attempting to land as the tornado was passing the airport; the pilot saw the tornado and was able to abort the landing just in time.[8] The tornado then crossed the northern portion of the airport, where the New England Air Museum was located. More than 20 vintage aircraft were completely destroyed, with many more damaged. The museum's hangar was also rendered unusable.[9] The tornado moved north into Feeding Hills before dissipating near the Westfield city line, about five miles north of the Massachusetts state line. The tornado was accompanied by more than 7 centimetres (2.8\u00a0in) of rain, and several instances of downburst winds.[2] Damage from downburst winds was reported across the Connecticut River in Enfield.[10]"

Governor Ella Grasso lived just a block away from the tornado's path, though she was in Hartford at the time of the storm. She declared an 8 pm\u20135 am curfew in the days following the tornado.[5][11] About 500 National Guardsmen were activated to prevent looting and direct traffic, and the area was declared a disaster area by President Carter.[11] FEMA trailers were provided within a few days, and were used by many residents until reconstruction or repairs could be completed.[4][6] In all, at least 38 businesses were damaged or destroyed, 65 homes were completely destroyed, and at least 75 homes were damaged. Twenty-five tobacco sheds were \"extensively damaged\".[12] At the airport, at least 30 vintage aircraft were damaged or destroyed, as well as most of the state's National Guard helicopters.[9][12] Because of the vast scope of the damage, initially Windsor town officials feared many, possibly even hundreds, of people could have been killed.[4] While there were many serious injuries, only three people were killed by the storm. Two victims, construction workers working in a bank parking lot, took shelter in a work truck when they saw the storm approach. The first victim was killed immediately by a piece of flying lumber, the other died a few weeks later from his injuries becoming the third victim.[4] The second victim was found the next day across the street from her obliterated house.[4][13] Over 400 people were hospitalized, mostly for injuries from flying glass or the victims' having been thrown by winds.[5]"

It eventually dissipated on November\u00a06, shortly after hitting northwest France. The storm affected the town of Norfolk, where it became the most damaging storm since 1879. Despite the damage inland, the storm is best known for the unusually high number of shipwrecks and maritime incidents it caused. One ship, a schooner called the Manantico, capsized, killing the captain and one of its crew members. Three other ships were driven ashore on Virginia beaches from False Cape to Cape Henry, and numerous others were put in danger."

It crossed land and emerged over water within the next eight hours while weakening.[3] During its passage near Fort Meade, the storm had an estimated barometric pressure of 1,007 millibars (29.7\u00a0inHg), supporting minimal tropical storm strength.[4] Upon crossing the state, it paralleled the East Coast for two days while restrengthening. It passed closest to land near the North Carolina coastline on October\u00a031 at its peak intensity, with sustained winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) and a pressure of 993 millibars (29.3\u00a0inHg). Shortly after moving away from land, it became extratropical.[2][3] The extratropical cyclone moved away from the coast and strengthened to the equivalent of a Category\u00a01 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale on November\u00a01. It began a weakening trend on November\u00a02 while taking a wavering path across the north Atlantic Ocean.[2] On November\u00a04, the cyclone started a general east-southeast motion, passing near the southwest coasts of Ireland and Great Britain. It made landfall on the Cotentin Peninsula of France on November\u00a06 and dissipated, although one proposed track, which is a modified track that differs from the official record due to new evidence or theory, was given by Charles Mitchell that showed the cyclone executing a counter-clockwise loop over northwest France until the storm dissipated on November\u00a08.[3]"

        "content": "In its formative stages, the storm was responsible for causing rain from the Rio Grande Valley along the Gulf Coast to Florida.[1] As the storm crossed Florida, Fort Meade recorded less than 1\u00a0in (2.5\u00a0cm) of rainfall.[4] As it  strengthened off the East Coast, the storm caused damage in various towns. A maximum wind speed of 54\u00a0mph (87\u00a0km/h) was measured at Hatteras, North Carolina. In Kitty Hawk, impact from the storm was more intense, generating maximum winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) to as high as 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) from late on October\u00a030 to the following afternoon; despite the intensity, only minor damage was reported. In Lenoir and Raleigh, heavy rain totals up to 4.18\u00a0in (10.6\u00a0cm) were reported. Unusually, reports of hail and snow were also received from these locations. Telegraph poles were snapped on Bodie Island and south of Little Kinnakeet, affecting communication. The worst land-based impact from the storm was in Virginia. Cape Henry was hit with a combination of wind, rain, and blown sand on October\u00a031 and communications between Cape Henry and Norfolk were lost. In Norfolk, the storm was the longest-lasting and most damaging since the Great Beaufort Hurricane of 1879.[1] The storm conditions made beaches in the area so hazardous that they were watched day and night.[5] Effects from the storm reached as far north as Provincetown, Massachusetts, where winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) were recorded.[3] Despite causing damage along the East Coast, the storm is best known for causing a record number of maritime incidents.[6] Numerous ships were caught in the storm from October\u00a030, when the steamship Claribel reported gale-force winds, to November\u00a06, when another steamship, the Australia, reported stormy weather. One ship, the brig Osseo, was caught in the storm on November\u00a01 and became flooded. Although the pumps were manned, the water level inside the ship soon reached 4\u00a0ft (1.2\u00a0m). After being carried away by a wave, the distressed ship was spotted by the Camalia, which rescued the crew and brought them to port. Another vessel, the Wyonoka, spotted a sunken schooner with its five crew grasping the mast and ropes: they were also rescued.[3] In addition, four ships were deemed total losses after being beached in Virginia. The first was the Mary D. Cranmer, which was ripped from its cables and stranded near Cape Henry. Shortly after the rescue of the crew of the Cranmer another ship, the Carrie Holmes, was found beached. The ship had been driven so far up the beach that its crew were able to jump and wade to safety.[5] A third ship, the Manantico also crashed into shore due to a combination of the storm and human error in which the captain confused Cape Henry with Cape Charles after spotting another schooner. The Manantico was also where the two deaths associated with the storm occurred. The first was when a cook on the ship was crushed to death by the cargo of lumber being hauled by the ship. The ship was then pushed towards a sand bar. The captain, who had stayed high on the starboard side for safety, began climbing down to slip the ship cables, but the ship made a sudden stop. This flung the captain into the water, and he drowned. Both bodies were found after the storm and were very disfigured. The captain was sent to Middletown, Connecticut for interment while the body of the cook was buried on the beach.[7] The final ship was the Harriet Thomas, which was the schooner spotted by the Manantico. After beaching, the crew managed to get a rope to shore where fishermen had tied the other end. The crew were able to climb ashore, although the captain had to be rescued via alternate means due to being too heavy for this method. The ship was written off as a $7,000 (1887 USD) loss. Although all four ships were beached, due to the loss of communications, only one wreck \u2013 that of the Mary D. Cranmer \u2013 was reported in the Norfolk Virginian newspaper. As a result, news of the two deaths from the Manantico were initially unreported.[5]"

It was the most intense North Atlantic hurricane since Hurricane Wilma of 2005, tying for eighth overall. Additionally, it made the fourth most intense Atlantic hurricane landfall. A Cape Verde hurricane that formed on August 13, 2007, Dean took a west-northwest path from the eastern Atlantic Ocean through the Saint Lucia Channel and into the Caribbean. It strengthened into a major hurricane,[nb 1] reaching Category\u00a05 status on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale before passing just south of Jamaica on August 20. The storm made landfall on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula on August\u00a021 at peak intensity. It crossed the peninsula and emerged into the Bay of Campeche weakened, but still remained a hurricane. It strengthened briefly before making a second landfall near Tecolutla in the Mexican state of Veracruz on August 22. Dean drifted to the northwest, weakening into a remnant low which dissipated uneventfully over the southwestern United States. Dean was the second-most intense tropical cyclone worldwide of 2007 in terms of pressure, only behind Cyclone George in the Australian region, and tied with Felix as the most intense worldwide in terms of 1-minute sustained winds. The hurricane's intense winds, waves, rains and storm surge were responsible for at least 45\u00a0deaths across ten countries and caused estimated damages of US$1.66\u00a0billion. First impacting the islands of the Lesser Antilles, Dean's path through the Caribbean devastated agricultural crops, particularly those of Martinique and Jamaica. Upon reaching Mexico, Hurricane Dean was a Category\u00a05 storm, but it missed major population centers and its exceptional Category\u00a05 strength landfall caused no deaths and less damage than in the Caribbean islands it passed as a Category\u00a02 storm. Through the affected regions, clean up and repair took months to complete. Donations solicited by international aid organizations joined national funds in clearing roads, rebuilding houses, and replanting destroyed crops. In Jamaica, where the damage was worst, banana production did not return to pre-storm levels for over a year. Mexico's tourist industry, too, took almost a year to rebuild its damaged cruise ship infrastructure. Dean was the first hurricane to make landfall in the Atlantic basin at Category\u00a05 intensity since Hurricane Andrew on August 24, 1992.[1] Dean's Category\u00a05 landfall was in a sparsely populated area and thus far less damaging than Andrew's, even though Dean was much larger, but its long swath of damage resulted in its name retirement from the World Meteorological Organization's Atlantic hurricane naming lists."

Ragged bands formed on August 15[9] and the formation of a partial eyewall was observed later that day.[10] Intensification continued,[11] and the storm was upgraded to Hurricane Dean at 5\u00a0am EDT (0900 UTC) August 16.[12] The deep-layered ridge to the north continued to steer the system west, towards the Caribbean Sea.[13] The storm quickly strengthened to a Category\u00a02 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson Hurricane Scale.[14][15] The storm's development slowed slightly but[16] a reconnaissance aircraft discovered a closed eyewall on August 17 as the storm passed through the Lesser Antilles.[17] Data from the aircraft indicated that Hurricane Dean had strengthened to a Category\u00a03 hurricane[18] and its trailing bands were still over the Lesser Antilles.[19] During the evening of August 17, Dean strengthened into a Category\u00a04 hurricane[20] and continued to steadily grow in both size and intensity through the night.[21] On August 18 the presence of a double eyewall was noted,[22] indicating an eyewall replacement cycle and causing short term fluctuations in intensity.[23] These fluctuations did not affect the storm's well defined satellite presentation.[22] Operationally, Dean was thought to have only been a Category\u00a04 on the 18th, but post-storm analysis shows that Dean had become a 165\u00a0miles per hour (265\u00a0km/h) Category\u00a05 on that day. Dean weakened very slightly on the morning of August 19 as it finished the eyewall replacement cycle and began to interact with the island of Jamaica.[24] Hurricane Dean passed south of Jamaica on the evening of August 19[25] and began to intensify again that night.[26] Its eyewall replacement cycle was thought to be completed.[27] A concentric eyewall was briefly observed again on the morning of August 20, but did not last long. The hurricane, still tracking west-northwest under the influence of a strengthening deep-layered high-pressure system to the north, moved over waters with extremely high heat content and began to strengthen once again.[28] The eyewall became even better defined during the day,[29] and, at 8:35\u00a0pm AST on August 20 (0035 August 21, UTC), Dean restrengthened to a Category 5 hurricane, the highest rating on the Saffir\u2013Simpson Hurricane Scale.[30] It made landfall as a Category\u00a05 storm in Quintana Roo's Costa Maya region, 40\u00a0mi (65\u00a0km) northeast of the border between Mexico and Belize, and weakened on its way over land, reemerging on the western side of Yucat\u00e1n as a Category\u00a01 storm.[31] Dean regained strength as it crossed the Gulf of Mexico, and made its second landfall as a Category\u00a02 storm on August 22, at around 11:30 CDT, near Tecolutla, Veracruz, to the south of Tuxpan, where after it moved westward, losing strength and disintegrating over central Mexico. A small remnant circulation reached the Pacific Ocean,[32] eventually moving northwestward around an anticyclone, roughly parallel to the Mexican coast and finally back inland over the southwestern United States,[33] where it completely dissipated on August 27.[34]"

On August 14 the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Response Agency (CDERA) placed its Regional Response Mechanism on standby and contacted the National Disaster Coordinators of all member states in the Lesser Antilles.[48] On August 15 the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) dispatched teams to Barbados, Dominica, and St. Kitts in advance of the hurricane to provide damage assessment should the hurricane affect those islands.[49] The Eastern Caribbean Donor Group convened a meeting on August 16 under the Chair of the Resident Representative United Nations Development Programme Barbados in anticipation that member states would require international assistance.[48]"

The Jamaican government executed long-standing evacuation plans, including converting the country's national arena into a shelter and relocating inmates from two maximum security prisons.[59] Political parties in the island suspended their campaigning for the August 27 national elections, to allow residents to prepare for the storm.[60] Curfews were put in place for parts of the island, while off-duty essential personnel were called back to work. More than 1,000 schools and churches were converted to emergency shelters, but residents only occupied 47 of them before the storm's arrival. Evidently the country's high crime rate led islanders to fear for their belongings should they abandon their homes.[61][62] UNICEF prepared 4 emergency health kits and 1,000 water containers and Copa Airlines agreed to fly the supplies to Jamaica on its scheduled August 22 flight, if possible. The World Food Program prepared food stocks in nearby Haiti, ready to move them to Jamaica if they were needed.[57] The United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) team tried to reach Jamaica, but only one member arrived before all incoming flights were canceled.[57] The United States confirmed that it would offer aid if it was needed,[63] and the North-West Caribbean Donor Group met to decide what actions would need to be taken.[58] The island of Hispaniola was also predicted to be heavily affected by the storm. Workers from World Vision supplied food, clean water, medicines and emergency generators in the southern provinces of the Dominican Republic, and in the southern departments of Haiti where hurricane warnings had been issued.[56] In low-lying areas, 1,580\u00a0residents of the Dominican Republic and more than 1,000\u00a0Haitians were evacuated as the storm approached.[55] Small craft were advised to stay in port, while Haiti's Toussaint Louverture International Airport was closed.[59] The Cayman Islands were expected to suffer badly if Hurricane Dean passed too close, and mandatory evacuations were instigated for the low-lying Little Cayman.[64][65] Tourists were forbidden from entering the island[66] and extra flights were added to evacuate those that were already there.[63][66] Schools and civic centers were converted to shelters on Grand Cayman and Cayman Brac, and, despite the mandatory evacuation, one shelter was opened on Little Cayman for the residents who remained there.[67] Expecting catastrophic damage, two Royal Navy ships of the Atlantic Patrol Task (North), HMS\u00a0Portland and RFA Wave Ruler, followed 150\u00a0mi (240\u00a0km) behind the storm in order to arrive at Cayman as soon after the hurricane as possible.[68] Cuba and Puerto Rico, neither of which were expected to experience the worst of Dean's strength, prepared more modestly. Cuba's Civil Defense evacuated 350,000\u00a0people from the coastal provinces.[55][69] The government in Havana suspended all tourist programs ahead of the storm.[63] Soldiers and emergency officials were prepared to convert schools and other government buildings into temporary shelters, but stood down when it became evident that they would not needed.[59] The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) deployed a five-member team to Puerto Rico ahead of Hurricane Dean.

In St. Lucia, damage was mostly caused by the high seas and was estimated at US$18\u00a0million.[35] Martinique experienced 75\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h) winds with gusts to 105\u00a0mph (170\u00a0km/h).[17] The torrential rainfall, which reached 332\u00a0mm (13.07\u00a0in)[35] caused flooding throughout the island, with the town of Rivi\u00e8re-Pilote flooding completely. The majority of Martinique's population were left without electricity, water, telephone, or food, and 600 Martiniquans were left homeless.[98][99][100] The storm destroyed Martinique's entire banana crop, and 70% of the island's sugar cane plantations.[101] The damage to these two agricultural sectors accounted for the majority of the island's \u20ac400\u00a0million damage. On the evening of August 16, 12\u00a0hours before the storm arrived in St. Lucia, power outages began in some of the island's neighborhoods. The night saw heavy rains, 1.58\u00a0in (40\u00a0mm) at St. Lucia's Hewanorra International Airport,[102][103] and intense thunderstorms and by morning hurricane-force winds peaked at 90\u00a0mph (145\u00a0km/h).[104] The winds uprooted trees,[45] downed electricity poles, disabled bridges, triggered landslides, and damaged several roofs. Saint Lucia's capital, Castries, was flooded by the storm surge which left boulders and fishing boats on the streets. One person drowned in Sarrot after being swept away by a rain-swollen river while trying to recover a cow.[83][105] Hurricane Dean damaged the roofs of two of the island's hospitals, but no-one was injured.[46][106] Several other buildings were damaged, mostly on the island's northern coast which was most exposed to the hurricane.[107] The Ministry of Education reported that 11 schools had sustained a combined total of EC$300,000 of damage,[108] and nationwide damage to housing and buildings totaled EC$800,000.[108] The Ministry of Communications, Works, Transport, and Public Utilities reported that most of the country's major infrastructure remained functional, and no long-term disruptions occurred.[107][108] The hardest hit area of Saint Lucia was its agricultural sector. 5,000 acres (20\u00a0km2) of banana farms in Mabouya Valley, Roseau Valley, and Marc Marc were severely damaged with many of the plantations waterlogged or outright destroyed.[104][109] An average of 75% of the crops were lost, with fields in the Northern Farms losing up to 80% and in the Roseau Valley losing up to 85%. The cost to the agriculture industry was $13.2\u00a0million, bringing Hurricane Dean's total cost on the island to $17.3\u00a0million (US$6.4\u00a0million in 2007) or 0.5% of the nation's GDP.[108][110][111]"

They estimated the storm left 600\u00a0people homeless. The brevity of their visit prompted some of Martinique's famous writers, including Edouard Glissant, Patrick Chamoiseau and Raphael Confiant, to write an open letter airing their grievances concerning French politics and the handling of Hurricane Dean's impact.[154] Fran\u00e7ois Fillon then visited Guadeloupe and brought with him a team of experts from the Ministry of the Interior to assess the nature and cost of the damage.[155] The local government reported to them that 75% of Guadeloupe's banana plantations, valued at \u20ac100\u00a0million, were totally destroyed.[35] Despite promises by Overseas Minister Christian Estrosi that all problems would be resolved within three months,[156] it took over six months to restart banana production, and several more to restore lost capacity.[157] Other than the crop damage, the island suffered only minor wind and flooding damage, both of which were quickly repaired.[158]"

This aid was targeted at the country's hardest-hit parishes.[159] She also announced a JA$500\u00a0million (US$7.1\u00a0million) programme to provide grants and low-interest loans for emergency housing repairs. Temporary tarpaulins were also provided to patch roofs at no cost.[160] The World Food Program immediately placed 5,500\u00a0Jamaicans on complementary food assistance, a daily ration of 1900\u00a0kJ (450\u00a0kcal) of High Energy Biscuits, for two weeks.[161] Within three days US$398,000 of pre-prepared United States Agency for International Development (USAID) emergency supplies arrived on the island. The airlift was composed mostly of mattresses, blankets, plastic sheeting, hygiene kits and water containers.[116] The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) provided a US$200,000 grant to support the relief effort[162] and the Chinese Red Cross, despite dealing with Typhoon Sepat, sent US$30,000 to its Jamaican counterpart for the purchase of emergency relief supplies.[163] In December, four months after the hurricane struck the island, the World Bank's board of directors approved a US$10\u00a0million emergency loan.[164] World Bank Director for the Caribbean and the Jamaican Finance Minister negotiated a 17-year repayment plan, and endowed the money into the Jamaica Hurricane Dean Emergency Recovery Project. The Jamaica Social Investment Fund, which was charged with implementing the project, used the money to \"rebuild and support schools, health centers, and community and farm roads affected by the hurricane\".[165][166] The Hurricane Dean Emergency Recovery Project finally kicked off in June 2008, with the issuance of rural road repair contracts valued at JA$37\u00a0million (US$520,000).[167] By the end of the summer on 2008, banana production in Jamaica was returning to pre-Dean levels. With the help of JA$1.1\u00a0billion (US$15.5\u00a0million) of aid from the EU's Banana Support Programme, thousands of acres were replanted. Banana chips were the first products ready for export at the beginning of the summer, with fresh banana production following shortly thereafter.[168]"

In Majahual, the only town to experience the full force of the hurricane, hundreds of buildings were destroyed.[35] Quintana Roo Governor F\u00e9lix Gonz\u00e1lez Canto reported that although the cleanup in the state capital of Chetumal was completed within three weeks, it took more than six months to fix all of the region's more rural roads.[129] Unable to handle the hurricane's aftermath, the state government appealed to federal authorities for aid. Together, they established a housing-repair fund which contributed to the reconstruction of over 37,000\u00a0residences.[169] The cruise port of Puerto Costa Maya was severely damaged, causing Carnival Cruise Lines and Royal Caribbean Cruises, the world's two largest cruise operators, to divert away from the port until at least 2009.[170] The Mexican government was quick to fund rebuilding of the destroyed concrete piers[171] which, by June 2008, were rebuilt to accommodate even larger ships than before.[172] The federal government was initially lauded for its swift and thorough preparation to which most observers, including the United Nations, attributed Dean's low death toll.[130][131] However, after the storm there were several accusations of political motivation in the distribution of aid. Members of President Felipe Calder\u00f3n's Partido Accion Nacional (PAN) distributed bags of bread, funded by the nation's disaster relief coffers, carrying the party's logo. In Veracruz, Governor Fidel Herrera was accused by both the PAN and his own Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) of using state resources, including hurricane relief, to support the campaigns of PRI candidates.[173]"

        "content": " Hurricane Liza caused the worst natural disaster in the history of Baja California Sur. The seventeenth tropical cyclone, thirteenth named storm, and eighth hurricane of the 1976 Pacific hurricane season, Liza developed from an area of disturbed weather southwest of the Mexican coast on September\u00a025. Slowly intensifying, the system attained tropical storm strength the following day. In favorable conditions, Liza continued to intensify, reaching hurricane strength on September\u00a028 after developing an eye. The hurricane peaked in intensity as a Category\u00a04 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale on September\u00a030, with winds of 140\u00a0mph (225\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 948\u00a0mbar (948\u00a0hPa; 28.0\u00a0inHg). Liza weakened as it moved northward into the Gulf of California. Shortly thereafter, the hurricane made its second landfall north of Los Mochis, Sinaloa, with winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h), making it one of 17 storms to make landfall as major hurricanes in the basin. Inland, the hurricane rapidly weakened and dissipated on October\u00a02. Prior to the arrival of Liza, residents along the Gulf of California coastline were evacuated, although some refused to leave their homes. Radio stations warned all nearby ships to remain at harbor. Liza brought heavy rainfall to the area, which caused significant flash flooding. Following a dam burst by the El Cajoncito Creek along the outskirts of La Paz, hundreds of people were swept away by flood waters. In La Paz, the capital of the state, 412\u00a0people died and 20,000\u00a0were left homeless. Nearly one third of the homes in the town were destroyed. Throughout the state, a variety of death tolls were reported, but officials estimated that 1,000\u00a0people had perished. In the states of Sinaloa and Sonora, Liza caused moderate damage and left 30,000\u00a0to\u00a054,000 homeless, along with 155\u00a0more casualties. Along the Gulf of California, 108\u00a0people were presumed dead after 12 boats were lost. The remnants of the storm later affected the United States, bringing moderate rainfall In the aftermath of the storm, rescue workers spent days digging through mud to find victims of the hurricane until the search was disbanded on October\u00a06. The government received criticism for the tragedy, citing that the dam that broke had been poorly built. Overall, at least 1,263\u00a0fatalities and $100\u00a0million (1976\u00a0USD) in damage are attributed to the hurricane, making it one of the deadliest tropical cyclones on record in the eastern Pacific, as well as one of the few Pacific hurricanes to kill more than 1,000\u00a0people."

        "content": "Hurricane Liza originated from a very large area of intense thunderstorms that developed about 400\u00a0mi (645\u00a0km) southwest of the Mexican coast on September\u00a025. Later that day, satellite imagery indicated that the system had developed a cyclonic circulation. It is estimated that a tropical depression developed at 1800\u00a0UTC on September\u00a025, centered about 485\u00a0mi (780\u00a0km) east-northeast of Zihuatanejo, Guerrero. The depression gradually intensified as it tracked west-northwestward, and became Tropical Storm Liza at 1800\u00a0UTC on the following day. Thereafter, Liza turned to the north at 7\u00a0mph (11\u00a0km/h) and began to strengthen while moving through sea surface temperatures of 85\u00a0\u00b0F (29\u00a0\u00b0C). Within 48\u00a0hours of the storm's formation, the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center (EPHC) reported winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h), and Liza intensified into a hurricane early on September\u00a028.[1][2] Around this time, the hurricane had developed an eye that was 17\u00a0mi (27\u00a0km) in diameter, though it was initially not visible on satellite imagery. Operationally, however, Liza was not upgraded to a hurricane until 18\u00a0hours later.[1] During the afternoon hours of September\u00a028, a Hurricane Hunters aircraft made its first flight into Liza, recording a minimum barometric pressure of 971\u00a0mbar (28.7\u00a0inHg); despite the low pressure, maximum sustained winds of just 45\u00a0mph (70\u00a0km/h) were reported. Hours later, a second flight into the hurricane revealed winds of 75\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h) and slightly lower pressures. Liza continued to intensify, attaining winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) by early September\u00a029.[1] Later that morning, the hurricane reached Category 2\u00a0intensity on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (SSHWS).[2] By midday, Hurricane Hunters recorded a pressure of 948\u00a0mb (28.0\u00a0inHg) as the eye became visible on infrared satellite imagery,[1] prompting the EPHC to upgrade Liza to a major hurricane, a Category\u00a03 or higher on the SSHWS.[1] Liza continued to rapidly intensify and attained winds of 140\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h) late on September\u00a029, making it a mid-level Category\u00a04 hurricane.[2] Though Liza encountered warm sea surface temperatures of 88\u00a0\u00b0F (31\u00a0\u00b0C), it did not strengthen further the following day. Late on September\u00a030, Liza brushed the Baja California Peninsula, passing about 65\u00a0mi (105\u00a0km) east of Cabo San Lucas[1] while still at peak intensity.[2] Early on October\u00a01, Liza entered the Gulf of California exactly 52\u00a0mi (84\u00a0km) east of La Paz, Baja California Sur. By 1300 UTC that day, Liza made landfall about 50\u00a0mi (80\u00a0km) north of Los Mochis, Sinaloa, with winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h), still a Category 3 storm.[1] Operationally, however, Hurricane Liza was estimated to have made landfall with winds of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h)[3] and gusts up to 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h).[4] The storm continued quickly inland while weakening, dissipating the following day.[1] The remnants of Hurricane Liza later entered the United States near El Paso, Texas.[5]"

For the higher areas of Colorado, a snow watch was in effect.[11] In addition, motorists were warned of very hazards driving conditions within 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km) of the border.[12]"

        "content": "Hurricane Liza caused extensive damage and loss of life in the Mexican state of Baja California Sur.[1] Although the Hydrometeorological Prediction Center (HPC) suggests that Liza brought only light to moderate rains to the area, peaking at around 1\u00a0in (25\u00a0mm),[18] newspaper accounts claim that 11.8\u00a0in (300\u00a0mm) fell (more than a year's worth of rainfall) in some areas in a mere 3 hours.[7] Moreover, 22\u00a0in (559\u00a0mm) was measured in El Triunfo and San Antonio, along the southern portion of the peninsula.[19] In La Paz, Baja California Sur, a storm surge of 8\u00a0ft (2.4\u00a0m) was reported.[20] The El Cajoncito Creek along the extreme southeast portion of the state grew into a raging torrent. During night of October\u00a01, waters burst a three-year-old and 30\u00a0ft (9.1\u00a0m) dike.[3][21] A 5\u00a0ft (1.5\u00a0m) wall of water[22] spilled over a small shanty town of\u00a010,000 inhabitantes, thousands of whom lived in cardboard shacks. Some shacks were swept 6\u00a0mi (9.7\u00a0km) away from their initial location.[3] The ensuing mudslide is regarded as the worst in the history of Mexico.[23] Most of the deaths from the hurricane were due to the dam failure;[24] streets also received flooding from the dam burst.[25] Initially, government officials denied that the dam was poorly built;[3] many politicians and an engineer for the nation's water company blamed the dam's poor construction as the source of the extreme death toll.[26] Prior to the arrival of the storm, many residents had repeatedly requested that a stone wall be built to protect their homes. After the storm, they said that the deaths could have been prevented.[6] According to one account, two master planned communities were situated in the middle of the drainage and were thus deluged by the storm.[27] The water department head took the blame for the construction, but also said that the disaster was a natural phenomenon.[28] \"Dozens\" of people were also swept away into the Gulf of California when Hurricane Liza destroyed a 600\u00a0ft (185\u00a0m) sea wall, which, ironically, had been built to prevent flooding from such storms.[29] Nine children got swept under mud.[12] The highway that connected Baja California with California was also destroyed in many places,[29] more than originally anticipated. In fact, there were holes in the asphalt pavement. Bridges up to 600\u00a0ft (185\u00a0m) long were twisted.[24] Due to flooding, troops evacuated dozens of communities along the Gulf coast. Many desert communities throughout the state were left without any telephone or electrical service;[8] wood, tarpaper, and cardboard were all scattered.[9] Dozens of scores of huts were destroyed. Many humans were swept into the gulf.[30] Sixteen people died inside the remains of a building.[24] Moreover, the Piojillo river overflowed its banks, killing many people and resulting in considerable damage.[31] Elsewhere, destruction was reported in San Jose del Cabo, Cabo San Lucas, San Lucas, and Puntas Arena;[12] Pichilinague also received moderate damage. However, there are no known reports of any casualties in all four of those places.[32] Hurricane Liza was also one of six hurricane to directly impact Los Cabos.[33] South of La Paz, communications and telephone services were cut off to 13 smaller communities. A highway that extends as far south as Cabo San Lucas was blocked. Further north, a highway that links La Paz to places along the northern part of the peninsula such as Mexicali were badly damaged in four places. Offshore, officials reported that 75 boats including nine owned by Americans had sunk during the hurricane.[5] Most notably, the ship Salvatierra's cabin and most of its upper deck were ripped off while its hull rolled over. Multiple trucks smashed the ship; however, they were later salvaged.[34] In addition, an 88\u00a0ft (27\u00a0m) vessel sunk during the storm, in which the owner had to pay for the damage, but later earned $50,000 settlement.[35] Overall, several ports along the coast were destroyed by the storm.[36] In La Paz, a city that at that time had a population of approximately\u00a085,000, some 20,000\u00a0were left homeless[3] (nearly one third of the city's population),[17] and an additional 4,000\u00a0were injured.[37] It is estimated that one out of five homes were destroyed in the city.[5] Widespread flooding was reported throughout the city[37] with mud filling up the first floor of many houses.[38] This flash flooding led to many homes and automobiles being destroyed.[3] Several roofs fell off of homes and landed deep in the mud.[39] Many roads were blocked due to fallen trees while numerous homes were pushed off their foundation;[20] some cars were also abandoned when Hurricane Liza struck.[40] Some cars were reportedly piled against damaged building and debris.[41] Nine people died when a car was swept away in the floodwaters.[32] Also, electrical lines and drinking water supplies were cut in La Paz.[9] Also, communication lines were extensively damaged. La Paz Airport received damage during the hurricane; however, by the afternoon of October\u00a01, the airport re-opened, thus allowing the military to provide much-needed aid to victims.[3] Wood, tarpaper, and cardboard were all scattered throughout La Paz.[9] By October 2, rescue teams had covered 38\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (100\u00a0sq\u00a0km) to configure the damage. Throughout the city, a total of 412 people had been killed,[3] 150 were missing people within the resort city,[29] five of which were later presumed dead.[42] Overall, nearly a third of the houses in La Paz were leveled.[28] A wide variety of death tolls were reported by many different sources.[43] Mexican president Luis Echeverria as well as the HPC and EPHC claimed that 435\u00a0people died during the hurricane.[1][18][44] It was initially stated that 630\u00a0people had died during the storm; however, this total does not include victims discovered by the Mexican army.[3] During the afternoon of October 2, the local government had placed the confirmed death toll at 397. Two days later, the Bangor Daily News reported that the number of bodies found dead ranged from 400\u00a0to\u00a0750.[8] By late October\u00a03, Mexican officials and a Red Cross spokesperson reported that 650\u00a0bodies had been found.[28] Meanwhile, a military search operation claimed that the death toll of the hurricane was\u00a01,050.[24] By October\u00a06, local officials had abandoned efforts to retrieve additional bodies, citing safety reasons. Even though 650\u00a0people were confirmed to have died during Hurricane Liza, officials estimated that at least 1,000\u00a0people died.[45] Within a week after Hurricane Liza, some feared 10,000\u00a0people perished. In addition, some modern estimates suggest that the toll could have been as high as\u00a07,000.[46] The Red Cross estimated that 75% of the deaths from the storm were children under 12.[47] At first, most of the bodies found by the army were buried normally[48] though due to the high death toll, some were just buried under debris.[29] Some dead bodies were later burned to prevent disease.[49][50] According to preliminary estimates by officials, 40,000\u00a0people were made homeless and an addition 20,000\u00a0were injured,[3] 126\u00a0of which were considered significant.[51] Within another day, the homeless total rose to\u00a070,000.[25] Total damage from the hurricane was estimated at $100\u00a0million (1976\u00a0USD).[52]"

Drinking water was supplied, but water supplies rapidly went short.[78] Some survivors of Hurricane Liza complained that they had only received one ration of food and water within 3 days of the passage of Liza.[78] Subsequently, armed troops guarded gangs of looters that damaged additional homes.[17] An effort was made to cure people who were suffering from sickness, but by midday on October\u00a03, after treating more than 5,000\u00a0persons, the effort had been halted due to a lack of sterile cotton vital for administrating the shots.[54] Medical workers attempted to vaccinate all survivors for typhoid fever and tetanus, but the supply of syringes ran short.[17] A large memorial service was held on October\u00a02 in a nearby church.[79] Supplies had been brought in through the air and via the Mexican Navy containing food, blankets, and medicine early on October\u00a02.[3] However, additional bad weather initially prevented further supplies from coming in.[5] Around that time, President Echeverria ordered emergency aid to be sent La Paz, Los Mochis, and Ciudad Obreg\u00f3n, as well as three coastal Sonoran ports.[3] In addition, officials set up tents to house 40,000\u00a0homeless persons.[22] Meanwhile, city officials appealed for additional food, medicine, and construction materials.[9] Gerald Ford, who was then the U.S. president, agreed to provide aid for victims of Hurricane Liza;[80] the first of which arrived late on October\u00a02, containing food and construction materials.[78] The next day, power had been restored to hospitals, government centers, and gas stations.[54] The government said that it was rushing in 100,000\u00a0meals as well as 40,000\u00a0temporary shelters[78] the first of which started to arrive on October\u00a05.[21] within a week after the storm, however, one survivor of the storm noted that plenty of food had arrived from many places.[46] \u00c1ngel C\u00e9sar Mendoza Ar\u00e1mburo, the governor of Baja California Sur, ordered a permanent evacuation of all low-lying residents to prevent more destruction during future floods, saying \"I never want to see this city menaced in this way again\".[54] State and federal officials arranged a meeting on October\u00a03 to make a plan to reconstruct the devastated area,[78] which had to be almost entirely re-built.[81] President Echeverr\u00eda declared that La Paz would be built a different way.[17] In February 1977, houses were donated to the needy in La Paz.[82] On the mainland, $50,000 of relief materials as well as $20,000 of cash was supplied to the Los Mochis area.[55] Many La Paz residents were upset with officials for failing to protect the dam.[8] Months later, the Mexican government launched an investigation into its failure.[83]"

        "content": " The 2011 Halloween nor'easter, sometimes referred to as \"Snowtober,\"[4] \"Shocktober,\"[5]   \"Storm Alfred,\"[6] and \"Oktoberblast,\" was a large low pressure area that produced unusually early snowfall across the northeastern United States and the Canadian Maritimes. It formed early on October\u00a029 along a cold front to the southeast of the Carolinas. As it moved up the East Coast, its associated snowfall broke records in at least 20\u00a0cities for total accumulations, resulting in a rare \"white Halloween\" two days later. The storm arrived just two months after Hurricane Irene caused extensive power outages and property damage in the Northeast; with the 2011 New England tornado outbreak also causing damage in Western Massachusetts. It dumped snow on trees that were often still in leaf, adding extra weight, with the ground in some areas still soft from a preceding warm, rainy period that increased the possibility trees could be uprooted. Trees and branches that collapsed caused considerable damage, particularly to power lines, with estimates of storm costs ranging between $1 billion and $3 billion. In all, 3.2 million U.S. residences and businesses[7] in 12 states experienced power outages, with the storm also impacting three Canadian provinces. Some customers in Connecticut did not get power back until early November;[8] many outages lasted 11 days.[9] Many communities chose to postpone celebrations of Halloween from two days to a week later as a result, or cancel them entirely. Delays in restoring power led to the resignation of the chief operating officer of Connecticut Light & Power amid widespread criticism of the company's mishandling of both the nor'easter and Irene.[10]"

At the same time, an area of precipitation extended from South Carolina through Pennsylvania, mostly falling as rain with some snow observed at higher elevations.[13] By late that morning, the system was producing precipitation over much of the Mid-Atlantic and New England.[14] As the system moved to the northeast through the day, it produced widespread snow and winds near hurricane-strength north of the cyclone's warm front over the open waters of the Atlantic Ocean.[15] Winds as high as 69\u00a0mph (111\u00a0km/h) were observed in Massachusetts,[16] and the National Weather Service, issued a Hurricane Force Wind Warning for the Gulf of Maine and other high seas off New England.[17] Overnight into October 30, the storm passed south of Nantucket, and it moved over Nova Scotia later that day with a barometric pressure of 975\u00a0mb (28.8\u00a0inHg). As it did so, the associated precipitation diminished over New England and moved into Atlantic Canada.[1] As the system moved out into the Atlantic Ocean, it reached a minimum barometric pressure of 971\u00a0mb (28.7\u00a0inHg) as it passed to the east of the island of Newfoundland late on October 31.[18] By the early morning of November 1, the system had fully moved out to sea.[19] The storm then hit the UK as Cyclone Quinn."

The deepest snowfall reported was  32.0\u00a0in (81\u00a0cm), at Peru, Massachusetts.[1] At least 20\u00a0cities reported record-breaking totals,[25] and the peak of 19\u00a0in (48\u00a0cm) in West Milford, New Jersey broke that state's record for highest snowfall in October. Newark, New Jersey's largest city, also broke its all-time October snowfall record with 5.2\u00a0in (13\u00a0cm).[27] Central Park in Manhattan observed 2.9\u00a0in (7.4\u00a0cm),[1] also a record.[28] In fact, this was New York City's 3rd October snowfall on record.[29]Hartford, Connecticut's state capital, observed a record 12.3\u00a0in (31\u00a0cm),[25] and the highest total in the state was 24.0\u00a0in (61\u00a0cm) in Farmington southwest of Hartford; this, too, broke the state record for an October snowfall.[30] In Massachusetts, the nor'easter brought wind gusts peaking at 69\u00a0mph (111\u00a0km/h) in Barnstable and, unofficially, 76\u00a0mph (122\u00a0km/h) in Provincetown.[31]\nAn automated marine weather station at Mount Desert Rock off the coast of Maine recorded a top gust of 77.2\u00a0mph (124.2\u00a0km/h).[32] In Concord, New Hampshire this became the largest 24 hour snowstorm on record.[33]"

Several JetBlue flights departing from Bradley International Airport there were stranded on the tarmac for up to seven hours due to the hazardous conditions.[49][50] Teterboro Airport was closed due to the snow and ice.[51] Some roads were also affected. Along the Jersey Shore, the nor'easter produced coastal flooding that left Ventnor Heights isolated. Officials closed a portion of the Black Horse Pike in West Atlantic City due to flooding.[52] Further north, the flooding closed five New Jersey state highways in Monmouth and Ocean counties.[53] In New York, motorists were stranded for up to 12 hours on the Taconic State Parkway due to the snowfall.[54]"

        "content": "Many traditional Halloween activities were affected by the storm. In communities without electricity, where tree limbs and wires were down, trick-or-treating was delayed until days when it was expected to be back and repairs had made the streets safer. This also occurred in communities where electricity was still fully or partially on but the streets still may have been unsafe. In Sleepy Hollow, New York, a popular destination for the holiday since Washington Irving's classic short story, \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" is set there, Halloween events were canceled due to the storm and its aftermath. On the other hand, another popular Halloween destination, Salem, Massachusetts, location of the 1692 witch trials, was unaffected due to its minimal snowfall.[57] Some families were able to compensate for the lost Halloween. They took their children to trick-or-treat in other communities that still had electricity. Residents of Glen Rock, New Jersey, organized a \"trunk-or-treat\" party at the local high school's football field, where children went around to parked sport-utility vehicles.[57] Since many schools had snow days, and there was little to distract children without electricity, many parents insisted on going ahead with the holiday. \"You can't cancel Halloween,\" said a woman in Fairfield, New Jersey. \"The kids are all hyped up. They had no school because there's no electricity and this and that.\" A boy in Lexington, Massachusetts said he now planned to \"buy some candy and eat it myself.\"[41] At UMass Amherst, the storm caused a power outage over a traditional party weekend at the college that lasted throughout most of the night on Saturday, October 29. While power was largely restored by Sunday, October 30, the campus canceled classes on October 31, and the UMass Campus Center served as a rest location for students and area residents who were still without power.[58] Amherst College saw similar conditions, with the university newspaper reporting that students were taking refuge from power outages in Valentine Dining Hall, with one student describing the response as similar to hurricanes in her home state of Florida.[59] Proposals in some communities to hold Halloween the following weekend, or whenever conditions returned to normal, met with protest from some parents. Some considered the October 31 date to be immutable and non-negotiable, so children would have to wait for 2012. \"I don't have control over the calendar, so Halloween is on Halloween, which is the 31st\", said Pat Murphy, mayor of New Milford, Connecticut. She noted the town had managed to celebrate the holiday that day on its village green despite considerable storm damage and continued power outages. Others had already allowed their children some trick-or-treating, and did not want them to indulge in candy a second time within the week.[60] Many school districts were forced by the storm to use up their remaining allotted snow days for the school year, after Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee had required some be used near the beginning of the year. The Weston, Connecticut, public schools had already used nine snow days as of November 2, five more than its schedule allowed. Since more snow days would inevitably be used during the upcoming winter, they predicted that  vacation periods planned for later in the year would have to be shortened or canceled, or the school year would have to be extended.[61] The storm came at a critical time for high school seniors preparing college applications for early decision, and 76 colleges and universities moved those deadlines back to compensate. In Connecticut, Weston High School, which had power, opened its library for students wishing to study or work on their applications; movies were shown in the auditorium.[61]"

        "content": "Approximately 1.7 million customers in the Northeast were still without electricity three days after the storm. Temperatures in the region warmed up to above 50\u00a0\u00b0F (10\u00a0\u00b0C) during the day, but went down to near freezing at night. As powerless houses grew cold, residents bundled up and kept under blankets, went to stay or visit with others who had electricity, or used their car heaters to temporarily warm-up.[62] Some, frustrated by long blackouts after other recent storms, considered leaving the region or moving to cities where power lines were underground.[63]\nAbout half a million households in New Jersey lost electricity, prompting a state of emergency declaration from governor Chris Christie.[39] He had himself suffered outages both at his personal residence in Mendham and the governor's mansion, Drumthwacket, in Princeton.[64] In Connecticut, Governor Dannel Malloy declared a state of emergency late on October\u00a029,[48] after 830,000\u00a0people lost power, breaking the record set after Hurricane Irene.[50] In the Danbury area, outages were so prolonged that seven school districts had to cancel classes for the following week.[65] A state of emergency was also declared in Massachusetts, which allowed for the activation of the state's National Guard as well as other emergency measures.[42] Due to the power outages and downed trees shortly before Halloween, at least three towns in the state advised delaying trick-or-treating.[42] In New Hampshire, officials opened seven shelters for people who lost heating during the storm.[50] The early snowfall allowed for the opening of ski resorts in Vermont and Maine.[42] At a November 1 press conference, Governor Malloy estimated that damages in Connecticut would exceed $3 billion. Two days later, close to 700,000 homes and businesses remained without power.[2] A week after the storm, almost 150,000 customers of the state's two utilities had not yet had power restored. Customers still suffering outages continued to cope as best they could, by sleeping at the homes of friends who had already had their electricity restored, taking showers at work and storing perishable foods outside.[66] Power was not restored to all the customers who had lost it in the storm until November 9.[8] Many Connecticut residents were angry with the state's electric utilities, particularly Connecticut Light & Power (CL&P), which serves most of the state, for the long delays in restoring service. By the weekend after the storm, in comparison, most customers in other affected states had already gotten their electricity back. Malloy said they had \"missed their own target\" and ordered an investigation into their preparation and restoration efforts to be led by James Lee Witt, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency during the Clinton Administration. An Avon man complained he had not seen any crews in his area since the storm.[67] Some commentators felt Malloy was being too lenient with CL&P, noting that the company had cut its maintenance budget in the preceding year and that smaller public utilities, such as that serving the city of Norwich, had experienced far less power loss and for far less time despite CL&P's customers paying the highest rates in the contiguous United States.[68] Similar complaints had been made after the company had taken a long time to restore service after Hurricane Irene, and three weeks after the nor'easter, Jeff Butler, the company's CEO, resigned.[69] A month after the storm, Malloy released Witt's report, which concluded that \"CL&P was not prepared for an event of this size\". The utility had planned for a worst-case scenario in which 100,000 customers lost power, only one-eighth of those actually affected by the nor'easter. While the report noted that such a storm had not hit in 25 years when the company's emergency plan was drawn up in June, it nevertheless faulted CL&P for merely telling its emergency crews to be on call that weekend, instead of having them wait at predetermined locations. As a result, it was harder to mobilize them when the effects turned out to be far worse than they anticipated despite warnings from the NWS using terms such as \"historic\" and \"catastrophic\" prior to the storm.[70][71] The report also said that CL&P did not ask for crews from neighboring states until after the storm, at which point other New England utilities were also seeking help from them. \"Because of that poor preparation, it's not surprising that they didn't, or that they couldn't, respond with enough boots on the ground when the worst-case scenario was compounded by a factor of eight\", said Malloy. The report did praise some aspects of CL&P's response, such as its short call wait times, speedy repairs by crews once they reached their job sites and the absence of death or serious injury among responding utility crews.[70]"

        "content": " The 25\u201326 January 1938 geomagnetic storm (also titled the F\u00e1tima Storm) was a massive solar storm which occurred 16\u201326 January with peak activity on 22, 25, and 26 January and was part of the 17th solar cycle. As the electrification of Europe and North America was still in its infancy, the light storm could be seen brilliantly. The intensely bright arches of crimson light with shifting spectrum of green, blue-white, and red radiated from a brilliant auroral crown near the zenith instead of appearing as usual in parallel lines. This aurora is believed by many people, especially those of the Catholic faith, to be related to the F\u00e1tima Prophecies (explained below). On January 25\u201326, 1938, the sky was lit up with an aurora borealis light storm, seen all across the world. The storm was identical to other storm-induced, low-latitude aurora borealis. The great aurora that was witnessed across Europe, the Americas, and Oceania had not been seen/documented in Europe since 1709, and in the Americas since 1888. The storm was remarkable primarily because of how far and wide it was observed, and for the brightness of its green strip lights and red glow, which led many to believe the cause was a fire. Reports collected at the time show that the aurora was witnessed in the far north of Canada, and spread as far south as Southern California and on Bermuda in the North Atlantic off of the Carolinas. In Europe, the aurora was seen in Northern Scotland, East Austria, in southern Sicily, Gibraltar, and Portugal. This magnificent display of lights was experienced across the world, as reported in different news archives. The lights sent some into panic, as many were awestruck, astonished by the rarity of the experience. Canada experienced the most vivid auroral displays on the nights of January 24\u201326. In the Netherlands people were awaiting the imminent birth of Princess Juliana's baby Princess Beatrix who was eventually born on 31 January 1938: the Dutch considered the aurora as a lucky omen. In Salzburg, Austria, some residents called on the fire department as they believed something was on fire. Alarm bells were rung into a frenzy that night and the fire departments were constantly sounding new alarms trying to calm the citizens. The loud multitude of ringing further caused panic, causing some residents to flee to more rural areas. The same fright was seen in London where many also believed whole streets were on fire, even the guards of Windsor Castle summoned the fire brigade to put out the said \"fire\". In Switzerland, the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss Alps were glowing bright and reflecting some of the auroral rays causing a reflective disco effect.\nIn Descanso, San Diego, the National Forest Service was alerted on the night of January 22 to respond to a \"great fire in the backcountry\"; after they checked out the back roads they discovered it was the crimson aurora borealis in the northern sky, which had not been seen in that region since February 1888. In Bermuda, many people believed that a massive freight ship was on fire at sea. Steamship captains were calling the wireless stations to learn if there were any S.O.S calls and if they could help. In Scotland, religious individuals living in the lowlands believed the aurora to be an ill omen for Scotland. The electrical side effects of the light storm were limited because, at that time, electricity had not been advanced to our modern technological standards. Short-wave radio transmissions were shut down for almost 12 hours in Canada. In England, the signaling equipment line on the Manchester-Sheffield express trains was inoperable due to electrical disturbances. These coal trains were halted in their movement and waited at these junctions for safety reasons. Teletype systems at the New York Western Union offices began to spew out garbage data, suffering electrical shortages.[1]"

        "content": "London experienced a thick cloud cover at the beginning of January. The London-based Royal Observatory Greenwich was able to observe a large sunspot on January 15 due to a short break in the cloud cover. The latitude of the sunspot was on the +19\u00b0 N declination on the sun's hemisphere, and the sunspot at its maximum size covered an area of roughly 3,000 Millionths of the Solar Hemisphere, or 3,000(MSH). The spot resembled a different spot that was observed in October 1937. Back then, this sunspot became the biggest sunspot observed since records began and trumped the sunspot of the May 1921 geomagnetic storm (which was previously known as the largest sunspot). The magnetic solar storm was detected on 16 January at around 22:30 GMT by the now-defunct Abinger Magnetic Observatory in Surrey, England.[2] A rapid succession of solar flares which created much larger geomagnetic disturbance quickly released towards Earth on January 22 between the hours of 05:00, 09:00 and 10:00. With high frequency, on January 25, a day after the massive sunspot had disappeared from the direct line of sight over the western side of the Sun, a sudden and rapid barrage of high-frequency waves began at around midday and developed to a new record-breaking high in the evening. A large movement of the recording magnets at Abinger began at around 17:00 and was extremely noteworthy at 20:00 and 21:30, the geomagnetic disturbance only started calming down at around 03:00 in the morning of January 26.[3] A witness account by Dr. B. A. Keen, former president of the Royal Meteorological Society had written the following during and after seeing the spectacle: \"At Harpenden, the display was seen from 18:45 until well after midnight. The early stages appeared as a red glow in the northwest and later in the northeast, with a low broad green arc in between. The area of the luminous sky increased, and by 20:30 the green color with areas of red extended well south of Orion. Up to 23:00, there seemed to be three periods of brilliant display: the first, and perhaps the best, at 19:45 when a bright red glow in the north-north-east was traversed by many sharply defined green and white shafts, at 20:30 especially in the east; and again at 21:45, when diffuse and rapidly fluctuating green streamers appeared between north-east and north-west, directed towards the Zenith. Thereafter, the luminosity decreased, but as late as 23:00 a broad green arc stretching from northwest to northeast was still clearly visible. About midnight, a fourth display began with red streamers in the northwest, which extended until a broad red band was formed passing through the zenith to the northeast. At 01:00, faint red and green glow was still visible.\"[4]"

        "content": "The January 25\u201326 geomagnetic storm of 1938 is alleged by some Roman Catholics to have fulfilled a prophecy by the Carmelite nun, Sister L\u00facia Santos. Twenty-one years before, L\u00facia and her two cousins allegedly experienced apparitions of a figure now known as Our Lady of F\u00e1tima. The children claimed that the apparition told them three secrets, to be revealed later. The second secret allegedly had to do with the beginning of World War II: \"When you see a night illumined by an unknown light, know that this is the great sign given you by God that he is about to punish the world for its crimes...\" Lucia wrote that the aurora borealis that took place on this night fulfilled the prophecy, insisting that it was not a natural phenomenon. Some Catholic organizations such as the Blue Army of Our Lady of F\u00e1tima take the position that the storm was of supernatural origin,[5] though it is important to note that January 1938 was only eight months after the last solar maximum in April 1937, and it takes six years for solar activity to go from maximum back to minimum. Some Catholics have also asserted that the aurora borealis was indeed a natural phenomenon, and that the prophecy of the \"unknown light\" is still to come.[6]"

        "content": " Hurricane Edna was a deadly and destructive major hurricane that impacted the United States East Coast in September of the 1954 Atlantic hurricane season. It was one of two hurricanes to strike Massachusetts in that year, the other being Hurricane Carol. The fifth tropical cyclone and storm of the season, as well as the fourth hurricane and second major hurricane, Edna developed from a tropical wave on September 2. Moving towards the north-northwest, Edna skirted the northern Leeward Islands as a tropical depression before turning more towards the west. The depression attained tropical storm status to the east of Puerto Rico and strengthened further to reach hurricane status by September 7. The storm rapidly intensified and reached its peak intensity of 125\u00a0mph (205\u00a0km/h) north of the Bahamas before weakening to Category 2 status near landfall in Massachusetts on September 11. Edna transitioned into an extratropical cyclone in Atlantic Canada before its remnants dissipated in the northern Atlantic. Edna caused 29 fatalities throughout its lifetime as a tropical cyclone, as well as a moderate amount of damage. It first caused rainfall-induced flooding in Puerto Rico, and it later brushed the Bahamas. High waves affected the coastline of North Carolina. Edna resulted in the heaviest day of rainfall in New York City in 45\u00a0years, while strong waves cut off Montauk from the remainder of Long Island. There were six highway deaths in the state, and $1.5\u00a0million in crop damage. There were widespread evacuations in southern New England, after Hurricane Carol struck the same area only 11\u00a0days prior. Strong winds caused extensive power outages for 260,000\u00a0people, including nearly all of Cape Cod. Edna became the costliest hurricane in the history of Maine, where the hurricane caused flooding that washed out roads and rail lines. There were 21\u00a0deaths in New England, eight of whom in Maine due to drownings. Later, high winds severely damaged crops in Atlantic Canada."

        "content": "Hurricane Edna originated in an easterly tropical wave which modern research has estimated to have spawned a tropical depression east of the Caribbean Sea on September 2, 1954.[1] The low pressure area was not observed in real time until several days later, on September 5, while situated between Puerto Rico and The Bahamas. Near the disturbance, a ship reported heavy squalls and wind gusts to 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h). Additionally, the island of Puerto Rico experienced torrential rainfall in association with the storm.[2] Operationally, the system was not recognized to have organized into a tropical cyclone until September 6;[3] it is listed in the Atlantic hurricane database as achieving tropical storm intensity early on September 4. Edna proceeded west-northwestward, bypassing Hispaniola to the north, and by September 7 it had strengthened into a minimal hurricane on the present-day Saffir\u2013Simpson Hurricane Scale.[1] Initially a rather small storm in terms of physical size, the hurricane steadily intensified throughout the day. Reconnaissance aircraft flew into the storm frequently to take observations on the cyclone's structure.[2][1] The center of circulation passed near San Salvador Island,[3] and on September 8, Edna further strengthened into a Category 3 major hurricane while broadly curving northward.[2][1] Reconnaissance flights indicated a maturing and evolving eye, approximately 20\u00a0mi (32\u00a0km) in diameter. The overall circulation increased in size as banding features became more well-defined.[2] The storm reached its peak winds of 120\u00a0mph (190\u00a0km/h) and maintained them for over two days.[1] However, reconnaissance data was at times inconsistent and inaccurate, leading to suspicious and unlikely jogs in the storm's track. The cause of these errors is attributed to misinterpretation of radar information.[2] Midday on September 9, while tracking nearly due north, Edna's minimum central barometric pressure fell to 968\u00a0mbar (28.6\u00a0inHg), but is believed to have leveled off shortly thereafter. The radius of hurricane-force winds increased, and the storm may have become asymmetrical, with convection concentrated to the right of the center, although this was not confirmed due to a lack of data. An approaching weak frontal boundary spread overcast conditions over the Eastern Seaboard north of North Carolina.[2] By September 10, Edna was located just south of Cape Hatteras, passing east of the Outer Banks early the next day.[1] As the hurricane accelerated to the northeast, it began to deteriorate and weaken.[1] Closely following the recent track of Hurricane Carol,[3] Edna approached New England, but diverged from Carol's track upon skirting the eastern coast instead of moving inland.[1] Weather reporting stations in the Mid-Atlantic States reported rapid clearing as the storm gained latitude, while heavy rain and gusty winds enveloped New England.[2] On September 11, Edna passed directly over Cape Cod after weakening to Category 2 status, although surface weather analysis depicted a central pressure of 950\u00a0mbar (28\u00a0inHg). It subsequently tracked just east of Eastport, Maine.[1] The storm continued northeastward into Atlantic Canada and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, although the exact time of this transition is unknown. The storm's extratropical remnants reemerged into the northern Atlantic after crossing eastern Canada and were last noted on September\u00a015.[2][3]"

Along the coast of North Carolina and the Virginia Capes, where gale-force winds and high tides were expected, residents were advised to take precautions. In New York City, it was to be considered \"a miracle\" if Edna did not strike the area directly, and the storm was predicted to be one of the most severe hurricanes in the history of the New York Weather Bureau.[5] In the 24\u00a0hours before the storm struck, New York Telephone received 361,392\u00a0calls, which was the third highest volume the company ever recorded.[6] In the Montauk area, 500 residents evacuated their homes by early September 11, while all businesses closed in Westerly, Rhode Island.[7] Businesses in Providence, which was flooded during Hurricane Carol, prepared sandbags to mitigate flooding.[8] Most beach homes had closed for the summer season, and hundreds of people who lived along the southern New England coast evacuated.[8] Other threatened areas were evacuated, including Milford, Connecticut, where 3,000 families left their homes. Sirens alerted other residents to remain indoors and drivers to stay off the highways. Along the coast of Connecticut, bus and train service was halted.[9] A state of emergency was declared in New London, and mail service was canceled in some areas.[10] On September 10, the Navy ordered the evacuation of hundreds of warships and aircraft.[11] Coast Guard planes evacuated from Rhode Island and Massachusetts. About 40\u00a0Red Cross shelters, which were opened during Hurricane Carol 11\u00a0days prior, were reopened to provide food. Officers at Fort Devens sent 40\u00a0trucks with cots, blankets, and generators to areas expected to be struck by the storm.[8] Advance warning was credited with a lower death toll in Edna than Carol.[12]"

        "content": "Edna's path near North Carolina was about 50\u00a0mi (80\u00a0km) east of Carol.[13] Winds blew at up to 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) along the shore, accompanied by strong surf, although no fatalities or major property damage resulted from the storm.[14] Tides at Norfolk, Virginia were only slightly above normal during the storm's passage to the east, and winds were moderate in strength.[15] Peripheral rainfall in Maryland and Delaware eased drought conditions.[16] In coastal New Jersey, northwesterly winds reached 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h), and Long Branch received around 4\u00a0in (100\u00a0mm) of rainfall. Further north, Long Island also suffered moderate to strong winds, blowing from the north at their peak. A Weather Bureau station in New York City recorded 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h) winds midday on September 11.[17] Rainfall reached 4.98\u00a0in (126\u00a0mm) in the city, becoming the wettest day in 45\u00a0years.[18] The storm cut off Montauk Point on eastern Long Island at its height, prompting the Coast Guard to temporarily relocate 500 families.[19] Rainfall in Suffolk County amounted to 9\u00a0in (230\u00a0mm).[20] Crop damage in New York was estimated at $1.5\u00a0million,[16] and six people died in the city due to highway deaths.[12] When Edna struck New England, it was moving quickly to the northeast at 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h). It struck eastern Massachusetts about 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km) east of where Hurricane Carol struck only a week prior. Hurricane-force winds affected much of the coastline, with peak gusts of 120\u00a0mph (190\u00a0km/h) on Martha's Vineyard offshore Massachusetts, and 110\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h) on Block Island offshore Rhode Island. Along the coast, wind gusts peaked at 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) at Hyannis, Massachusetts. The high winds caused widespread power outages, including for nearly all of Cape Cod. The storm surge reached 6\u00a0ft (1.8\u00a0m) along the Massachusetts coast, causing flooding and heavy boating damage. Further west, there was lesser coastal flooding, although heavy rainfall after previously wet conditions caused urban and stream flooding; rainfall peaked at around 11\u00a0in (280\u00a0mm). Damage in Connecticut and Rhode Island was mainly in areas already affected by Hurricane Carol. Several streets were washed out, and rivers rose above flood stage.[21] Damage was heaviest in Maine, estimated at $25\u00a0million,[16] which made Edna the costliest hurricane in the state's history. Strong wind gusts, reaching 74\u00a0mph (119\u00a0km/h), and heavy rainfall, peaking at 7.49\u00a0in (190\u00a0mm), extended into the state;[22] these were considered the heaviest rains in the state in 58\u00a0years.[18] The Androscoggin and Kennebec rivers both reached above-normal levels, causing flooding and washing out roads.[22] In Augusta, the Kennebec River reached 20.5\u00a0ft (6.2\u00a0m), which was 5\u00a0ft (1.5\u00a0m) above the peak level after the spring snow melt.[23] Flooding entered basements, affected fields, and covered bridges. In West Peru, the floods washed out a bridge that was under construction.[24] In addition, the winds downed trees,[22] which blocked widespread roads and caused power outages in 18% of the state.[12] Washed out roads and rail lines cut off the state from the rest of New England.[18] In Lewiston, a trapped car in 5\u00a0ft (1.5\u00a0m) deep waters required rescue by boat.[25] Another stranded family was rescued after seven hours in Unity, in which one child and a rescuer were killed. There were eight deaths in the state, most of whom related to cars being swept away by floods.[12] There were 21\u00a0deaths in New England,[21] including eight drownings in Maine.[22] Throughout the United States, damage was estimated at $42,815,000. Damage was less from Edna than from Carol, primarily due to its strongest winds not occurring at the time of highest tides, and its track farther to the east.[16] Throughout New England, 260,000\u00a0people lost power, most of whom in Massachusetts.[26]"

        "content": "While rapidly losing characteristics of a tropical cyclone, Edna traversed central New Brunswick. In contrast with the smaller, more compact Hurricane Juan, which struck Atlantic Canada in 2003, Edna was a much larger storm with strong winds extending hundreds of kilometers from the center. The tightest pressure gradient was focused on the east side of the storm, over mainland Nova Scotia. Edna brought down approximately 700 million board feet of timber, and although the amount of trees the storm destroyed was comparable to that of Juan, its effects were more widespread and not as locally severe.[27] Sustained winds reached 160\u00a0km/h (99\u00a0mph) at Yarmouth and 95\u00a0km/h (59\u00a0mph) at Halifax. The intense winds downed power and telephone lines and destroyed many barns; one such structural collapse killed a man, and livestock were lost throughout the region. Other damage to property included several fallen chimneys, a toppled church steeple in Pictou, and roof failures. In Kentville, an apartment building undergoing construction was destroyed. Approximately $3 million CAD in apple crops were decimated, while in Yarmouth, both live lobsters and lobster pots were lost. Debris blocked streets across the province, and at least 800\u00a0m (0.50\u00a0mi) of road was washed out. Damage in Nova Scotia totaled $6 million CAD: in the aftermath, Yarmouth and Kentville declared states of emergency.[28] In New Brunswick, the storm dropped 130\u00a0mm (5.1\u00a0in) of rain and produced winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph). Wind damage was less significant than in Nova Scotia, although still evident in structures and utility lines. A theatre in McAdam was destroyed, and several people were injured across the area. The storm flooded streets in St. Stephen. About 400 salmon, valued at $10,000 CAD, were lost in Dalhousie. Total damage in the province is estimated at $1.78 million CAD. Elsewhere, power outages were reported in Montreal.[28]"

Cross and Democratic Edmund Muskie. Before the election, politicians commented how a suppressed turnout as a result of the storm would benefit Muskie, in a state where no Democrat had won governorship since 1934.[32] Muskie ultimately won the election in a close race, which saw a lower turnout than 1950, due in part to Edna suppressing the rural, Republican turnout.[33] After a survey from the Federal Civil Defense Administration described damage as \"tremendous\", President Dwight Eisenhower declared portions of Maine as a disaster area, which allocated federal funding for relief. The president also authorized additional aid to Rhode Island and Massachusetts due to additional damage there from Edna.[31] Due to the severity of the hurricane, the name Edna was removed from the tropical storm naming list for 10\u00a0years.[34] The name was reused in the 1968 season, but was permanently retired in the spring of 1969, as the 1954 hurricane was still an active subject of research.[35] None the less, Edna appeared once again on the 1972 naming list,[36] but ultimately went unused. The name will never be used again for another Atlantic hurricane.[34]"

        "content": " Hurricane Leslie was an Atlantic tropical cyclone that caused minor damage in Bermuda and Atlantic Canada in September\u00a02012. The twelfth tropical cyclone of the annual hurricane season, Leslie developed from a tropical wave located nearly 1,500 miles (2,400\u00a0km) east of the Leeward Islands on August\u00a030. About twelve hours later, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Leslie. Tracking steadily west-northwestward, it slowly intensified due to only marginally favorable conditions. By September\u00a02, the storm curved north-northwestward while located north of the Leeward Islands. Thereafter, a blocking pattern over Atlantic Canada caused Leslie to drift for four days. Late on September\u00a05, Leslie was upgraded to a Category\u00a01 hurricane. However, due to its slow movement, the storm causing upwelling, which decreased sea surface temperatures (SST's), weakening Leslie back to a tropical storm on September\u00a07. The storm drifted until September\u00a09, when it accelerated while passing east of Bermuda. Relatively strong winds on the island caused hundreds of power outages and knocked down tree branches, electrical poles, and other debris. Slight re-intensification took place, with Leslie becoming a hurricane again, before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone near Newfoundland on September\u00a011. In Atlantic Canada, the storm brought heavy rainfall to both Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. In the latter, localized flooding occurred, especially in the western portions of the province. Also in Newfoundland, strong winds from Leslie ripped off roofs, destroyed trees, and left 45,000\u00a0homes without power. Additionally, a partially built house was destroyed and several incomplete homes were damaged in Pouch Cove. Overall, Hurricane Leslie caused $10.1\u00a0million (2012\u00a0USD) in damage and no fatalities.[1]"

        "content": "A tropical wave, which was accompanied by a broad surface low pressure area, emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa late on August\u00a026.[2] Tracking generally westward, the system remained disorganized for the next several days.[3] By August\u00a029, the system became increasingly organized as showers and thunderstorms concentrated toward the center.[2][4] Based on Dvorak satellite classifications and scatterometer surface wind data, it is estimated that Tropical Depression Twelve developed at 0000\u00a0UTC on August\u00a030, while located about 1,495 miles (2,406\u00a0km) east-southeast of the northern Leeward Islands.[2] Situated to the south of a subtropical ridge, the system tracked west-northwestward over warm sea surface temperatures.[5] As a result, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Leslie by 1200\u00a0UTC on August\u00a030.[2] After becoming a tropical storm on August\u00a030, the subtropical ridge caused Leslie to turn west-northwestward.[2] By the early on August\u00a031, the storm featured well-define outflow in all directions and the center of circulation was close to the main area of convection.[6] Intensity estimates around that time indicated sustained wind speeds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h).[2] However, intensification halted later on August\u00a031 as wind shear increased over the storm, causing convection to become displaced from the center.[7] Early on September\u00a01, an eye-like feature appeared on satellite imagery; however, there was uncertainty as to whether or not the feature was displaced from the low-level center.[8] The storm became increasingly disorganized, with the circulation displaced from the main convective area several hours later.[9] Relentless wind shear caused Leslie to weaken to slightly to a 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h) tropical storm, despite sea surface temperatures (SSTs) exceeding 84\u00a0\u00b0F (29\u00a0\u00b0C). Early on September\u00a03, the storm decelerated and curved northwestward, while approaching a weakness in Bermuda high pressure ridge. Eventually, Leslie turned to a more northerly motion. A blocking pattern over Atlantic Canada caused the storm to drift at forward speeds under 5\u00a0mph (8.0\u00a0km/h) for four days. Wind shear also decreased, allowing Leslie to re-organize and strengthen into a hurricane at 1200\u00a0UTC on September\u00a05.[2][10] Six hours later, Leslie attained its maximum sustained wind speed of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h). However, the slow movement of the storm caused upwelling \u2013 a process by which warm SSTs are replaced with colder waters. As a result, Leslie slowly began to weaken and fell to tropical storm intensity by early on September\u00a08. Despite weakening, the storm's circulation expanded to a radius of more than 1,150 miles (1,850\u00a0km); the wind field also expanded, with tropical storm force winds reaching about 175 miles (282\u00a0km) in diameter from the center.[2] By early on September\u00a09, the blocking pattern diminished as a broad mid- to upper-level trough and associated cold front moved off the East Coast of the United States. As a result, Leslie accelerated north-northeastward. Later that day, the storm passed about 130 miles (210\u00a0km) east of Bermuda. After leaving the region of upwelled waters, Leslie began to re-strengthen and became a hurricane again at 1200\u00a0UTC on September\u00a010. Early on the following day, the storm reached its minimum barometric pressure of 968\u00a0mbar (28.6\u00a0inHg). However, a combination of cold SSTs, strong wind shear, and merging with a cold front caused the storm to become an extratropical cyclone at 0900\u00a0UTC on September\u00a011, while located about 85 miles (137\u00a0km) south of St. Lawrence, Newfoundland.[2] Leslie was operationally considered a tropical cyclone when it made landfall on the Burin Peninsula of Newfoundland.[11] The remnants of Leslie moved rapidly across Newfoundland and re-emerged into the Atlantic later on September\u00a011. At 0600\u00a0UTC on the following day, the remnants of Leslie were absorbed into another larger extratropical storm over the Labrador Sea.[2]"

The watch was upgraded to a tropical storm warning at 0900\u00a0UTC on September\u00a08. By early on September\u00a010, the warning was discontinued.[2] On September\u00a06, officials in Bermuda urged residents to \"prepare for the worst\". Schools prepared to close Friday as residents got ready for the approaching storm. \"Leslie could be a historic storm for Bermuda as it is very large and forecast to intensify rapidly as it approaches,\" the Bermuda Emergency Measures Organization said. \"The island could experience hurricane force winds for a sustained period of time, possibly up to two days.\"[12] However, the storm passed further east of Bermuda than initially predicted, causing only minor impact. Nonetheless, sustained winds of 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h) and a gust up to 54\u00a0mph (87\u00a0km/h) was reported in St. David's Island. At the same location, 3.15 inches (80\u00a0mm) of precipitation was recorded.[13] Throughout Bermuda, scattered power outages affected hundreds of residents and tree branches and other debris fell on roads; at least one street pole was toppled in Hamilton.[14]"

Simultaneously, a hurricane watch was put into effect from Stones Cove to Charlottetown. By 1500\u00a0UTC on September\u00a010, the tropical storm watches were discontinued. Around that time, a tropical storm warning was implemented from Indian Harbour to Triton. By late on September\u00a011, all watches and warnings were discontinued.[2] As a precaution, the town of Badger declared a state of emergency.[15] While still a tropical cyclone, Leslie produced 2 to 4 inches (51 to 102\u00a0mm) of rain across much of Nova Scotia, peaking at 6.5 inches (170\u00a0mm) in Shubenacadie.[2] The rainfall likely contributed to the ongoing flooding in some areas of Nova Scotia.[16] Similarly, 2 to 4 inches (51 to 102\u00a0mm) of precipitation was reported throughout much of Newfoundland, with a peak total of 4.25 inches (108\u00a0mm) in Cow Head. Localized flooding left some roads and bridges impassable and briefly isolated the Port au Port Peninsula from the mainland of Newfoundland.[2] Due to winds up to 85\u00a0mph (137\u00a0km/h), Leslie ripped off roofs, destroyed trees, and left 45,000\u00a0homes without power, particularly on the Avalon Peninsula, in the southeast portion of Newfoundland.\n[15] In Pouch Cove on the Avalon Peninsula, the storm destroyed a partially built house and damaged incomplete homes in the Pleasantville neighborhood of St. John's.[17] Within the latter, several streets were closed, as crews cleaned up scattered debris. A portion of Memorial University of Newfoundland's campus was closed after glass littered a pedestrian walk.[15] Later, the remnants of Leslie brought rainfall to Nunavut, bring 1.4 inches (36\u00a0mm) of precipitation to Iqaluit during a three-day period.[18] Damage in Atlantic Canada reached 10\u00a0million CAD ($10.1\u00a0million USD).[1]"

The cyclone paralleled the coast of Mexico and also gradually decelerated. Despite some wind shear, Eight-E strengthened into a tropical storm on September 2 and was named Elida. On September 3 and 4, Elida came close to the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula at its peak intensity of 994\u00a0mbar (29.4\u00a0inHg) and winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h). The cyclone then drifted into cooler waters, was devoid of deep convection on September 5, and dissipated the next day.[1] The storm was forecast slightly better than the long term averages for the eastern North Pacific.[1] Elida posed enough of a threat to the Baja California Peninsula to require a tropical storm warning for the Baja California Peninsula south of Cabo San L\u00e1zaro on September 3. The warning was lifted on September 5 after the threat ended.[1] Moderate to heavy rains fell in association with the tropical cyclone across southwest Mexico and the Baja California peninsula, with the maxima falling at San Marcos/Compostela in southwest mainland Mexico, which measured 6.60\u00a0in (168\u00a0mm), and a maximum for Baja California of 3.88\u00a0in (99\u00a0mm) at La Poza Honda/Comondu.[1] While passing offshore, the tropical storm killed six people and affected 1,200 others,[2] but the damages were minimal.[3]"

On Saint Croix in the United States Virgin Islands, gusty winds downed trees, which struck power lines, leaving minor electrical outages. Along its path, Harvey dropped heavy rainfall across much of Central America. Strong winds and heavy precipitation were reported in the country of Belize. Heavy rains in Mexico triggered numerous landslides, one of which killed 3\u00a0people. Landslides in damaged 36\u00a0homes and 334\u00a0homes in the states of Chiapas and Veracruz, respectively.

In response, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) noted the potential for the wave to develop into a tropical cyclone.[3] The wave continued westward at 15 to 20\u00a0mph (24 to 32\u00a0km/h)[4] and became less vigorous over the next several days, with no strong convection present on August\u00a013.[5] Sporadic convection redeveloped over the course of the following day.[6] Early the next day, the system was analyzed as an area of low pressure between Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent and an inverted trough extending well to the north.[7] The wave moved westward through the Caribbean Sea and produced areas of heavy showers and thunderstorms, although convection on the northern side of the system was limited, possibly a result of excessive Saharan dust.[8] Mid-level cyclonic turning became more pronounced by early on August 17.[9] Although a closed center of circulation was still lacking, conditions were becoming more favorable for the tropical cyclogenesis.[10] By early on August 18, the NHC issued a \"high chance\" of the wave becoming a tropical cyclone within 48 hours.[11] After a low-level circulation became identifiable, the system was designated as Tropical Depression Eight at 1800\u00a0UTC on August\u00a018,[1] while located about 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km) east-northeast of Cape Gracias a Dios.[12] Steered by a building high pressure area over the Gulf of Mexico, the cyclone remained on its westward course and was expected to move westward throughout its duration.[13] Continuing to deepen, Tropical Depression Eight strengthened into Tropical Storm Harvey at 1200\u00a0UTC on August\u00a019.[1] Harvey continued to strengthen throughout the afternoon, with an improved appearance on visible satellite imagery and good outflow across the northwestern part of the storm.[14] A discussion by the NHC early on August\u00a020 indicated the potential for Harvey to strengthen into a hurricane prior to landfall, but this never materialized.[1] At 0600\u00a0UTC on August\u00a020, the storm attained its minimum barometric pressure of 994\u00a0mbar (29.4\u00a0inHg). Winds increased slightly further, and at 1730\u00a0UTC on August\u00a020, Harvey made landfall near Dangriga, Belize with winds of 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h).[1] While located over northeastern Guatemala early on August\u00a021, the system weakened to a tropical depression. Harvey reached the Bay of Campeche early on August\u00a022, where a convective burst allowed it to briefly re-strengthen into a tropical storm. By 0200\u00a0UTC, Harvey made landfall near Punta Roca Partida, Veracruz with winds of 40\u00a0mph (65\u00a0km/h).

By 10 p.m. the wind had reached force 10 and continued to increase, reaching force 12 by midnight. It continued to blow at force 12 until the afternoon of 26 October. The Royal Charter was driven ashore on the east coast of Anglesey just north of the village of Moelfre in the early hours of the morning of 26 October 1859, eventually being smashed to pieces against the rocks, with the loss of over 450 lives. The public impact of the shipwreck may be judged by the fact that Charles Dickens travelled from London to Anglesey to report on the aftermath as described in The Uncommercial Traveller."

The death toll was estimated at around 800, including some people killed on land by falling rocks and masonry. Twice as many people died in these two days as had been lost at sea around the British Isles in the whole of 1858. There was extensive structural damage to many buildings, with the west coast of Great Britain being most severely affected. The remains of the church of Saint Brynach may still be seen at Cwm-yr-Eglwys in Pembrokeshire. This storm had an effect on the development of the Meteorological Office as Captain Robert FitzRoy, who was in charge of the office at the time, brought in the first gale warning service in 1860 to prevent similar tragedies.[4]"

The season has no official bounds but cyclones tend to form between April and December. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northern Indian Ocean. There are two main seas in the North Indian Ocean\u2014the Bay of Bengal to the east of the Indian subcontinent and the Arabian Sea to the west of India. The official Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre in this basin is the India Meteorological Department (IMD), while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) releases unofficial advisories. An average of five tropical cyclones form in the North Indian Ocean every season with peaks in May and November.[1] Cyclones occurring between the meridians 45\u00b0E and 100\u00b0E are included in the season by the IMD.[2] Prior to 1992, this season had the most tropical storms in North Indian recorded history, with 8 storms forming."

Forming on August\u00a08, 2009 from an area of low pressure, the system gradually intensified into a tropical storm. Tracking in a curved path around the edge of a subtropical ridge, Etau continued to intensify as it neared Japan. By August\u00a010, the cyclone reached its peak intensity as a weak tropical storm with winds of 75\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph 10-minute sustained) and a barometric pressure of 992\u00a0hPa (mbar). Shortly after, Etau began to weaken. Increasing wind shear led to the center becoming devoid of convection and the system eventually weakened to a tropical depression on August\u00a013. The remnants of Etau persisted for nearly three days before dissipating early on August\u00a016. Although Etau did not make landfall, the outer bands of the storm produced torrential rainfall in Japan, peaking at 326.5\u00a0mm (12.85\u00a0in). These rains triggered deadly flooding and mudslides, especially in Hy\u014dgo Prefecture. Twenty-eight people were killed by the storm and \u00a57.1\u00a0billion (US$87.5\u00a0million) in damage occurred throughout the affected region.[1][2] According to the Fire and Disaster Management Agency, a total of 5,602 homes were flooded and 183 were destroyed. Following the storm, 600 Japanese soldiers were deployed from Tokyo to assist in cleanup efforts."

Convective turning began to appear on satellite imagery and a tropical upper tropospheric trough (TUTT) cell to the north provided a northward component to the system's movement.[4] Early on August\u00a07, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the developing system as deep convection consolidated around the low-pressure system.[5] Around 0000\u00a0UTC on August\u00a08, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) designated the system as a tropical depression.[6] Several hours later on August\u00a08, the JTWC also declared the system a tropical depression, classifying it at 10W.[7] Later that day, convection associated with the depression became disorganized, preventing intensification of the system. The depression generally tracked towards the northwest during the day in response a subtropical ridge to the north.[8] By August\u00a09, the center of circulation became more defined as convection wrapped around it.[9] Around 1200\u00a0UTC, the JMA upgraded the depression to a tropical storm and gave it the name Etau.[10] The JTWC, however, did not upgrade the system to a tropical storm for several more hours.[11] On August\u00a010, the JTWC briefly downgraded the storm to a tropical depression.[12] By this time, the system had re-curved to the east around the western periphery of the subtropical ridge. Etau also became slightly disorganized as it began to interact with the baroclinic zone near Japan.[13] Early on August\u00a011, the JMA reported that the storm winds had peaked at 75\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph 10-minute sustained) and a barometric pressure of 992\u00a0hPa (mbar).[14] Later that day, the storm once more became slightly disorganized due to increased wind shear; however, the JTWC reported that the storm intensified based on satellite intensity estimates and weather radar imagery from Japan.[15] Later on August 11, the center of Etau became partially devoid of convection, with only a narrow band of shower and thunderstorm activity persisting to the southeast of the center.[16] Increasing wind shear prevented convection from redeveloping and the storm continued to weaken.[17] Early the following day, the JTWC issued their final advisory on Etau as they reported it had weakened to a tropical depression well to the east of Japan.[18] Roughly 24\u00a0hours later, the JMA also downgraded the system to a tropical depression.[19] The final advisory on Etau was issued by the JMA early on August\u00a014 as it slowly tracked northward.[20]"

Officials also feared that flooding from Tropical Storm Etau would mirror that of Typhoon Morakot in Taiwan where at least 14 were killed in the country's worst flood in 50 years.[21][22] Six flights in the country were canceled after a plane was struck by lightning. Fifteen railway services were also canceled due to heavy rains.[23] According to officials in Japan, nearly 140,000 people were evacuated to shelters in relation to flooding and landslides produced by Etau.[1] As Tropical Storm Etau brushed Japan on August\u00a010, torrential rains fell within its outer bands. In a 24\u2011hour span, a record 326.5\u00a0mm (12.85\u00a0in) of rain fell, triggering extensive flooding and landslides.[24] Initial reports stated that 13 people were killed and 10 others were missing due to the storm.[25] Most of the fatalities took place in Hy\u014dgo Prefecture where hundreds of homes were flooded and numerous others were damaged or destroyed by landslides.[26] In some areas, flood waters reached a depth of 1.5\u00a0m (4.9\u00a0ft).[24] One man drowned after driving his car into a flooded street and being overcome by the water.[27] Another person was killed after her home was destroyed by a landslide in Okayama prefecture.[28] In Tokushima, two people were listed as missing and two others sustained serious injuries.[23] Later news reports stated that up to 18 people were missing following further landslides. The affected region was especially susceptible to landslides due to recent seismic activity, with a magnitude 6.4 earthquake taking place on August\u00a010.[29] By August\u00a011, one of the missing persons was confirmed to have been killed during the storm. About 800 people were placed in public shelters and 53,000 homes were left without running water. By August\u00a012, a total of 18 people were confirmed to have been killed and nine others were still missing.[30] Three bridges in Tokushima were also washed away.[31] Days later, the Japanese Fire and Disaster Management Agency finalized the death toll at 26 with one other missing,[1][2] making Etau the deadliest tropical cyclone to impact Hy\u014dgo Prefecture, Japan since Typhoon Tokage in 2004.[32] Throughout several prefectures, 5,602 homes were flooded and 183 were destroyed. Landslides triggered by the storm damaged another 2,109 structures, most of which were in Okayama and Hy\u014dgo prefectures.[1] Following severe damages, in the town of Sayo it requested assistance from the national government. As a result, more than 200 troops were deployed to the town.[23][24]  A post-disaster office was also set up by the prime minister's office crisis management center.[24] An additional 400 troops were deployed to the city by August\u00a011 to assist in rescue efforts.[31]"

The fourth tropical storm, second hurricane, and first major hurricane of the season, it formed from an area of disturbed weather east of the Leeward Islands on July\u00a013, 1909. Remaining weak for much of its early existence, the system began to intensify after nearing Jamaica. Curving towards the northwest, it reached hurricane strength on July\u00a018 near the western tip of Cuba. Intensification stalled as it moved westwards across the Gulf of Mexico, but resumed as the hurricane approached the Texas coast. The storm intensified to a major hurricane on July\u00a021 and subsequently reached its peak intensity with winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h) prior to making landfall near Velasco, Texas. Once over land, the system began to quickly weaken, and dissipated near the Rio Grande on July\u00a022. The hurricane caused 41\u00a0deaths and $2\u00a0million in damages,[nb 1] all of which were in Texas. Strong waves caused several offshore shipping incidents, and storm surge inundated areas of the Texas coast, though damage in Galveston was mostly mitigated by the Galveston Seawall. In Velasco, only eight buildings remained intact after the hurricane. Strong winds forced train closures and destroyed and downed various infrastructure. Heavy rains further inland peaked at 8.5\u00a0in (220\u00a0mm) in Hallettsville."

Weather reports throughout the Caribbean during this time were sparse and according to Jos\u00e9 Partag\u00e1s, a former meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center, the system still may have not formed a closed circulation. This meant that the low was not classifiable, though the lack of data also meant that there was no evidence to support this claim and the system was kept as a tropical depression in HURDAT, the Atlantic Hurricane Database.[2]  However, once the depression was located south of Jamaica, it began to slowly strengthen and curve more towards the northwest, reaching tropical storm intensity by 0000\u00a0UTC on July\u00a017.[1] At the time, the system was expected to make landfall on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. Ships in the vicinity of the storm reported strong breezes associated with low barometric pressure.[3] Despite predictions, the system curved from its initial west-northwest movement and more towards the northwest, towards the central Gulf of Mexico. The tropical storm continued to intensify, attaining hurricane strength as a Category\u00a01 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson Hurricane Scale at 1800\u00a0UTC on July\u00a018 after skirting past the Guanahacabibes Peninsula.[1] Once in the Gulf of Mexico, intensification substantially lessened as the storm maintained its Category\u00a01 intensity throughout July\u00a019 and July\u00a020.[1] The hurricane curved in the gulf back to a more westerly direction, while moving at about 10\u00a0mph (15\u00a0km/h).[4] A minimum pressure reading of 985 mbar (hPa; 29.09\u00a0inHg) was reported offshore south of Louisiana by the ship S.S. Paraguay at 1800\u00a0UTC on July\u00a020.[4] Strengthening resumed late on July\u00a020th as the hurricane tracked almost parallel to the Louisiana coastline towards Texas. On July\u00a021st, the storm attained its peak intensity as a modern-day Category\u00a03 major hurricane, with sustained winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h) and a barometric pressure of 959 mbar (hPa; 28.32\u00a0inHg).[1] Later the same day, the hurricane made landfall at this intensity almost directly over Velasco, Texas, with maximum wind speeds stretching 22\u00a0mi (35\u00a0km) from the hurricane's center. Over the following 24\u00a0hours, the system rapidly weakened over land and lost tropical characteristics near the Rio Grande during the afternoon of July\u00a022.[2][1]"

        "content": "As the hurricane approached Texas, the Weather Bureau issued hurricane warnings for potentially affected areas beginning on July\u00a018. Ships and ports were also continuously notified on the oncoming storm, which helped to keep offshore shipping accidents to a minimum.[4] Inland, as a precautionary measure, rail operations along the coast were halted for a duration of the storm's passage.[5] At its landfall in Velasco, the hurricane caused a wide swath of damage along the Texas coast and areas further inland. Despite previously issued warnings, rough seas produced by the hurricane still caused several ship accidents. Strong waves forced several ships near Galveston to either become grounded or sunk. The derrick barge Miller and other craft were grounded along Galveston's West Bay.[6] A large dredge was swept into the Galveston Causeway, snapping telegraph cables that ran along the length of the causeway.[7] The Miriam was sunken by a submerged log, while the schooner Ed Gibbs was broken into pieces near La Porte. The steamboat El Siglo (The Century) remained stranded offshore for twelve hours in winds estimated at 90\u00a0mph (145\u00a0km/h).[6] Off of Mobile, Alabama, the high waves prevented ships from entering the Port of Mobile.[8] Closer to the coast, the hurricane produced a storm surge of 10\u00a0ft (3.0\u00a0m) in Galveston and Velasco.[2] However, due to the Galveston Seawall, much of the potential storm surge-related damage in Galveston was mitigated, though the seawall forced spray to rise 60\u00a0ft (18\u00a0m) in the air. Areas outside the seawall on the Galveston beach, including two fishing piers and pavilions were destroyed.[9] On Galveston's Tarpon Pier, ten members of a fishing party perished after the pier collapsed,[10] though six were rescued by the yacht Mayflower.[11] In western areas of Galveston, where there was no seawall, inland areas were inundated under 7\u00a0ft (2.1\u00a0m) of water.[12] However, Galveston's primary streets were submerged to a lesser extent, under 2\u00a0ft (0.61\u00a0m) of water.[13] In Velasco, the tide was reported to have been 3\u00a0ft (0.91\u00a0m) higher than during the 1900 Galveston hurricane,[4] which inundated the city under 4\u00a0ft (1.2\u00a0m) of water.[14] Areas of Sabine Pass were also inundated by the high waves, and the Southern Pacific Railroad was submerged in water.[15] In Velasco, where the hurricane made landfall, only eight buildings remained intact after the storm's passage. Quintana, Columbus, and Columbia were also heavily affected, with all houses experiencing some form of severe damage. In Austin, homes were unroofed, and the storm was considered as the worst hurricane to affect Austin at the time.[6] Heavy rains caused large amounts of driftwood to float down the Colorado River. In Austin, the driftwood struck the newly constructed Congress Avenue Bridge, carrying away 200\u00a0ft (61\u00a0m) of trestle and resulting in $10,000 in damages.[16] Other cities also reported severely damaged homes and businesses. Galveston suffered minor damage, with reports of chimney damage and broken windows.[9] Three sections of the Galveston Causeway were blown down by the strong winds.[17] As a result, tug boats were forced to carry people and cargo to and from Galveston along West Bay.[7] The Western Union Telegraph Company reportedly lost all direct communication with Galveston for a temporary period of time. Other telegraph companies in Dallas and Chicago also lost communications with the city.[17] Property damage in Galveston was estimated at $100,000.[10] Strong winds and gusts from the storm were reported as far inland as Eagle Pass. The winds uprooted trees and extensively damaged various crops, as well as downed power lines.[6] In the Galveston Jetty, Rosenburg, and Brazoria, strong winds blew trains off of their tracks. Train stations and train depots along the coast also experienced considerable damage, with some depots being completely leveled. Maize fields which had been previously burned by wildfires caused by an ongoing drought in Kingsville were swept down, while cotton crops withstood the hurricane well. Oil derricks near Markham were blown down, and water wells were stripped of their machinery.[18] In Alvin, barns and windmills were destroyed. Richmond also reported destroyed barns, as well as downed chimneys. Six prisoners escaped from the city's local jail after windows were blown in.[18] Rice mills were downed in Eagle Pass.[6] Damage was comparatively light in Louisiana. Heavy rains and storm surge inundated marshes, resulting in hundreds of reported cattle drownings. Cotton crops from Grand Chenier, Louisiana to Sabine Pass was destroyed by the rains and wind. Two deaths in Louisiana were reported in Cameron Parish, Louisiana.[19] Further inland, the hurricane produced heavy rainfall in many areas, peaking at 8.5\u00a0in (220\u00a0mm) in Hallettsville, Texas, with rainfall totals of at least 3\u00a0in (76\u00a0mm) common in along the hurricane's track.[20] Boerne, Fredericksbrug, and Columbia all set monthly records for 24\u2011hour rainfall totals on July\u00a021 and 22, with all three cities reporting totals of 5\u00a0in (130\u00a0mm) or greater. While the heavy rains caused damage in areas, it provided beneficial drought relief in other regions.[6]"

        "content": "The 1909 Grand Isle hurricane was a large and deadly Category\u00a03 hurricane that caused severe damage and killed more than 400 people throughout Cuba and the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico. Forming out of a tropical disturbance just south of Hispaniola on September\u00a013, 1909, the initial depression slowly intensified as it moved west-northwest towards Jamaica. Two days later, the system attained tropical storm intensity and turned northwestward towards Cuba. On September\u00a016, it attained the equivalent of a modern-day Category\u00a01 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale and further strengthened to attain winds of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) before making landfall in Pinar del R\u00edo Province, Cuba on September\u00a018. After a briefly weakening over land, the system regained strength over the Gulf of Mexico, with peak winds reaching 120\u00a0mph (195\u00a0km/h) the following day. After only slightly weakening, the hurricane increased in forward motion and made landfall near Grand Isle, Louisiana on September\u00a021. The system quickly lost strength after moving over land, dissipating the following day over Missouri. In the Caribbean, little impact was known to have been caused by the storm outside of Cuba where rough seas killed 29 people. In the United States, the hurricane wrought catastrophic damage across Louisiana and Mississippi. Throughout these states, 371 people are known to have been killed, making it the sixth deadliest hurricane in United States history at the time; however, it has since been surpassed by five other cyclones. Along the Louisiana coastline, a powerful storm surge penetrated 2\u00a0mi (3.2\u00a0km) inland, destroying the homes of 5,000 people. Thousands of other homes throughout the affected region lost their roofs and telegraph communication was crippled. In terms of monetary losses, the storm wrought $11\u00a0million (1909\u00a0USD; $265\u00a0million 2010\u00a0USD) in damage throughout its path."

        "content": "The origins of the Grand Isle hurricane were in a tropical disturbance over the western Atlantic Ocean in early September 1909. Enhanced by a strong area of high pressure over the Azores and British Isles, the system was able to gradually intensify as it neared the Lesser Antilles. On September\u00a010, barometric pressures across several of the islands in the eastern Caribbean fell, indicating that a disturbance was moving through the region.[1] According to the Atlantic hurricane database, maintained by the National Hurricane Center, the system developed into a tropical depression south of Hispaniola in the Caribbean on September\u00a013.[2] However, meteorologist Jos\u00e9 Fern\u00e1ndez Partag\u00e1s stated that there was no evidence of a closed circulation, a key component of tropical cyclones, until September\u00a014.[3] Tracking west-northwestward, the depression brushed the coast of Haiti before attaining tropical storm intensity off the northwestern coast of Jamaica on September\u00a015.[2] After reaching this strength, the storm slowed and gradually took a more northwesterly course, heading towards Pinar del R\u00edo Province in western Cuba. On September\u00a016, the system attained winds of 75\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h), what would now be considered a Category\u00a01 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale. Moving at a slow pace of 4 to 6\u00a0mph (6.4 to 9.7\u00a0km/h), the system gradually intensified. Late on September\u00a018, the center of the storm was estimated to have made landfall in Pinar del R\u00edo Province with winds of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h); an atmospheric pressure of 976 mbar (hPa; 28.82\u00a0inHg) was recorded during its passage.[2] The storm's eye passed over the town of Manta for four hours, between 3:00\u00a0pm and 7:00\u00a0pm on September\u00a017.[4] Slight weakening took place after moving over western Cuba; however, once over the Gulf of Mexico, the storm steadily regained its strength. By September\u00a019, the system re-attained the equivalent intensity of a Category\u00a02 hurricane and the forward motion increased. Early that morning, the storm further intensified to attain its peak winds of 120\u00a0mph (195\u00a0km/h), equivalent to a mid-range Category\u00a03 cyclone.[2] By the afternoon of September\u00a019, reports from the Louisiana and Mississippi coastline indicated that the outer bands of the hurricane were producing scattered rainfall.[1] Early on September\u00a021, it was estimated that the center of the hurricane made landfall near Grand Isle, Louisiana with winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h). A pressure of 952 mbar (hPa; 28.11\u00a0inHg) was recorded around this time, the lowest in relation to the storm.[2] Operational analysis of the storm indicated that it attained the equivalent intensity of a Category\u00a04 hurricane as it made landfall.[5] The storm's lowest pressure was also operationally listed as 931 mbar (hPa; 27.49\u00a0inHg).[6] This pressure was based on operational estimates in relation to the system's storm surge and was not directly measured.[7] However, later research of the storm determined that its winds had not exceeded 120\u00a0mph (195\u00a0km/h).[2] At this time, the hurricane's radius of maximum wind was roughly 32\u00a0mi (51\u00a0km) and the overall size of the storm was estimated to be 374\u00a0mi (602\u00a0km) wide.[8] Once overland, the system quickly weakened, losing hurricane status within 12\u00a0hours and later to a tropical depression over southern Missouri.[2] The remnants of the system were last noted on September\u00a022 as it merged with a trough over the Midwestern United States.[1]"

A maximum of 7.88\u00a0in (200\u00a0mm) of rain fell in a 24\u2011hour span, while the strongest recorded winds reached 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h).[1] Numerous buildings in western Cuba sustained extensive damage and a large portion of the orange crop was lost. Ships were pushed onshore by the hurricane's large swells.[9] Throughout Pinar del R\u00edo Province, damage was estimated at $1\u00a0million (1909\u00a0USD).[1] Amidst rough seas produced by the hurricane, the steamship Nicholas Castina sank off the coast of Cuba, near the Isle of Pines. At least 29 people drowned in the wreck.[10] Of the fatalities, 27 were crew members and two were passengers.[11]"

As the storm passed over western Cuba, warnings were declared for much of the Gulf Coast of Florida and all ships in the Gulf or planning to set sail were advised return and remain at port.[12] Warnings were then issued for the northern Gulf Coast, allowing residents time to evacuate before the storm struck.[1] In the United States, the storm wrought extensive damage along the Gulf Coast. At least 371 people were killed by the storm; however, this is considered a conservative estimate and the true death toll may never be known.[1] Of the known fatalities, 353 took place in Louisiana and 18 in Mississippi.[13][14][15] This makes the 1909 Grand Isle hurricane the eleventh deadliest hurricane on record in the continental United States. However, at the time of its occurrence, it was the sixth deadliest storm in the country.[16] Damage throughout Louisiana and Mississippi was estimated to be at least $10\u00a0million (1909\u00a0USD).[17]"

        "content": "In New Orleans, the storm caused substantial damage, with many homes destroyed and ships wrecked.[17] Communication with the city was completely lost after most of the telegraph wires were downed. Around 3:00\u00a0pm on September\u00a021, advisories from the New Orleans Weather Bureau ceased, leading to concerns over the state of the city. Prior to the communication loss, the Weather Bureau reported that waves along the Mississippi River banks were surpassing 3\u00a0ft (0.91\u00a0m) and water rise in New Orleans itself could reach unprecedented levels. Several lakes overflowed their banks as water from the Mississippi River back-flowed into them, flooding nearby lowlands.[18] The resulting floods, which inundated areas with upwards of 10\u00a0ft (3.0\u00a0m) of water,[3] were similar in scale to the flooding caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, nearly 100 years later. However, due to the lack of residential buildings in the area at the time, the flooding caused far less destruction than that of Katrina.[19] A report falsely claimed that the city's French Quarter was  \"swept away\". A total of 306 coal barges sank off the coast of New Orleans and Lobdell (West Baton Rouge Parish), incurring over $1\u00a0million in losses.[17] Nearly every sugar cane plantation between New Orleans and Baton Rouge sustained damage, resulting in at least $1\u00a0million in losses.[20] Strong winds from the hurricane lifted homes off their foundations and in some cases, the homes were blown away from where they originally stood. Many towns in Louisiana were isolated immediately after the storm as telegraph communication was lost. Along a 25\u00a0mi (40\u00a0km) stretch of coastline near where the storm made landfall,[17] a 15\u00a0ft (4.6\u00a0m) storm surge destroyed the homes of 5,000 people and traveled 2\u00a0mi (3.2\u00a0km) inland.[13] At least 300 of the fatalities took place in southeastern Louisiana, the hardest hit region. Many people who were boating on the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico were caught in the storm's 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) winds and officials presumed that all who were caught in this perished.[17] Near the Texas border, it was estimated that two-thirds of the unharvested rice crop was ruined by the hurricane.[18] In Baton Rouge alone, damage from the hurricane was estimated at $2.9\u00a0million (1909\u00a0USD).[21] Throughout Louisiana, a total of 353 people were killed by the hurricane according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.[13] A maximum of 13.5\u00a0in (340\u00a0mm) of rain fell in the state during the passage of the hurricane.[22]"

Telegraph wires were also downed, cutting communication with the surrounding area.[18] The Biloxi Bay Bridge was swamped by large waves and it was thought that it would be destroyed by the storm at one point. Although the bridge held through the storm, one person died after being washed away while crossing it. Initial estimates stated that damage in Biloxi was between $40,000 and $50,000 (1909\u00a0USD). Along a 4\u00a0mi (6.4\u00a0km) stretch of beach in Mississippi, all of the homes and 300\u00a0ft (91\u00a0m) of the electric car line were destroyed by the hurricane's storm surge.[24] Further north in Jackson, communication in the city was lost and the dome of the newly constructed capital building was destroyed by high winds. Two people were killed in the city after being crushed by falling walls.[15] A maximum of 7.02\u00a0in (178\u00a0mm) of rain fell in Mississippi during the passage of the hurricane.[22] In areas in and around Pensacola, Florida, 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) winds caused some damage.[18] At the local pier, a ship, named Romanoff, toppled over onto a wharf due to large waves produced by the hurricane. Two barges carrying lumber sank near the western beach of Pensacola and several others lost their cargo. Many small ships were destroyed by large swells and according to The New York Times, some of these were \"...swamped and pounded into pieces\".[24] Further inland, the remnants of the hurricane brought light to moderate rainfall to portions of the central United States. A maximum of 3.2\u00a0in (81\u00a0mm) of rain fell in Arkansas; 3.35\u00a0in (85\u00a0mm) in Missouri; 2.54\u00a0in (65\u00a0mm) in Tennessee; and 2.29\u00a0in (58\u00a0mm) in Kentucky.[22] A 25\u00a0mi (40\u00a0km) section of the Louisville and Nashville railroad and an 8\u00a0mi (13\u00a0km) section of the Illinois central railroad were washed out by floods caused by the storm's remnants.[1]"

        "content": "Although the storm killed more than 370 people in the United States, the National Weather Bureau was credited for \"invaluable warnings\" prior to the hurricane's arrival, saving many lives.[1] Following the hurricane's landfall on September\u00a021, rescue and relief efforts began taking place on September\u00a022 near Houma, Louisiana.[21] By September\u00a025, thousands of dollars worth of supplies had been sent to survivors of the storm.[25] However, more than four days after the passage of the storm, many other areas devastated by the hurricane had yet to receive aid from either the government or United States Army. Congressman Robert F. Broussard sent a telegraph to the war department requesting aid; however, he had not received a response by September\u00a027. Initially, news reports focused on the large loss of life from the storm but, once the lack of aid was noticed, their attention shifted to the hundreds of survivors who were left homeless and in dire need of basic necessities.[26] Within days of the storm's passage, there were fears that the storm ruined the cotton crop in southern Louisiana and would cause a spike in prices. However, in a report released on October\u00a04, 1909, it was stated that the losses were much less than previously thought and as a result, there would be no change in the cotton price.[27] According to a report in 2009, the rice and cotton crops sustained 35% and 20% losses respectively in the wake of the hurricane.[13] In 2002, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration added the storm surge from the hurricane to the Global Tsunami Database based on newspaper reports referring to the event as a tidal wave. However, four years later, a more detailed study of possible tsunamis in the past resulted in this event being \"flagged\" as suspect. After further review of the news articles indicating that the wave came after the hurricane, it was determined that there was a misinterpretation of the publishing date since the article was archived by telegraph on September\u00a022, 1909, the day after the hurricane made landfall. In light of this research, the possibility of the wave being a tsunami was denied; however, it remains in the database as a \"debunked\" event.[28]"

Barry was the fourth tropical depression, second named storm and second hurricane of the inactive 1983 Atlantic hurricane season. Developing out of a tropical wave on August\u00a023, Barry quickly strengthened off the coast of Florida, reaching an initial peak intensity with winds of 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h). However, increased wind shear caused the storm to weaken to a tropical depression before making landfall near Melbourne, Florida, the next morning. Traveling almost due west, the storm regenerated and became a hurricane on August\u00a028. The storm made landfall on the northern Mexican coastline later that day at peak intensity. Rapid weakening followed shortly after and the storm dissipated the next day. The storm had only minor effects in the United States but destroyed hundreds of homes and left over 400 homeless in northern Mexico. Despite the damage, there were no reports of fatalities or injuries."

        "content": "The origins of Hurricane Barry can be traced to a tropical wave which moved off the western coast of Africa on August\u00a013, 1983. Strong wind shear in the North Atlantic hurricane basin prevented significant development of the system as it traveled towards the west-northwest. Little convection was associated with the disturbance as a result of the shear. While approaching the Bahamas on August\u00a022, an upper-level trough moved away from the system, which led to a decrease in the wind shear.[1] The disturbance then entered this environment and spawned an area of low pressure which intensified. On August\u00a023, the low had become sufficiently organized to be declared Tropical Depression Four. Later that day, the depression quickly strengthened into a tropical storm and was given the name Barry by the National Hurricane Center (NHC).[2][3] About 12\u00a0hours after becoming a tropical storm, Barry reached its initial peak intensity with winds of 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h).[4] Barry then began a westerly course towards central Florida. However, wind shear began to increase, causing the system to weaken. The NHC downgraded the storm back to a tropical depression on August\u00a025.[2] Barry made landfall near Melbourne, Florida the same morning with winds of 35\u00a0mph (55\u00a0km/h).[4] After crossing Florida, the depression traveled towards the west-southwest due to a strong upper-level flow. On August\u00a027, Barry became sufficiently organized to be reclassified as a tropical storm while located in the central Gulf of Mexico. The re-strengthening was the result of decreased wind shear and more favorable conditions over the Gulf. The storm continued to become better organized as it traveled nearly due west towards Mexico. At 1200\u00a0UTC the next day, Barry was upgraded to a hurricane while located about 75\u00a0mi (120\u00a0km) southeast of Brownsville, Texas. The hurricane continued to intensify until it made landfall about 35\u00a0mi (55\u00a0km) south-southeast of Brownsville[2] at peak intensity with winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h).[4] The storm quickly weakened after landfall and dissipated the next day over northern Mexico.[2]"

The warning was discontinued by late August\u00a028.[5] Over 4,000 people were evacuated from South Padre Island in preparation of Hurricane Barry.[6] Several thousand people were evacuated from beaches in Port Aransas on August\u00a027 as Barry approached. An estimated 700 people took refuge in shelters set up in Brownsville and 800 people fled to schools, which were being used as temporary shelters, in Harlingen.

Only two tropical cyclones during the season existed simultaneously. The hurricane brought heavy rainfall to Jamaica, resulting in eight deaths. This storm also left damage to crops and vessels in portions of the Bahamas and Cuba. Because technologies such as satellite monitoring were not available until the 1960s, historical data on tropical cyclones from this period may not be comprehensive.

        "content": "The spring weather preceding the flooding had been wet in the region, and May 2013 had been one of the three wettest in the last 156 years in Austria, together with the years 1962 and 1965. Austria saw twice as much rainfall as average during the month,[7] resulting in the ground in the region becoming saturated. Soils in Germany were showing record levels of moisture prior to the rains.[8] The already saturated soils led to greater runoff when the rains began. In the last ten days of May a low pressure system named \"Christoffer\" swung up from the Mediterranean across the Black Sea then across Ukraine and Poland to Northern Germany, eventually bringing a very moist, and warm airmass to Central Europe from north-east.[9] Late May saw a blocking high \"Sabine\" located over the Sole sea area to the west of the UK and France. This split the jet stream over Europe which maintained the weather pattern in Central Europe. Spring and summer flooding in Central Europe is commonly associated with the so-called \"Zugstrasse Vb\" track of low pressure areas, which bring low pressure and moist air from the Mediterranean Sea over Central Europe, and have led to severe flooding in the affected region before. Though later analysis found this flooding did not fit into this type.[10] Low pressure areas \"Frederik\" and \"G\u00fcnther\" formed over the northern Adriatic and tracked north towards central Europe. The high pressure \"Sabine\" and low pressure areas brought an airflow from the north across Germany, which brought the water-laden air from the north east. The air mass was pushed to the south west by the northerly flow, where it was lifted as it moved south from the North European Plain over the Thuringian Forest, Ore Mountains, and Bohemian Forest. The air was then lifted along the north side of the Alps in Austria as the air masses were pushed into the Alps by the northerly flow, which led to intense orographic precipitation. Heavy rain was reported in the Austrian states of Vorarlberg and Tyrol and the area of Salzburg, and to the mountains of Upper Austria and Lower Austria and Upper Styria in a short time. On 30 May to 1 June, 150 to 200\u00a0mm of rain (5.9 to 7.9\u00a0in of rain) fell, in places reaching around 250\u00a0mm (9.8\u00a0in), which in just a few days was the equivalent normally seen over two and a half months on average.[11] The rainfall experienced in Austria has an expected return period of between 30 and 70 years. The bulk of the rain fell in only two days in Salzburg, Tyrol, and Vorarlberg, which is thought to have a return period of more than 100 years.[12] Following the intense rain, sporadic showers and rainfall continued to raise the risk of further flooding but no rainfall of the intensity as that seen on 31 May-2 June occurred.[13] Some Flash flooding occurred in the Polish capital Warsaw on 9 June, as a result of thunderstorms.[14] The flood waters were expected to exceed the levels seen during the disastrous \"once in a century\" Central European floods of 2002 in some areas. In Bavaria and eastern Germany water levels significantly exceeded those of 2002 in many places on the Danube and Elbe. In Passau, at the confluence of the rivers Danube, Inn and Ilz, the highest water level since 1501 was recorded. In Dresden, by contrast, the old city center was largely spared, unlike in 2002. Thanks to better flood control, fewer dykes on the upper reaches of the Elbe broke than in 2002, but this meant that the flood wave further downstream was all the higher. In Magdeburg, the floods reached a record level.[4]"

Linking the weather to the concurrent drought conditions in Russia, he said pressure systems stay locked in place, causing a persistent pattern of weather in an area. He also stated that this planetary wave resonance is not a local effect but spread around the whole (northern) hemisphere. When a \u201cresonance\u201d episode occurs, half a dozen peaks and troughs of high or low pressure form around the hemisphere. This explains why some parts of the world become unseasonably hot or cold and others unusually dry or rainy.[15] According to The Inquirer/Agence France-Presse, the resonance hypothesis has been widely discussed among climate scientists, but has met resistance among experts who are wary of associating single extreme-weather events with climate change; the European Environment Agency cautioned that more data were needed to confirm it.[16][failed verification] Climate scientists have estimated that the flooding regime, which has prior inflicted severe flooding once every 50 years, to become more frequent, and cause severe flooding once every 30 years.[17] The cost of flooding in the European continent, which currently causes an estimated 4.9 billion Euros of damage per year, is expected to increase to 23.5 billion Euros per year.[18]"

This made Epsilon the easternmost major hurricane this late in the calendar year, as well as the strongest late-season major hurricane in the northeastern Atlantic, and the fastest recorded case of a tropical cyclone undergoing rapid intensification that far northeast that late in the hurricane season.[2] Afterward, Epsilon began to weaken as the system turned northward, with the storm dropping to Category 1 intensity late that day. Epsilon maintained its intensity as it moved northward, passing to the east of Bermuda. On October 24, Epsilon turned northeastward and gradually accelerated, before weakening into a tropical storm on the next day. On October 26, Epsilon transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, before being absorbed by another larger extratropical storm later that same day. Epsilon brought tropical storm conditions to Bermuda while passing to the east of the island. The storm brought large surf to parts of the Caribbean and the East Coast of the United States. Epsilon's remnants later brought severe weather to the British Isles. The storm's remnants also produced one of the largest October swells on record in Nazar\u00e9, along the Atlantic coast of Portugal.[3] Epsilon caused one death in Florida, when a 27-year-old man drowned in rip currents produced by the hurricane. Overall damage from the storm was minor."

        "content": "Hurricane Epsilon had non-tropical origins, developing from an upper-level trough associated with a weak baroclinic low that emerged off the East Coast of the United States on October 13. As the primary low continued to drift towards the northeast, a trailing cold front behind the low moved eastward into the central Atlantic Ocean over the next few days; the low eventually stalled on October 15 and soon degenerated into a surface trough well east of Bermuda.[4] Around this time, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) first noted the possibility of a broad non-tropical low-pressure system forming within the trough several days later, identifying a chance that the disturbance could gradually organize and undergo tropical cyclogenesis.[5] Upstream synoptic flow began to increase, as an expansive upper-level ridge developed across the northwestern Atlantic, west of the original upper-level trough. This meteorological pattern caused the upper-level trough to be cut off, while bending underneath the ridge. On October 16, convective activity (or thunderstorms) began to increase and become better organized, as the cut-off low interacted with the degrading parent trough.[4][6] With the low-level cyclonic flow strengthening, a non-tropical surface low formed underneath the cut-off upper-level low, at 12:00 UTC that same day.[4] Later that day, satellite wind data depicted a better-defined circulation, while convective activity continued to organize within the upper-level low.[7] Over the next few days, the surface low continued to remain superimposed underneath the upper-level low, as it slowly wandered southward, equatorward of a deep-layer ridge resembling an omega block in the northern Atlantic. Only minimal convection was produced by the surface low, due to dry air associated with upper-level low prohibiting much convective activity. While moving southward, the disturbance encountered warmer sea surface temperatures of around 80\u00a0\u00b0F (27\u00a0\u00b0C), causing convection to flourish and deepen.[4] However, the disturbance's center of circulation remained somewhat elongated.[8] The convective activity began to degrade the dry cyclonic flow of the upper-level low, aiding the tropical transition of the system, as its wind field contracted and upper-level cyclonic flow intensified. At 06:00 UTC on October 19, a large burst of deep convection developed just east of the surface low, causing the center to become more sufficiently organized, prompting the NHC to upgrade the disturbance into Tropical Depression Twenty-Seven. The NHC also noted that the depression appeared more tropical than subtropical, due to its small radius of maximum sustained winds, despite undergoing a similar formation process to that of subtropical cyclones.[4][9] Just six hours later, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm, and was given the name Epsilon.[4] The name Epsilon comes from the Greek Alphabet backup naming lists for the NHC, which was only used for two seasons, the other being the 2005 season.[10] Despite the center of the storm becoming exposed, convective banding over the northern and eastern parts of the system improved. This made the system take on the appearance of having a hybrid-type structure, resembling a subtropical cyclone in appearance. Situated within an area of moderate vertical wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures, further strengthening occurred. Later that same day, a new convective cluster near the center returned Epsilon to a more tropical appearance. However, ASCAT data depicted an asymmetrical wind radius, with gale-force winds extending northward 230 miles (370\u00a0km) from the center.[11][12] Early on October 20, water vapor imagery showed Epsilon interacting with a dissipating cold front to its north and a negatively-titled (oriented northwest to southeast) upper-level trough from the south. Around this time, a dry slot formed within the eastern portion of the storm, weakening convective banding. The cloud pattern of Epsilon began to resemble an occluded extratropical low, with an inner-core tropical feature evident.[13] The system began to move northward and then northwestward, making a loop over the Central Atlantic, due to its smaller circulation interacting with its upper-level cyclonic flow.[4] Later that day, the system began to be affected by southwesterly vertical wind shear, due to the upper-level trough to its southwest, though it retained its hybrid-type structure.[14] However, late that same day, wind shear calmed and dry air was mixed out of the cyclone, allowing the cyclone's structure to improve, with deep convection wrapping tightly around the center, as a small central dense overcast (CDO) became visible on satellite imagery. Even while battling weak-to-moderate deep-layer wind shear and some mid-level dry air, an eye-like feature started to become evident on visible and microwave imagery, giving Epsilon a more tropical structure, compared to its earlier hybrid appearance.[15] Around this time, Epsilon underwent a period of rapid intensification, with sustained winds increasing by 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) within a 24-hour period.[4] At 03:00 UTC the next day, the NHC upgraded the strengthening tropical storm to a Category\u00a01 hurricane, while it was located roughly 545 miles (877\u00a0km) east-southeast of Bermuda.[16] However, the eastern and southern sides of the eyewall were rather thin, even as Epsilon shifted west-northwestward, due to a mid-tropospheric ridge located north of the cyclone.[17] Despite this, just a few hours later, microwave imagery showed a closed eyewall with deep convection enclosing the center, with a 15 miles (24\u00a0km) eye visible. Around this time, Epsilon briefly shifted westward, before returning to its previous northwestward movement.[18] At 18:00 UTC that same day, the Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunters investigated the cyclone, finding flight-level and surface winds of around 110\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h), marking the storm's intensification into a high-end Category 2 hurricane. The reconnaissance aircraft also discovered a stadium-effect eye.[19][20] Just three hours later, Epsilon reached Category\u00a03 major hurricane status, while displaying a well-organized satellite presentation. A warm, well-defined eye was evident, with closed eyewall convection, and cloud top temperatures of around \u221276\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221260\u00a0\u00b0C).[21] The upgrade to a Category 3 hurricane made Epsilon the easternmost major hurricane recorded this late in the calendar year, as well as the strongest late-season major hurricane in the northeastern Atlantic, and the fastest rapid intensification rate of a tropical cyclone recorded this far northeast this late in the Atlantic hurricane season.[2] At 00:00 UTC on October 22, Epsilon reached its peak intensity, with 1-minute sustained winds of around 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of around 952 mbar (28.11 inHg). Meanwhile, the hurricane's small and well-defined inner core was located within an environment of deep-level moisture, protecting it from dry air associated with an upper-level trough wrapping three-quarters of the way around the hurricane.[4] Shortly afterward, Epsilon began to degrade due to a dry air intrusion, and its eye started to become ill-defined and cloud-filled, while its western eyewall eroded, causing the storm to weaken to a Category 2 hurricane.[22] Weakening ensued throughout the day, further degrading Epsilon to a 85\u00a0mph (135\u00a0km/h)-Category 1 hurricane before the weakening trend stopped, with the storm maintaining this intensity for about 48 hours. However, the eye briefly became better-defined, before becoming ill-defined once more just a few hours later. Meanwhile, the CDO became disorganized, with a broad outer band wrapping around the western portion of the storm. However, upper-level outflow was well-defined in the northern part of the hurricane.[23][24][4] Around this time, Epsilon made its closest approach to Bermuda, passing just 190 miles (310\u00a0km) east of the island.[25] At 15:00 UTC on October 23, a small eye reappeared on geostationary and polar-orbiting microwave imagery, along with increased well-defined curved banding.[26] Concentric eyewalls began to develop within Epsilon, while the northern half of its wind field expanded, indicating the start of an eyewall replacement cycle.[27] Several hours later, early on October 24, Epsilon completed its eyewall replacement cycle. The storm's convective pattern devolved into a large, comma-shaped structure, rather than the classical circular structure normally seen in mature tropical cyclones.[28] During this time, Epsilon moved over the warm waters of the Gulf Stream, which allowed it to retain its intensity. A buoy near the center of the hurricane indicated that Epsilon's central pressure was about 957.8 millibars (28.28\u00a0inHg) around this time, which indicated that Epsilon was a stronger hurricane than the NHC had estimated it to be earlier.[29] Later that day, Epsilon began interacting with another upper-level trough; combined with baroclinic forcing, this caused Epsilon's wind field and inner core to expand in size. Epsilon also turned sharply northeastward and accelerated its forward motion.[4] The hurricane slowly weakened as it continued moving further north. Early on October 25, Epsilon began transitioning into an extratropical cyclone, with the storm's cloud pattern expanding in size.[30] The storm soon moved north of the Gulf Stream several hours later and entered much cooler waters,[30][31] subsequently weakening into a tropical storm at about 18:00\u00a0UTC on the same day, even as it moved closer to another larger extratropical storm to the north, which was spawned by the upper-level trough.[32][4] At 06:00\u00a0UTC on October 26, Epsilon finished transitioning into an extratropical cyclone while located about 565 miles (909\u00a0km) east of Cape Race, Newfoundland, with the storm's low-level circulation becoming stretched out along a north\u2013south axis.[4][33] Later that day, Epsilon was absorbed by the larger extratropical storm to the north, at 18:00\u00a0UTC.[4]"

Though no transportation disruptions were anticipated, bikers were warned to be cautious of strong wind gusts.[37][38] Dangerous Surf Advisories were posted on southern-facing beaches, with residents urged to stay out of the water.[39] The start of the World Tens Series had to be postponed from October 24 to the following day, to avoid severe weather from Epsilon.[40] Between October 22\u201323, Epsilon passed just 190 miles (310\u00a0km) east of Bermuda. Several locations of the island reported tropical storm-force winds, owing to the hurricane's large wind field. Sustained winds peaked at about 49\u00a0mph (79\u00a0km/h), with the highest wind gust measured at 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h), which was recorded at the Maritime Operations Centre, at an elevation of about 290 feet (88,000\u00a0mm). Tropical storm-force winds were also reported on Pearl Island and The Crescent, while a wind gust of 38\u00a0mph (61\u00a0km/h) was registered at the L.F. Wade International Airport.[4][25] Only minor wind damage occurred on the island, while most weak trees and tree branches had already been downed by previous Hurricanes Paulette and Teddy.[41][4] The outer bands of the storm only brought scattered showers to Bermuda, with a peak precipitation amount of 0.42 inches (11\u00a0mm) being reported at the L.F. Wade International Airport.[4] Epsilon produced dangerous swells along the coast of Bermuda, forcing lifeguards at Horseshoe Bay to briefly halt services.[42] In St. George's, video taken by Bernews showed waves crashing over small seawalls. Photos also showed waves ponding on nearby sidewalks and roads. Overall, damage in Bermuda was minor, and the storm's impact was compared to that of winter gales on the island.[37][43][44]"

        "content": "Tropical Storm Patricia originated from a tropical wave that moved off the west coast of Africa on September 23. Two days later, Tropical Depression Eight developed from the wave over the eastern Atlantic Ocean.[1] The depression tracked northwestward,[2] while the wave continued a steady westward track. By October\u00a06, the system crossed Central America and entered the eastern Pacific Ocean. Gradual development took place over the following several days with widespread, scattered convection consolidating around a developing area of low pressure. On October\u00a011, a well-defined circulation had formed and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) estimated that it developed into a tropical depression roughly 405\u00a0mi (650\u00a0km) south-southeast of the southern tip of Baja California Sur.[1] Several hours later, the system further strengthened into a tropical storm and was named Patricia.[1] The low-level circulation became embedded within very deep convection and further intensification was anticipated. Patricia tracked north-northwest in a region of low to moderate wind shear, under the steering currents of a strong ridge of high pressure to the east and a trough located northwest. Although over warm sea surface temperatures, relatively stable air aloft prevented substantial intensification.[3] By the late morning of October\u00a012, the overall extent of cloud cover had increased but the center became less defined.[4] Later that day, Patricia attained its peak intensity as a moderately strong tropical storm with winds of 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of\n996\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.41\u00a0inHg).[1] The storm maintained this intensity for several hours as its central dense overcast remained intact despite increasing wind shear. However, the NHC stated that there was a 20% chance of the storm becoming a hurricane within 24\u00a0hours based on climatological factors and the average forecast intensity errors.[5] However, this did not take place. The combination of moderate wind shear and a stable environment caused Patricia to rapidly weaken on October\u00a013.[1] The storm's cirrus outflow became weak in all directions and convection diminished.[6] Later that day, convective developed ceased to occur as the storm neared the south tip of Baja California Sur. Early on October\u00a014, Patricia degenerated into a remnant low pressure area, bypassing tropical depression status, roughly 30\u00a0mi (50\u00a0km) south of the Baja California Peninsula. The remnant low turned westward and tracked over open waters before dissipating on October\u00a015.[1]"

The following day, the watch was upgraded to a tropical storm warning for areas between Buenavista and Agua Blanca. However, the storm's rapid decay on October\u00a014 allowed the watches and warnings to be discontinued.[1] Officials in the threatened region began preparing by closing schools and opening 159 shelters on October\u00a012. The Civil Protection Department was prepared to evacuate residents in low-lying area if necessary. Resorts and hotels cancelled all outdoor activities and brought all loose objects indoors.[7] The city of Los Cabos was placed under a state of emergency as flooding rains were forecast to impact the area.[8] Ports in the region were also shut down due to rough seas.[9] The storm's quick deterioration led to significantly less impact than anticipated.[1] High waves affected the coastlines of Baja California Sur, Sinaloa and Nayarit.[10] Parts of Sinaloa also recorded heavy rainfall from Patricia, peaking at 184.5\u00a0mm (7.26\u00a0in) in Higuera de Zaragoza.[11] Subsequent flooding was reported in 12 municipalities in the state, resulting in the evacuation of 3,000 people.

        "content": " The 1906 Florida Keys hurricane was a powerful and deadly hurricane that had a major impact on Cuba and southern Florida. The fifth hurricane and third major hurricane of the season, the storm formed from a system near Barbados on October 4. By October 8, it had intensified into a tropical storm, and made landfall as a hurricane in Central America. The hurricane traveled towards Cuba, making landfall and wreaking havoc on the island. The storm then made a third landfall in the Florida Keys during the evening of October 18. At least 240 people were killed as a result of the hurricane,[note 1] and damages totaled at least $4,135,000.[note 2] Of the 240 people killed during the storm, 135 were workers on the Florida East Coast Railway.[1] The hurricane eventually led to the end of pineapple production in the Florida Keys for commercial purposes in 1915, although this was amplified by two further hurricanes in the following years.[9]"

        "content": "The hurricane originated from a \"cyclonic perturbation\" near Barbados on October 4, as reported by local newspapers. On October 5, no closed circulation was evident in the system. In Col\u00f3n, Panama, a report was sent to the Weather Bureau, reporting sinking barometric pressures on October 6.[8] It was recognized as a tropical storm early on October 8, with winds of 40\u00a0mph (65\u00a0km/h), while located in the southwestern Caribbean.[10] As the system continued to move west on October 9, it strengthened into a hurricane, and while it began to curve toward the west-northwest, further strengthening occurred, as it intensified into a Category 2 hurricane. The hurricane made landfall in Nicaragua on October 10 as a Category 3 hurricane. The system quickly weakened to a tropical storm as it traveled west-northwestward on October 11, later passing over the Gulf of Honduras. It later struck Belize on October 13 as a strong Category 1 hurricane on October 13, tracking north-northwestward.[10] The system weakened into a tropical storm by October 14 but restrengthened into a Category 1 hurricane by October 16. As the hurricane began to turn northeastward, it continued to intensify, attaining Category 3 status by early October 17.[10] The hurricane continued to approach Havana during the day, and the hurricane's center passed east of Havana during the evening. The hurricane passed over southern Florida on the morning of October 18 moving northeastward, and over the next few days turned north and slowed down to the east of South Carolina.[1] The hurricane began to weaken as it was forced to curve south-southwestward,[10] striking Florida again as the result of a high-pressure area.[1] The system eventually weakened to a tropical depression over Florida, and traced southwestward into the Gulf of Mexico. On October 23, the remnants of the hurricane struck Central America and dissipated on October 23.[10]"

Approximately 180 pounds (82\u00a0kg) of crushed dry ice were seeded into the 1947 hurricane.[24] The system was successfully seeded; however, soon after the seeding, the hurricane changed course and traced toward Charleston, South Carolina. Following the seeding, the project was cancelled and numerous lawsuits were filed as the result of the sudden change of the path in the storm. However, the similar path of this hurricane prevented the success of the lawsuits.[25]"

        "content": " The winter of 1981\u20131982 in the United Kingdom (also called  The Big Snow of 1982 by the press) was a severe cold wave that was formed in early December 1981 and lasted until mid-late January in 1982, and was one of the coldest Decembers recorded in the United Kingdom.[2] At the end of November 1981, a strong high-pressure anticyclone over southern England was keeping temperatures around the average for the time of year. Numerous strong low-pressure extratropical cyclones passing to the north of Scotland dragged cold upper-level air down from the Arctic, but the anticyclone to the south of the United Kingdom deflected the coldest air away from the British Isles. On 23 November 1981, a cold front crossing the United Kingdom, fuelled by humid subtropical air from the south colliding with this colder Arctic air from the north, spawned 104 tornadoes as part of a record-breaking nationwide tornado outbreak. Following the passing of the cold front, the anticyclone to the south began to break down, allowing the colder Arctic air to move in over Great Britain and Ireland from the north and precipitating the start of the severe cold wave at the start of December. The Central England Temperature region (CET) recorded a daily mean temperature of 0.3\u00a0\u00b0C (32.5\u00a0\u00b0F)[3] and a daily minimum temperature of \u22122.7\u00a0\u00b0C (27.1\u00a0\u00b0F),[4] for December, the coldest December recorded in the 20th century.[3] The CET region also reported its lowest minimum December temperature at \u221215.9\u00a0\u00b0C (3.4\u00a0\u00b0F) on the 13th.[5] The lowest temperature recorded in December was \u221225.2\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221213.4\u00a0\u00b0F) recorded in Shawbury, Shropshire on the 13th, and is the lowest December temperature recorded in England. Wales also recorded its lowest recorded December temperature during the cold wave, with a temperature of \u221222.7\u00a0\u00b0C (\u22128.9\u00a0\u00b0F) recorded at Corwen, Denbighshire also on the 13th.[1] The lowest temperature recorded in the United Kingdom during the cold wave was recorded in Scotland with a temperature of \u221227.2\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221217.0\u00a0\u00b0F) recorded in Braemar, Aberdeenshire on 10 January, and is the lowest temperature ever recorded in the United Kingdom. England also recorded its lowest temperature during the cold wave at \u221226.1\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221215.0\u00a0\u00b0F) which was recorded at Newport, Telford and Wrekin, also on 10 January.[1]"

Starting in late December as a result of the southward shift of the polar vortex, extremely cold conditions froze the eastern United States in the last few days of 2017 as well as into the new year. Following a brief respite in mid-January, cold temperatures swung back into the eastern U.S. shortly afterwards. The cold wave finally dissolved by around January 19, as near-average temperatures returned. Several winter weather events accompanied the cold wave, the most significant one was a powerful blizzard that impacted the Northeastern U.S. in the first few days of 2018. Some of these events impacted areas that normally do not receive snow, such as Louisiana and Texas. In an extremely rare event, Tallahassee, Florida in extreme north Florida received trace amounts of frozen precipitation for the first time in more than 30 years. In addition, many places broke records for lowest temperatures in the final week of 2017 and the first week of 2018."

Because of an \"omega\" block pattern that set up around Christmas time \u2013 a shift to a pattern with a ridge settling over the western continental U.S. and a trough in the central- to eastern parts of the U.S., below-average temperatures occurred through much of the Lower 48 for the final week of 2017 \u2013 leading to many records being broken.[5] The pattern continued into the first week of 2018, with more record lows being set following a significant blizzard that impacted the Northeastern United States in early January. By January 11, warmer temperatures had surged northeastwards, although following a winter storm a few days later, cold temperatures returned to the Northeast. The cold wave had an impact on New Year's Eve celebrations in the affected regions; some Canadian cities chose to scale back their ancillary outdoor festivities (but still scheduling celebrations at midnight), including Calgary (which forecast a high of \u221226\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221215\u00a0\u00b0F)), Ottawa (overnight low of \u221224\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221211\u00a0\u00b0F)), and Toronto (\u221215\u00a0\u00b0C (5\u00a0\u00b0F), \u221230\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221222\u00a0\u00b0F) after wind chill). Montreal and Winnipeg decided to go on without any changes.[6][7] New Year's Eve celebrations at New York City's Times Square were the second-coldest on record, at 9\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221213\u00a0\u00b0C) (\u22124\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221220\u00a0\u00b0C) after wind chill).[8][9] On December 31, 2017, the New England Patriots and Tennessee Titans of the National Football League (NFL) both played their coldest home games in franchise history, with the Patriots (in Foxborough, Massachusetts) recording a kickoff temperature of 13\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221211\u00a0\u00b0C) and a wind chill of \u22122\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221219\u00a0\u00b0C),[10] and the Titans (in Nashville, Tennessee) with a kickoff temperature of 23\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22125\u00a0\u00b0C).[11]"

The record of eight days set in 1895 and 1917 still had yet to be broken, but temperatures were not recorded every hour at that time.[19] On January 7, temperatures in Massachusetts were so cold that part of Buzzards Bay froze.[20] That day saw new record lows established in Worcester, Providence and Hartford, and tied in Boston.[21] During the cold wave, Boston used two million barrels of oil to heat their homes, more than what is burned in an average year, and more than twice all the oil burned in 2016.[22] The first week of 2018 became the coldest first week on record of any year in New York City, Pittsburgh, Raleigh, Charlotte, Tallahassee, Detroit and Cincinnati. New Orleans tied their coldest first week of the year that was previously set in 1970. The second coldest first week of the year was set in Jacksonville, Cleveland, Indianapolis, and Boston.[23] Dulles International Airport saw their longest cold wave on record,[24] while Bridgeport, Connecticut saw its longest streak of subfreezing temperatures.[25]"

Gladys later reached peak winds of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) just before making landfall near Homosassa on the western coast of Florida on October\u00a019. The hurricane crossed the state and continued northeastward, passing just east of Cape Hatteras on October\u00a020. The next day, Gladys became extratropical and was absorbed by a cold front over Nova Scotia. In Cuba, the threat of the hurricane prompted widespread evacuations. Gladys caused flash flooding and heavily damaged the tobacco crop. Damage in the country was estimated at $12\u00a0million (1968\u00a0USD), and there were six deaths. While passing west of the Florida Keys, the hurricane produced strong winds that briefly cut communications to the Dry Tortugas, but damage was minor. Near where Gladys made landfall, winds gusted to 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) and tides reached 6.5\u00a0ft (2.0\u00a0m) above normal. There was heavy beach erosion and flooding along the coast, while the winds knocked down trees and caused power outages. Across the state, damage was estimated at $6.7\u00a0million (1968\u00a0USD), and three people were indirectly killed. Heavy rainfall in South Carolina caused minor river flooding. When paralleling just off the coast of North Carolina, Gladys was responsible for breaking the state's worst drought since 1932, and proved more beneficial than the minor storm damage there. Later, Gladys killed two people in Atlantic Canada and caused coastal damage in Prince Edward Island."

        "content": "The origins of Hurricane Gladys were from a tropical wave \u2013 a trough embedded in the trade winds \u2013 that moved across the Lesser Antilles on October\u00a06. For the next few days, the wave moved across the Caribbean without any development. As the wave interacted with the Intertropical Convergence Zone, a large area of convection persisted across the region, spawning a series of low-pressure areas. One became a tropical depression near Swan Island offshore Honduras on October\u00a011, and two days later another tropical depression formed near San Andr\u00e9s island in the extreme southwestern Caribbean. The latter system, which would eventually become Gladys, moved slowly north-northwestward. An anticyclone in the region caused wind shear to decrease, allowing for gradual development. On October\u00a015, a hurricane hunters flight observed winds of 52\u00a0mph (84\u00a0km/h); on that basis, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Gladys.[2] Gladys' track and origin were fairly typical of October.[3] After becoming a tropical storm, Gladys intensified into a hurricane near the Isle of Youth on October\u00a016.[1] Shortly thereafter it crossed the narrow but mountainous region of western Cuba.[2] By the time the hurricane reached the southeastern Gulf of Mexico, a deep trough was moving eastward through the United States toward a weak anticyclone off the east coast. Gladys turned more to the north, passing just west of the Dry Tortugas, before resuming its north-northwest trajectory, possibly due to a mid-level low near Alabama. Around that time, the eye was reorganizing offshore southwestern Florida, and the hurricane failed to intensify significantly due to the eastern portion of the circulation being over the state. Early on October\u00a019, Gladys made landfall near Homosassa after turning to the northeast,[2] with peak winds estimated at 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h).[1][4] It accelerated across the state due to the approaching trough, emerging into the Atlantic near St. Augustine. Paralleling the southeastern coast of the United States, Gladys passed just east of Cape Hatteras on October\u00a020, although by that time the strongest winds remained along the eastern periphery. The approaching trough caused Gladys to gradually lose tropical characteristics, and on October\u00a021 Gladys became extratropical just south of Nova Scotia. A few hours later, the former hurricane was absorbed by the cold front.[2] Hurricane Gladys was active during the Apollo 7 spaceflight mission, and astronauts aboard took several pictures of the hurricane. Later, researchers were able to compare the photographs to airforce reconnaissance data, radar, and local weather networks, the first such hurricane to be observed with such varied data.[5]"

Many classes were canceled in the region, and workers took steps to minimize damage to the tobacco crop.[8] Shortly after Gladys became a tropical storm, the NHC issued gale warnings for the Florida Keys and later a hurricane watch for the southwest Florida coast from the Florida Keys to Clearwater. After Gladys entered the Gulf of Mexico, the NHC issued hurricane warnings for the Florida Keys to Cedar Key, with a watch to St. Marks. Later, hurricane warnings were issued from Charleston, South Carolina to Hatteras, North Carolina.[2] Before Gladys made landfall in Florida, all schools in Pinellas County were closed, and officials evacuated 60\u00a0jet fighters from MacDill Air Force Base to Mississippi. HMS\u00a0Sirius, which was visiting St. Petersburg, rode out the storm in the open Gulf of Mexico. The American Red Cross opened shelters across western Florida for people to stay in during the storm,[9] and about 40,000\u00a0people evacuated their homes during the storm's passage.[7] Then-governor Claude R. Kirk Jr. ordered 100\u00a0Florida guardsmen to assist with storm work.[10] Shelters were set up in North Carolina, although few people evacuated.[7]"

        "content": "Before its first landfall in Cuba, Gladys produced wind gusts of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) at Nueva Gerona on the Isle of Youth. Rainfall on the island was estimated at 8.49\u00a0in (216\u00a0mm). On the Cuban mainland, a station in Havana reported gale-force winds for several hours. The hurricane dropped heavy rainfall, causing flash flooding that damaged factories and crops; the tobacco crop sustained heavy losses to the extent that the Monthly Weather Review described it as \"virtually wiped out\".[2] In Havana, floodwaters from the storm wrecked houses and other buildings, while in San Antonio de los Ba\u00f1os, residents required rescue from their flooded houses. After the storm, Cuban officials advised residents in Havana to boil their water to prevent the spread of disease, after water lines were damaged.[6] At least 36,000 people were left homeless as a result of the storm.[11] Throughout Cuba, Gladys caused $12\u00a0million in damage and six deaths.[12] While Gladys was still moving northward offshore Florida, it produced winds of 64\u00a0mph (103\u00a0km/h) on the Dry Tortugas, with gusts to 86\u00a0mph (138\u00a0km/h).[2] Rainfall on the Dry Tortugas reached over 4\u00a0in (100\u00a0mm). Communications were briefly cut to the island during the storm.[6] Along the Florida Keys, the only other report of a hurricane-force wind gust was 87\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) on Plantation Key.[2] Tides in the Florida Keys were about 0.6\u00a0ft (0.18\u00a0m) above normal, and damage was minor in the region.[13] As the storm paralleled Southwest Florida, it produced negligible impact between Sarasota and Naples.[14] Farther north in Florida, hurricane-force winds were limited to a small area from Clearwater to Bayport, with peak gusts of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h).[2] A weather station at Inglis clocked sustained winds of 94\u00a0mph (151\u00a0km/h) before being disabled.[4][14] Winds in eastern Florida were not as strong. Gladys produced moderate rainfall across the state,[2] peaking at 12.46\u00a0in (316\u00a0mm) at Cape Canaveral.[15] Rainfall was generally less than 6\u00a0in (150\u00a0mm), which limited flooding. The hurricane produced high tides near where it made landfall, reaching 6.5\u00a0ft (2.0\u00a0m) above normal; this caused heavy beach erosion and coastal flooding.[2] The town of Sunset Beach was almost entirely under water during the high storm tides. Elsewhere, the high waves wrecked boat houses, and portions of the seawall were washed out in Tierra Verde.[13] Across Florida, Gladys downed many trees and power lines,[13] and the NHC office briefly lost power for two hours.[16] Gladys affected about 85% of the citrus crop to some degree, although crop damage was fairly minimal,[2] with about 10% lost in Pinellas and west Pasco counties.[13] There was widespread property damage due to the strong winds, particularly to mobile homes.[2] Strong winds in Pinellas County knocked over trailers and damaged billboards. In Ocala, most roads were blocked by fallen trees and power lines. Falling trees revealed liquor bottles and other archeological relics from the period of the Second Seminole War at Fort King in Ocala.[17]\nWind damage was minor in northeastern Florida, despite a wind gust of 74\u00a0mph (119\u00a0km/h) in Jacksonville.[13] Gladys also spawned at least three\u00a0tornadoes in the state, one\u00a0each in Boca Raton, Palatka, and Whitfield Estates.[2] The one in Boca Raton damaged a warehouse, while a waterspout in Whitfield Estates damaged three homes.[18] The Palatka twister caused minimal damage.[19] According to locals, several other tornadoes were suspected to have touched down in Volusia and Putnam counties, based on the falling of trees and visible twisting trail of damage.[20] Two\u00a0people died in the state due to storm-induced heart attacks, and another person died after driving into a flooded ditch. Damage in the state totaled $6.7\u00a0million, mostly to private property,[13] and due to the damage, portions of the state were later declared a federal disaster area.[21] The Small Business Administration authorized low-interest loans to homes and businesses damaged during the storm.[22] Outside of Florida, Gladys produced rainfall through Delaware, with a maximum of 13.80\u00a0in (351\u00a0mm) in Marion, South Carolina.[23] In the state, the rains caused minor river flooding and left minor damage to the cotton crop, while high tides eroded beaches.[13] In North Carolina, wind gusts peaked at 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) at Cape Lookout, while sustained winds reached 63\u00a0mph (101\u00a0km/h) at Nags Head before the anemometer blew away. The strongest winds were only along the immediate coastline due to the hurricane passing offshore. Gladys produced above-normal tides of 2 to 4\u00a0ft (0.61 to 1.22\u00a0m).[2] The storm knocked two houses off their foundations and severely damaged a business and a mobile home.[7] Rainfall in the state helped end break the worst drought since 1932, and the minimal storm damage was offset by the beneficial precipitation. In southeastern Virginia, the fringes of the storm produced wind gusts of 46\u00a0mph (74\u00a0km/h) and light rainfall in Norfolk.[2] Farther inland, rains from Gladys caused the Roanoke River to rise 9\u00a0ft (2.7\u00a0m) near Roanoke, just below flood stage.[13] Tides were about 2\u00a0ft (0.61\u00a0m) above normal in the state, low enough to prevent major coastal flooding.[18] Later, the extratropical remnants of Gladys produced beneficial rainfall of 2 to 4\u00a0in (51 to 102\u00a0mm) over Atlantic Canada,[2] peaking at 5.03\u00a0in (128\u00a0mm) in New Brunswick. In the province, the former hurricane also produced 1.38\u00a0in (35\u00a0mm) of snow in Upsalquitch. Precipitation from the storm spread as far west as Quebec and as far northeast as Newfoundland, causing flooding in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. Wind gusts in the latter province peaked at 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) in Sydney. Along Cape Breton Island, the remnants of Gladys killed one person and injured four. In Prince Edward Island, wind gusts reached 85\u00a0mph (135\u00a0km/h) in Charlottetown, strong enough to knock over a tree and kill a man driving in Alberton. The storm washed out a portion of a bridge near Alberton and part of a wharf in Miminegash, and damaged 35\u00a0boats.[24] Ferry service was disrupted between the Canadian Maritime provinces.[25]"

A short-lived cyclone, Danielle developed on September\u00a07 to the east of the southern Lesser Antilles. Strengthening to peak winds of 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h), the storm moved through Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, where a rainband moved across the main island with hurricane-force gusts. Continuing westward, Danielle absorbed dry air from northern South America and dissipated on September\u00a010. The threat of Danielle prompted gale warnings in Barbados as well as Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. On the former island, wind gusts reached 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h). On Saint Vincent, the winds caused a major power outage, while heavy rainfall left crop damage. Another rain system affected the country a few weeks later, and the combined monetary damage totaled $9.2\u00a0million (1986\u00a0USD, $18\u00a0million 2010\u00a0USD); 142\u00a0people had to seek shelter after their homes were destroyed, and a total of 436\u00a0dwellings were impacted to some degree.

It progressed westward through the tropical Atlantic Ocean, initially at a moderate speed before accelerating to 23\u00a0mph (37\u00a0km/h) on September\u00a06. A tropical depression developed along the tropical wave early on September\u00a07, and satellite imagery indicated that it quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Danielle about 385\u00a0mi (620\u00a0km) east-southeast of Grenada, an island in the Lesser Antilles.[1][2] On September\u00a08, Hurricane Hunters flew into Tropical Storm Danielle and reported maximum sustained winds of 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h), as well as a pressure of 1,000 millibars (30\u00a0inHg).[1] Initially, forecasters anticipated Danielle would strengthen further.[3] As the storm moved through Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, a rainband north of the center contained winds of near hurricane force, which moved across the island of Saint Vincent. After maintaining peak winds for about 18\u00a0hours, Danielle began weakening in the eastern Caribbean Sea,[1] due to entrainment of dry air from northern South America.[4] Paralleling the northern coast of the continent, the circulation became dislocated from the convection. Late on September\u00a09, the system weakened to tropical depression status, and the next day it dissipated in the western Caribbean.[1] It was the only tropical cyclone in the Caribbean Sea during 1986.[2]"

The winds caused a major power outage on the island,[1] and destroyed the roofs of more than 30\u00a0houses.[6] Elsewhere in the country, the combination of winds and heavy rains caused heavy crop damage.[1] Twelve days after Danielle struck, a severe rainstorm affected Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. The combined disasters produced a damage total of $9.3\u00a0million (1986\u00a0USD, $18\u00a0million 2010\u00a0USD), the majority of it from crop damage. About 40% of the banana crop was destroyed or unfit for cultivation, and 2,050 acres (8.3\u00a0km2) of other crops were seriously affected. The two storms caused the deaths of 120\u00a0animals, although there were no human fatalities. In addition to the crop damage, the combined impact of the two storms left over 100\u00a0houses destroyed, with a total of 436\u00a0dwellings damaged; this forced 142\u00a0people to seek emergency shelter. Across the country, the heavy rainfall caused mudslides and flooding which disrupted the transportation and utility network.[9] During its passage, Danielle produced a 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h) wind gust at the airport in Bridgetown, Barbados.[3] A coast guard ship from Barbados ran aground into a reef in the southern Grenadines, but it was rescued.[1][6] Further south, rainbands from Danielle swept through Trinidad and Tobago, producing up to 4 feet (1.2\u00a0m) of flooding. The flooding caused 27\u00a0landslides and destroyed 4\u00a0bridges. Damage in the country was estimated at $8\u00a0million (1986\u00a0TTD, $1.2\u00a0million 1986\u00a0USD).[10]"

The first storm of the season formed on June\u00a024, while the final dissipated on November\u00a012. Damage from the storms was minimal, and no deaths were reported.

        "content": "Prior to the advent of modern tropical cyclone tracking technology, notably satellite imagery, many hurricanes that did not affect land directly went unnoticed, and storms that did affect land were not recognized until their onslaught. As a result, information on older hurricane seasons was often incomplete. Modern-day efforts have been made and are still ongoing to reconstruct the tracks of known hurricanes and to identify initially undetected storms. In many cases, the only evidence that a hurricane existed was reports from ships in its path, and judging by the direction of winds experienced by ships, and their location in relation to the storm, it is possible to roughly pinpoint the storm's center of circulation for a given point in time. This is the manner in which all of the five known storms in the 1907 season were identified by hurricane expert Jos\u00e9 Fern\u00e1ndez-Partag\u00e1s's reanalysis of hurricane seasons between 1851 and 1910. Partag\u00e1s also extended the known tracks of three other hurricanes previously identified by scholars. The information Partag\u00e1s and his colleague uncovered was largely adopted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Atlantic hurricane reanalysis in their updates to the Atlantic hurricane database (HURDAT), with some slight adjustments. HURDAT is the official source for such hurricane data as track and intensity, although due to a sparsity of available records at the time the storms existed, listings on some storms are incomplete.[1][2] The season was one of only two Atlantic seasons without a storm of hurricane intensity (winds of 75\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h) or higher), the other being the 1914\u00a0season. In addition, the maximum winds recorded from the first tropical storm were also the highest of the season; it also broke the record for the weakest \"most intense\" storm on record for an Atlantic hurricane season.[1] Reanalysis also indicated that four additional systems could have developed during the season.[3] No deaths occurred during the season and damage was minimal.[4] The season's activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 13.06, the third lowest total since the beginning of HURDAT records in 1851. ACE is a metric used to express the energy used by a tropical cyclone during its lifetime. Therefore, a storm with a longer duration will have high values of ACE. It is only calculated at six-hour increments in which specific tropical and subtropical systems are either at or above sustained wind speeds of 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h), which is the threshold for tropical storm intensity. Thus, tropical depressions are not included here.[5]"

Late on June\u00a026, it passed between the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula and Cuba, and subsequently entered the Gulf of Mexico shortly thereafter. The tropical storm continued to slowly intensify, and started to make sharp curve towards the northeast on June\u00a028.[1] The storm traveled east-northeastward paralleling the Gulf Coast of the United States, and eventually made landfall on the Florida panhandle early on June\u00a029. It weakened slightly as it traversed inland, and entered the Atlantic Ocean just offshore Georgia during the morning. At this point, the storm attained its peak intensity of 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h), though it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone within the six hours that followed.[1] Late during the day, the extratropical storm reached New Jersey, and entered Maine on June\u00a030.[6] The 2003 reanalysis made only minor adjustments to the storm's intensity and track created by Partag\u00e1s and Diaz, which included moving the point of landfall westward and increasing windspeeds on June\u00a029 based on readings received in Jacksonville, Florida.[7]"

After swiftly crossing the southern portion of the state, it strengthened into a tropical storm on September\u00a019 over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico, and attained its peak intensity of 45\u00a0mph (75\u00a0km/h) early during September\u00a020. It began turning north on September\u00a021, and made landfall on the Mississippi coast on September\u00a022. The storm weakened as it moved inland, and curved east-northeast later during that day, only to transition into an extratropical cyclone shortly thereafter. The storm lost extratropical characteristics over Virginia on September\u00a023.[1] As there were no reports of strong winds near the point of landfall, Partag\u00e1s had doubt as to whether or not this storm was a tropical storm, as the most intense winds were recorded when the system was classified as extratropical.[9]"

By September\u00a028, it was moving east-northeastward at 24\u00a0mph (39\u00a0km/h), and simultaneously attained its peak intensity of 50\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h). At this point, it remained just offshore the Florida panhandle, and moved inland shortly thereafter on September\u00a029. It plowed through northern Florida and southeastern Georgia while maintaining its intensity and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone off the coast of North Carolina on September\u00a029.[1] The remnants of the storm merged with a cold front the following day while situated south of New York.[10] Storm warnings were issued on September\u00a028 for the shorelines of Louisiana and Mississippi, but the states did not receive strong winds. The maximum gust from the storm was 46\u00a0mph (74\u00a0km/h), which was recorded at Pensacola, Florida.[10]"

        "content": " Tropical Storm Bret was the second named storm of the 2011 Atlantic hurricane season. Bret formed along the southwestern periphery of a weather front north of the Bahamas on July 17. At first, the storm moved little and gradually strengthened in response to favorable upper-level conditions, reaching peak sustained winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h). Steering currents in the area subsequently became better established, and Bret turned toward the northeast only to encounter a substantial increase in vertical wind shear. Despite the shear, the storm maintained a well-defined wind circulation for several days, with intermittent bursts of thunderstorms near its center. By July 22, Bret had been devoid of strong thunderstorm activity for several hours, prompting the National Hurricane Center to discontinue public advisories when it was located about 375 miles (604\u00a0km) north of Bermuda. Since Bret remained over the open Atlantic for most of its existence, its effects on land were limited. While moving little, the storm produced inclement weather and widespread cloudiness over much of the north-central Bahamas. Squalls off the eastern coast of Florida generated rough seas along coastlines, injuring a number of people. Although it stayed well offshore, the storm enhanced tropical moisture over Bermuda, causing beneficial rainfall in dry areas."

        "content": "In mid-July, 2011, a broad upper trough dropped southward over the northwest Atlantic, supporting a cold front that extended westward across Bermuda to inland over Georgia.[2] The front produced a large area of light showers to its north, with its westernmost component remaining quasi-stationary over northeastern Florida.[3] On July 16, a surface low developed along the decaying boundary, just off the coast,[4] generating an area of sporadic convection north of the Bahamas.[5] Although a wind circulation was initially absent and surface pressures were relatively high, the low later became better organized under abating shear conditions on July\u00a017.[6] A reconnaissance flight observed a closed circulation center about 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km), northwest of Great Abaco Island at 18:00\u00a0UTC that day, which confirmed the formation of a tropical depression.[7] Just three hours later, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued its first advisory on the depression,[8] and upgraded it to Tropical Storm Bret at 03:00 UTC the next day, owing to a quick increase in winds and thunderstorms around its center.[9] Situated along a weakness in the subtropical ridge, Bret drifted very slowly southward during the initial stages of its existence.[8] Though traces of dry air approached it from the west, the cyclone continued to strengthen, as prominent bands of deep thunderstorms tightened around it eastern semicircle.[10] Satellite images displayed a disorganized eye-like feature on July 18, suggesting a rather sharp increase in strength. Indeed, an additional reconnaissance flight into the cyclone found peak surface winds of around 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h), just below hurricane strength.[1][11] Following its peak, Bret began to accelerate toward the northeast in response to building high pressure in the area. It fluctuated little in intensity for several hours,[12] although a combination of high wind shear and a lack of tropical moisture inhibited further development. By July 19, the circulation center had become exposed and devoid of deep convection, and the storm weakened to 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) winds upon moving through the increasingly hostile environment.[13] Despite the unfavorable conditions, Bret retained this intensity for the next couple of days as it briefly slowed, with a distinct low-level circulation and a few patches of persistent thunderstorms over its southwestern quadrant.[14] Early on July 20, the heavily sheared cyclone began to reaccelerate within the deepening southwesterly wind flow.[15] Over the next day, Bret continued to deteriorate in organization;[16][17] however, a brief decline in the upper winds allowed intermittent bursts of convection to redevelop south of the exposed center.[18][19] Bret eventually weakened to a tropical depression over cool ocean temperatures early on July 22, once again lacking significant convection while increasing in forward speed.[20] Forecasters at the NHC noted that Bret remained \"a maverick tropical cyclone by refusing to dissipate despite experiencing very hostile wind shear conditions,\" with ship data indications of prevailing strong winds.[21] By 1500 UTC, however, the circulation had become ill-defined, prompting the NHC to declassify Bret as a tropical system about 375\u00a0mi (604\u00a0km) north of Bermuda.[22] During the next several hours, the remnant low of Bret continued to move northeastward out into the Atlantic, until it dissipated on July 23.[1]"

A polar ridge of high pressure was situated north of Bermuda, producing anomalous easterly trades at an unusually high latitude.[3] The easterly flow blew over a long fetch of open waters, thus producing low-level convergence.[3] Gradually, instability probably supported convective activity, and the cyclone slowly acquired tropical characteristics. On October 30, the system became a tropical storm with maximum sustained winds of 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h).[4] Initially, the cyclone moved westward. On November\u00a01, the storm strengthened to a Category 1 hurricane, and it attained peak winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h).[4] The tropical cyclone temporarily threatened the Carolinas.[3] On November\u00a02, the hurricane reached its closest approach to Cape Hatteras; the center was located less than 145 miles (233\u00a0km) off the coast.[4] The cyclone's wind field remained narrow, and Hatteras recorded peak gusts of 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h).[3] The cyclone turned south, under the influence of northerly winds from a high pressure system. On November\u00a03, a ship reported a minimum pressure of 964 mbar (28.48 inHg) north of the Abaco Islands.[5] On November\u00a04, the hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h), made landfall north of Miami Beach near the present location of Bal Harbour, Florida.[4] The hurricane's lowest central pressure in Florida was recorded at 973 millibars (28.7\u00a0inHg) in Miami, Florida.[3][4] The hurricane traversed southern Florida and weakened over land. Later, the cyclone entered the Gulf of Mexico north of Cape Sable. On November\u00a06, the tropical system weakened to a strong tropical storm, and it turned northwest. On November\u00a07, the circulation turned east, and the cyclone weakened to a remnant low pressure area. On November\u00a08, the system dissipated 50 miles (80\u00a0km) southwest of Saint Petersburg.[4]"

The weather prediction for the day was issued by the Weather Bureau, which at the time was managed by Brigadier General Adolphus Greely. The indications officer (forecaster), Lieutenant Thomas Mayhew Woodruff in St. Paul, Minnesota, said: \"A cold wave is indicated for Dakota and Nebraska tonight and tomorrow; the snow will drift heavily today and tomorrow in Dakota, Nebraska, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.\"[4] On January 11, a strengthening surface low dropped south-southeastward out of the Alberta District in Canada's North-West Territories into central Montana Territory and then into northeastern Colorado by the morning of January 12. The temperatures in advance of the low increased some 20\u00a0to 40\u00a0\u00b0F (11\u201322\u00a0\u00b0C) in the central plains (for example, Omaha, Nebraska, recorded a temperature of \u22126\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221221\u00a0\u00b0C) at 7\u00a0a.m. on January 11, while the temperature had increased to 28\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22122\u00a0\u00b0C) by 7\u00a0a.m. on January 12). The strong surface low rapidly moved into southeastern Nebraska by 3\u00a0p.m. on January 12 and finally into southwestern Wisconsin by 11\u00a0p.m. that same day. On January 11, the massive cold air mass that had formed around January 8 around Medicine Hat and Qu'Appelle, Assiniboia District, had reached a spread of over 780 miles (1,255\u00a0km).[5] The blizzard was precipitated by the collision of an immense Arctic cold front with warm moisture-laden air from the Gulf of Mexico. Within a few hours, the advancing cold front caused a temperature drop from a few degrees above freezing to \u221220\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221229\u00a0\u00b0C) [\u221240\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221240\u00a0\u00b0C) in some places]. This wave of cold was accompanied by high winds and heavy snow. The fast-moving storm first struck Montana in the early hours of January 12, swept through Dakota Territory from midmorning to early afternoon, and reached Lincoln, Nebraska, at 3\u00a0p.m. Many who were caught unaware misjudged the weather due to a warm spell. Carl Saltee, a teenage Norwegian immigrant in Fortier, Minnesota, remembered that \"... on the 12th of January 1888 around noontime it was so warm it melted snow and ice from the window until after 1\u00a0p.m.\" This changed rapidly for the teenager who continued that by 3:30\u00a0p.m. \"A dark and heavy wall built up around the northwest coming fast, coming like those heavy thunderstorms, like a shot. In a few moments, we had the severest snowstorm I ever saw in my life with a terrible hard wind, like a Hurricane, snow so thick we could not see more than 3 steps from the door at times.\"[5] The Boston Daily Advertiser reported under the headline \"Midnight at Noon\" that \"At Fargo ... mercury 47\u00b0 below zero and a hurricane blowing ... At Neche, Dak. the thermometer is 58\u00b0 below zero.\"[6] What made the storm so deadly was the timing (during work and school hours), the suddenness of the storm, and the brief spell of warmer weather that preceded it. In addition, the very strong wind fields behind the cold front and the powdery nature of the snow reduced visibilities on the open plains to zero. People ventured from the safety of their homes to do chores, go to town, attend school, or simply enjoy the relative warmth of the day. As a result, thousands of people \u2014 including many schoolchildren \u2014 got caught in the blizzard. The death toll was 235, though some estimate 1,000.[7] Teachers generally kept children in their schoolrooms. Exceptions nearly always resulted in disaster.[8] This cold front was so self-reinforced that it dropped temperatures as far south as Veracruz, Mexico, before dissipating. Travel was severely impeded in the days following. Two months later, yet another severe blizzard hit the East Coast states: This blizzard was known as the Great Blizzard of 1888. It severely affected the east coast, in states like New York and Massachusetts."

During the late afternoon and into the evening hours there, frequent rain squalls occurred, and at 10:15 pm a strong gust of wind was reported. After that gust, the winds decreased in intensity, until around 12:00 am when winds picked up from the west. By 8:00 am the next morning, the wind had become south, and rain was steadily falling on the island.[3] Back on a northwestward track, it continued to weaken, and tracked through the Bahamas on August 22. The center of the storm was reported to have tracked directly over Crooked Island, Bahamas. Beginning on August 23, a ridge of high pressure was situated off the southeast coast of the United States. Now a Category\u00a01 hurricane, the ridge of high pressure prevented the storm executing a recurve to the north or northeast.[3] Instead, it tracked over the Florida Peninsula as a tropical storm, making landfall near Homestead on August 24. Subsequently, it moved into the Gulf of Mexico, where it officially dissipated on August 25.[2] However, there were reports of a cyclonic disturbance in the east Gulf of Mexico until August 29.[3]"

        "content": "On Martinique, the storm struck the east side of the island at about 6:00 pm. Throughout the storm, frequent lightning occurred.[3] Houses, crops and trees across the entire island were obliterated. Especially, the loss of coffee, sugar and cotton crops had a large effect on Martinique's economy.[4] At Ducos, it is noted that only four homes remained following the storm, and at St. Pierre, at least 34\u00a0people lost their lives.[5] At Fort de France, the main part of the hospital collapsed, crushing to death two artillery men. Also, a military camp in Balata was destroyed, where houses comprising the campus suffered from severe roof damage. A number of soldiers there sustained injuries from airborne wood blanks and beams.[6] All vessels at harbors were lost during the hurricane.[7] Initially, the total number of fatalities was placed at sixty. Later, 118 were reported dead in coastal locations alone. Even after the storm, finding an exact number of casualties was difficult because all roads in and out of interior sections of the island were impassable, blocked by downed trees and large amounts of washed out soil and rock. For a final death toll, the August 1891\u00a0Monthly Weather Review states that 700 perished in the storm.[3] However, some newspapers report that the passage of the cyclone resulted in at least 1,000 deaths in Martinique.[8] Additionally, another 1,000\u00a0people sustained injuries of one form or another as a direct result of the cyclone.[6] Total damage is estimated at $10\u00a0million (1891\u00a0USD).[3] Elsewhere, when the hurricane passed north of Grand Turk, three people drowned on the island, and there was some damage to small houses and shipping vessels.[3] In the U.S. State of Florida, it hit near Homestead as a minimal hurricane, blowing boats onshore near present-day Cutler, though due to lack of observations near the landfall location its impact in the state is largely unknown.[9][10]"

It spread heavy snow across the major cities of the Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states, making it the defining snowstorm of the very snowy winter of 2002\u20132003. All cities from Washington, D.C. to Boston were covered in 15\u201330 inches (38\u201376\u00a0cm) of snow[2] and those cities were brought to a standstill due to problems caused by temperatures and the snow. In Baltimore and Boston, this was the biggest snowstorm on record, with 28.2 and 27.5\u00a0inches (71.6 and 69.9\u00a0cm) respectively."

        "header": "Synoptic setup",
        "content": "The severity of the Blizzard of 2003 can be attributed to the unusually favorable atmospheric conditions surrounding the storm (synoptic conditions). Most notably, the storm allowed for cyclogenesis off of the coastal Carolinas, a feature that is common to most major winter storms in the eastern parts of North America. This secondary system fed off the moisture of the Atlantic Ocean and enhanced precipitation totals from North Carolina to Massachusetts. Secondly, a high pressure system was in place over eastern portions of Canada, allowing for cold air to be brought down into the coastal areas in a process known as cold air advection. This cold air ensured that many areas where storms typically produce mixed precipitation received most or all precipitation in the form of snow.[3]"

        "content": "The storm developed in the southern Rockies on February 14, and moved through southern Missouri and the Lower Tennessee Valley during the next few days. It brought heavy rain, ice and severe weather to some areas of the South, including the nation's first tornado of the year. Farther north, snow and ice affected the Midwest. Southern Iowa and eastern Illinois also got significant snow, with 11\u00a0inches (28\u00a0cm) in Des Moines. In central Kentucky the storm produced mostly ice, with some locations including Frankfort, Lexington, and nearby Cynthiana in Harrison County receiving up to 3/4\" (2\u00a0cm) of ice. Much of Ohio received heavy snowfall, with Mansfield receiving 21\u00a0inches and Columbus receiving about a foot. However, early on February 16, heavy snow started falling in those two cities, and the snow later developed in Philadelphia. Heavy snow was continuously reported, falling at rates of up to 4\u00a0inches (10\u00a0cm) per hour.[citation needed] In addition, temperatures were frigid, around 15\u00a0\u00b0F (-10\u00a0\u00b0C). The heavy snow continued all day, and it developed in New York City by the evening. At about the same time, the snow changed to sleet in Washington, D.C., and significantly lowered the accumulation. Throughout the rest of the Northeast, however, the snow continued for much of the night. The sleet changed back to snow by the next morning in Washington, D.C., and soon ended. By that time, a secondary low pressure system formed off the North Carolina coast and traveled north, turning the storm into a nor'easter for New York City and Boston. Blizzard Warnings were issued, and the snow began in Boston that day. In the evening, the heavy snow ended in New York City, and ended in Boston the morning of February 18. After that, the storm weakened and brought a few inches of snow to other parts of New England. The blizzard left the East Coast of the United States on February 19 and moved out into the North Atlantic Ocean. The storm weakened until it was completely absorbed by other systems on February 22."

        "content": "This snowstorm paralyzed much of the East Coast with its heavy snow.  All in all, it was the most significant and powerful storm to affect the major cities of the Northeast since the Blizzard of 1996. Washington's Reagan National Airport, Baltimore/Washington International Airport, Pittsburgh International Airport, Philadelphia International Airport, and LaGuardia Airport in New York City were shut down completely, and Dulles Airport had one runway open. With snow continually accumulating, road travel was nearly impossible. In Baltimore, the roof of the historic B&O Railroad Museum built in 1884 collapsed, damaging many valuable engines, historic railroad cars, and train exhibits. Although the structure's central support columns remained standing, the supporting iron struts and ties of the destroyed roofing sections failed under the heavy snow load. Some items in the  museum's collection were damaged beyond repair. Reporting on the devastation the following day, The Baltimore Sun said, \"...hours after the collapse, columns of mangled steel stuck out from the roundhouse ... Locomotives and passenger cars in the museum's collection, some dating from the 1830s, could be seen covered with snow and debris\".[4] Parts of the Baltimore suburbs were some of the hardest hit areas of the blizzard. Snowfall totals in the towns immediately north of the city were estimated at between 38\"-40\" while the downtown city center recorded only 28\" of snow. The difference in reported totals resulted in conflicting reports received by the Department of Transportation. This confusion in communications resulted in the towns with the highest amounts of snow receiving delayed assistance in the cleanup while the major roadways into and out of the city were cleared. Most Washington, D.C. area television stations had wall-to-wall coverage from Saturday morning through Monday evening, only stopping briefly overnight.  Even overnight, they had constant information bars on the screen with the latest forecasts and emergency information.  The University of Maryland baseball team was stranded in Florida for an extra 3 days following a tournament at Stetson University due to all flights being canceled in the Baltimore/DC area.  The city of Albany, New York was shut down for three days. Many school districts affected by the blizzard closed schools for the week. The amount of snow accumulating on the roads forced some snowplows to plow the snow into parking lots, further contributing to school closures. Many schools announced during the storm that their facilities would be closed for the duration of the week following the storm. The University System of Maryland announced on Sunday, February 16 that their campuses would not reopen until Monday, February 24. The extended closure of school districts due to this storm exacerbated the task of scheduling make-up days for the affected students, as most of these districts had already used all of their previously allocated days on storms earlier in the winter. Some districts in New Jersey ended the school year as late as June 30, 2003. In Pennsylvania, Governor Ed Rendell declared a state of emergency early on the 17th which made state agencies available for assistance. It also freed counties from spending restrictions and allowed routes to be closed to non-emergency vehicles. The state also issued a travel advisory asking people to stay off the roads. Many municipalities (including Philadelphia and Pittsburgh) declared their own snow emergencies which banned non-essential travel and parking on snow emergency routes. There were two snow-related deaths within Philadelphia. In the southeastern part of the state, area malls closed early on the 16th and churches cancelled services. The weight of the snow caused several roof and porch collapses throughout the region, particularly around Philadelphia where the snow mixed with sleet. Most malls and shopping centers were closed on the 17th as many employees could not get to work. Funerals and elective surgical procedures were cancelled. Businesses, universities and government offices started to reopen on Tuesday the 18th, but most schools remained closed. Organizers had to postpone scheduled events. Even Girl Scouts could not deliver their cookies. Life returned closer to normal as the week continued. Volunteers helped hospital personnel get to and from work. Blood supplies though were down to about one day. Numerous accidents occurred in the southeast part of the state during the morning of the 16th. After that, the timing of the storm (during the holiday weekend) kept the number of accidents and rescues down. The fluffy nature of the snow led to few power outages. Most were caused by vehicles crashing into utility poles. In Philadelphia, a partially buried man was found in a snowpile on the 17th. On the 21st, a 79-year-old woman was killed after a snow-packed aluminum patio roof collapsed on her. On the 19th, a 24-year-old man was injured when his leg was trapped under the debris of a porch collapse. The worst building collapse occurred in a warehouse near the old Navy Yard. Damage to the roof and goods was 3.5 million dollars. Philadelphia International Airport remained open on the 16th, but closed on the 17th and stranded about 600 passengers at the airport. The Greyhound bus terminal closed on the 17th. SEPTA regional rail lines ran on weekend schedules through Tuesday the 18th. About 400,000 tons of snow were dumped into the Schuylkill River. The city estimated snow removal cost about 8 million dollars. It took until the 18th to plow side streets. The worst accident of the storm occurred early on the 16th as six vehicles collided near Academy Road on Interstate 95. In Delaware County, all trolley and bus routes were closed through the 18th as were schools and county offices. Snowmobiles were used to rescue trapped motorists. In Chester County, a major accident during the early afternoon of the 16th closed the eastbound lanes of the Pennsylvania Turnpike between Morgantown and Downingtown for three hours. In Montgomery County, in Conshohocken, two people were killed in an early morning fire on the 17th. Firefighters were hampered by the ongoing storm. Lengthy delays occurred on the 16th on U.S. Route 422, the Pennsylvania Turnpike and the Northeast Extension to the Pennsylvania Turnpike. A string of porch collapses occurred on the 19th in Norristown. In Bucks County, a woman died of a heart attack. Emergency personnel could not reach her. The eastbound lanes of the Pennsylvania Turnpike near the Philadelphia Interchange were shut down during the afternoon of the 16th because of a multi-vehicle accident that set a couple of them ablaze. In Nockamixon and Bridgeton Townships, an avalanche closed a mile of River Road. Several drivers were stranded and had to be rescued. The snow was 10 feet high on the roadway. In the Lehigh Valley, even police cruisers were getting stuck in the snow. Non-four-wheel drive vehicles could not move. The Lehigh Valley International Airport remained opened, but most flights were canceled. There was no public transportation on the 17th. The blizzard was part of a winter remarkable for its snowstorms in the affected states, where total snowfall for the season ranked in the top\u00a0ten and even higher in some areas. In sections of the coastal northeast, 75\u00a0inches of total snowfall occurred that year. Some Maryland communities getting more than three feet of snow in the President's Day blizzard, such as Kingsville and Perry Hall,[citation needed] experienced more than 80\u00a0inches of snow for the entire winter season.[citation needed]"

It was inactive, with only five known tropical cyclones. Another tropical storm was believed to have existed offshore Atlantic Canada in late August and early September,[1] but HURDAT \u2013 the official Atlantic hurricane database \u2013 now excludes this system.[2] The first known system was initially observed on August\u00a05, while the final known storm was last noted on September\u00a017. These dates fall within the period with the most tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic. At one point during the season, two tropical cyclones existed simultaneously. Two of the cyclones only have a single known point in their tracks due to a sparsity of data. Of the season's five tropical cyclones, four reached hurricane status. Furthermore, one of those four strengthened into a major hurricane, which are Category\u00a03 or higher on the modern-day Saffir\u2013Simpson scale. The strongest cyclone of the season, the fifth system, peaked at Category\u00a03 strength with 125\u00a0mph (205\u00a0km/h) winds. It reportedly produced some of the worst impacts in Louisiana and Mississippi since 1819 and killed at least one person in the latter. The first storm of the season brought locally severe impact to Tampico, Tamaulipas, in Mexico in early August. Additionally, the fourth storm caused severe damage in the Lesser Antilles."

However, it is possible that the storm developed in the Caribbean in late July, due to data obtained from the barque Bercaldine.[1] Torrential rainfall in the Tampico area caused disastrous flooding, with heavy damage to goods and property. Eleven vessels were docked at Tampico, some of which lost their cargo. At the mouth of the P\u00e1nuco River, a pilot station and a fort were swept away.

Shortly thereafter, the hurricane made landfall near Buras-Triumph, Louisiana, at the same intensity.[2] Based on the pressure-wind relationship, the storm had a minimum barometric pressure of approximately 945\u00a0mbar (27.9\u00a0inHg) upon striking the coast.[6] It weakened after moving inland, decreasing to Category\u00a01 intensity later on September 16. Early on the following day, the system weakened to a tropical storm, several hours before dissipating over central Alabama.[2] This was regarded as the worst hurricane in the region since 1819. In Louisiana, winds and storm surge impacted the eastern portions of the state. The wharf and bathhouse in Proctorville were swept away. About 4\u00a0ft (1.2\u00a0m) of water was reported at Proctor's Landing. A combination of strong winds and storm surge destroyed a number of houses along the shores of Lake Borgne. Along the coast of Mississippi, most structures were swept to sea.[7] The foundation of the Biloxi Lighthouse was endangered due to erosion from this storm.[8] Additionally, locals described the Cat Island Lighthouse as being left in \"severe peril\".

The second storm of the season, Bonnie formed from an area of low pressure northeast of the Bahamas on May\u00a027, a few days before the official hurricane season began on June\u00a01. Moving steadily west-northwestwards, Bonnie intensified into a tropical storm on May\u00a028 and attained peak winds six hours later. However, due to hostile environmental conditions, Bonnie weakened to a depression hours before making landfall just east of Charleston, South Carolina, on May\u00a029. Steering currents collapsed afterwards, causing the storm to meander over South Carolina for two days. The storm weakened further into a post-tropical cyclone on May\u00a031, before emerging off the coast while moving generally east-northeastwards. On June\u00a02, Bonnie regenerated into a tropical depression just offshore North Carolina as conditions became slightly more favorable. The next day, despite increasing wind shear and cooling sea surface temperatures, Bonnie reintensified into a tropical storm and reached its peak intensity. The storm hung on to tropical storm strength for another day, before weakening into a depression late on June\u00a04 and became post-tropical early the next day. Lingering over South Carolina for a few days, Bonnie brought heavy rains and widespread floods to the Southeastern United States. Rainfall totals hit 6 inches (150\u00a0mm) in much of South Carolina, and exceeded 10\u00a0in (250\u00a0mm) in some areas.

        "content": "On May\u00a024, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring an area of disturbed weather resulting from the interaction of a weakening cold front and an upper-level trough.[1] A surface area of low pressure formed late the next day,[2] and the low eventually gained sufficient organization to be declared a tropical depression at 18:00\u00a0UTC on May\u00a027.[3][4] At the time, the depression was located about 435 miles (700\u00a0km) southeast of Charleston, South Carolina, and moving west-northwestwards in response to a low over the northwestern Bahamas and a ridge near the coast of North Carolina.[5] Strong vertical wind shear and dry air in the region hindered strengthening, however, the depression was located over the warm waters of the Gulf Stream.[5] In the afternoon of May\u00a028, a burst of deep convection developed near the northwestern part of the exposed low-level circulation center (LLCC), and the NHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Bonnie.[3][6] Despite strong southerly wind shear exposing the LLCC, Bonnie intensified slightly to reach its initial peak intensity with winds of 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h) as it turned towards the north.[3][7][8] However, the continued effects of high wind shear and dry air caused the cyclone's appearance to significantly degrade early on May\u00a029, as deep convection dissipated due to more than 46\u00a0mph (74\u00a0km/h) of southerly shear.[9] Bonnie weakened back to tropical depression strength about half an hour prior to its landfall just east of Charleston, South Carolina.[3][10][11] Caught in weak steering currents,[12] the depression meandered over South Carolina for over a day before degenerating to a remnant low over the northeastern portion of the state at 12:00\u00a0UTC on May\u00a030.[3][13] The remnant circulation continued to move slowly and erratically as it emerged off the coast on May\u00a031, before accelerating east-northeastwards and reintensifying slightly.[14][15] Amidst light wind shear and high sea surface temperatures (SSTs), organization improved as convection persisted near the center, and Bonnie regenerated into a tropical depression at 00:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a02.[3] The next day, despite worsening conditions, a burst of convection around the center led to Bonnie restrengthening into a tropical storm, simultaneously attaining a new minimum pressure of 1,006\u00a0mbar (1,006\u00a0hPa; 29.7\u00a0inHg).[3][16] Increasing northwesterly shear and cooling SSTs soon became evident as the LLCC became exposed to the west, however Bonnie continued to maintain tropical storm strength.[17] On the afternoon of June\u00a04, Bonnie began to succumb to the unfavorable conditions, and the storm weakened into a tropical depression.[3][18] Early the next day, Bonnie degenerated once more into a post-tropical cyclone as it tracked east-southeastward over the Atlantic Ocean.[3][19] The storm eventually transitioned to an extratropical cyclone on June\u00a07, and eventually dissipated south-southwest of the Azores, just after 18:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a09.[3]"

Water inundated both the Jasper County Sheriff's Office and Detention Center, prompting the relocation of one-third of its inmates. Ridgeland's wastewater treatment plant overflowed, spilling 75,000\u00a0to 100,000\u00a0gallons (280,000\u00a0to 380,000\u00a0liters) of discharge into the nearby Captain Bill Creek. Bonnie is estimated to have caused about $640,000 (2016\u00a0USD) worth of damage in Jasper County alone, mainly in Ridgeland.[3][24] At Charleston International Airport, a sustained wind of 31\u00a0mph (50\u00a0km/h) and a gust to 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h) were observed; these were the highest recorded windspeeds related to the cyclone on land.[23] In Georgia, precipitation reached 7.74\u00a0in (197\u00a0mm) at Oliver. In Bulloch County, several roads were inundated or closed due to high water. Some ponds exceeded their banks.[23] Heavy rainfall, record-breaking in some areas, was observed in much of the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Precipitation peaked at 8.21\u00a0in (209\u00a0mm) at the Billy Mitchell Airport in Hatteras.[25] At that location, 7.09\u00a0in (180\u00a0mm) of rain fell on May\u00a030, breaking the old record set in 1940. Furthermore, a new monthly rainfall record for the month of May was observed\u201412.67\u00a0in (322\u00a0mm) of rain fell during that month.[26] At least 7\u00a0in (180\u00a0mm) of rain fell on Hatteras Island, resulting in the closure of Cape Point Campground and its online reservation system for a week. Several beach ramps were inundated with at least 6\u00a0in (150\u00a0mm) of standing water and some were rendered impassible, however none were closed.[27][28] Tropical Storm Colin would later combine with Bonnie to produce at least 10\u00a0in (250\u00a0mm) of standing water in farmlands in Hyde and Beaufort counties, damaging newly planted crops.[29] Further north, Bonnie dumped 1.65\u00a0in (42\u00a0mm) of rain in New York City.[30] Swells generated by Bonnie created an elevated risk of rip currents along the coastline of the Southeastern United States.[31] Several water rescues were carried out. A 21-year-old man went missing at Carolina Beach on May\u00a028; his body was recovered in New Hanover County, North Carolina, three days later.[32] Further south, the body of a 20-year-old man was recovered in Brevard County, Florida, after he drowned.[33] When Bonnie formed on May\u00a027, it became the first occurrence of two pre-season Atlantic storms since 2012, and only the second occurrence since 1951 (the third occurring in 2020). The first storm, Alex, had formed in January.[34][35]"

The 500 mb height contours on January 18 showed the strong trough over the Great Lakes region extending southward that brought cold air down from the North Pole. MERRA-2 reanalysis detailed the cold air funneling into the Upper Midwest from Canada on January 18, with strong winds out of the northwest. The surface analysis map on January 18 showed a low-level ridge over the Upper Midwest and surface winds blowing out of the northwest. The surface anticyclones on January 18 and 21 both exceeded 1,040\u00a0mbar (104\u00a0kPa) and moved to the southeast, bringing cold air to much of the eastern half of the United States.

This lower humidity is caused by the air compressing and heating up as it moves downward.[3] Anticyclonic storms, as high-pressure systems, usually bring warm, clear conditions in the summer. Occasionally, this can result in heat wave conditions and droughts if the anticyclone remains stationary over a certain region of land.[4] During the winter time, the clear, settled conditions of the anticyclone can lead to frost and fog. This is because the clear skies created by the sinking air of the high-pressure system allow heat to be lost from Earth's surface overnight, leading to rapid air temperature drops that condense into frost or fog.[5] Due to the Coriolis effect, anticyclonic storms involve clockwise flow in the Northern Hemisphere and counterclockwise flow in the Southern Hemisphere."

Typically, the mesocyclone rotates cyclonically (counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere), but on occasion it can rotate anticyclonically, thus yielding a Mesoanticyclone. Mesoanticyclones in the northern hemisphere are more likely to form in an environment where the vertical wind shear vector turns in a counterclockwise manner with height (wind backing). As such, anticyclonic supercells typically move left of the mean tropospheric wind unlike most supercells and are short-lived, so they rarely produce tornadoes.[7]"

Enawo was the strongest tropical cyclone to strike Madagascar since Gafilo in 2004, killing 78 people and causing $400 million in damages.[3] Forming as a moderate tropical storm on 3\u00a0March, Enawo initially drifted and intensified slowly. It strengthened into a tropical cyclone on 5 March and further an intense tropical cyclone on 6 March. Enawo made landfall over Sava Region on 7 March just after reaching peak intensity, and it emerged back into the Indian Ocean as a post-tropical depression late on 9 March, before dissipating two days later. The most severe impacts were seen in the districts of Antalaha and Maroantsetra.[4]"

        "content": "A monsoon trough started to persist west of Diego Garcia in late February 2017 as the Madden\u2013Julian oscillation (MJO) over the Indian Ocean grew more noticeable.[5] On 2 March, a zone of disturbed weather formed within the area, although it was initially difficult to define a clear centre;[6] later, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the improving low-level structure and favourable environmental conditions.[7] Only six hours after the system about 820\u00a0km (510\u00a0mi) north of Mauritius intensifying to a tropical disturbance, M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France upgraded it to a moderate tropical storm at 06:00 UTC on 3 March with the name Enawo from the Mauritius Meteorological Services, because of the recent ASCAT-B data suggesting gale-force winds.[8][9] The JTWC also began to issue tropical cyclone warnings on Enawo.[10] Since the afternoon, Enawo started to significantly slow down with the weakening of the tropical ridge that drove the track southwards. Due to easterly vertical wind shear, the centre was located in the eastern part of deep convection.[11] Enawo developed into a severe tropical storm at around 18:00 UTC on 4 March, displaying an impressive embedded centre pattern associated with extremely cold cloud tops.[12] The JTWC indicated a system equivalent to Category 1 on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale at the same time.[13] M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France upgraded Enawo to a tropical cyclone at 06:00 UTC on 5 March, after it resumed a west to west-southwest track steered by the mid-troposphere ridge south of Madagascar.[14] Enawo formed a ragged eye soon afterward, thanks to favourable conditions of excellent outflow, weaker vertical wind shear, and warm sea surface temperatures;[15] however, the strengthening phase was halted for a half of day owing to a possible eyewall replacement cycle.[16] Enawo started to intensify again and developed a well-defined eye indicated by both of satellite and microwave imageries, prompting M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France upgrading the system to an intense tropical cyclone at 12:00 UTC based on the structural improvements.[17] The JTWC reported that Enawo had become a Category 4-equivalent cyclone at 18:00 UTC, with one-minute maximum sustained winds at 240\u00a0km/h (150\u00a0mph).[18] Early on 7 March, cloud tops cooled again around the eye, despite the fluctuating eye definition. Enawo reached its peak intensity at 06:00 UTC on 7 March, with ten-minute maximum sustained winds at 205\u00a0km/h (125\u00a0mph) and the central pressure at 932 hPa (27.32 inHg).[19] Soon after that, Enawo made landfall over the area between Antalaha and Sambava in Sava Region, Madagascar at around 09:30 UTC (12:30 EAT), becoming the strongest landfall to the country since Gafilo in 2004.[3] The cyclone started to rapidly weaken due to land interaction with a cloud-filled eye and the warming cloud tops;[20] the JTWC also issued a final warning later for the inland movement.[21] After classified as an overland depression early on 8 March and moving further inland, it started to accelerated southwards the next day along the weakening mid-troposphere ridge on Madagascar, with deep convection rather far away from the ill-defined centre.[22] Meanwhile, gale-force winds still maintained over the eastern coast throughout the inland period.[23] Enawo emerged into the Indian Ocean late on 9 March and was considered as a post-tropical depression by M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France because of the asymmetric and shallow core.[24] However, the JTWC started to issue a tropical cyclone warning on Enawo again due to a 2\u00a0\u00b0C (36\u00a0\u00b0F) warm anomaly at 10\u00a0km altitude.[25] Despite a final warning from the JTWC again for winds below gale-force a half of day later, M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France indicated that Ex-Enawo strengthened again during its extratropical transition, according to data from ships.[26][27] The system became fully extratropical soon afterward, before dissipating late on 11 March.[28]"

In the district of Maroantsetra, landslides and strong winds caused widespread infrastructural damage, which also rendered 500\u00a0people homeless. There, a landslide killed one adult and two children, in addition to injuring six others.[33][34] The city of Antalaha was particularly hard hit, where the port became inaccessible and half the population was rendered homeless. Rice fields in Antalaha and Sambava districts were submerged after heavy rain and suffered severe losses. The Lohoko River burst its banks near Farahalana, inundating part of the town.[35] As of 17\u00a0March, 78 deaths have been reported across the country, with 18 other people reported missing.[36][37] Total damages were estimated to be US$400\u00a0million, including $US207 million to the agricultural sector alone.[38]"

Over the next two days, the system gradually drifted in a generally southern track as it gained intensity and prompted the JTWC to issue a TCFA.[3] On 13 February, RSMC La R\u00e9union declared that a Tropical Disturbance had formed in the area and began issuing advisories.[4] Located in a very favorable environment, the depression quickly increased in intensity and both the RSMC and JTWC noted winds of at least 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph) later that day, with the RSMC subsequently naming the storm Dineo. Dineo intensified to a tropical cyclone later on. It reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph (140 km/h) and a low barometric pressure of 955 hPa (mbar); 28.20 inHg on 15 February. Dineo made landfall on the coast of Mozambique, and it started weakening after landfall on the same day. On 17 February after making landfall, the JTWC issued the final advisory on Dineo. Dineo later dissipated after a few hours on the same day.[5][6]"

Mount Mitchell, in North Carolina recorded an all time record low of \u221234\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221237\u00a0\u00b0C)."

In Chicago, Illinois, a record low of \u221227\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221233\u00a0\u00b0C) combined with 25 miles per hour (40\u00a0km/h) winds, to produce a wind chill of \u221260\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221251\u00a0\u00b0C).[2] St. Louis, Missouri saw a low of \u221218\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221228\u00a0\u00b0C), and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania had a low of \u221218\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221228\u00a0\u00b0C), the coldest morning since 1899.[3] In Cincinnati, Ohio, the morning temperature of \u221221\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221229\u00a0\u00b0C) tied for the fourth-lowest minimum temperature in the city's history, outdone by a cold mass the year before and a blizzard in 1977.[4] Cleveland, Ohio fell to \u221218\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221228\u00a0\u00b0C), which was at the time a record low.[5] Memphis, Tennessee recorded a low of \u22124\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221220\u00a0\u00b0C), setting a record low for that day. Virginia's official record low temperature of \u221230\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221234\u00a0\u00b0C) was also set on this day in Pembroke, Virginia.[6] As the cold air mass moved southeastward, it modified only slightly, resulting in frigid air for most of the East Coast of the United States starting on the morning of January 21, 1985. New York City's Central Park recorded a low of \u22122\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221219\u00a0\u00b0C), breaking that date's record.[7] Washington National Airport recorded a low of \u22124\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221220\u00a0\u00b0C) and Washington Dulles Airport a low of \u22126\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221221\u00a0\u00b0C) on the morning of January 21.[8] Farther south, Roanoke, Virginia, set a record low of \u221211\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221224\u00a0\u00b0C). Nashville, Tennessee dropped to \u221217\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221227\u00a0\u00b0C), and Knoxville, Tennessee recorded a record low of \u221224\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221231\u00a0\u00b0C).[1]   All-time low temperature records were also set well into interior sections of the deep South, such as in Charlotte, North Carolina, where temperatures were recorded as low as \u22125\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221221\u00a0\u00b0C);[1] Macon, Georgia, with a record low of \u22126\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221221\u00a0\u00b0C);[1] and Jacksonville, Florida with a record low of 7\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221214\u00a0\u00b0C).[1] Gainesville, Florida, with a low temperature of 10\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221212\u00a0\u00b0C)[9] was its coldest temperature since the Great Blizzard of 1899 (when it had reached a low of 6\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221214\u00a0\u00b0C)). Atlanta, Georgia saw a low of \u22128\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221222\u00a0\u00b0C), setting a record for the month of January as well as for the 20th century, and was only one degree shy of its all-time record (since 1878) set in February 1899.[10] Miami, Florida, whose average low in late January is 61\u00a0\u00b0F (16\u00a0\u00b0C), recorded a record low of 37\u00a0\u00b0F (3\u00a0\u00b0C) on January 21, 1985, and 34\u00a0\u00b0F (1\u00a0\u00b0C) on January 22, 1985.

Disaster Volunteer of Hiroshima City decided to discontinue activities on 24 August.[25] Volunteers continued later, but stopped temporarily on 4 September because of bad weather.[26] An estimated 2,000[27]\u20133,600[28] rescuers consisting of firefighters, police and members of the Self-Defense Force took part in searching and clearing debris despite rain and dangerous conditions that hampered and sometimes halted their efforts. There was also ongoing risk for a secondary disaster, and more rain was forecast for the area.[29][b] Consequently, residents on Asakita and Asaminami were told to evacuate.[30] Because schools were being used as shelters, several had to postpone the start dates.[31] All elementary school shelters were closed 1 November.[32] Evacuation advisories were partially lifted for Asaminami-ku on Sunday, 31 August, allowing about 14,400 persons (around 5700 households) to return to their homes.[33] Number of persons and households in shelters, by date: Prime Minister Shinzo Abe planned to visit the disaster area on the morning of 24 August, but bad weather postponed his visit by one day.[55] The Emperor and Empress visited Hiroshima 3 December, and observed damage and met survivors, SDF personnel, firefighters, police and volunteers.[56] 5 September Cabinet of Japan meeting estimated that 900 million yen is needed for Hiroshima's recovery. (The valuation of the damage caused by the landslide is incomplete.)[57] Hiroshima prefectural and municipal governments decided to provide 157 public housing units, for evacuees, free of charge. Officials were forced to hold a lottery after 284 households applied.  Local governments are also preparing to build temporary housing for those who lost their homes.[58] The procedures will begin on 28 August, which is also the earliest day tenants can move in.[59] According to the city, municipal housing is provided rent-free for up to a maximum six-month stay, as a general rule.[60] On 2 September, officials issued a new evacuation advisory to parts of Asaminami-ku, fearing that a nearby slope might collapse and cause more damage. This affected around 2,520 persons(about 980 households).[61] Voluntarily evacuation order was issued 24 September to districts of Asakita and Asaminami-ku because Typhoon 16.[62]\nAt next day, part of it was cancelled.[63] On 1 October and further 7 October and 17th, evacuation advisories were cancelled for several parts of area.[64][65][66] On 20 November, last evacuation advisory was cancelled and 42 people (16 households) were able to return to their homes.[67] The last shelter was closed 25 December.[68]"

The JTWC reported that peak intensity was 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h) (1-min winds), PAGASA reported that peak intensity was 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) (10-min winds), and the JMA reported that peak intensity was 40\u00a0mph (65\u00a0km.h) (10-min winds).[3][4][5] Twelve hours later, the JMA downgraded the tropical storm to a depression.[5] Tropical Storm Wendy continued to move towards the Chinese coast for the next day.[2][4] As it was nearing land, a Central Dense Overcast, an area of very strong thunderstorms, formed and the tropical storm made landfall about 140 miles (230\u00a0km) east-northeast of Hong Kong,[2] and promptly weakened into a tropical depression.[4] The tropical depression dissipated early on September 4 while over the mountains of China.[4][5]"

Blowing snow meant that roads could not be cleared, and hundreds of automobile accidents were caused by the blizzard conditions.[3] Tanks had to be used to remove stranded vehicles on some highways.

The Midwestern United States and the Canadian Prairies were hit the hardest. Only the Southwestern United States and California largely escaped its effects. The cold wave was related to a highly negative North Atlantic Oscillation event during that winter driving cold Arctic air into most of North America.[1] February 1936 was the coldest February on record in the contiguous U.S., narrowly eclipsing February 1899.[2] It also was the coldest month ever in Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota. The meteorological winter (December through February) of 1935/36 was the coldest on record for Iowa,[3] Minnesota,[4] North Dakota,[5] and South Dakota.[6] This winter was much colder than the immediately preceding winters. 1930 through 1934 had each seen exceptionally mild winters in substantial parts of the United States: 1930/31 in the northern Great Plains; 1931/32 in the mid- and south-Atlantic states, the eastern north central states, and the eastern south central states; 1932/33 in New England, and 1933/34 in the Mountain and Pacific states.[7] In the northern plains, the Februaries of 1925, 1926, 1927, 1930, 1931, and 1935 are among the 25 warmest Februaries between 1895 and 2017, although 1929 had the third-coldest February of all-time.[8] Despite a mild March over most areas east of the Rocky Mountains, the six months from October 1935 to March 1936 were the fifth-coldest on record over the contiguous U.S.[9]"

Health care was affected by a shortage of serum. Many remote South Dakota towns did not have outside contact for several weeks,[30] At the peak of the cold wave, only two days of supplies were in inventory at many stores in the plains states.[31] As far south as Richmond, Virginia, rivers were completely ice-bound.[24] Subsequent thaws accompanied by heavy rain over the southern states led to flooding.[29] In Canada away from the Atlantic Ocean, temperatures averaged as much as 30\u00a0\u00b0F (17\u00a0\u00b0C) below normal.[32] At the Saskatoon airport, the temperature did not rise above 0\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221217.8\u00a0\u00b0C) from February 2 through February 20.[33] A temperature of \u221263\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221252.8\u00a0\u00b0C) was reached in Sceptre, Saskatchewan.[31]"

The tropical depression intensified into Tropical Storm Brendan in July\u00a021 when the depression approached Philippines. Brendan quickly intensified to reach the first peak intensity of 115\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph) when it made landfall in Luzon, Philippines.[nb 1] After emerging in Luzon Strait as a strong tropical storm and continued to track west-northwestward, Brendan reached the secondary peak intensity of 105\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph) in July\u00a023, before making landfall on Guangdong, China, 30 kilometres (19\u00a0mi) southwest of Macau in July\u00a024. After making landfall, Brendan weakened and dissipated later that day. Across the Philippines, heavy rain associated with Brendan combined with volcanic debris from Mount Pinatubo raised mudflows up to 5 metres (16\u00a0ft) high around the vicinity of volcano. Around 10,000 people were forced to evacuate and approximately 1400 houses were destroyed by the rising mudflow. Four deaths are recorded in the country. In Hong Kong, Brendan caused 17 injuries. These people were hit by glass pieces and objects that were blown away by the storm. Overall damages across Hong Kong was estimated to be HK$0.94 million, mostly from public utilities. In Macau, severe flooding are reported in low-lying areas. Two fishermen from China reported missing southwest of Macau after the storm capsized their boats. In Guangdong, the storm killed two people and injured four others. 64 houses were destroyed and 1,019 others were damaged. More than 78,000 hectares (190,000 acres) of farmland were affected. Total losses were estimated to be \u00a51.32\u00a0billion (US$247\u00a0million).[nb 2] In Guangxi, the storm killed 28 people and injured 189 others.

The name Erwin was chosen by the Free University of Berlin, while the storm was named Gudrun by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute and was the name used in Sweden. Sustained wind speeds of 126\u00a0km/h (78\u00a0mph) with wind gusts of 165\u00a0km/h (103\u00a0mph) were measured in Hanstholm, Denmark \u2013 the same strength as a Category 1 hurricane. The storm caused significant financial damage in Sweden, where the forest industry suffered greatly from damaged trees, as more than 75\u00a0million cubic metres (2.6\u00d710^9\u00a0cu\u00a0ft) of trees were blown down in southern Sweden. This resulted in Sweden at the time having the world's largest surplus of lumber. About 415,000 homes lost power in Sweden and several thousand of these were without power for many days and even weeks in some cases, as about 10,000 homes were still without power after three weeks.[3] The death toll in Sweden was 7[4] victims, making it one of the biggest environmental disasters in Swedish history, while four were killed in Denmark and one in Estonia."

        "content": "A cold wave (known in some regions as a cold snap, cold spell or Arctic Snap) is a weather phenomenon that is distinguished by a cooling of the air. Specifically, as used by the U.S. National Weather Service, a cold wave is a rapid fall in temperature within a 24-hour period requiring substantially increased protection to agriculture, industry, commerce, and social activities. The precise criteria for a cold wave are the rate at which the temperature falls, and the minimum to which it falls. This minimum temperature is dependent on the geographical region and time of year.[1] In the United States, a cold spell is defined as the national average high temperature dropping below 20\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22127\u00a0\u00b0C).[2] A cold wave of sufficient magnitude and duration may be classified as a cold air outbreak (CAO).[3][4]"

        "header": "Effects",
        "content": "A cold wave can cause death and injury to livestock and wildlife. Exposure to cold mandates greater caloric intake for all animals, including humans, and if a cold wave is accompanied by heavy and persistent snow, grazing animals may be unable to reach needed food and die of hypothermia or starvation. They often necessitate the purchase of foodstuffs to feed livestock at considerable cost to farmers. Cold spells are associated with increased mortality rates in populations around the world.[5] Both cold waves and heat waves cause deaths, though different groups of people may be susceptible to different weather events.[6] More temperature-attributable deaths occur during a cold wave than in a heat wave,[7][8] though the mortality rate is higher in undeveloped regions of the world.  Extreme winter cold often causes poorly insulated water pipelines and mains to freeze. Even some poorly protected indoor plumbing ruptures as water expands within them, causing much damage to property and costly insurance claims. Demand for electrical power and fuels rises dramatically during such times, even though the generation of electrical power may fail due to the freezing of water necessary for the generation of hydroelectricity. Some metals may become brittle at low temperatures. Motor vehicles may fail when antifreeze fails or motor oil gels, producing a failure of the transportation system. Fires become even more of a hazard during extreme cold. Water mains may break and water supplies may become unreliable, making firefighting more difficult. The air during a cold wave is typically denser and thus contains more oxygen, so when air that a fire draws in becomes unusually cold it is likely to cause a more intense fire.[citation needed] However, snow may stop spreading of fires, especially wildfires. Winter cold waves that are not considered cold in some areas, but cause temperatures significantly below average for an area, are also destructive. Areas with subtropical climates may recognize a cold wave at higher temperatures than other, colder areas of the globe. The cold wave may be recognized at barely freezing temperatures, as these are still unusually cold for the region, and plant and animal life will be less tolerant of such cold. The same winter temperatures that one associates with the norm for Colorado, Ohio, or Bavaria are catastrophic to crops in places like Florida, California, or parts of South America that grow fruit and vegetables in winter. Cold waves that bring unexpected freezes and frosts during the growing season in mid-latitude zones can kill plants during the early and most vulnerable stages of growth, resulting in crop failure as plants are killed before they can be harvested economically. Such cold waves have caused famines. At times as deadly to plants as drought, cold waves can leave land in danger of later brush and forest fires that consume dead biomass. One extreme was the so-called Year Without a Summer of 1816, one of several years during the 1810s in which numerous crops failed during freakish summer cold snaps after volcanic eruptions that reduced incoming sunlight. Recent research suggests a possible link between cold waves in North America and extratropical cyclogenesis over the East Atlantic.[9] These may be connected by large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns. [10] Examples include Rossby wave propagation from the North Pacific or an upper-level anticyclone west of Greenland.[11] In Europe, the advection of cold air masses from the northeast emerges as a potential precursor signal for the majority of cold waves, significantly affecting the energy, health, and agricultural sectors of the continent.[12]"

        "header": "Countermeasures",
        "content": "In some places, such as Siberia, extreme cold requires that fuel-powered machinery intended to be used occasionally must be run continually. Internal plumbing can be wrapped, and persons can often run water continuously through pipes. Energy conservation, difficult as it is in a cold wave, may require such measures as collecting people (especially the poor and elderly) in communal shelters. Even the homeless may be arrested and taken to shelters, only to be released when the hazard abates.[13] Hospitals can prepare for the admission of victims of frostbite and hypothermia; schools and other public buildings can be converted into shelters. People can stock up on food, water, and other necessities before a cold wave. Some may even choose to migrate to places of milder climates, at least during the winter. Suitable stocks of forage can be secured before cold waves for livestock, and livestock in vulnerable areas might be shipped from affected areas or even slaughtered. Smudge pots can bring smoke that prevents hard freezes on a farm or grove. Vulnerable crops may be sprayed with water that will paradoxically protect the plants by freezing and absorbing the cold from surrounding air. Most people can dress appropriately and can layer their clothing should they need to go outside or should their heating fail. They can also stock candles, matches, flashlights, and portable fuel for cooking and wood for fireplaces or wood stoves, as necessary. However, caution should be taken as the use of charcoal fires for cooking or heating within an enclosed dwelling is extremely dangerous due to carbon monoxide poisoning. Adults must remain aware of the exposure that children and the elderly have to cold."

Following an earlier cold wave in the winter, the period of below-average temperatures contributed to an already unusually cold winter for the Eastern U.S. Several places broke their records for their coldest February on record, while some areas came very close. The cause of the cold wave was due to the polar vortex advancing southward into the eastern parts of the U.S, and even making it as far south as the Southeast, where large snow falls are rare. By the beginning of March, although the pattern did continue for the first week, it abated and retreated near the official end of the winter. In addition to the extremely cold weather, multiple winter storms affected nearly the entire United States, especially in the snow-weary Northeast, which had already seen nearly 3 feet (0.91\u00a0m) of snow in the latter part of January; this was added to by roughly 3\u20134 feet (0.91\u20131.22\u00a0m) more snow, leading to Boston having its highest seasonal snowfall on record."

        "content": "Like most American cold waves, this was caused by the southward movement of the polar vortex into the United States due to changes in the  jet stream in early February 2015. However, unlike most which last for a few days, this one remained for much of the entire month. This was partly due to the Ridiculously Resilient Ridge, which persisted over parts of Alaska for much of the month, essentially keeping the jet stream pattern \"locked\" for several weeks. This allowed for bitterly cold air masses to migrate southward into the eastern part of the country, leading to well-below average temperatures.[5]"

However, records don't go back as far as they do in Central Park.[16] The average temperature in Buffalo, New York, set a record in February for its all-time coldest month with an average temperature of 10.9\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221211.7\u00a0\u00b0C). breaking the prior record set in 1934 of 11.6\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221211.3\u00a0\u00b0C). Before that, the previous coldest February was in 1875 with an average temperature of 13.4\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221210.3\u00a0\u00b0C). It was also the second time in history that the entire month of February was below freezing.[17] Other cities that broke cold weather records for February included Cleveland, at 14.3\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22129.8\u00a0\u00b0C), while Chicago tied its February 1875 record at 14.6\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22129.7\u00a0\u00b0C).[18] Rochester, New York, also set a record for coldest month overall.[19] In February 2015, nine states (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Vermont) had their second coldest February.[20] New York and Vermont had its coldest first quarter on record in 2015.[21] New Jersey also had one of the coldest February's in 2015, and the coldest month since January 1994. During the cold wave, several intense bursts of Arctic air intruded down the Eastern United States. February 15 became the coldest day in Buffalo in over two decades, with a high of 2\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221217\u00a0\u00b0C) at 12:20 a.m. and a low of \u221210\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221223\u00a0\u00b0C), leading to a mean temperature of \u22124\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221220\u00a0\u00b0C). On February 16, Erie, Pennsylvania tied their all time record low of \u221218\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221228\u00a0\u00b0C). Flint, Michigan set a daily record low and saw the coldest temperature of \u221221\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221229\u00a0\u00b0C).[22] On February 18, Mount LeConte hit a record low of \u221223\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221231\u00a0\u00b0C), although unofficial records dictate a colder temperature in 1985.[23] An arctic blast on February 20 was even more intense. Lynchburg, Virginia set an all time record low of \u221211\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221224\u00a0\u00b0C), Flint, Michigan tied a record low of \u221225\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221232\u00a0\u00b0C), and Jamestown, New York set an all time record low of \u221231\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221235\u00a0\u00b0C). Several cities in Ohio, such as Toledo, Youngstown and Cleveland set or tie monthly record lows. A temperature of \u221231\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221235\u00a0\u00b0C) in Kentucky tied the states monthly record low. Even Key West, Florida reached 49\u00a0\u00b0F (9\u00a0\u00b0C), setting a daily record low. Crestview, further north in the state, reached 19\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22127\u00a0\u00b0C).[24] Parts of Michigan, at \u221239\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221239\u00a0\u00b0C), were only 5\u00b0F (3\u00b0C) warmer then the North Pole.[1] In the second cold snap, a man was found dead in Coney Island.[25] In addition, ice on the Hudson River forced several Circle Line boat tours to be cancelled.[26]"

        "content": "Most of the northern half of the United States and most of Canada saw several winter storms impact them; each of them had somewhat unique traits. At the start of the month, a major snowstorm was moving across the country, having previously brought blizzard conditions to the Midwest, especially in Chicago, Illinois, where more than a foot of snow was recorded. This storm continued to dump large amounts of snow as it progressed into the Northeast and New England, before finally exiting offshore.[34] Less than a week later, another winter storm struck New England, with up to nearly 2 feet (24\u00a0in) of snow recorded in Boston, Massachusetts over a period of two days.[35] This was the beginning of a three-week streak of winter storms that would progress into the Northeast (with the expectation of one system which went further south).[citation needed] These winter storms caused $1 billion in losses to Massachusetts alone. The 110 inch season was Boston's highest on record. The snowmelt pile in the Seaport district didn't finish melting until July 14.[36][37] Around the middle of the month, near Valentine's Day, a powerful blizzard struck the Northeast again, bringing strong winds and more heavy snowfall. After, as the storm exited, it ushered in the coldest air to impact the Northeast in decades, with temperatures dipping as far as 30\u201340\u00a0\u00b0F (17\u201322\u00a0\u00b0C) below average. Several places broke record lows for February, and temperatures even dipped below 0\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221218\u00a0\u00b0C) in a good part of the Northeast.[38][39] Several more winter storms followed afterward, but one of the more notable ones was the one that occurred from February 25\u201326. This particular storm took an unusual track into the Southeastern United States as the jet stream along with the polar vortex pushed even further southward, resulting in heavy snowfall in states that rarely see it at all, this included Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and the Carolinas. Up to 18 inches (46\u00a0cm) fell in the hardest hit areas, which was in North Carolina and Virginia.[40] Due to the cold wave, February 2015 saw only two tornadoes.[41] In addition, Great Lakes ice extent reached its 3rd highest on record.[42]"

One migrant died of cold, and many migrants on islands in the Aegean Sea were moved into heated tents as the area was covered in snow.[10] The authorities opened three Athens Metro tube stations to homeless people to help protect them from the cold.[17] Road and public transport in the country were also disrupted. On 10 January, it was announced that in Thessaloniki in the province of Macedonia only 130 buses out of 480\u2013500 operated by Thessaloniki Urban Transport Organisation were in operational condition.[18] The islands of Euboea, Skopelos and Alonnisos declared a state of emergency after serious power failures and collapse of traffic due to snowfall.[19] Mytilene on the island of Lesbos recorded a low of \u22125.7\u00a0\u00b0C (21.7\u00a0\u00b0F) on 7 January,[20] a temperature expected to occur on average once in 300\u00a0years in current climatic conditions.[21] January 2017 overall mean monthly temperature was 4.7\u00a0\u00b0C (8.5\u00a0\u00b0F) below average in Mytilene and Bucharest, and many weather stations reported monthly means more than 3\u00a0\u00b0C (5.4\u00a0\u00b0F) below average.[22] Deaths were also reported in Russia and Ukraine. Temperatures in some parts of European Russia fell to below \u221240\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221240\u00a0\u00b0F), setting records across the region.[10] About 100,000 residents of settlements in Moscow Oblast such as Lyubertsy, Lytkarino, Dzerzhinsky and Kotelniki lost electricity due to extremely harsh temperatures.[23] On 11 January, the cold wave reached Albania, with temperatures reaching \u221222\u00a0\u00b0C (\u22128\u00a0\u00b0F) and supplies being flown in by army helicopters, mainly in the city of Gjirokast\u00ebr and the nation's capital Tirana.[24] On 16 January, it was reported that the electricity prices in Europe were at their highest since 2008 as a result of power outages and increased demand. Romanian Energy Minister, Toma Petcu, suggested that, if coal consumption remained high, reserves held by the country's two major producers would only last for four days.[25]"

(Due to sparse observations, the system may have developed prior to this time, but was not detected.) The cyclone moved west-northwestward and quickly strengthened, becoming a hurricane late on June 16. It reached its peak intensity of 80 miles per hour (129\u00a0km/h) early on June 17. Around 06:00 UTC on June 17, the hurricane made landfall southwest of Bay City, Texas, over the eastern end of East Matagorda Bay. Turning to the northwest after landfall, it quickly degenerated into a tropical storm, gradually turning northward over time. By 06:00 UTC on June 18, it weakened into a tropical depression, and just 12 hours later it lost its identity near Waco, Texas.[2] In Texas, the cyclone produced heavy rain, peaking at 6.4 inches (163\u00a0mm) over a 16-hour period at Galveston. The highest measured winds reached 54\u00a0mph (87\u00a0km/h) in the city.[3] Along the coast of Texas, the lowest measured pressure was 29.69 inches of mercury (1,005\u00a0mb) at Corpus Christi, about 120 miles (193\u00a0km) southwest of the landfall location.[4] The Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project estimated that the minimum central pressure in the storm was likely close to 985 millibars (29.09\u00a0inHg) at the time of landfall.[5] Operationally, the U.S. Signal Corps\u2014predecessor to the U.S. Weather Bureau (now the National Weather Service)\u2014did not classify the system as an area of low pressure, and as such, it did not appear in the June 1888 track map of cyclones in the Monthly Weather Review, the official publication of the Signal Corps.[6] However, as early as June 17 the New York Times noted that a moderate storm was apparently approaching Texas.[7]"

It moved north-northwest, attaining its peak intensity of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) by 00:00 UTC on July 5. About 16 hours later, the moderate tropical storm made landfall at that intensity just east of Bay City\u2014impacting the same region as the previous storm. The cyclone turned north and north-northeast after striking land, slowly weakening as it did so. By 12:00 UTC on July 6, the cyclone was last positioned over northwestern Cherokee County, Texas.[2] Climate researcher Michael Chenoweth proposed the removal of this storm from HURDAT, finding \"No evidence in land-based reports or from ships\".[8] In Texas, the storm produced peak winds of 42\u00a0mph (68\u00a0km/h) in Galveston, and the lowest measured pressure was 29.78 inches of mercury (1,008\u00a0mb) in the city.[9] Like the preceding storm, the cyclone produced heavy rain over parts of Texas, especially in the Palestine area in Anderson County. In this area, a shower of pebbles, each ranging from 1\u20448\u20131\u20444 inch (0.32\u20130.64\u00a0cm) in diameter and irregularly shaped, was reported to have occurred,[10] possibly due to a tornado or waterspout that touched down at an unknown distance from Palestine.[11]"

Moving west-northwestward, the storm intensified into a hurricane about 24\u00a0hours later. It made landfall on Cat Island in The Bahamas on August\u00a016 and then Andros Island on August\u00a016. As it approached southeast Florida, the storm strengthened into the equivalence of a major hurricane\u2014Category 3 on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale\u2014and peaked with winds of 125\u00a0mph (205\u00a0km/h) by 12:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a016. Around 19:00\u00a0UTC, it made landfall just north of present-day Miami Beach at peak intensity. The cyclone weakened over land and emerged into the Gulf of Mexico near Cayo Costa on August\u00a017 as a Category\u00a01 hurricane. However, the hurricane soon re-intensified as it turned westward and attained a second peak intensity of 110\u00a0mph (175\u00a0km/h) early on August\u00a018. While nearing the Gulf Coast, the storm curved northwestward and then north-northwestward. Around 16:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a019, the cyclone made landfall south of Cocodrie, as a strong Category\u00a02 hurricane. Turning northward after moving inland, the hurricane weakened to a strong tropical storm by 18:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a020, near Greenville, Mississippi, before curving to the northeast. Little more than a day later, it passed over southern New England, becoming extratropical by 12:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a022. The extratropical remnants crossed Atlantic Canada before dissipating over the Labrador Sea on August\u00a024.[2] In the Bahamas, the hurricane damaged fruit trees, crops, and fences, especially on the Abaco Islands, Harbour Island, and New Providence.[12] Despite South Florida at the time being sparsely-populated, widespread damage occurred as far north as Sebastian.[13] The highest wind reported in South Florida was 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) at Jupiter,[14] and the heaviest rainfall was 2.02\u00a0in (51\u00a0mm) at that location.[15] Farther north, winds at Sebastian Inlet were estimated at 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h), downing trees and telegraph poles, beaching many small boats, and causing local fruit groves \"several thousand dollars\" in damage.[13][16] Additionally, the hurricane reportedly produced a storm surge of 14 feet (4.3\u00a0m) \"on the beaches near Miami.\"[13] In the Big Bend region of Florida, several yachts to capsized at Cedar Key. Winds in Pensacola peaked at 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h), badly damaging local property.[16] Slightly lesser winds in Mobile, Alabama,[15] prostrated trees and fences, and deroofed a few homes.[17] Flooding from the storm surge inundated the waterfront to a depth of 3\u00a0ft (0.91\u00a0m) and areas as far as two to three blocks inland from the Mobile River.[16][17] Along the Mississippi River Delta, the storm produced severe flooding.[13] Rainfall in New Orleans totaled 7.9\u00a0in (201\u00a0mm) over a 12-hour period, and winds in the city reached an estimated 90\u00a0mph (145\u00a0km/h),[15] unroofing many buildings, felling numerous trees, and blowing down fences. In many areas, strong winds downed at least one-third of the timber, and damage to rice, sugarcane, corn, and cotton crops was significant.[16][17] The storm produced heavy rainfall and high winds along much of its path across the Mississippi Valley, the Mid-Atlantic states, and the Northeastern United States.[15]"

The storm intensified further, reaching Category\u00a02 intensity prior to striking the Turks and Caicos Islands around 18:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a02. About 24\u00a0hours later, the cyclone peaked as a Category\u00a03 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 125\u00a0mph (205\u00a0km/h). On September\u00a04, the storm made landfall along the coast of modern-day Villa Clara Province. Weakening to a Category\u00a01 hurricane by early on the following day, the system turned southwestward over Cuba and remained over land until emerging into the Yucat\u00e1n Channel several hours later. The hurricane then crossed the channel and made landfall near the northeastern tip of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula on September\u00a06. After weakening to a tropical storm, it briefly re-strengthened into a Category 2 hurricane while moving southwestward in the Bay of Campeche. Thereafter, the storm weakened back to a Category\u00a01 prior to its landfall near Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, early on September\u00a08 and soon dissipated.[2] Although the storm remained well north of Puerto Rico, heavy rainfall caused flooding that killed more than 100\u00a0people, 30\u00a0of them in Ponce after the Portugu\u00e9s River overflowed. The main bridge in Ponce collapsed, while crops and cattle suffered major impacts. Due to the effects in Puerto Rico, the storm was compared to Hurricane Donna in 1960.[19] On the Turks and Caicos Islands, almost every dwelling experienced some degree of damage, while the hurricane flattened over 250\u00a0homes owned by peasants. More than 400,000\u00a0bushels of salt were ruined. A total of 21\u00a0people died on the Turks and Caicos Islands. Meteorologist Ivan Ray Tannehill stated in 1938 that \"Whole towns along coast of Cuba swept out of existence by gigantic waves.\" generated by this storm. Extreme damage to tobacco plantations, farms, homes,[20] and buildings occurred in the four westernmost provinces, including in major cities.[18] The Vuelta Abajo region alone reported the destruction of virtually all tobacco crops and more than 3,000\u00a0homes, leaving about 10,000\u00a0people homeless.[21] In Havana, few public buildings escaped damage and massive trees felled, with some being blown several blocks away, while downed street lamps left most of the city dark. Waves capsized many barges and left the northern sections of Havana inundated and only accessible via boats.[22] Damage in Cuba exceeded $1\u00a0million,[20] while approximately 800\u00a0people died on the island. In Mexico, the storm produced heavy rainfall in the vicinity of Veracruz. Three vessels were beached, while a bark and schooner collided.[18] Overall, the hurricane caused 921\u00a0fatalities.[23]"

In less than six hours after landfall, the cyclone traversed the Florida peninsula and emerged into the Atlantic near Jacksonville, albeit as a much weaker storm. Continuing to weaken after reaching the Atlantic, the system fell to tropical storm intensity prior to making another landfall near present-day Oak Island, North Carolina. The storm re-emerged into the Atlantic east of Elizabeth City early on October\u00a012 and continued northeastward until curving east-northeastward near the eastern tip of Long Island, New York. Several hours later, the system was last noted near the Gulf of Maine.[2] Cedar Key, Florida, observed sustained wind speeds as high as 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h). Tides there reportedly rose by 9\u00a0ft (2.7\u00a0m) in 30\u00a0minutes, flooding low-lying streets and forcing many people to evacuate their homes. Damage on Cedar Key was estimated at $5,000,[18] while nine people drowned.[13] Although downtown Jacksonville only reported sustained winds of 38\u00a0mph (61\u00a0km/h), the storm destroyed the Beach House Hotel on nearby Fort George Island.[25] Several locations in North Florida and South Georgia reported rainfall amounts up to 2\u00a0in (51\u00a0mm).[26] Sustained winds up to 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) in Savannah, Georgia,[18] caused the streets to be littered with tree branches and downed some electrical wires.[26] In North Carolina, the storm produced 5-minute sustained winds of 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h) at Wilmington.[27] Farther north, at least one location in New England reported tropical storm-force winds \u2013 52\u00a0mph (84\u00a0km/h) on Block Island, Rhode Island.[18]"

        "content": " The 1898 Atlantic hurricane season marked the beginning of the Weather Bureau operating a network of observation posts across the Caribbean Sea to track tropical cyclones, established primarily due to the onset of the Spanish\u2013American War. A total of eleven tropical storms formed, five of which intensified into a hurricane, according to HURDAT, the National Hurricane Center's official database. Further, one cyclone strengthened into a major hurricane.[nb 1] However, in the absence of modern satellite and other remote-sensing technologies, only storms that affected populated land areas or encountered ships at sea were recorded, so the actual total could be higher. An undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 and zero to four per year between 1886 and 1910 has been estimated.[2] The first system was initially observed on August\u00a02 near West End in the Bahamas, while the eleventh and final storm dissipated on November\u00a04 over the Mexican state of Veracruz. Originally, only nine storms were recognized during the 1898\u00a0season, until reanalysis by meteorologists Jos\u00e9 Fern\u00e1ndez-Partag\u00e1s and Henry F. Diaz in 1996 led to the inclusion of the third and tenth systems. The Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project implemented few significant changes while reviewing the season in 2011, declining to add or remove storms from HURDAT. However, a study by climate researcher Michael Chenoweth, published in 2014, lists twelve tropical cyclones, proposing the removal of both systems first documented by Fern\u00e1ndez-Partag\u00e1s and Diaz and the eighth storm, as well as the addition of four new storms. However, Chenoweth's reanalysis has yet to be added to HURDAT. The most intense tropical cyclone of the season, the seventh system, peaked as a Category\u00a04 hurricane on the present-day Saffir\u2013Simpson scale with maximum sustained winds of 130\u00a0mph (215\u00a0km/h). On October\u00a02, the hurricane struck Georgia, causing 179\u00a0fatalities in the state and about $1.5\u00a0million (1898\u00a0USD) in damage there and in Florida combined.[nb 2] Another devastating storm was the fourth cyclone, which left at least 283\u00a0deaths, including 200\u00a0or more on Saint Vincent, and approximately $2.5\u00a0million in property damage alone on Barbados. In August, the first system caused some damage in the Tampa area and the Florida Panhandle, while 16\u00a0people were killed after vessels capsized in the Gulf of Mexico. Additionally, flooding in Cuba's defunct Santa Clara Province as a result of the ninth storm left eight people dead due to drowning. Several other systems impacted land, but generally to a minor extent. Overall, the tropical cyclones of the 1898\u00a0Atlantic hurricane season caused at least 486\u00a0deaths and more than $4.4\u00a0million in damage."

        "content": "The Atlantic hurricane database (HURDAT) officially recognizes that eleven tropical cyclones formed during the 1898\u00a0season, five of which strengthened into a hurricane, with one of those intensifying into a major hurricane.[3] The Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project did not add or remove any storms from the 1996 reanalysis of the season by meteorologists Jos\u00e9 Fern\u00e1ndez-Partag\u00e1s and Henry F. Diaz.[3][4] However, a more recent reanalysis by climate researcher Michael Chenoweth, published in 2014, adds four storms and removes three others\u2014the third, eighth, and tenth systems\u2014for a net gain of one cyclone, although these proposed changes have yet to be approved for inclusion to HURDAT.[5] The track for the first observed storm begins near Grand Bahama in the Bahamas on August\u00a02. Moving west-northwestward to northwestward, the cyclone struck Florida twice before dissipating over Alabama on the following day. After four weeks of no activity, another system was detected on August\u00a030 off the east coast of Florida. Striking South Carolina, the storm crossed into Georgia before also dissipating over Alabama on September\u00a01. September became the most active month of the season, with six known systems developing. This included the seventh storm of the season, the strongest in the Atlantic in 1898, peaking as a Category\u00a04 hurricane with winds of 130\u00a0mph (215\u00a0km/h) and a barometric pressure of 938\u00a0mbar (27.7\u00a0inHg).[3] The storm also remains the most recent to make landfall in Georgia at major hurricane intensity.[6] Three additional systems, all tropical storms, formed in October, with the third dissipating over Mexico by November\u00a04.[3] Overall, the cyclones of the 1898\u00a0season caused more than $4.4\u00a0million in damage and 486\u2013637\u00a0deaths.[7] In April\u00a01898, the United States declared war on Spain, marking the beginning of the Spanish\u2013American War, after the USS Maine capsized in Havana Harbor on February\u00a015. Due to the increased presence of American vessels in the Caribbean Sea as a result of the war, Weather Bureau head Willis L. Moore convinced President William McKinley to authorize the establishment of weather observation posts throughout the region.[8] Following approval from President McKinley and Congress, the Weather Bureau quickly constructed five sites, with a central location at Kingston, Jamaica, and the others at Santiago de Cuba, Cuba; Willemstad, Cura\u00e7ao; Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic; and Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago.[9] The season's activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 113. ACE is a metric used to express the energy used by a tropical cyclone during its lifetime. Therefore, a storm with a longer duration will have higher values of ACE. It is only calculated at six-hour increments in which specific tropical and subtropical systems are either at or above sustained wind speeds of 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h), which is the threshold for tropical storm intensity. Thus, tropical depressions are not included here.[1]"

The system briefly weakened to a tropical depression on August\u00a02, before re-strengthening into a tropical storm and emerging into the Gulf of Mexico near Tarpon Springs. Later that day, the cyclone intensified quickly, becoming a Category\u00a01 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale at 23:00\u00a0UTC. Simultaneously, the hurricane made a second Florida landfall on St. George Island with winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h),[3] an intensity estimated mainly based on the severity of damage in the area.[10] After moving inland, it rapidly weakened and dissipated over southwestern Alabama late on August\u00a03.[3] During its first landfall, the storm churned up surf on the Lake Worth Lagoon, and generated strong winds that felled signage, fencing, and trees. At West Palm Beach winds unofficially \"blew with hurricane velocity\".[11] About 24\u00a0hours of heavy rainfall was observed in the Tampa area, which the Morning Tribune noted caused \"great damage ... in many places.\" In the Florida Panhandle, considerable impact was inflicted to crops, turpentine farms, and property. Offshore, three barges, four tugboats, and many sailing crafts sank. Among the capsized vessels was the tugboat Nimrod, with 12\u00a0people aboard, all of whom drowned.[10] Four additional deaths occurred offshore, three after the Keyser wrecked and another one after the Herndon foundered.[12] Climate researcher Michael Chenoweth's reanalysis, published in 2014, suggests that the storm did not become a tropical storm until reaching the Gulf of Mexico, but did not propose any other significant changes.[5]"

After reaching a point about 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km) northeast of Cape Canaveral on August\u00a030, the Weather Bureau reported that the disturbance had characteristics of a tropical cyclone.[10] Moving northwestward, the storm soon strengthened into a hurricane and peaked with winds of 85\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h), based on Savannah, Georgia, recording a barometric pressure of 990\u00a0mbar (29\u00a0inHg).[13] Around 07:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a031, the hurricane made landfall at the south end of Hilton Head Island, South Carolina. The cyclone weakened to a tropical storm about five hours later and then curved westward. Late on September\u00a01, the storm weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated over Alabama.[3] Severe damage occurred near the storm's point of landfall, with sustained winds of 84\u00a0mph (135\u00a0km/h) at Tybee Island, Georgia.[10] Approximately 100\u00a0buildings in the vicinity of Savannah at least partially lost their roof and many others experienced at least some degree of damage. The barks Noe and Ragna wrecked along the northeast coast of Georgia.[12] At Port Royal, South Carolina, this storm produced 10.82\u00a0in (275\u00a0mm) of rain over a 24-hour period, breaking the previous one-day record by 5.89\u00a0in (150\u00a0mm),[14] with a storm total of 12.4\u00a0in (310\u00a0mm).[15] Overall, the storm caused approximately $400,000 in damage, nearly all in Savannah and at nearby rice plantations.[16] Chenoweth argued that this storm developed as a tropical depression on August\u00a029 just north of the Abaco Islands in the Bahamas and weakened slower over the Southeastern United States, dissipating over Tennessee on September\u00a02.[5]"

The storm moved northeastward and was last encountered by the brig Iddesleigh on September\u00a05,[10] on the same day the Atlantic hurricane best track indicated that the system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone approximately 870\u00a0mi (1,400\u00a0km) west-southwest of Ireland.

Early on September\u00a011, the storm peaked as a strong Category\u00a02 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 110\u00a0mph (175\u00a0km/h) as it began passing through the Lesser Antilles, first near Barbados and then between Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent several hours later. Thereafter, the hurricane turned northwestward and entered the Caribbean. Around 18:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a012, the cyclone passed just west of Anguilla while traversing the Anegada Passage and re-emerged into the Atlantic. The storm continued northwestward until curving northeastward on September\u00a017. Late on September\u00a019, the system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone about 95\u00a0mi (155\u00a0km) of the eastern tip of Nova Scotia. The remnants crossed Newfoundland before dissipating over the Labrador Sea on the following day.[3] Extensive impacts occurred in the Windward Islands. On Barbados, the storm rendered many streets impassable and substantially damaged two stone bridges. Winds downed many trees and thousands of telephone poles. Across the island, 5,062\u00a0homes were destroyed and another 2,359\u00a0suffered some degree of damage, rendering an estimated 40,000\u00a0people homeless. Property damage alone reached about $2.5\u00a0million.[18] Saint Vincent also experienced significant impact, especially on the west side of the island. Windward Islands governor Cornelius Alfred Moloney noted that \"From Buccamont to Kingstown ... everything is destroyed.\" A telegraph between British government officials stated that the storm destroyed 2,000\u00a0dwellings and damaged numerous others, leaving roughly 15,000\u00a0people homeless,[19] though a report authored by T. A. Carpenter and published in the Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society reported 6,000\u00a0homes demolished or damaged beyond repair and raised the number of persons rendered homeless to about 20,000. The National Hurricane Center estimated in 1996 that this hurricane caused 283 to 383\u00a0fatalities,[20] with 200 and 300\u00a0fatalities on Saint Vincent and 83\u00a0deaths on Barbados. However, this excludes 18\u00a0deaths on Guadeloupe and another after a crew member of a ship was swept overboard over the open Atlantic.[10] Additionally, the death toll for Barbados may have been 115, according to Carpenter.[21] According to Chenoweth's reanalysis study, this cyclone did not form until September\u00a09. The storm also had two stints as a major hurricane, first while passing through the Lesser Antilles and later on September\u00a018 and September\u00a019, before dissipating east of Newfoundland on the next day; the storm peaked with winds of 120\u00a0mph (195\u00a0km/h) each time.[5]"

Two days later, the cyclone moved ashore northern Belize (then known as British Honduras) and crossed southeastern Mexico before emerging into the Gulf of Mexico near Ciudad del Carmen, Campeche, early on September\u00a017. The storm then moved mostly northward for the next few days, until curving slightly to the north-northeast on September\u00a019 while approaching the Gulf Coast of the United States. Around 11:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a020, the cyclone made landfall just east of Creole, Louisiana, with winds of 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h). The cyclone is estimated to have weakened to a tropical depression near the Arkansas-Louisiana state line on September\u00a021 and then dissipated over Illinois on September\u00a022.[3] Parts of Louisiana experienced heavy rainfall. Plaquemine reported 4\u00a0in (100\u00a0mm) of precipitation in only a few hours, damaging local sugarcane crops.[22] In Lake Charles, rains flooded streets and caused losses to rice crops, while winds downed many telephone poles.[23] Similarly, the town of Jennings noted damage to rice crops, with losses totaling \"many thousands\", according to The Times-Democrat.[24] Farther east, New Orleans reported sustained winds up to 42\u00a0mph (68\u00a0km/h).[10] Precipitation generated by the storm in Mississippi led to a washout along the Yazoo and Mississippi Valley Railroad.[25] Elsewhere, winds and precipitation from the storm and its remnants spread across parts of the Mississippi Valley and Eastern United States.[10] Chenoweth does not begin the track for this storm until September\u00a019, when it was centered over the west-central Gulf of Mexico. The system also moves more northeasterly over land and transitions into an extratropical cyclone on September\u00a021.[5]"

By September\u00a026, the cyclone turned northward over the west-central Gulf of Mexico. Around 07:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a028, the storm made landfall in Texas near the west end of the Bolivar Peninsula. The system weakened to a tropical depression several hours after moving inland and promptly dissipated over Tyler County.[3] Heavy rainfall fell across the central Gulf coast and up the Mississippi Valley, with the highest totals recorded at Pensacola, Florida, with 12.61\u00a0in (320\u00a0mm) and Sikeston, Missouri, where 11.67\u00a0in (296\u00a0mm) fell.[26] At the former, a Weather Bureau observer considered the 48-hour rainfall amount of 11.45\u00a0in (291\u00a0mm) to be unprecedent when compared to the then-19\u00a0years of records at that location. Some homes in Pensacola reported floodwaters reaching as high as 12 to 14\u00a0in (300 to 360\u00a0mm) above the floor. Nearby, the ship Bellevue capsized at a Perdido Key wharf.[27] In Louisiana, precipitation generated by the storm flooded several streets in New Orleans.[28] Similar to the previous cyclone, the track for this storm is not started by Chenoweth until it is over the west-central Gulf of Mexico on September\u00a027, but otherwise proposes only minor alterations to the system's path, duration, and intensity.[5]"

Neumann began the track for this system about 200\u00a0mi (320\u00a0km) east of Guadeloupe two days earlier.[4][3] Traveling northwest, the storm intensified into a hurricane on September\u00a026 and then into a Category\u00a02 hurricane on September\u00a027. While nearing the coast of the Southeastern United States, the cyclone became a Category\u00a03 hurricane early on October\u00a01 and then a Category\u00a04 hurricane the next day. Around 12:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a02, the storm peaked with maximum sustained winds of 130\u00a0mph (215\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 938\u00a0mbar (27.7\u00a0inHg). The hurricane then made landfall on Cumberland Island, Georgia, four hours later at the same intensity. Early on October\u00a03, the system weakened to a tropical storm over west-central Georgia and a tropical depression over northeastern Alabama several hours later. The cyclone turned northeastward over Indiana and then east-northeastward over Ontario. After emerging into the Gulf of St. Lawrence, the storm struck Newfoundland on October\u00a06 and promptly dissipated.[3] The First Coast of Florida experienced strong winds and storm surge.[29] Though only minor impacts occurred in Jacksonville, the city lost communications with areas farther north. Nearby, Jacksonville Beach (then known as Pablo Beach) and Mayport reported damage due to storm surge. Farther north, storm surge may have reached 12\u00a0ft (3.7\u00a0m) in height in Fernandina Beach, flooding much of the town. Damage in Florida was conservatively estimated at $500,000.[29] In Georgia, the storm produced tides up to 18\u00a0ft (5.5\u00a0m) above mean high water mark at the Sapelo Island Lighthouse. A total of 32\u00a0people died in Darien. Storm surge inundated much of Brunswick, with at least 20\u00a0streets flooded with 4 to 8\u00a0ft (1.2 to 2.4\u00a0m) of water, damaging nearly all businesses, warehouses, and docks.[4] Tides and storm surge also caused flooding in the Savannah area, drowning 97\u00a0people at one plantation and numerous livestock while ruining about 5,000\u00a0barrels of rosin and 60,000\u00a0bushels of rice. High tides caused some damage to rice and cotton crops in South Carolina.[29] The cyclone produced heavy rainfall in other areas of the Southeastern United States, especially in western North Carolina.[30] Overall, the storm caused significant damage amounting to around $1.5\u00a0million,[29] and 179\u00a0fatalities in Georgia.[31] Chenoweth's reanalysis initiates the track for this storm north of Puerto Rico on September\u00a021. The storm had two stints as a major hurricane, the first from September\u00a025 to September\u00a028, with the cyclone peaking with winds of 145\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h) on September\u00a027.

In the Cherokee Sound district of Great Abaco Island, the storm destroyed 39\u00a0dwellings and damaged many other structures.[32] According to Chenoweth, however, damage ascribed to this storm in the Bahamas was actually related to the previous hurricane, which he places near Eleuthera and Great Abaco Island during this timeframe as a Category\u00a04 hurricane.[5]"

A subtropical storm, it moved northeastward through March\u00a015, by which time it turned to the southeast. The storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone early on the following day.[5] If the existence of this system is confirmed, it would become one of only two known Atlantic tropical or subtropical storms in the month of March, the other occurring in 1908.[34] On September\u00a02, the next unofficial system formed over the southwestern Caribbean. The storm moved northwestward and attained hurricane status within 24\u00a0hours. It then turned west-northwestward and struck Belize (then known as British Honduras) late on September\u00a04, before reaching the Gulf of Mexico the next day.

Chenoweth theorized that a tropical depression developed near the Cabo Verde Islands on September\u00a029. The cyclone strengthened into a tropical storm on the next day and moved parabolically across the eastern Atlantic until dissipating south of the Azores on October\u00a08. The final unofficial system formed well east of Bermuda on November\u00a08. Initially a tropical depression, it became a subtropical storm but then a fully tropical storm late the following day while moving slowly northwestward.

As a result, cold air moved far to the south across Florida, causing both snow flurries and record low temperatures. Most notably, the weather system brought snow flurries (seen in the air, but not on the ground) as far south as Homestead on January\u00a019. No snow had ever been reported in southeastern Florida before or since. Damage was most significant to agriculture, as major losses occurred to citrus fruits and tender vegetables. Statewide, agricultural damage from the cold wave totaled to $350\u00a0million (1977\u00a0USD), and losses overall totaled to $2\u00a0billion (1977\u00a0USD). One fatality occurred due to an automobile accident in Central Florida, which was related to the cold wave."

Two days later, another cold front crossed Florida,[1] while a strong arctic high-pressure system over the Mississippi River Valley also began pushing cold air into Florida. Simultaneously, an upper-level trough associated with the second cold front contained a band of clouds and precipitation. Between 8 and 9:30 am, snow flurries were reported in several areas outside Miami. The National Weather Service office in Miami reported that an observation at nearby Lake Worth reported a trace of snow on the ground at the 9:00 am observation (it was gone by the 10:00 am observation). This was the source of the trace of snow at Miami in 1977. It was reported that people stopped their cars and emerged from their homes to see the snow in great numbers, many having never seen snow flurries in their lifetimes. That day the high only reached 47\u00a0\u00b0F (8\u00a0\u00b0C) in Miami. The associated cold air began to subside on January\u00a021.[2]"

For much of the state, temperatures remained below freezing for 10\u201314 hours, and at or less than 28\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22122\u00a0\u00b0C) for at least four hours.[2] In Pensacola, a temperature of 10\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221212\u00a0\u00b0C) was recorded,[7] and was later surpassed by a mere 5\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221215\u00a0\u00b0C) during the Winter 1985 Arctic outbreak. A record low temperature of 20\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22127\u00a0\u00b0C) was reported in Orlando. Few other records were broken in North and Central Florida.

The USDA reported the following crop losses: 35% to citrus, at least 95% to vegetables, between 50\u201375% of commercial flowers, 50% to permanent pasture lands, and 40% to sugar cane. Crop damage totaled to $350\u00a0million (1977\u00a0USD),[7] while at least $100\u00a0million (1977\u00a0USD) of that figure occurred in Dade County alone.[1] In order to prevent water pipes from freezing, nurseries and farms ran sprinklers all night. However, some water began flowing onto roadways, and with freezing temperatures, caused ice to form on roads in western Dade County.[2] Overall, the cold wave caused up to $2\u00a0billion (1977\u00a0USD) in damage.[7] Several traffic accidents occurred due to snowfall and ice. Most notably, there was a ten-car pileup in Tampa, and another accident killed a man near Auburndale, when his car skidded in snow and crashed into a truck.[8] Due to significant losses related to the freezing temperatures, then-President Jimmy Carter, who was inaugurated on January\u00a020,[1] designated 35\u00a0counties in Florida disaster areas.[2]"

        "content": " Intense Tropical Cyclone Bonita in January 1996 struck both Madagascar and Mozambique, causing severe damage. The long-lived storm began developing in the last hours of 1995, and slowly consolidated over the open waters of the South-West Indian Ocean. Tracking generally toward the west-southwest, the disturbance received its name from M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France on 5 January. Ultimately peaking as an intense tropical cyclone, Bonita bypassed Mauritius and R\u00e9union to the north before striking northeastern Madagascar late on 10 January. There, the storm affected up to 150,000 people, flooded wide tracts of croplands, and killed 25 people. In the aftermath, disaster relief came from both the government of Madagascar and the international community, as well as non-governmental organizations (NGOs); the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs assisted in the distribution of about $450,000 in monetary donations. Bonita emerged into the Mozambique Channel as a significantly diminished storm, though it quickly regained some of its previous intensity. Three days after its initial landfall, the cyclone moved ashore over the Zambezia Province of Mozambique. Throughout northern parts of the country, Bonita triggered extensive flooding that damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings and reportedly killed 17 individuals. Swollen rivers submerged roads and bridges, isolating some locations. A meteorological rarity, Bonita continued inland for several days, persisting as a distinct tropical low; the system traversed southern Africa and ultimately entered the South Atlantic Ocean. In the process, it dropped unseasonably heavy rainfall over Zimbabwe and Zambia. A paper published by the Zambia Meteorological Department asserted that Bonita was the first storm confirmed to have tracked across the African continent from the South-West Indian Ocean to the Southern Atlantic Ocean."

        "content": "Cyclone Bonita originated from a weak area of disturbed weather observed about 600\u00a0km (370\u00a0mi) to the east of Diego Garcia, in the Chagos Archipelago, on 31 December 1995. The system was marked by a distinct low-level circulation and curved banding features,[1] and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) promptly began monitoring it.[2] A hostile upper-air pattern prevented further organization over the following several days as the disturbance drifted generally toward the southwest. On 3 January, the low pressure center showed initial signs of strengthening,[1] prompting M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France to declare it a tropical disturbance, the lowest of seven distinct intensity categories used by the agency.[3] The surrounding environment became more favorable for tropical cyclogenesis, with increased upper-level divergence, and consequently, the system further matured;[1] it was upgraded to a depression early on 5 January, and to a moderate tropical storm 12 hours later.[3] At that time, it was named Bonita by M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France R\u00e9union (MFR).[4] The JTWC upgraded 06S (its internal designation for Bonita) to a tropical storm equivalent early the next day.[2] Continuing to intensify, the storm accelerated toward the west-southwest, heading nearly due west for a short time as it encountered a subtropical ridge of high pressure. The cyclone's inner structure steadily improved in organization, adhering well to the model of a well-developed tropical system. Transcending the severe tropical cyclone stage,[4] Bonita achieved tropical cyclone status at 1200 UTC on 8 January.[3] Passing just south of St. Brandon, the system exhibited a broad and ill-defined eye about 50\u00a0km (31\u00a0mi) across.[4] The cyclone quickly strengthened over the course of the same day, with a consolidating eye and a formidable central dense overcast. Tracking about 225\u00a0km (140\u00a0mi) north of Mauritius, Bonita reached its peak intensity\u2014as assessed by M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France\u2014with maximum sustained winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph) and a central barometric air pressure of 920\u00a0hPa (27\u00a0inHg). This made the storm as an intense tropical cyclone, the second-highest category on the regional scale.[3] The JTWC stated that Bonita (06S) peaked at 12:00 UTC the next day, with 1-minute peak winds of 250\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph) (a Category 4 tropical cyclone on the Saffir\u2013Simpson Hurricane Scale).[2] According to M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France, Bonita began to weaken slightly in the early hours of 9 January,[3][4] the eye becoming asymmetric and poorly defined. The ridge to the south prevented the storm from progressing to the south,[4] and after passing about 270\u00a0km (170\u00a0mi) north of R\u00e9union, Bonita shifted due west and later roughly west-by-north, apparently steered by a building mid-to-upper-level anticyclone south of Madagascar.[5] It remained a strong tropical cyclone as it approached the eastern coast of Madagascar, making landfall near Mahavelona on the night of 10 January local time,[6] or about 21:30 UTC. At the time of landfall, a clear eye was visible on satellite imagery.[7] It crossed the island nation over the course of about a day, weakening significantly to a moderate tropical storm as it reemerged into the Mozambique Channel. Once over water, favorable conditions prompted quick reintensification of the cyclone, as it proceeded west-southwestward toward mainland Africa.[6] At 12:00 UTC on 13 January, Bonita reattained severe tropical storm status, marking its secondary peak intensity with 10-minute winds of 95\u00a0km/h (59\u00a0mph).[3] With an expansive circulation and a good structure, the cyclone made its second and final landfall over the Zambezia Province of Mozambique, between Quelimane and Pebane District, on the night of 13 January local time. Bonita meandered inland, weakening only gradually and nearly tracking back over open water.[6] Although the cyclone's \"best track\" listings by both M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France and the JTWC end at 0600 UTC on 15 January,[2][3] its residual tropical low remained distinct and active as it continued generally westward across the southern African continent. Where nearly all landfalling tropical cyclones in the area recurve toward the south or dissipate quickly on moving ashore, a rare synoptic pattern allowed the remnants of Bonita to persist, moving over northern Zimbabwe on 16 January. For the next two days, the weakening storm remained prominent on satellite imagery, ultimately moving off the coast of Angola and entering the South Atlantic Ocean on 19 January. By the next day, the system had succumbed to cold waters and days of land interaction, dissipating completely. According to a paper published by the Zambia Meteorological Department, Bonita was the first tropical cyclone known to have traversed southern Africa from the South-West Indian Ocean to the South Atlantic.[8]"

Stronger winds were observed on the offshore island of \u00cele Sainte-Marie, where gusts exceeded 230\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph) on 10 January.[9] Extensive freshwater flooding penetrated far inland, inundating 1,800\u00a0ha (4,400 acres) of rice crops in one area alone near Antananarivo.[10] Damage was heaviest along the northeastern coastline of Madagascar, particularly around Mahavelona, Fenoarivo Atsinanana, and Mahambo.[9][11] where both infrastructure and crops took a heavy beating. In its seasonal tropical cyclone report, M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France confirmed that 25 people in the country were either killed, or unaccounted for and presumed dead.[9] Overall, the storm impacted as many as 150,000 individuals,[11] of whom 5,000 were left homeless.[9] However, coverage of the disaster was scarce.[12] Following the storm, a government-endorsed disaster relief program was initiated to mitigate the developing humanitarian crisis in the three hardest-hit communes. The program was to distribute emergency food rations to 40,000 affected individuals, with special supplies intended to reach 1,500 malnourished children. A malnutrition rehabilitation center was established in Mahavelona as part of the program, which cost approximately $1.2 million (1996 USD) in total, and funded partially by the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA). At the end of February, the Government of Madagascar requested international aid; by 6 March, France and Germany had donated a combined $100,000 in assistance funds, as well as emergency supplies worth nearly $80,000.[11] Overall, the DHA handled roughly $450,000 in foreign donations, mostly from Europe.[13] United States Ambassador to Madagascar, Vicki J. Huddleston, authorized the allocation of $25,000 to distribute tarps, while the United States Agency for International Development sent $17,000 for medical treatment.[14] Immediately following the cyclone's onslaught, concerns arose amongst relief agencies and NGOs that the storm was either too early in the season or not damaging enough to dedicate a significant portion of disaster funds. Consequently, disagreements between prospective donors about the extent of emergency response resulted in delayed intervention. Post-storm assessments of the response to Bonita highlighted the need for increased coordination between agencies.[14]"

Subsequently, international entities distributed emergency food supplies to storm victims.[15] Substantial rainfall caused damaging floods throughout inland portions of country, reportedly killing as many as 17 people. Floodwaters destroyed 2,500\u00a0ha (6,200 acres) of crops and demolished many buildings, including about 12 schools.[16][17] The Buzi River swelled beyond its banks, sweeping away nearby houses and rendering roadways impassable in the Buzi District. Local officials were unable to reach the hardest-hit places, prompting fears of heavier destruction than what had been reported. Significant flooding was also reported in the Pungwe River watershed; bridges over two of its tributaries were submerged.[12] The remnants of Bonita dropped significant precipitation, described as the heaviest in 80 years, over drought-stricken eastern Zimbabwe. A long-standing two-day rainfall total was broken at Rusape, which recorded 135\u00a0mm (5.3\u00a0in) of precipitation between 15 and 16 January.[18] Unsettled weather extended into Zambia, which endured relatively strong winds and noteworthy precipitation that contributed to above-normal seasonal rainfall totals in many areas; by comparison, rainfall remained average or even trended slightly below-average across northern and eastern sections of the nation. Daily rainfall totals in Zambia peaked at 134\u00a0mm (5.3\u00a0in) at Choma on January 16.[8]"

Temperatures fell as much as 25\u201350 \u00b0F (14\u201328 \u00b0C) below average as far south as the Gulf Coast. Severe winter storms also were associated with the bitter cold, which allowed for heavy snowfall and ice accumulations to places as far south as Houston, Texas, and contributing to one of the snowiest winters ever in some areas in the Deep South. With the record cold advancing so far south, effects were crippling and widespread. Many regions within the Southern Plains such as Oklahoma and Texas, in addition to Arkansas, broke or nearly reached record-low temperatures not seen in decades or even a century. In Texas, the record cold caused enormous strain on the power grid and froze pipelines, leading millions to lose power and many pipes to burst. At least 278 people were killed directly or indirectly by severe cold,[5][6][7][8][9][10][11] and the damages are estimated to exceed $27.575 billion (2021 USD), including at least $26.075 billion in the United States and $1.5 billion in Mexico.[2][3][4]"

        "content": "Hurricane Nate was a tropical cyclone that threatened Bermuda but remained at sea during early September 2005. The fourteenth named storm and seventh hurricane of the annual Atlantic hurricane season, Nate formed southwest of Bermuda on September 5 and initially moved very slowly to the northeast. Early forecasts suggested a possible threat to the island, but Nate passed well to its south as a Category\u00a01 hurricane on September 8. After moving away from the island, the storm entered a region with cooler sea surface temperatures and unfavorable wind shear, causing it to weaken to a tropical storm before becoming extratropical on September 10. The extratropical remnant was later absorbed by a larger weather system. The hurricane caused no structural damage while tropical, although it generated rip currents in combination with other storms that killed one person off the New Jersey coast. Nate dropped light rainfall and produced gusty winds on the island of Bermuda. The remnants of hurricanes Nate and Maria contributed to heavy rainfall in parts of Scotland and later Western Norway, triggering a mudslide that killed one person. Canadian Navy ships en route to the US Gulf Coast, carrying relief supplies to assist in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, were delayed while trying to avoid Nate and Hurricane Ophelia."

        "content": "A tropical wave emerged from the west coast of Africa on August\u00a030 and tracked westward across the Atlantic Ocean, maintaining a vigorous area of convection along the wave axis. By September\u00a01 most of the  deep convection had been stripped away by southwesterly wind shear.  Despite this, the wave remained well-defined as it continued west-northwest. The wave split into two pieces; the northern portion passed between the Leeward Islands and Hurricane Maria on September\u00a03, while the southern portion moved into the Caribbean Sea. On September\u00a04, the northern portion of the wave began to interact with an upper-level low pressure system and an elongated trough that was located between Bermuda and the Leeward Islands[1]\u2014the same trough which contributed to the development of Hurricane Ophelia.[2] As a result of the low wind shear, convection redeveloped and organized along the wave axis. Convective banding formed around a broad surface low. It is estimated that the system developed into a tropical depression at 1800\u00a0UTC on September\u00a05. At the time it was located approximately 350 miles (560\u00a0km) to the south-southwest of Bermuda.[1] Upon being designated, Tropical Depression Fifteen developed deep convection close to, and to the east of, the center of circulation. At the same time, banding features became better organized.[3] Later on September 5, the overall cloud pattern improved while thunderstorm activity condensed and deepened within the increasingly well-defined circulation.[4] Just six hours after being designated as a tropical depression, the cyclone intensified into a tropical storm; it was given the name Nate by the National Hurricane Center. Over the following two days, Nate drifted slowly northeastward towards Bermuda.[1] Within the early hours of September\u00a06, Nate became quasi-stationary under a weak steering pattern between Hurricane Maria and a disturbance over The Bahamas.[5] Satellite imagery indicated that the cloud pattern continued to organize with excellent outflow surrounding the storm.[6] Late on September\u00a06 a developing banding eye feature became evident.[7] Tropical Storm Nate strengthened further and became a hurricane at 1200 UTC\u00a0on September\u00a07, as it began to turn away from Bermuda.[1] Some models indicated that Nate could have been either absorbed by or merged with the larger Hurricane Maria, but the National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecast that Nate would survive as a separate system, which it did.[8] The large low to the northeast of The Bahamas gradually opened into a broad trough as a shortwave trough approached from the northwest. The larger trough slowly became elongated in a northeast\u2013southwest manner late on September\u00a07. At the same time, the shortwave trough moved southward along the west side of the other trough. The increasing southwesterly flow along the southeast side of the broad trough caused Nate to accelerate northeastward. Nate reached its peak intensity of 90\u00a0mph (145\u00a0km/h) late on September\u00a08 as it passed 120\u00a0miles (205\u00a0km) southeast of Bermuda, while its strongest winds remained well offshore.[1] While at peak intensity, the storm maintained a well-organized and \"impressive\" convective pattern.[9] Soon after the storm peaked in strength, increasing wind shear and dry air caused Nate to weaken back into a tropical storm later on September\u00a09.[1] Satellite imagery showed that the cloud pattern began to rapidly deteriorate.[10] The hurricane was downgraded to a tropical storm at 1800\u00a0UTC on September\u00a09 and continued to weaken as wind shear increased in association with an approaching trough and a related cold front.[1] By late on September\u00a09, all of the already limited convective activity was confined to the eastern semicircle, leaving the low-level center exposed.[11] The storm was reduced to a swirl of low-level clouds just hours later.[12] Nate became extratropical the next day before becoming absorbed by a larger system by 0000\u00a0UTC on September\u00a013, to the north-northeast of the Azores.[1]"

        "content": "A tropical storm watch was issued for Bermuda early on September\u00a07, and later that day a tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch superseded it. However, the storm did not reach the island, so the warnings were canceled as the storm moved away September\u00a08.[1] Four cruise ships left the island ahead of schedule, and flights were canceled in anticipation of Nate.[13][14] The outer bands of Nate brushed Bermuda with sustained winds of 35\u00a0mph (55\u00a0km/h) and widespread showers.[1][15] Gusts were higher, peaking at roughly 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h).[16] Less than 1\u00a0inch (25\u00a0mm) of rain was recorded at Bermuda International Airport.[1] Damage in Bermuda was minimal.[1] Two ships reported tropical storm-force winds in association with the storm: the Maersk New Orleans, to the north of the storm's center, and a ship with the call sign WCZ858 to the east-southeast.[1] Rip currents from Nate and the more distant Maria killed one and injured another in New Jersey; several others were caught in rip currents, though they were able to escape.[17] In the Carolinas, Nate also contributed to heightened seas, though this time in combination with Hurricane Ophelia and persistent unrelated northeasterly winds. A buoy just offshore Cape Fear recorded waves up to 12\u00a0ft (3.7\u00a0m).[18] Tropical energy from the remnants of Nate and Maria merged to form a broad storm system that would track toward parts of Europe. The mid-latitude cyclone produced a day of heavy rains across the Scottish Highlands that included a 24-hour precipitation total of 5.17\u00a0in (131\u00a0mm) on the Isle of Skye.[19] As it continued north, the storm also dropped torrential rainfall over Western Norway. The region suffered extensive flooding and mudslides, including one that killed one person and injured nine more.[19][20] Although the remnants of Nate and Maria avoided England, they broke a streak of above-average temperatures in the region, filtering down much cooler Arctic air. In places, this led to the first frost of the winter season.[21] Temperatures down to \u22121.7\u00a0\u00b0C (28.9\u00a0\u00b0F) were recorded following the influx of colder air, with readings below freezing as far south as Hertfordshire.[19] Four Canadian Navy ships headed to the Gulf Coast of the United States, carrying relief supplies to help in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, were slowed down trying to avoid Hurricanes Nate and Ophelia.[22] The convoy included a destroyer, two frigates, and an icebreaker, and developed a plan to travel between the two hurricanes to minimize damage to their cargo. Anticipating rough seas and gusty winds even with the altered course, crews secured onboard supplies which included generators, chainsaws, diapers, and cots.[23] The genesis of Tropical Storm Nate continued the unprecedented levels of tropical activity during the 2005 hurricane season; when it developed on September\u00a05, it was the earliest in any season that the fourteenth named tropical cyclone formed, surpassing the previous record held by an unnamed storm during the 1936 season. This record was later broken in 2020 when Tropical Storm Nana formed on September 1, four days earlier.[24]"

It was one of two systems during the season to reach Category 5\u2011equivalent intensity on the Saffir\u2013Simpson Hurricane Scale.[nb 1] It formed on August\u00a022 off the west coast of Africa, and for much of its duration it maintained a west-northwest track. The system intensified into a tropical storm on August\u00a026 and into a hurricane on August\u00a028. Passing north of the Lesser Antilles, the hurricane rapidly intensified as it approached the Turks and Caicos islands. It reached Category\u00a05 status and its peak winds of 160\u00a0mph (260\u00a0km/h) on August\u00a031. Subsequently, it weakened before striking northern Cuba on September\u00a01 with winds of 120\u00a0mph (190\u00a0km/h). In the country, the hurricane left about 100,000\u00a0people homeless and killed over 70\u00a0people. Damage was heaviest near the storm's path, and the strong winds destroyed houses and left areas without power. Damage was estimated at $11\u00a0million.[nb 2] After exiting from Cuba, the hurricane entered the Gulf of Mexico and restrengthened. On September\u00a02, it re-attained winds of 140\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h). Initially the hurricane posed a threat to the area around Corpus Christi, Texas, and the local United States Weather Bureau forecaster advised people to stay away from the Texas coastline during the busy Labor Day Weekend. Officials declared martial law in the city and mandated evacuations. However, the hurricane turned more to the west and struck near Brownsville early on September\u00a05 with winds estimated at 125\u00a0mph (205\u00a0km/h). It quickly dissipated after causing heavy damage in the Rio Grande Valley. High winds caused heavy damage to the citrus crop. The hurricane left $16.9\u00a0million in damage and 40\u00a0deaths in southern Texas."

        "content": "The origins of the hurricane were from a tropical disturbance near the west coast of Africa on August\u00a020. Two days later, the system organized enough to be classified a tropical depression just southwest of Cape Verde. For the next few days, the system moved west-northwestward with little change in intensity. It is estimated the depression strengthened into a tropical storm on August\u00a026, about halfway between the Lesser Antilles and Cape Verde. Initially, the storm was elongated, although beginning on August\u00a028 it began to intensify more quickly. That night, the storm attained hurricane status, and many nearby ships reported gale-force winds.[3] On August\u00a029, the hurricane passed north of the Lesser Antilles as it approached the southeastern Bahamas. It underwent rapid deepening: in a 24\u2011hour period beginning late on August\u00a029, the winds increased from 105\u00a0mph (165\u00a0km/h) to 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h). It also became a small storm, as Grand Turk Island reported winds of 56\u00a0mph (90\u00a0km/h) while the hurricane passed slightly to the north on August\u00a030. At 0130\u00a0UTC the next day, a ship near Mayaguana reported a barometric pressure of 930\u00a0mbar (27\u00a0inHg) and hurricane-force winds. The pressure would ordinarily suggest winds of 152\u00a0mph (245\u00a0km/h), but because it was not reported in the eye and the storm was smaller than normal, the winds were estimated at 160\u00a0mph (260\u00a0km/h). The hurricane's winds rank as a Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, one of two such storms in the 1933 season.[3] After maintaining peak winds for about 12\u00a0hours, the hurricane began weakening as it passed through the southern Bahamas. At around 1200\u00a0UTC on September\u00a01, the hurricane made landfall on northern Cuba near Sagua La Grande, with winds of about 120\u00a0mph (190\u00a0km/h). The eye moved along the northern coast of Cuba, crossing over Matanzas. Shortly thereafter the storm exited into the Straits of Florida, and late on September\u00a01 the hurricane passed about 16\u00a0mi (26\u00a0km) north of Havana. After entering the Gulf of Mexico, the hurricane restrengthened, and a ship reported a pressure of 948\u00a0mbar (28.0\u00a0inHg) late on September\u00a02; this suggested winds of about 140\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h). The hurricane turned more to the west on September\u00a03, and as it approached southern Texas it weakened slightly as it decelerated. At 0400\u00a0UTC on September\u00a05, the hurricane made its final landfall on South Padre Island in southern Texas, with winds estimated at 125\u00a0mph (205\u00a0km/h). It quickly weakened over land as it crossed into northeastern Mexico, and the storm dissipated late on September\u00a05.[3]"

        "content": "Throughout its path, the hurricane killed at least 179\u00a0people collectively in the Turks and Caicos Islands, Cuba, and south Texas.[4] It first affected the Turks and Caicos, producing winds of 54\u00a0mph (87\u00a0km/h) on Grand Turk.[5] Before the hurricane struck Cuba, officials warned of the impending storm, and military workers warned people to remain indoors.[6] About 4,000\u00a0people evacuated the coastal town of Isabela on three trains specifically run for the residents. In Havana, business owners secured their properties in anticipation of the storm.[7] Most of the deaths from the hurricane occurred in northern Cuba. Winds of over 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h) affected the coastline, and Havana reported maximum winds of 94\u00a0mph (151\u00a0km/h).[3] There, the winds downed power lines and uprooted trees. High waves flooded six blocks of the city with up to 4\u00a0ft (1.2\u00a0m) of water, entering the cellars of some homes.[6] East of Havana in C\u00e1rdenas, high waves destroyed the aqueduct, while high winds severely damaged the local sugar industry. A nearby coastal town 20\u00a0mi (32\u00a0km) east of C\u00e1rdenas was described as being \"virtually leveled by the storm\" in news reports.[8] In Cienfuegos along the southern coast, the hurricane destroyed many ships and piers.[6] High waves washed four ships ashore, one of which damaged another ship.[9] High winds destroyed hundreds of houses and damaged many others along the storm's path.[10] About 100,000\u00a0people were left homeless, many of whom lacking food or medical supplies.[11] In the interior of the country, the hurricane dropped rainfall that flooded rivers and towns.[12] Damage was estimated at $11\u00a0million, and a report published in 2003 indicated that there were about 70\u00a0deaths in the country;[13] however, newspaper accounts from shortly after the hurricane indicated there were around 100\u00a0deaths.[14] After the storm, police officers were deployed to maintain order.[6] Officers shot and killed five people caught looting in Havana, although the deaths were not included in the overall death toll.[15] Officials deployed trucks to pick up wounded citizens.[16] While the hurricane was over the Bahamas late on August\u00a030, the United States Weather Bureau issued storm warnings for southern Florida. Two days later, the storm struck Cuba and passed south of the state, producing peak winds of 42\u00a0mph (68\u00a0km/h) in Key West.[5] The winds caused little damage; however, high waves destroyed a sea wall and washed onto a coastal roadway. High waves also sank a boat, killing three people.[17] Three days before the hurricane made its final landfall, officials at the Weather Bureau in Brownsville issued a warning to all stations along the Texas coast, declaring that it was \"uncertain where tropical storm in Gulf will reach coast line, but all persons should be warned to remain away from inaccessible places on Texas coast over week end.\" The early warning was to prevent travelers from being on the Texas beaches on Labor Day Weekend. As a result, an official at the Corpus Christi Weather Bureau office estimated that the warning \"probably saved thousands of lives.\" Early on September\u00a04 about a day before landfall, the Weather Bureau issued a hurricane warning from Corpus Christi to Freeport and storm warnings for other locations along the Texas coast. When the storm's westward motion became more apparent, the hurricane warning was dropped north of Corpus Christi and extended southward to Brownsville.[5] Officials in Corpus Christi declared martial law before the storm struck and ordered mandatory evacuations of low-lying areas. Shelters opened in the city, and many businesses closed.[18] When the storm moved across the area, winds were estimated at 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) in Brownsville,[5] with gusts to 125\u00a0mph (201\u00a0km/h).[19] High tides were reported along the coast,[17] and the storm surge reached 13\u00a0ft (4.0\u00a0m) near Brownsville. The tides flooded portions of Corpus Christi about 3\u00a0ft (0.91\u00a0m) deep, sinking boats and damaging piers. Storm-generated waves destroyed 20\u00a0buildings in one settlement. The storm destroyed the causeway from Padre Island to Flour Bluff, and there were over 40\u00a0breaches in the island,[19] some up to a mile wide.[18] The storm dropped heavy rainfall from southern Texas through northeastern Mexico,[20] peaking at over 15.0\u00a0in (380\u00a0mm) at a station near Mercedes; the total was one of four 24\u2011hour precipitation records set by the storm.[19] The rains from the storm and two previous hurricanes led to a large increase in tropical butterfly species across the area.[20] Throughout the Rio Grande Valley, the strong winds destroyed about 90% of the citrus crop.[19] Overall, the hurricane left $16.9\u00a0million in damage and 40\u00a0deaths, mostly in Cameron County.[17][19] However, none of the deaths were in Brownsville or Corpus Christi, which was credited to the advance warning.[5] Damage was less than expected in Corpus Christi, and many business owners who lost revenue sent letters of outcry to the Weather Bureau Headquarters; however, the Bureau determined that the evacuations and warnings were warranted given the storm's threat.[18]"

The storm formed off the coast of Mexico and intensified rapidly, peaking as a strong tropical storm on September 3, before starting a weakening trend. It dissipated before making landfall on Baja California. While the storm never made landfall, the remnants from the storm fueled the Labor Day Storm of 1970, causing floods in Arizona that resulted in heavy damage and loss of life. The rainfall from this storm broke records, mostly for 24-hour rainfall totals. Despite not being tropical when the damages were done, Norma is considered to be the deadliest disaster in Arizona history.[1]"

Soon after, a weak low pressure center associated with the system formed 100 nautical miles (190\u00a0km) southwest of Acapulco, Mexico.[2] The system later went through rapid intensification, becoming a tropical depression on August 31 and Tropical Storm Norma later that day. Initially, with a loose organization, Norma continued to organize and strengthen, reaching its peak of 60\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h) on September 2. Satellite pictures showed cirrus outflow was greater in the tops of the feeder bands than in the eyewall chimney.[2] On September 3, Navy reconnaissance reported a 992\u00a0mbar pressure, Norma's lowest.[2] Shortly after the 992\u00a0mbar report, however, Norma began to weaken. The same recon that reported the 60\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h) and 992\u00a0mbar reading reported back with a mere 40\u00a0mph (60\u00a0km/h) some time after. Despite the sudden drop in winds, the minimum pressure remained around 994\u00a0mbar. The weakening became obvious on satellite presentation, which showed cool inflow and a sheet of stratocumulus clouds around the west semicircle extending under the storm clouds. Norma continued to weaken, degrading into a depression by September 4. At this point, the circulation forced moist and unstable\nmaritime air into Arizona which resulted in disastrous floods during Labor Day along with a slow moving cold front. This system would become known as the Labor Day Storm of 1970. On September 5, a cloud spiral was still visible west of Baja California, but the storm's circulation dissipated, with the remnants of the storm finally dissipating on September 6, just before making landfall on Baja California.[2]"

        "content": "On August\u00a030, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) indicated the potential for an area of low pressure to form offshore the coastline of Mexico and slowly develop over subsequent days.[1] This projection came to fruition the next afternoon, when a large area of showers and thunderstorms in association with a trough of low pressure was noted.[2] Amid a generally favorable environment with moderate wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures, convection steadily coalesced atop a distinct low-level circulation, and the disturbance acquired enough organization to be deemed a tropical cyclone at 15:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a02; it was designated Tropical Storm Norbert in accordance with an Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) pass. Due to moderate northeasterly wind shear, only modest intensification was predicted.[3] Norbert moved generally northwestward succeeding formation, steered around the southwestern periphery of a subtropical ridge across Baja California and northern Mexico.[4] All the while, the cloud pattern of the cyclone progressively improved, with a symmetric central dense overcast and distinct rainbands on convectional satellite, and a formative inner core with hints of a small mid-level eye on hurricane imagery.[5] In conjunction with satellite intensity estimates, Norbert was upgraded to a Category\u00a01 hurricane on September\u00a04.[6] Continuing on a general northwestward trajectory, increased easterly wind shear caused the system to temporarily lose organization during the pre-dawn hours of September\u00a04 as the low- and mid-level circulations became dislocated.[7] An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft investigated Norbert that afternoon, recording peak flight-level winds of 97\u00a0mph (156\u00a0km/h), maximum surface winds of 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h), and a minimum barometric pressure of 970\u00a0mbar (970\u00a0hPa; 29\u00a0inHg).[8][9] Early on September\u00a06, the cyclone began a period of unexpected rapid deepening; at 00:00\u00a0UTC, it was upgraded to a Category\u00a02 hurricane,[10] and at 06:00\u00a0UTC, it intensified a major hurricane, a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.[11] After attaining its peak intensity with maximum winds of 125\u00a0mph (201\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 950\u00a0mbar (950\u00a0hPa; 28\u00a0inHg), Norbert began to track over cooler sea surface temperatures, and a weakening trend ensued. It was downgraded to a Category\u00a02 hurricane at 21:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a06,[12] and further to a Category\u00a01 hurricane at 03:00\u00a0UTC the next day.[13] Deep convection associated with Norbert began to wane significantly as the storm entered a stable environment, and a blend of satellite intensity estimates prompted the NHC to downgrade it to a tropical storm at 15:00\u00a0UTC.[14] At 09:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a08, after having been devoid of deep, organized convection for over 12 hours, the system was declared a post-tropical cyclone.[15] During the next few days, Nobert's remnants made a northward loop, before dissipating on September 11.[16]"

Due to the severity of damage, the New Mexico Department of Transportation closed the road indefinitely and stated it could be more than a month until it was re-opened.[41] In Nevada, rainfall totaled over 4\u00a0in (100\u00a0mm) in a short period of time, causing the worst flooding in the Moapa Valley since 1981. The flooding prompted The National Weather Service to issue a strongly worded flash flood emergency for the Moapa Valley, advising people to avoid travel and keep local roads open for emergency operations.[42][43] The waters closed a 30\u00a0mi (48\u00a0km) section of Interstate 15 in both directions.[44] Several vehicles were washed away along the interstate and damaged the road forcing the closure for several days.[44] The cost of the repairs to the road are expected to be in excess of $5\u00a0million.[45] Indian Reservation in Moapa was evacuated due to the floods.[24] Up to 200 children were trapped in an elementary school due to waters 12\u00a0ft (3.7\u00a0m) deep.[46] Damage in the state amounted to $9.64\u00a0million.[47]"

The nineteenth tropical cyclone and fifteenth named storm of the 1983 Pacific hurricane season, the origins of Tropical Storm Octave were from a tropical disturbance that formed south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec on September\u00a023, 1983. Steered by a deep layer high over Mexico, the disturbance moved west for four days before becoming a tropical depression on September\u00a027 off the southwest coast of Mexico. Over an area of warm sea surface temperatures, it was able to quickly strengthen to peak winds of 50\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h), through wind shear prevented much further development. By September\u00a030, Octave was accelerating to the northeast, steadily weakening due to cooler waters. That day it weakened to tropical depression status, and on October\u00a02, Octave dissipated. In Arizona, the highest rainfall total was 12.0\u00a0in (300\u00a0mm) at Mount Graham. In Tucson, flood waters were reportedly 8\u00a0ft (2.4 m) high. Throughout the state, excessive rainfall caused many rivers to overflow. After the rain ended, the Santa Cruz, Rillito, and Gila rivers experienced their highest crests on record. Five towns \u2013 Clifton, Duncan, Winkelman, Hayden, and Marana \u2013 were almost completely flooded. In Marana, many homes were submerged, forcing residents to be evacuated. Over 700\u00a0homes were destroyed in Clifton. In addition, 86 of the town's 126\u00a0business were heavily damaged due to the flooding. Around 3,000\u00a0buildings were destroyed due to Octave. A total of 853\u00a0houses, mobile homes, and apartments were destroyed while 2,052\u00a0others were damaged. About 10,000\u00a0people were temporarily left homeless. Damage in Arizona totaled $500\u00a0million (1983\u00a0USD), which was above the preliminary estimate of $300\u00a0million. Fourteen people drowned and 975\u00a0persons were injured. Elsewhere, Octave was responsible for $12.5\u00a0million in damage in New Mexico. Following the storm, governor Bruce Babbitt declared a state of emergency. President Ronald Reagan declared Cochise, Gila, Graham, Greenlee, Pima, Pinal, Santa Cruz and Yavapai counties a \"major disaster area\"."

In fact, it had rained almost every other day at many weather stations in Arizona.[2] The remnants of a Pacific hurricane brought rain to much of California and part of Arizona. Then, on September 22, the North American Monsoon became active over the region.[3] This was atypical for late September; by this time, in a normal year the climate is dry. However, in late September\u00a01983, surface weather maps exhibited a few unusual features. A thermal low lay over the mouth of the Gulf of California while the tail end of a weak cold front was located atop of the Great Basin.[2] On September\u00a028, moisture from the storm began spreading across Mexico and the southwest United States, due to a stalled low pressure area off the coast of California drawing the thunderstorms northeastward.[1] Tropical Storm Octave played a vital role in the disaster by supplying warm, moisture to the region, which collided with cooler air from the subtropics.[2] By October 2, the heaviest rainfall had ended.[1]"

Therefore, significant development was impeded as the depression curved back to the north along an adjacent upper-level low.[4] As conditions aloft turned favorable by September\u00a028, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Octave at 1800\u00a0UTC that day. Within six hours, Octave attained its peak intensity of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) and decreased in forward speed while turning to the northeast. On September\u00a030, Octave began to accelerate towards the northeast as it began to weaken due to cooler waters and increasing vertical wind shear. Consequently, the winds gradually decreased to 35\u00a0mph (55\u00a0km/h) and the storm was downgraded back to tropical depression status during the afternoon.[5] At 1200\u00a0UTC on October\u00a02, the EPHC issued their last advisory on the storm as the surface circulation had dissipated.[4]"

Water was released from the Coolidge Dam, which forced 75\u00a0residents to evacuate,[26][27] marking the third time in 50\u00a0years that water was released from the dam.[28] After a third bout of heavy rain on October 2, the Santa Cruz, Rillito, and Gila rivers experienced their highest crests on record.[1] A flow rate of 25,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft (707,921,165\u00a0cc) per second was measured in the Rillito river;[22] the Santa Cruz river peaked at a flow rate of 1,490\u00a0m3 (52,620\u00a0cu\u00a0ft),[2] which was short of the record set during Hurricane Heather during the 1977 Pacific hurricane season.[29] All other rivers that pass through Tucson did not attain record levels and were significantly lower than past flood episodes.[2] As Tropical Storm Octave deluged the state, the Rillito River slowly eroded its banks, and by October\u00a02, the river had widened 100\u00a0ft (30\u00a0m), destroying a parking lot and an office building. Runoff from both the Rillito and Santa Cruz rivers eventually piled up in a delta, flooding Marana.[2] In Marana, many homes were submerged, forcing residents to be evacuated. Only two town residents had flood insurance because officials \"didn't believe a flood could occur there.\" Additionally, communities along the Santa Cruz River were flooded, forcing 4,000 residents to evacuate their homes, many of whom lost key property possessions. The metropolitan area of Tucson was completely flooded due to the storm.[22] Tropical Storm Octave also caused major flooding along the Gila River,[2] which reached its highest discharge rates since 1906.[29] and two of its tributaries, the San Francisco River and the San Pedro River. These rains devastated Clifton along the San Francisco River valley.[2] Most of Clifton's 4,200\u00a0residents had to be evacuated due to flooding, where over 700\u00a0homes were destroyed. In addition, 86 of the town's 126 businesses were heavily damaged due to the floods.[22] The Gila River near Clifton sustained its largest discharge rates since Clifton was founded.[2] Along the Southern Francisco River, a peak discharge rate of 56,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft (1.6\u00d7109\u00a0cc) was reported by meteorologists, which is 1.8\u00a0times greater than the previous record set by Hurricane Joanne during the 1972 Pacific hurricane season.[29] Further south along the Gila River, major flooding was reported in extreme southeastern Arizona, where Octave was described as the worst flood in the area's history since 1916.[29] In Willcox, a farming community 80\u00a0mi (130\u00a0km) east of Tucson, residents armed with shovels and sandbags fought rising floodwaters after the Hooker Dam, an earthen dam 35\u00a0mi (55\u00a0km) north of Willcox, burst, preventing further destruction. The cities of Nogales and Tubac, near the Mexican border, was without power and water for two days following the storm.[28] The Mohave and Yavapai counties were particularly hard-hit. A relief helicopter crashed in attempt to rescue a woman and her baby, killing its two crew members.[30] Five towns \u2013 Clifton, Duncan, Winkelman, Hayden, and Marana \u2013 were all almost entirely flooded.[1] Authorities were forced to close Interstate 10 when waters from the Gila River destroyed a bridge.[31] Additionally, two people perished in their car on an Indian reservation in the Gila River valley.[32] Nearby, in Phoenix, 150 persons were evacuated from an apartment complex.[33] One underpass was filled with water 9\u00a0ft (2.7\u00a0m) deep. Throughout the greater Phoenix area, eight fires were started via lightning. Damage from the fires totaled $90,000. In all, 14 injuries were reported.[34] The 28\u00a0mile (45\u00a0km) long Santa Fe Railway that served the city of Prescott was washed out in multiple locations between the Chino Valley and downtown Prescott due to floodwaters. Railroad service was never reinstituted and the line was formally abandoned in 1984, leaving Prescott as Arizona's largest city ever to lose its rail service.[35] Extensive damage was reported throughout the state. About one-seventh of the cotton crop was destroyed by Octave. Much of the rich topsoil was washed downstream into large reservoirs. Furthermore, agriculture damage totaled about $97.5 million. Damage to homes totaled $17 million while damages to business exceeded $6 million in damage. Public property damage reached $55.7 million. A father, mother, and two children were swept off their truck in Ash Fork. Two navy officers where killed on September 30 near Oatman when their jet crashed. On October 1, a man drowned in the Santa Cruz river. Another person drowned in a wash near Tucson when his truck stalled. In addition, a taxi driver and a passenger died when tried to cross a flooded river.[34] Overall, infrastructural damage estimates in the Tucson area ranged from $54\u2013100 million;[2] damage to roads and highways alone surpassed $10\u00a0million in Tucson.[30] Tropical Storm Octave was very similar to Tropical Storm Norma in terms of flood damage. Octave was also described as the \"Storm of the Century\" and a 100-year flood.[2] The system is considered the cause of the worst flood in Pima County history.[36] It is also regarded as the worst tropical system to affect Arizona.[37] Around 3,000\u00a0buildings were destroyed due to Octave.[33] A total of 853\u00a0houses, mobile homes, and apartments were destroyed by Octave while 2,052\u00a0others were damaged.[28] About 10,000\u00a0people were temporarily left homeless.[23] Damage in Arizona totaled $500\u00a0million,[1] which was above the preliminary estimate of $300\u00a0million.[33] Fourteen people drowned and 975\u00a0persons were injured.[38]"

Damage to highways also totaled $1.5\u00a0million.[41] Further west, rainfall was also reported in California. In Mexico, 12\u00a0in (300\u00a0mm) of precipitation was reported in Altar, while lighter totals between 1\u20133\u00a0in (25\u201375\u00a0mm) were reported along the Baja California Peninsula.[21] In Sonora, many roads near the border were closed, and a lack of food supply was reported.[42] Along the Mexican Riviera, there were isolated reports of 1\u00a0in (25\u00a0mm) of precipitation.[21]"

Babbitt also toured the devastated area. Officials also opened 15 shelters, which housed 2,905 people.[28] Many workers from dozens of companies used cranes, dynamite, trucks, and hammers to clean up dried 7\u00a0ft (2.1\u00a0m) mud near some rivers.[42] Many destroyed buildings were later rebuilt. Considerable experience was also gained on how to protect flood banks.[22] Repair costs from Octave totaled $60\u00a0million.[45] It is estimated that it took four months for floodwaters to recede across southeastern Arizona and portions of New Mexico.[29]"

        "content": "The 1933 Florida\u2013Mexico hurricane was the first of two Atlantic hurricanes to strike the Treasure Coast region of Florida in the very active 1933\u00a0Atlantic hurricane season. It was one of two storms that year to inflict hurricane-force winds over South Texas, causing significant damage there; the other occurred in early September. The fifth tropical cyclone of the year, it formed east of the Lesser Antilles on July\u00a024, rapidly strengthening as it moved west-northwest. As it passed over the islands, it attained hurricane status on July\u00a026, producing heavy rains and killing at least six\u00a0people. Over the next three days, it moved north of the Caribbean, paralleling the Turks and Caicos Islands and the Bahamas. The storm produced extensive damage and at least one\u00a0drowning as it crossed the Bahamas. On July\u00a029, the cyclone came under the influence of changing steering currents in the atmosphere, which forced the storm into Florida near Hobe Sound a\u00a0day later. A minimal hurricane at landfall, it caused negligible wind damage as it crossed Florida, but generated heavy rains along its path, causing locally severe flooding. The storm turned west, weakened to below hurricane status, and later exited the state north of Charlotte Harbor on July\u00a031. Once over the eastern Gulf of Mexico, the storm shifted its course to the west-southwest and gradually recovered its intensity. The path of the storm brought it close to the mouth of the Rio Grande in early August. Few ships encountered the small storm as it regained hurricane status on August\u00a04, just a\u00a0day before striking northern Mexico with winds of 90\u00a0mph (145\u00a0km/h)\u2014making it close to a modern-day Category\u00a02 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale. Striking close to the border between the United States and Mexico, the storm caused extensive damage in both countries. Winds damaged buildings and crops in Tamaulipas and the southern regions of Texas, with heavy losses to citrus production in the Rio Grande Valley. While only one\u00a0person died in the United States, heavy rains led to catastrophic flooding that claimed at least 31\u00a0lives in northern Mexico; the worst-hit areas were in and near the city of Monterrey. While monetary losses in Mexico were unclear, the storm did at least $3,000,000 in damages in the United States, measured in contemporary U.S. dollars."

        "content": "The July storm was not the last to damage the Treasure Coast of Florida in 1933: a much stronger cyclone in September, with winds of 125\u00a0mph (200\u00a0km/h), extensively damaged the same area that the July storm affected. This storm overshadowed memories of the earlier hurricane, and would be remembered as among the worst on the Treasure Coast as late as the 1980s.[1][2] The occurrence of two\u00a0hurricanes on the east coast of Florida in the same season is a relatively rare event in historical records, but not unprecedented: for instance, forensic research by weather historian David M. Ludlum suggests that two or more hurricanes in 1837 may have affected the region. Citing reports from William Reid in Law of Storms (1838), Ludlum noted that two hurricanes affected Central and Northeast Florida on August\u00a01\u20132 and September\u00a06, respectively, while other storms, potentially hurricanes, may have done so later in September. The September hurricane struck between St. Augustine and Jacksonville. Incidentally, the 1837 Atlantic hurricane season was apparently very active, like 1933; as in 2004, a record four hurricanes hit the state of Florida, including the infamous Racer's hurricane in October.[3]"

        "content": "At 12:00 UTC on July\u00a024, HURDAT initialized a tropical depression some 430 miles (690\u00a0km) east of Saint Lucia in the Windward Islands.[4] (This was at the time that another tropical system formed over 450\u00a0mi (725\u00a0km) east of Bermuda.) Prior to reanalysis in 2012, official records indicated formation at 12:00 UTC on July\u00a025; however, examination of observations from ships and land stations revealed a closed low a day earlier.[5] Upon generation, the depression moved generally west-northwest, toward the eastern Caribbean, becoming a tropical storm at 00:00 UTC on July\u00a025.[4] However, ships and weather stations did not observe gales until later that day, so the winds in HURDAT were interpolated, but based on available data, the storm strengthened steadily.[5] At 16:00 UTC, the British steamship Daytonian recorded a pressure of 1,012\u00a0mb (29.87\u00a0inHg), followed by peak winds of Force\u00a09, about 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h), from the east.[6] Around that time, the island of Antigua also experienced gales and a pressure of 1,002\u00a0mb (29.59\u00a0inHg) as the storm made landfall with winds of 60 to 70\u00a0mph (97 to 113\u00a0km/h).[5] A barometer on Saba measured 983\u00a0mb (29.02\u00a0inHg), implying maximum sustained winds of 85\u00a0mph (135\u00a0km/h);[7] based on this, the storm was posthumously upgraded to hurricane status at 00:00 UTC on July\u00a026, 12\u00a0hours earlier than once designated in HURDAT.[5] As the storm neared Saint Thomas, the island experienced northeast winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h).[8] On its west-northwest course, the storm\u2014now equivalent to a Category\u00a01 hurricane\u2014missed Puerto Rico to its northeast.[4] On July\u00a027, the cyclone brushed Grand Turk and the Caicos, producing winds visually estimated at 85\u00a0mph (137\u00a0km/h) on the former island, with a peripheral pressure of 995\u00a0mb (29.37\u00a0inHg).[8] The hurricane gradually bent to the northwest as it followed the arc of the eastern Bahamas.[4] After 15:00 UTC on July\u00a028, the Norwegian steamship Noreg encountered southeast winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h), yet pressures only dipped to 1,002\u00a0mb (29.58\u00a0inHg).[6] The storm struck Cat Island, Bahamas, around 18:00 UTC with winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h); the next day, the storm made another landfall on the Abaco Islands with the same winds. During this time, the storm turned to the west-northwest, nearing the east coast of Florida;[4] this was likely due to a robust subtropical ridge in the area.[9] Based on ship reports, the storm made its only landfall in the United States on Jupiter Island, between Port Salerno and Hobe Sound, Florida, around 16:00 UTC on July\u00a030.[4] Some hours earlier, the American steamship El Almirante encountered hurricane-force winds\u2014the only such instance at sea in the storm\u2014concurrent with a pressure of 998\u00a0mb (29.46\u00a0inHg).[6][10] Another ship nearby made a reading of 992\u00a0mb (29.29\u00a0inHg) coincident with winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h), hinting that it was taken inside the eye of the storm; calculations by researchers determined that the central pressure was 988\u00a0mb (29.18\u00a0inHg) at the time and at landfall in Florida.[5] While this supported winds of only tropical storm force (70\u00a0mph (115\u00a0km/h)), the storm had a small radius of outermost closed isobar embedded in a ridge of high pressure, so winds in Florida were deemed to be 75\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h), affirming earlier reports that listed the storm as a hurricane at landfall.[5] After landfall, the storm weakened to a tropical storm and moved slowly westward across the south-central peninsula, passing over the northern end of Lake Okeechobee early on July\u00a031. The center of the compact tropical cyclone then passed slightly north of Punta Gorda and reached the Gulf of Mexico, between Venice and Englewood, with winds of 45\u00a0mph (70\u00a0km/h).[4] From this point, few ships were near the center of the storm with which to accurately discern its location and intensity, though data on August\u00a01\u20132 confirmed a weaker cyclone than earlier.[8] At 00:00 UTC on August\u00a01, the storm began a persistent west-southwest motion that continued for the rest of its life cycle. A few ships on August\u00a01\u20133 noted modest gales of 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h), with the lowest pressure on weather maps being 1,004\u00a0mb (29.65\u00a0inHg) at 12:00 UTC on August\u00a03.[5] Based on this pressure, reanalysis inferred that the storm began gradually restrengthening a day earlier, reaching 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) at the time of the reading. Although the storm regained hurricane status at 00:00 UTC on August\u00a04, due to the sparsity of ship data, weather forecasters at the time assumed the storm only contained gale-force winds.[8] For a\u00a0day, the storm briefly angled to the west as it neared the Mexico\u2013United States border, reaching its final and strongest peak of 90\u00a0mph (145\u00a0km/h) late on August\u00a04.[4] Anemometers in Brownsville, Texas, verified a landfall near Playa Lauro Villar, Tamaulipas, just south of the Rio Grande, near 01:00 UTC on August\u00a05. Based on the data, scientists ascertained a radius of maximum wind of about 30\u00a0mi (50\u00a0km) as the eye made landfall.[5] Barometers in Brownsville showed pressures of 981 to 982\u00a0mb (28.98 to 29\u00a0inHg), attesting a central pressure of 975\u00a0mb (28.79\u00a0inHg) in the eye.[5][7][11] Now hooking west-southwest, the storm quickly atrophied as it moved inland and vanished over easternmost Nuevo Le\u00f3n by 18:00 UTC on August\u00a05.[4]"

These were later extended to include the west coast of the state from Punta Rassa to Tarpon Springs.[8] At the time, forecasters were unaware that the storm was of hurricane status; this unawareness extended to the storm's passage over the Gulf of Mexico. Forecasters only issued storm warnings for part of the Texas coast, including the cities of Brownsville and Freeport.[8] Upon news of the storm, businesses in West Palm Beach boarded up vulnerable, expensive plate glass windows.[14] Fearing flooding, authorities were empowered by Florida governor David Sholtz to evacuate over 4,200\u20135,000 residents, most of whom were black farm workers, from low-lying areas around Lake Okeechobee to elevated locations. Most of the evacuees left by train, prompted by fears of washouts on the track beds.[15][16] A day before the storm, the lake level reached 17 feet (5.2\u00a0m), heightening officials' concerns about flooding and spurring the evacuations. Several railway companies lent free transport to their passengers, and trains were conveniently stationed around the lake.[15] The evacuations took place in the communities of Belle Glade, Pahokee, Canal Point, Okeechobee, and Clewiston. Relief organizations and local mayors distributed milk, biscuits, and coffee to evacuees.[17] On the west coast of the state, some residents covered their windows, but many others did not, anticipating little damage from the weak storm. Citizens received radio updates from the Weather Bureau, which gave the position and movement of the storm.[18] Some beachfront residents, such as in Sarasota, left their homes for safety, while boaters secured their vessels.[19][20] In Texas, the Weather Bureau notified people early enough to allow mass evacuations: most coastal residents and camping visitors evacuated the vulnerable islands as the storm neared. Between 60 and 70% of Port Isabel's 500\u00a0residents left before the storm, with the remainder sheltering in a sturdy brick store on the highest land available.[21]"

The barometer dipped to 1,005\u00a0mb (29.69\u00a0inHg) as the storm bypassed the islands to the south.[29] Crops and farm fencing on Saint Croix sustained some damage, though overall effects were limited. Coincidentally, the storm arrived the day after Hurricane Supplication Day, a local tradition marking the opening of hurricane season on the fourth Monday in July.[30] In the Bahamas, winds of 84\u00a0mph (135\u00a0km/h) swept the Abaco Islands early on July\u00a029, but caused only minimal damage there.[31] Other reports indicated more severe damage elsewhere in the islands, including across the Turks and Caicos Islands,[32] and one\u00a0death from drowning.[24] The American schooner Adams, anchored off Grand Turk, was dragged out to sea by the hurricane's waves.[32]"

        "header": "Florida",
        "content": "Wind damage was generally minimal as the small hurricane crossed Florida, except to citrus crops and snapped vegetation in some areas. According to a survey by local fire officials, the calm eye was observed from Hobe Sound to the edge of Stuart, during which passage \"hardly a needle in pine trees along the side of the road could be seen moving.\"[33] Peak winds estimated or registered at 60 to 70\u00a0mph (97 to 113\u00a0km/h) affected the coast between Stuart and Fort Pierce.[25][34] The winds downed several telegraph poles and destroyed a structure at Stuart, but otherwise little damage resulted.[33] Initial reports from Fort Pierce signaled no uprooted trees.[19] Farther south, apart from a snapped coconut palm, the town of Palm Beach evinced little damage to foliage.[35] In Fort Pierce, heavier losses to grapefruit were accounted at about 25%, especially in exposed groves, and some trees suffered total loss of fruit. Shrubs and roofs in the city were damaged as well, but power and water services were quickly revived as the worst of the storm passed.[36] Final losses to citrus in the Indian River region were tallied at 10\u201320%, with much greater tolls locally. Avocado and mango trees also sustained significant damage.[34] A minimum pressure of 1,004\u00a0mb (29.66\u00a0inHg) occurred in Stuart, the same as in Jupiter\u2014both unusually high for a hurricane,[33] though likely related to the storm's small size.[5] In fact, contemporary meteorologists concluded that the storm had only hit Florida at tropical storm strength, with top winds of 70\u00a0mph (113\u00a0km/h) in Stuart.[19][34] Despite the relatively modest winds, prolific rains attended the cyclone. A rain gauge at the Palm Beach Post office in West Palm Beach counted 12.01 inches (305\u00a0mm) on July 30\u201331, setting a 24-hour record at that location\u20143.19\u00a0in (81\u00a0mm) above the daily maximum for the week of the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane. This established a monthly record as well, the total being 23.28\u00a0in (591\u00a0mm) for July.[37] Ultimately, totals exceeding 15.25\u00a0in (387\u00a0mm) fell over a two-day span,[14] with a storm total of 15.7\u00a0in (399\u00a0mm).[9] Other rain gauges, such as one that blew over in Fort Pierce, failed to measure the true totals, which were likely underestimated.[34] The deluge turned lawns into \"small lakes\", overflowed curbs on Royal Palm Way for two blocks, and left up to 1 foot (0.30\u00a0m) of water in the streets of Royal Park, a neighborhood in Palm Beach. Floodwaters submerged all but the highest land on a nearby golf course, which was navigable only by boat.[35] The copious rains submerged roads and rural countryside in Palm Beach, Martin, and St. Lucie counties, but did not render highways impassible for traffic.[38][39] However, roads in the Jupiter area could only be traversed \"with great difficulty\", and water stood 2.5\u00a0ft (0.76\u00a0m) deep on parts of Dixie Highway. Floodwaters shut down a bridge in town, and aside from a West Palm Beach commuter, bus drivers were the only motorists on flooded roads.[40] The Post described the predicament of Matt Platt, the commuter from West Palm Beach, as he entered Jupiter: Trains were getting through but travel by car in any direction was almost taboo. [...] Water ... at times was up to the lights on his car, [and he] was the only person to drive into the town Monday [July 31]...\n\u00a0 \u2003 \u00a0\u2013Palm Beach Post, August 1, 1933[40] Reports from Jupiter detailed a town almost \"cut off\" by floodwaters.[41] A washout affected a 70-foot (21\u00a0m) section of track bed on the Florida East Coast Railway in Port Salerno, halting three passenger trains for a combined 7.5\u00a0hours.[38][40] Nearby, floodwaters stranded two Florida Motor Lines buses as water rose to cover the floors. Relief vehicles later transported passengers on their way.[40] African-American communities in Stuart reported severe flooding as well, and torrential rains formed potholes in streets in West Palm Beach.[14][40] The rains demonstrated that local communities could be stranded, causing funds to be expedited toward bridge repairs on the Loxahatchee River near Jupiter.[42] As late as August\u00a02, floodwaters remained 1.5 to 2\u00a0ft (0.46 to 0.61\u00a0m) deep along Military Trail near West Palm Beach.[43] Flooding in some areas was the worst since a hurricane in October\u00a01924.[35] Winds disrupted communications with small settlements, and Stuart was unreachable for many hours.[19] Loose branches falling on power lines temporarily disrupted electricity in Palm Beach, where flooding affected low-lying ground. The effects were similar to those attending earlier storms.[19] Sewers in West Palm Beach backed up, causing water to seep over Dixie Highway at several spots. The water also submerged an FEC railroad siding and was 1.5\u00a0ft (0.46\u00a0m) deep at the east end of the Royal Park bridge. Several cars were stranded while attempting to navigate flooded streets.[19] Despite inconveniences, residents made good humor of the elements: newspapers noted that a parrot lost shortly before the storm was spotted in a tree, uninjured, and returned to its owner.[44] Inland, the storm caused no appreciable effects as it mostly crossed sparsely settled areas.[19][34] Winds at Okeechobee reached 40 to 50\u00a0mph (64 to 80\u00a0km/h) as the center moved south of that town early on July\u00a031.[15][19] Heavy rains extended over the area, with 24-hour amounts of 12.02\u00a0in (305\u00a0mm) in Indiantown and 15.6\u00a0in (396\u00a0mm) at a water transport lock.[34] Additional heavy rains fell over the west coast of Florida, but to a lesser extent than on the east; as was the case elsewhere, notable wind damage was almost non-existent.[9][34] Little immediate damage from wind and rain resulted in the Everglades and near Lake Okeechobee. Winds peaked at 30\u00a0mph (48\u00a0km/h) in Pahokee, along the lake's eastern shore, and the lake level rose 18\u00a0in (457\u00a0mm) on July 30\u201331, which was not enough to induce flooding, although the Kissimmee River, which fed into Lake Okeechobee, rose steadily, owing to heavy rains.[15] The Weather Bureau office in Tampa recorded peak winds of 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h).[34] In St. Petersburg, citizens enjoyed a refreshing northeast breeze that removed dead fronds from palms, uprooted scattered plants, and sent waves splashing over seawalls. An anemometer operated by United States Airways at Grand Central Airport, a now-defunct airport on Weedon Island,[45] clocked 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h) winds.[18]"

Debris covered streets in nearby Port Isabel, where waterfront fishing huts were wrecked. High seas also destroyed many structures on South Padre Island and partly submerged Padre and Brazos islands.[21][47] High tides eroded 500\u00a0ft (150\u00a0m) of highway on Brazos.[46] Almost no building in Port Isabel went unscathed,[21] with poorly built structures flattened;[46] among the worst hit were at a development company. Early reports confirmed that airborne glass from the local courthouse mildly injured a man in Brownsville.[21] The storm also disrupted communications between the Texas mainland and the barrier islands, where high tides stranded 25\u201330\u00a0campers and a detachment of cavalry from Fort Brown.[21] Two\u00a0hangars in Brownsville collapsed from the winds as well.[26] A smokestack at a canning facility in La Feria collapsed under the strain of high winds.[46] Water levels along the Rio Grande rose by 14\u00a0ft (4.3\u00a0m), though the river ultimately fell short of flood stage and spared surrounding areas of damage.[48] The storm ruined between 8\u201310% of the citrus crop in the Rio Grande Valley, and caused at least one\u00a0death in Texas.[11][49] Localized losses to the citrus crop reached 25% and upwards of 50% of the cotton crop was blown away in the lower valley region.[46] Total crop damage reached $2\u00a0million.[27] In Mexico, the storm produced torrential rains that resulted in severe flooding, particularly in riparian areas along and near the Santa Catarina River in Monterrey, where at least 31\u00a0people died as floods made more than a quarter of the city inaccessible.[22] The collapse of a bridge isolated the Colonia Independencia.[50] Raging waters destroyed 300\u00a0homes in one section alone, forcing occupants to flee, and the number of homeless reached the \"thousands.\"[22][51] Governor L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas and Mayor Calles called upon all city and state facilities for relief efforts.

The fifteenth tropical cyclone and thirteenth named storm of the year, Matthew formed on September 23 and lost its tropical characteristics in the morning of September 26. However, its remnants continued to produce life-threatening rain over parts of Central America as it dissipated. Throughout Central and South America, torrential rain produced by Matthew triggered widespread flooding and landslides. Eight people were killed by the storm in Venezuela, and at least 100 people have been confirmed dead throughout Central America and southern Mexico. In Mexico, a massive landslide, roughly 200\u00a0ft (61\u00a0m) long, buried nearly 300 homes. Initially, officials feared hundreds of casualties, but the impact was much less fatal than expected. Despite the disastrous loss of life caused by the storm, the name Matthew was not retired and was used again in the 2016 season, though it would be retired following that season."

        "content": "The origins of Tropical Storm Matthew were from a tropical wave that emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa on September 11. On the following day, that tropical wave contributed to the development of Hurricane Julia near Cape Verde. The southern portion of the system continued westward into the Atlantic with minimal development until September 20. After no further organization over the last eight days, convection associated with the tropical wave began to increase,[1] and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) first mentioned the wave as an area for potential tropical cyclogenesis on September 21, noting favorable environmental conditions.[2] However, deep convection associated with the system remained disorganized,[1] despite surface and air data indicating an organizing surface circulation.[3] A low pressure area formed on September 22 near Cura\u00e7ao in the south-central Caribbean Sea; at that point, the NHC assessed a high chance of tropical cyclone development.[4] The thunderstorm activity remained disorganized,[5] but on September 23 the convection increased and became better organized,[6]  and curved bands developed throughout the day.[1] Late that day, a Hurricane Hunters flight into the system confirmed the development of a well-defined circulation, and the NHC initiated advisories on Tropical Depression Fifteen about 485\u00a0mi (781\u00a0km) east of Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua.[7] However, post-analysis indicated that the system had already been a tropical depression for six hours.[1] While the National Hurricane Center initially classified the depression, it was noted in post-analysis that the system had already intensified into Tropical Storm Matthew,[1] but was operationally carried as a tropical depression until 21:00 UTC September 23. based on confirmation from Hurricane Hunters. At the time, it was moving generally westward, due to a subtropical ridge over the northwestern Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico. Tropical cyclone prediction models anticipated a path near or over Nicaragua, followed by Matthew stalling near the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula due to a collapse in steering currents. There was uncertainty in the timing of the latter events, and the NHC noted that great intensification could occur if the storm remained over warm waters; this was due to favorable conditions, such as sea surface temperatures exceeding 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F) and an upper-level anticyclone providing good outflow.[8] As the storm gradually strengthened during the morning of September 24 after a burst in convection, and the National Hurricane Center noted that there was a considerable uncertainty over the path Matthew would take in the long run. Some numerical models forecast the tropical storm to pass through the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula into the Bay of Campeche, while others forecast Matthew to reach the peninsula's coast, then do a sharp turn to the northeast back into the Caribbean Sea. As such, the NHC considered its track forecast\u2014and by extension, its intensity forecast\u2014to be of \"low confidence.\"[9][10] Tropical Storm Matthew attained its peak intensity on September 24, 18:00, UTC, with maximum sustained winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 998\u00a0mbar (998\u00a0hPa; 29.5\u00a0inHg). Only an hour later, Matthew made landfall 23\u00a0mi (37\u00a0km) south of the border of Nicaragua and Honduras on September 24 with winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h). Matthew briefly emerged into the Gulf of Honduras and did not re-intensified due to its close proximity with land. Heading west-northwestward toward Belize, Matthew made landfall near Monkey River Town with winds of 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h).[1] After moving inland, Matthew quickly weakened, and was a strong tropical depression only three hours later.[11] From thereon, Matthew underwent further gradual weakening while simultaneously losing forward speed as it moved over southern Mexico. In the morning of September 26, it finally justified its forecast faith by weakening to a remnant low; however, it continued to produce heavy rainfalls over parts of eastern Mexico and other parts of Central America.[12] Matthew's remnants dissipated completely over Mexico, however increased moisture and convection throughout the Bay of Campeche and Caribbean Sea contributed to the development of Tropical Storm Nicole only two days after.[1]"

Costa Rica issued a yellow alert for its coastal region, citing the chance for an indirect impact from the storm. Honduras issued a yellow alert for the Ul\u00faa River area, and issued green alerts for 11 departments of Honduras.[14] On the border with Nicaragua, small communities in the Gracias a Dios province were evacuated, forcing at least 300 people out of their homes. Authorities said that classes would be suspended until further notice and that 15,000 schools had been made available to be used as shelters.[15] Guatemalan authorities ordered evacuations in Izabal between the mouth of the Motagua River and Punta de Manabique. Additionally, the country's Institute of Seismology, Vulcanology, Meteorology and Hydrology (Insivumeh) noted that Guatemala had experienced the most rain since the 1940s as a result of previous storm systems.[16] In neighboring Belize, officials began evacuating three towns near the border with Guatemala after flood waters rose.[15]"

This season was much more active than the previous season, although both seasons were below the Pacific typhoon average of 26. The season ran throughout 2011, though most tropical cyclone tend to develop between May and October. The season's first named storm, Aere, developed on May 7 while the season's last named storm, Washi dissipated on December 19. The season was also much deadlier and destructive than the previous season. Typhoon Muifa affected many countries during August. Tropical Storm Talas and Typhoon Roke made landfall over in Japan and were the most destructive since 2009. Typhoon Nesat was the most powerful to strike China since 2005. Tropical Storm Washi, a late but weak cyclone, affected southern Philippines and killed 2546 people. The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean to the north of the equator between 100th meridian east and the 180th meridian. Within the Northwestern Pacific Ocean, there are two separate agencies who assign names to tropical cyclones which can often result in a cyclone having two names. The Japan Meteorological Agency will name a tropical cyclone should it be judged to have 10-minute sustained wind speeds of at least 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph) anywhere in the basin. Whilst the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration assigns names to tropical cyclones which move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility located between 135\u00b0E and 115\u00b0E and between 5\u00b0N-25\u00b0N even if the cyclone has had a name assigned to it by the Japan Meteorological Agency.

During the early morning of May 12, the JMA downgraded Aere to a tropical depression while south of Kyushu Island as it became a weak extratropical cyclone. Its extratropical remnants finally dissipated on May 15. Throughout the Philippines, multiple agencies activated their emergency plans as the storm approached. The Armed Forces of the Philippines, the Philippine National Police, and the Philippine Coast Guard were all placed on standby to deploy to areas struck by Aere once the storm passed. Several ports were affected by the storm, stranding 1,379 passengers by the afternoon of May 7.[29] According to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council, at least 35 people have been killed and two more are missing as a result of Aere. Agricultural losses are estimated at PHP1.37\u00a0billion (US$31.7\u00a0million).[30] Widespread flooding and landslides damaged homes, blocked off roads and severed communications.

As the system moved towards the northwest under the influence of a subtropical ridge of high pressure, it rapidly consolidated in an area of light to moderate vertical wind shear. The JMA then started to monitor the system as a tropical depression later that day, before the JTWC designated it as Tropical Depression 04W early on May 20. The JTWC then reported later that day that the depression had intensified into a tropical storm with wind speeds of 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph), however, it later reported that it had overestimated the wind speeds and consequently lowered the storm's status to a tropical depression, based on observations from Yap island. Late on May 21, both the JMA and the JTWC reported that the depression had now become a tropical storm with the JMA naming it as Songda. Over the next couple of days, the system gradually intensified further while moving northwest into PAGASA's area of responsibility. PAGASA named it as Chedeng. At 1200\u00a0UTC on May 24, the JTWC reported that Songda had intensified into a typhoon. 12 hours later, the JMA followed suit while the system was located about 800\u00a0km (500\u00a0mi) to the southeast of Manila in the Philippines. It rapidly intensified into a Category 5 typhoon. On the afternoon of May 29, Songda became extratropical south of Shikoku Island.[32]  The extratropical remnants of Sonda later crossed the International Date Line, which was later absorbed by another extratropical cyclone on June 4, and later dissipated completely over Alaska. Although Songda remained offshore, heavy rains within the typhoon's outer bands impacted the Philippines, causing significant flash flooding and landslides. Four fatalities are attributed to the system there.[33] Further north, Okinawa experienced intense wind gusts, measured up to 198\u00a0km/h (123\u00a0mph), along with torrential rain.[34] Extensive damage took place across the area with losses reaching \u00a523.2\u00a0billion ($287\u00a0million);[35] however, there were no fatalities.[36] As it became extratropical, Songda brought heavy rains from Kyushu to eastern Honshu, causing significant flooding.

As a result, Talas accelerated towards the west maintaining strength and outflow.[125] An upper-level cyclone over the system suppressed the convection and kept it from reaching the center. Therefore, Talas remained weak and did not strengthen further. Convection never managed to consolidate the center and convective banding remained well away from the fully exposed low-level circulation center.[126] The convective banding continued to expand more and more with the outer rainbands already brushing parts of Japan. Coastal areas in the nation have already reported gale-force winds several hours before landfall, while the Omega block continued to drive Talas towards the nation.[127] Land interaction weakened Talas, prompting the JMA to downgrade Talas from a typhoon to a severe tropical storm with winds of under 60 knots (110\u00a0km/h; 69\u00a0mph).[128] Early on September 3, Talas made landfall over Aki, Japan.[129] After landfall, Talas accelerated north at over 13 knots (24\u00a0km/h; 15\u00a0mph) and its central convection became significantly eroded and was displaced to the north-east as Talas was exposed to a very strong wind shear of over 50 knots (93\u00a0km/h; 58\u00a0mph) that made the LLCC very distorted and difficult to pin-point. Talas was embedded in a baroclinic zone and the JTWC anticipated an extratropical transition, which prompted them to issue their final warning on the system.[130] On September 5, the JMA issued their final warning on the system, reporting that Talas has become extratropical on the Sea of Japan.[131][132] In October 2011, the JMA upgraded Talas as a typhoon in post-analysis.

Also, they added that Roke developed a 10 nautical miles (19\u00a0km; 12\u00a0mi) eye and a good poleward outflow channel.[156] On September 21, Typhoon Roke made landfall over Hamamatsu, Japan at about 5:00 UTC (14:00 JST).[157] Soon Roke started weakening as cloud tops started getting warmed up and eye diameter started to decrease. However, the system still maintained a near radial outflow and the convective structure continued to remain organized that kept Roke from dissipating rapidly.[158] Although Roke entered a de-intensification phase, it still had plenty of strength that posed a great threat to regions of Japan. Being located approximately 330 nautical miles (610\u00a0km; 380\u00a0mi) southwest of Yokosuka, the typhoon accelerated north-northwestward at approximately 16 knots (30\u00a0km/h; 18\u00a0mph) with winds of over 100 knots (190\u00a0km/h; 120\u00a0mph) (1-min sustained) being a Category 3 typhoon on the SSHS.[159] Being embedded in the baroclinic zone, Roke started its extratropical transition. Also, land interaction severely weakened the storm to a minimal Category 1 typhoon with winds of under 70 knots (130\u00a0km/h; 81\u00a0mph) (1-min sustained).[160] Only six hours later, the storm further weakened and accelerated northeastward at approximately 31 knots (57\u00a0km/h; 36\u00a0mph) with rapidly dissipating deep convection completely sheared to the northeast of the LLCC. As a result, the JTWC ceased advisories on the storm, as it became fully extratropical.[161]"

[173] The transition took place relatively fast because of a frontal boundary and the JTWC reported that Sonca became extratropical early on September 20,[174] while the JMA did the same later in the evening.[175]"

        "content": "On September 23, both the JMA and the JTWC reported that Tropical Depression 20W, had developed about 610\u00a0km (380\u00a0mi) to the southwest of Hag\u00e5t\u00f1a, Guam.[28] Early on September 24, the JMA further upgraded 20W to a tropical storm and named it Nesat.[176] Nesat continued to drift west with expanding deep convection around the entire system and consolidating convection around the LLCC. The mid-level warm anomaly near the system continued to intensify and convective banding near the LLCC became more and more tighter.[177] As a result, the JMA upgraded Nesat to a severe tropical storm on September 25,.[178] Late on the same day, the JMA further upgraded Nesat to a typhoon.[179] The system rapidly deepened and quickly developed a 30 nautical miles (56\u00a0km; 35\u00a0mi) ragged eye and mesoscale anticyclone aloft generating an exceptionally excellent all-around outflow. Also, the system had a highly symmetric radial outflow. The JTWC originally anticipated Nesat to become a category 4 typhoon on the SSHS with winds exceeding 130 knots (240\u00a0km/h; 150\u00a0mph) (1-min sustained). However, because of a cold anomaly, the system only reached a maximum 1-min sustained wind speed of 115 knots (213\u00a0km/h; 132\u00a0mph).[180] Early on September 27, Nesat made landfall over the Luzon region of Philippines. As a result, the eyewall got eroded and the maximum 1-min sustained winds dropped to 95 knots (176\u00a0km/h; 109\u00a0mph). The system approached land at nearly 10 knots (19\u00a0km/h; 12\u00a0mph).[181] However, later on that day, the LLCC started to get re-consolidated with convection as Nesat quickly moved west and re-emerged over water. At that time, it was located near the southern periphery of a deep layered subtropical steering ridge and moved towards the southwest and the winds further dropped to 85 knots (157\u00a0km/h; 98\u00a0mph) because of land interaction.[182] Though the system has maintained overall central deep convection, subsidence persisted along the northwest quadrant which caused further drop in wind speed. Upper level analysis indicated that Nesat was to the south of a ridge axis in an area of moderate vertical wind shear.[183] The system continued to weaken with convective banding loosely wrapped into the partially exposed LLCC. The winds continued to drop and eventually reached 65 knots (120\u00a0km/h; 75\u00a0mph) (1-min sustained) which made it a minimal typhoon on the SSHS. Though the weakening, Water vapour imagery showed that the typhoon was still maintaining excellent outflow towards the equator and improving outflow towards the pole.[184] Nesat maintained a relatively large area of gale-force winds. Animated infrared satellite imagery depicted that the storm was expanding in size and convective banding continued to move further and further away from the LLCC. The LLCC was also relatively large, elongated and cloud free.[185] On September 29, by the time Nesat managed to re-develop ad 10 nautical miles (19\u00a0km; 12\u00a0mi) ragged eye, it made landfall over Wenchang in Hainan, China and started weakening again. Because of the poor shapre and disorganization at the LLCC, the typhoon could only maintain a maximum 1-min sustained windspeed of 65 knots (120\u00a0km/h; 75\u00a0mph).[186] Even after the landfall, Nesat maintained vigorous convection all around the LLCC and did not weaken too much when compared to the reactions after the Philippine landfall. There was a sea-surface temperature of approximately 28\u00a0\u00b0C (82\u00a0\u00b0F) and a slight vertical wind shear of 10 knots (19\u00a0km/h; 12\u00a0mph) near the system's center at that time. The JTWC anticipated the storm to gradually drift over the Gulf of Tonkin and make landfall over Vietnam with a 1-min sustained wind speed of at-least 50 knots (93\u00a0km/h; 58\u00a0mph).[187] Early on September 30, Nesat made its final landfall over northern Vietnam with a 1-mim sustained windspeed of 55 knots (102\u00a0km/h; 63\u00a0mph) and a well-defined, tightly wrapped LLCC, and soon it started weakening. Due to land interaction, the convection around the system started decaying rapidly.[188] Due to the rapid weakening, the JTWC ceased advisories on the storm, soon afterwards.[189] Later that evening, the JMA downgraded Nesat to a tropical low over land and issued their final warning on the system.[190] The residents of Manila had nothing to do but wading through waist-deep floodwaters, dodging branches and flying debris as the typhoon sent surging waves as tall as palm trees over seawalls completely submerging neighborhoods. By the evening of September 27, at-least 7 people were reported to be killed and most of them in metropolitan Manila, a place already battered by heavy monsoonal rains. Similar to the Tulane University during Hurricane Katrina, the Manila Hospital moved patients from its ground floor which was flooded with neck-deep waters. Hospital generators were flooded and the building had no power since the typhoon arrived. Soldiers and police in trucks moved thousands of residents, most importantly the women and the children away from the Baseco shanty after many houses were washed away in the storm surge and floodwaters brought by Nesat. The typhoon made landfall before dawn triggering instant response. Authorities ordered more than a hundred thousand people across the country to flee from Typhoon Nesat's rains and wind gusts. Several schools and offices were shut and thousands were stranded after flight and ferry services were completely disrupted by the fierce storm. Nearly thirty-seven percent of Manila Electric Company's service area was left without power after high winds and heavy rains toppled power lines. Also, in Malabon, Navotas and Valenzuela the Manila Electric power company shut down power to prevent any accidents.[citation needed] During late 2011, the JTWC instead upgraded Nesat from a category 3 to a category 4 typhoon as a post-analysis."

Though a ridge building over China impinged poleward outflow, the euquatoward outflow remained significantly excellent. Haitang was also a slow-mover, moving westward at only 3 knots (5.6\u00a0km/h; 3.5\u00a0mph).[197] However, by the night of September 26, Haitang rapidly accelerated west at over 13 knots (24\u00a0km/h; 15\u00a0mph) and made landfall over Vietnam. Though there was a burst of convection at that time, both land interaction and vertical wind shear weakened the system into a tropical depression and the JTWC ceased their advisories.[198] The JMA tracked Haitang as a tropical depression until it finally dissipated inland Vietnam early on September 27,.[199]"

This prompted the JTWC to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the system early the next day.[201] However less than 3 hours later, the JTWC decided to issue advisories on the system designating it as Tropical Depression 22W, before the JMA reported that the depression had become a tropical storm and named it Nalgae.[200][202][203] The storm slowly drifted to the west and kept on intensifying gradually. Nalgae developed a microwave eye like feature and well defined convective banding in all the quadrants. The system had a tiny radius of winds, though it was still strengthening significantly and was very well defined.[204] On the evening of September 28, the JMA reported that Nalgae continued to intensify, as they upgraded it to a severe tropical storm with winds of over 55 knots (102\u00a0km/h; 63\u00a0mph).[205] On that night, the PAGASA initiated advisories on Nalgae, giving it the local name Quiel, as it entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR).[206] Late on September 29, the JMA upgraded Nalgae to a typhoon. Nalgae rapidly intensified on September 30, and attained category 4 super typhoon status early on October 1, just before making landfall over Luzon. Due to land interaction and colder sea surface temperature in the South China Sea, the JMA downgraded Nalgae to a severe tropical storm on October 2, and then a tropical storm late on October 3. The JTWC downgraded Nalgae to a tropical depression on October 4, and the JMA also did it on the next day. Later on October 5, the remnant low of Nalgae dissipated. Striking the Philippines just days after Typhoon Nesat, Nalgae caused further damage across Luzon. Although first feared that Nalgae would cause much more damage to Luzon, which was severely affected by Typhoon Nesat, damage from the storm was not as anticipated to be lighter than Typhoon Nesat, which ironically is much weaker than Nalgae, but high winds and heavy rains from the storm caused widespread power outages and flooding that left many communities isolated. Nearly 2,900 homes were destroyed and approximately another 15,400 sustained damage. At least 18 people were killed by the storm and another 7 were reported as missing as of October 11. A total of 1,113,763 people were affected by the storm. Total losses in the country reached just over 115\u00a0million PHP (US$2.62\u00a0million).[207]"

        "content": "Hurricane Olivia was a Category\u00a04 hurricane that impacted Hawaii as a weakening tropical storm in mid-September 2018, causing severe flooding and wind damage. Olivia was the first\u00a0tropical cyclone\u00a0to make\u00a0landfall\u00a0on Maui and Lanai\u00a0in recorded history. It was the fifteenth named storm, ninth hurricane, and sixth major hurricane of the 2018 Pacific hurricane season.[2][nb 1] A tropical depression formed southwest of Mexico on September\u00a01, and slowly organized while hindered by northeasterly wind shear, strengthening into Tropical Storm Olivia a day later. Olivia began a period of rapid intensification on September\u00a03, reaching its initial peak as a high-end Category\u00a03 hurricane on September\u00a05. Soon after, the cyclone began to weaken, before unexpectedly re-intensifying on September\u00a06. Olivia peaked as a Category\u00a04 hurricane on September\u00a07, with winds of 130\u00a0mph (215\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 951\u00a0mbar (28.08\u00a0inHg). Six hours later, Olivia began another weakening trend that resulted in the hurricane being downgraded to Category\u00a01 status on September\u00a08, east of the 140th meridian west. Olivia entered the Central Pacific Basin on September\u00a09 while continuing to decay. For much of its existence, Olivia had tracked westward to northwestward under the influence of a subtropical ridge. The cyclone weakened to a tropical storm on September\u00a012, while turning towards the west-southwest as a result of trade winds. Olivia made brief landfalls on Maui and Lanai, with winds of 45\u00a0mph (75\u00a0km/h), later in the day. Olivia fluctuated in intensity as it tracked away from the Hawaiian Islands, before transitioning to a post-tropical cyclone on September\u00a014. It opened up into a trough of low-pressure several hours later. Olivia's approach towards the Hawaiian Islands prompted the issuance of tropical storm watches and warnings for Hawaii County, Maui County, the island of Oahu, and Kauai County. Hawaii Governor David Ige declared Hawaii, Maui, Kalawao, Kauai, and Honolulu counties disaster areas prior to Olivia's landfall in order to activate emergency disaster funds and management. Tropical-storm-force winds mainly affected Maui County and Oahu. Torrential rainfall occurred on both Maui and Oahu, peaking at 12.93\u00a0in (328\u00a0mm) in West Wailuaiki, Maui. Olivia felled trees, and caused thousands of power outages and severe flooding on Maui. Floodwaters deposited debris on roads and caused severe damage to portions of highways, most notably Lower Honoapiilani Road where cliffs were eroded along its shoulder; repairs to that road are still ongoing as of January\u00a02021. In Honokohau Valley, the Honokohau stream rose over 15\u00a0ft (4.6\u00a0m), submerging a bridge and inundating over a dozen homes. Multiple homes and vehicles were swept away by floodwaters. Olivia left the valley without potable water for more than a week. Ditch systems in the valley that supply water to residents were damaged during the storm; repairs cost $300,000\u2013$400,000 (2018 USD) and finished during May\u00a02020. Several hundred power outages occurred on Molokai, and around 1,100 lost power in Honolulu. A pipe overflowed from excessive rainfall on Oahu, sending raw sewage into Kapalama Stream and Honolulu Harbor. United States President Donald Trump issued a disaster declaration for Hawaii to aid with emergency response efforts. Olivia caused a total of $25\u00a0million in damage throughout Hawaii."

        "content": "Hurricane Olivia originated from a disturbance that developed over the southwest Caribbean Sea on August\u00a026. The disturbance tracked westward, crossing over Central America and entering the Eastern Pacific Ocean a couple of days later. Associated thunderstorm activity increased over the next few days, and by early August\u00a031, a broad low-pressure area had developed several hundred miles south of Mexico's southwestern coast. Atmospheric convection organized around the system's center, prompting the National Hurricane Center (NHC) to declare a tropical depression had formed by 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a01, approximately 405\u00a0mi (652\u00a0km) southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico.[1] While the depression was located over warm sea surface temperatures, northeasterly wind shear prevented any intensification from occurring on September\u00a01.[1][4] Although the system was still elongated and disorganized,[5] convection had been increasing over and west of its center. This led to the depression strengthening into Tropical Storm Olivia by 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a02, while it was located 520\u00a0mi (840\u00a0km) south of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico.[1] Soon after, Olivia began a northwestward motion as a result of a weakness in the subtropical ridge located to the north.[1] Wind shear displaced the cyclone's low-level center to the north and northeast of the convective canopy through September\u00a03.[6][7] The wind shear abated early on September\u00a03, allowing Olivia to begin a period of rapid intensification. Meanwhile, the storm turned towards the west as the ridge strengthened.[1] Later in the day, the amount of banding features\u00a0\u2013 significantly elongated, curved bands of rain clouds\u00a0\u2013 increased greatly while Olivia's inner core strengthened;[8] microwave imagery displayed an irregular eye underneath the system's central dense overcast.[9] Olivia became a Category\u00a01 hurricane around 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a04, while located 575\u00a0mi (925\u00a0km) southwest of Cabo San Lucas. The cyclone continued to intensify, reaching its initial peak intensity as a Category\u00a03 major hurricane at 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a05, with maximum sustained winds of 125\u00a0mph (205\u00a0km/h).[1] Around that time, Olivia exhibited a prominent 15\u201325\u00a0mi (24\u201340\u00a0km) wide eye within its central dense overcast.[10] The hurricane began to weaken shortly after its initial peak as sea surface temperatures decreased, wind shear increased, and dry air incorporated into the storm. Olivia's eyewall collapsed in the north and convection eroded in the northwestern quadrant.[1][11] Olivia bottomed out as a minimal Category\u00a02 hurricane around 18:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a05. Models had predicted that Olivia would weaken as a result of dry air and lower sea surface temperatures, however, a second, unexpected round of intensification occurred.[12] At the time, the hurricane's eye was uneven and the convective canopy was lopsided. Olivia strengthened over the next day, regaining major hurricane status by 12:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a06. The cyclone peaked around 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a07, as a Category\u00a04 hurricane with 1-minute maximum sustained winds of 130\u00a0mph (215\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 951\u00a0mbar (28.08\u00a0inHg), while located over 1,265\u00a0mi (2,036\u00a0km) west of Cabo San Lucas.[1] Olivia had become an annular hurricane, developing a cloud-free eye embedded within a symmetric, ring-shaped central dense overcast.[13] Cooler sea surface temperatures of 77\u201379\u00a0\u00b0F (25\u201326\u00a0\u00b0C) and low-to-mid-level dry air caused Olivia to weaken shortly after its peak.[1] Continuing to track west-northwestward under the subtropical ridge,[14] Olivia gradually weakened as it approached the Central Pacific Ocean, with cloud tops warming and its eye temperature decreasing.[15][16] Olivia began tracking westward under the influence of a strengthening subtropical ridge mid-day on September\u00a08.[17] After having fallen to Category\u00a01 status, the cyclone crossed the 140th meridian west and entered the Central Pacific Basin around 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a09.[1] Olivia continued to decay, with its eye disappearing, and the cyclone weakening to a minimal Category\u00a01 storm by 12:00\u00a0UTC.[1][18] Later that day, low wind shear and slightly higher sea surface temperatures allowed Olivia to restrengthen slightly and re-develop an eye feature on satellite imagery. The hurricane strengthened to 85\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) by 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a010 and maintained that intensity for 12 hours before increasing wind shear caused the storm to weaken once more. Olivia's eye became cloud-filled and the system fell below hurricane intensity by 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a011.[1] Increasing wind shear caused faster weakening, displacing convection well to the east of the low-level center.[19][20][21] Olivia weakened into a 45\u00a0mph (75\u00a0km/h) tropical storm by 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a012.[1] Flow from low-level trade winds had turned Olivia to the west-southwest and caused it to slow down by 00:00\u00a0UTC on that day. An upper-level trough shifted the storm back to a westward direction and further reduced its forward speed later that day.[1] Olivia made brief landfalls over Maui and Lanai, the first such instance in recorded history,[22] on September\u00a012, at 19:10\u00a0UTC and 19:54\u00a0UTC, respectively, with sustained winds of 45\u00a0mph (75\u00a0km/h). High wind shear and interaction with the mountainous terrain of the Hawaiian Islands led to the rapid depletion and displacement of convection away from Olivia's center.[1][23] Tracking west-southwestward, away from the Hawaiian Islands, Olivia weakened to tropical depression status by 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a013. Convection briefly redeveloped near the center of the depression, allowing Olivia to become a tropical storm again around 18:00\u00a0UTC. The storm turned westward and transitioned into a post-tropical cyclone by 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a014. This system opened up into a trough of low-pressure about 12 hours later.[1]"

        "content": "Hurricane Olivia's approach towards the Hawaiian Islands warranted the issuance of tropical cyclone watches and warnings. A tropical storm watch was issued for the islands of Hawaii, Maui, Molokai, Lanai, Kahoolawe, and Oahu on September\u00a010 at 03:00\u00a0UTC. By 15:00\u00a0UTC, every watch had been upgraded to a tropical storm warning except for the island of Oahu, which was upgraded at 03:00\u00a0UTC on the next day. Additional tropical storm watches had been issued for the islands of Kauai and Niihau at the same time on September\u00a011. These watches were upgraded to tropical storm warnings by 21:00\u00a0UTC.[1] The United States Coast Guard initiated Condition Whiskey[nb 2] at 08:00\u00a0HST on September\u00a08 for ports in Hawaii, Maui, and Honolulu counties, expecting gale-force winds to occur within 72 hours.[25] Honolulu and Kauai county ports were later upgraded to Condition X-ray, with the expectation of gale-force winds occurring within 48 hours. By 08:00\u00a0HST on September\u00a09, ports in Hawaii and Maui counties were upgraded to Condition Yankee, with the expectation of gale-force winds within 24 hours. At both of these conditions, restrictions were set on ports. Pleasure craft were asked to travel into safer waters, and any barge or other ocean-traveling ship above 200 short tons (180\u00a0t) were asked to remain in port if they had permission to do so or depart from the port if they did not.[26] Ports in Hawaii, Maui, and Honolulu counties were upgraded to Condition Zulu at 08:00\u00a0HST on September\u00a011, when gale-force winds were expected to occur in less than 12 hours. All ports in those counties were closed to naval traffic until the danger from Olivia had ended.[27] Maui County closed all government offices, schools, and the court system in anticipation of Olivia's impact. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) readied personnel and supplies on Maui, and the Hawaii National Guard stationed troops and transportation trucks on the eastern side of the island. Hawaiian Airlines canceled flights for its Ohana commuter airline service.[28] Fees for changing flights were waived by multiple airline companies during the storm.[29] Hawaii Governor David Ige requested federal help for search and rescue, medical evacuations, medical care and shelter commodities, and generators.[30] The governor declared Hawaii, Maui, Kalawao, Kauai, and Honolulu counties disaster areas prior to Olivia's landfall in order to activate emergency disaster funds and management.[31]"

        "content": "Olivia brought heavy rainfall, winds, and high surf to the main Hawaiian Islands, less than a month after Hurricane Lane dropped a record 58\u00a0in (1,500\u00a0mm) of rain on the state.[32][33] From September\u00a011\u201312, 8\u201320\u00a0ft (2.4\u20136.1\u00a0m) high surf was reported along the northern and eastern facing shores of the Big Island, Maui, Molokai, and Lanai. Surf of this magnitude occurred along the southern and eastern shores of Oahu, and Kauai.[34] In Maui County, the Lanai Airport recorded peak wind gusts of 55\u00a0mph (89\u00a0km/h).[35] The highest rainfall occurred near West Wailuaiki on the island of Maui, peaking at 12.93\u00a0in (328\u00a0mm). Around 10.31\u00a0in (262\u00a0mm) of rain was recorded at the Manoa Lyon Arboretum on Oahu.[36] A flash flood warning was issued for Molokai and Maui.[28][37] Olivia felled trees, caused severe flooding, and caused 6,800 power outages on Maui.[38] Rising rivers prompted the evacuation of several residences in Lahaina and another in the Waihee Valley.[37][39] In the former, floodwaters deposited mud in one home and fractured a concrete barrier wall along the property's riverfront boundary.[40] Around 65 reports of damage occurred on Maui, with some reaching complete and total destruction.[41] A brown water advisory, a recommendation for people to stay out of affected waters, was issued on September 18 for coastal waters near Waihe\u02bbe to Kahului and Honok\u014dhau to Honua Kai due to the possibility of contamination from various sources, including chemicals, sewage, pesticides, and animal carcasses. This replaced an advisory that covered the entire island of Maui; that advisory was issued after Olivia moved through the region.[42] Multiple parks and forest reserves were closed to visitors due to a combination of water damage, land erosion, and downed trees.[43] Several sections of the Hana Highway were closed after trees fell.[38] The Honolua Ditch was clogged with debris; authorities asked customers to conserve water for the remainder of September while the ditch was cleaned out and repaired. Floodwaters damaged multiple portions of Lower Honoapiilani Road and eroded cliffs along its shoulder; temporary repairs cost about $50,000 and complete repairs were estimated to exceed $100,000 in cost.[44][45] Temporary cliff restoration work was ongoing as of January\u00a02021, consisting of sandbag and sheet wall repairs. Hololani Resort Condominiums and Goodfellow Bros, the company performing the work, was fined $75,000 in that month for violating state health and county environmental regulations.[46] In the Honokohau Valley, multiple buildings, cars, and trees were swept away by floodwaters. At least a dozen homes were flooded after debris clogged streams, forcing the strong currents to forge new paths.[43][47][48] The Honokohau stream rose 15\u00a0ft (4.6\u00a0m), submerging the Honokohau bridge; debris floating downstream struck the foundations of the bridge.[49] A bridge that provided access to a home was destroyed, resulting in $5,000 in damage. The house suffered flood damage; the telephone and water lines were destroyed. An elderly woman was rescued by her neighbors during the storm. The floor of a house was destroyed after it was submerged under 1\u00a0ft (0.30\u00a0m) of water. Another house had its floors plastered with mud after floodwaters entered the structure.[50] On one property, a home was swept away, and another was moved off its foundation by floodwaters; the latter and a third building both required demolition due to flood damage.[41][51] Another home was swept away by floodwaters and a second house was moved around 100\u00a0yd (91\u00a0m). Around a month after the storm, both homes were intentionally set on fire before repairs could commence; the fires caused a total of $80,000 in damage.[52] The valley was without potable water at least a week after the storm. Maui County workers parked a water tanker on the Honoapiilani Highway while work was underway on water services. Volunteers worked to clear the wreckage left by the storm so buildings could be repaired. The American Red Cross helped with recovery efforts.[50] Maui restaurants donated 100 meals to people affected by the storm and those volunteering to help clear the wreckage left behind.[48] The cost to replace a broken water inflow pipe in the valley was estimated at $100,000.[41][45] A road in Kahana that had been damaged during the storm was repaired for $100,000.[41] Torrential rainfall and flooding from Hurricanes Lane and Olivia reduced water flow and damaged a control gate in the Honokohau Stream ditch system. The ditch provided water to farmers as well as residential areas. The Ka Malu o Kahalawai and West Maui Preservation Association filed a complaint with the state water commission in spring\u00a02019, alleging that the Maui Land & Pineapple Company was wasting water, causing water dearths, and not maintaining critical infrastructure. The state commission approved a motion on November\u00a020, 2019, that The Maui Land & Pineapple Company must upgrade the damaged structures.[53] The Maui Land & Pineapple Company announced on December\u00a04, 2019, that it began repairs on the Honokohau Stream ditch system.[54] The project cost around $300,000\u2013$400,000, with repairs finishing on May 11, 2020.[53] Floodwaters made eastern Molokai's only highway impassable.[37][39] At least 700 power outages occurred on the island, resulting in the closure of a school.[43] Power was restored by September\u00a012; crews fixed multiple areas of downed lines and damaged poles.[55] The storm caused around 1,140 power outages in Honolulu.[56] A roof was blown off a structure in \u02bb\u0100ina Haina. Numerous roads, including portions of the Kamehameha Highway and Kalanianaole Highway, were closed due to flooding.[57] Rainfall from Olivia caused the waterlevel behind the earthen Nu\u02bbuanu Dam #1 to rise 4\u20135\u00a0ft (1.2\u20131.5\u00a0m) overnight, prompting firefighters and officials to pump and siphon water away; however, the dam was not at risk of failure.[58][59][60][61] A pipe overflowed from excessive rainfall, sending over 32,000\u00a0US\u00a0gal (120,000\u00a0L) of raw sewage into the Kapalama Stream and Honolulu Harbor; the city disinfected the waters.[58] At least 775\u00a0US\u00a0gal (2,930\u00a0L) of sewage was contained by a vacuum truck.[57] A 100\u00a0ft (30\u00a0m) landslide occurred at the top of the Manoa Falls Trail around a week after the storm, taking down trees and boulders.[62] According to Aon, Olivia caused a total of US$25\u00a0million in damage throughout Hawaii.[63] United States President Donald Trump declared Hawaii a disaster area to improve the response of FEMA.[37] Bank of Hawaii allocated $25,000 to relief programs for the extension or forbearance of loans, necessary items, and home and vehicle repairs.[55] Hotel occupancy dropped an average of 2.1% in September for Maui compared to the same time in 2017 as a result of hurricanes Lane and Olivia.[64] Overall, tourism increased in the month of October despite the two storms.[65]"

The season officially began on May 15, 2003 in the Eastern North Pacific (east of 140\u00b0W), and on June 1 in the Central (between 140\u00b0W and the International Date Line); both ended on November 30. These dates, adopted by convention, historically describe the period in each year when most tropical cyclogenesis occurs in these regions of the Pacific.[1] The season featured 16 tropical storms, 7 of which intensified into hurricanes, which was then considered an average season. Damage across the basin reached US$129\u00a0million, and 23\u00a0people were killed by the storms.[nb 1] Despite the overall lack of activity, the season produced an unusually large number of tropical cyclones that affected Mexico, with eight tropical cyclones making landfall on either side of Mexico, which was the second highest on record. Tropical Storm Carlos struck Oaxaca in late June, resulting in nine fatalities. In late August, Hurricane Ignacio struck the Baja California Peninsula, killing four people and inflicting US$21 million in damage. In September, Hurricane Marty affected the same areas as Ignacio, and was responsible for 12 casualties and US$100 million in damage, making Marty the costliest and deadliest storm of the season. In October, Hurricanes Olaf and Nora struck western Mexico as tropical depressions, causing slight damage and one casualty. Activity in the Central Pacific was below average, with only one tropical depression forming in the basin and one hurricane entering the basin from the East Pacific. In mid-August, Hurricane Jimena passed just to the south of Hawaii; it was the first storm to directly threaten Hawaii in several years. Also, the remnants of Tropical Storm Guillermo moved into the basin on August 12, prior dissipating the following day."

A total of 15 named storms, 6 hurricanes, and 2 major hurricanes was forecast.[3] Three later days, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) issued its Central Pacific hurricane season forecast, calling for a slightly below-average level of activity due to the expected development of La Ni\u00f1a.[6] La Ni\u00f1a conditions generally restrict tropical cyclone development in the Northeast Pacific, which is the opposite of its effect in the Atlantic.[4] On June\u00a012, 2003, NOAA issued a forecast for the East Pacific hurricane season \u2013 the first time it had done so. The scientists expected that La Ni\u00f1a conditions would develop, and predicted a 50\u00a0percent chance of below normal activity and a 40\u00a0percent chance of near normal activity.[4]"

For the first time since 1977, there were no major hurricanes, where the long-term average is four.[9] (Major hurricanes are storms of Category\u00a03 intensity or higher on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale.[10]) The first hurricane, Ignacio, formed on August\u00a024. This is the latest formation of the first hurricane of a season recorded in the East Pacific since reliable satellite observation began in 1966.[9] The accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index for the 2003 Pacific hurricane season, at 53.4\u00a0units in the Eastern Pacific and 3.3\u00a0units in the Central Pacific, places the season among the top 10 least active seasons since 1971, when reliable records began.[11] While the total activity was below average, there was an unusually high number of landfalls in Mexico. Eight Pacific and North Atlantic tropical cyclones had a direct impact in Mexico in 2003, second only to 1971, when nine did so. This is well above the long-term average of 4.2 Atlantic and East Pacific storms affecting Mexico. Five Pacific storms impacted Mexico; Hurricanes Ignacio and Marty both made landfall in the state of Baja California Sur at hurricane intensity.[9] Two other storms hit mainland Mexico as tropical storms and a third as a tropical depression.[9] Three storms hit Mexico within a very short space of time: the Pacific hurricanes Nora and Olaf, and the Atlantic Tropical Storm Larry. As a result of the flooding caused by these storms, disaster areas were declared in 14 states.[12] Activity in the Central Pacific was below average, with only one tropical depression forming in the basin and one hurricane entering the basin from the East Pacific. A third system, Tropical Storm Guillermo, weakened to a remnant low just to the east of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility. Although activity was generally low, Hurricane Jimena was the first direct threat to the Hawaiian Islands for several years and a hurricane watch was issued for the island of Hawaii. Jimena passed to the south, but still brought tropical-storm-force gusts and heavy rain to the island.[7]"

That day, it attained peak winds of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) by later that day. Although the NHC anticipated further strengthening to major hurricane status, Nora weakened due to increased wind shear from the developing Tropical Storm Olaf to its east.[50][53] By October\u00a05, the eye of Nora was no longer evident on satellite imagery, which indicated the beginning of a weakening trend.[54] The convection became ragged,[55] and on October\u00a06 the winds decreased below hurricane-force. Around the same time, a strong approaching mid-level trough caused Nora to slow and turn to the east.[50] Continued wind shear and the presence of dry air stripped the thunderstorms away from the center,[56] and by October\u00a07 all of the deep convection had dissipated.[57] As a result, it was downgraded to a tropical depression,[50] and Nora weakened to the extent that it barely met the criteria for being a tropical cyclone.[58] Nora rapidly accelerated towards the east-northeast toward Mexico in response to the approaching trough.[59] Thunderstorms redeveloped over the center as Nora approached western Mexico,[60] and it made landfall near Mazatl\u00e1n, Sinaloa early on October\u00a09. It dissipated shortly thereafter over the high terrain of western Mexico.[50] Ahead of the storm's landfall, Mexico's Servicio Meteorol\u00f3gico Nacional issued advisories and bulletins regarding the threat from the storm.

Olaf moved erratically before ultimately accelerating northward toward the Mexico coast, and it made landfall about 20 miles (32\u00a0km) west of Manzanillo with winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) on October\u00a07. The system weakened as it moved inland, falling to tropical depression intensity late on October\u00a07 and dissipating early the next day.[65] Since Olaf struck the Mexico coastline as a more coherent system than Nora, it produced significantly more rainfall across the region,[66] resulting in severe flooding in the states of Jalisco and Guanajuato. These rains damaged crops, roads, and over 12,000 houses.[65] One fatality was reported.[18]"

The incipient disturbance slowly organized as it moved west-northwest south a ridge, organizing into a tropical depression around 12:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a020 about 460\u00a0mi (740\u00a0km) south of Acapulco. Six hours later, it intensified into Tropical Storm Patricia while paralleling the Mexico coastline well offshore. As banding features increased in association with the cyclone, and as it developed an eye, Patricia became the season's final hurricane around 12:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a021.[67] It peaked with winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) twelve hours later, despite predictions of a much stronger storm.[68] On October\u00a022, the cyclone encountered wind shear associated with an upper-level trough near Baja California, and its circulation quickly became displaced from associated thunderstorm activity. It fell below hurricane strength that day but fluctuated in intensity through October\u00a025. Early that day, Patricia weakened to a tropical depression, and by 06:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a026, it degenerated to a remnant low. The low turned west and dissipated twelve hours later.[67]"

In \u00d6rebro the maximum temperature recorded was \u22120.6\u00a0\u00b0C (30.9\u00a0\u00b0F) and in V\u00e4ster\u00e5s \u22121\u00a0\u00b0C (30\u00a0\u00b0F),[2] which is very rare for an area so far south in Sweden.

Stockholm and Gothenburg both recorded 7 days with highs below freezing, something that is highly unusual for the country's big cities in November. Even more remarkable were the five ice days measured in Malm\u00f6, with southern Scania often averaging means above freezing even in January.

Out of SMHI's 100 selected monthly stations, the \u221216.2\u00a0\u00b0C (2.8\u00a0\u00b0F) mean of Nikkaluokta was the lowest ever recorded for the month, and lower than its January normals.

Although January 2010 had been slightly colder than what was recorded in the south of the country, December is normally a month that is above freezing during daytime in southern Sweden due to its seasonal lag that a maritime climate brings. Although the month started out quite mild, temperatures plummeted to extreme cold as winter solstice and Christmas neared.[11] Most of the month was solidly below freezing in the entire country, with a few bursts of mild air affecting the deep south. The cold just before Christmas was unprecedented this time of the year in many southern locations. Kalmar saw a record cold \u221225.6\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221214.1\u00a0\u00b0F) value, Kristianstad another record \u221224.6\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221212.3\u00a0\u00b0F) value, with \u00d6rebro nearly beating its December all-time record cold with \u221226.6\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221215.9\u00a0\u00b0F), the coldest value for 124 years.[11] During Christmas, the most extreme cold had swept north, with several coastal cities of Norrland recording temperatures around \u221230\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221222\u00a0\u00b0F).[11] This, albeit highly unusual, did not break any December records. Temperatures throughout the months in the northern parts of the country were quite far below normals, resulting in the cold wave being felt in the entire country. In the south, the New Year's Eve brought milder air, bringing temperatures just above freezing for that night.[11] This marked the end of the cold wave in the south, with January 2011 being a normal winter month. The cold returned to normal levels further north as well, although winter temperatures there are more extreme than a cold wave in the south regardless. The coldest temperature of the month and year was recorded in Nikkaluokta on 20 December, with \u221242.1\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221243.8\u00a0\u00b0F).[11] The fallout of December were a lot of new all-time low monthly mean temperatures in southern Sweden. The most extreme new record was set in Arvika, V\u00e4rmland, with a monthly mean of \u221214.6\u00a0\u00b0C (5.7\u00a0\u00b0F) and a low of \u221220.2\u00a0\u00b0C (\u22124.4\u00a0\u00b0F).[12] This was more than three degrees colder than the previous December record for the site and less than half a degree below the deep freeze of January 1987, in all possibly the coldest December month there since 1788. Among other new December record cold months were found in \u00d6rebro, Norrk\u00f6ping, Link\u00f6ping, Gothenburg, Malm\u00f6, Kalmar, V\u00e4xj\u00f6, Kristianstad, Halmstad, Varberg, Bor\u00e5s, V\u00e4nersborg, Helsingborg, Ljungby, Visby and many maritime coastal stations such as Falsterbo, Landsort and the extreme points of \u00d6land.[12] The \u22125.3\u00a0\u00b0C (22.5\u00a0\u00b0F) reading of Helsingborg was also almost three degrees colder than the previous record."

Prices for energy slipped into negative values as low as minus \u20ac83.06 per megawatt hour, with an average low of minus \u20ac52.11 (normal energy prices are \u20ac37 per megawatt hour). These values were the lowest since Christmas 2012. This can lead to a situation where Austria and Switzerland find it attractive to use the energy in their pumped storage reservoirs, where it can later be sold back to Germany.[14] Herwart was not as strong as Xavier which struck Germany earlier in October 2017.[15] Herwart is considered one of the strongest storms of the past 10 years in Germany, ranked in 8th place in the strongest storms there in the last decade, but not considered memorable when compared to the strongest storms such as Kyrill (2007) and Lothar (1999).[16] Herwart was responsible for the worst insurance losses in the Czech Republic since the storms Kyrill and Emma (2008).[17]"

Parks in New York City were closed, and construction was halted.[10] In Nassau County, New York, more than 140\u00a0trucks put sand and salt on roads.[11] Schools were closed in Connecticut.[12] Due to sufficiently cool air and steady snowfall, the National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning.[15] The New York Red Bulls had to postpone a Major League Soccer tournament game due to the snow.[16] Across New Jersey and New York, the storm dropped rain and snow in areas that sustained significant damage from Hurricane Sandy about ten days prior.[11] Snowfall spread from New Jersey to Maine, peaking at 13.5\u00a0in (34\u00a0cm) in Clintonville, Connecticut, and the highest associated rainfall total was 2.28\u00a0in (5.8\u00a0cm) near Kingston, Massachusetts.[6] Snowfall in Central Park reached 4.7\u00a0in (12\u00a0cm),[6] which broke the daily record and also the record for the earliest date of more than 4\u00a0in (10\u00a0cm) at the location. A daily snowfall record was also broken in Newark, New Jersey, with a total of 2\u00a0in (5.1\u00a0cm),[17] while Bridgeport, Connecticut set a record for their biggest November snowstorm on record, with 8\u00a0in (20\u00a0cm).[18] The nor'easter also produced strong winds that peaked at 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) in Fairhaven, Massachusetts.[6] High winds downed trees that were weakened by Sandy, some of which fell onto power lines. About 50,000\u00a0people lost power in the two states who had previously lost power after the hurricane. Along the coast, the storm produced 8\u00a0ft (2.4\u00a0m) waves,[10] and coastal roads were flooded.[11] There were two traffic deaths in Connecticut that were related to the storm.[12] On November 8 as of 9 a.m. EST, around 715,000 eastern U.S. homes and businesses were without power. This is an increase of nearly 43,000 from 12 hours earlier, due to the effects of the storm.[19] There were 167,000\u00a0power outages in New Jersey alone, and at least 50,000 on Long Island.[17] At 6 a.m. EST on November 9, about 265,000 New Jersey homes and businesses were without power because of Sandy and the nor'easter.[20]"

It was the coldest January at Kew since 1838.[15] In January 1963, the sea froze for one mile (1.6\u00a0km) from shore at Herne Bay, Kent.[16][17] The sea froze inshore in many places, removing many British inland water birds' usual last resort of finding food in estuaries and shallow sea. The sea froze 4 miles (6\u00a0km) out to sea from Dunkirk.[8] The upper reaches of the River Thames froze over,[14][18] although it did not freeze in Central London, partly due to the hot effluent from two thermal power stations, Battersea and Bankside. The removal of the multi-arched London Bridge, which had obstructed the river's free flow, and the addition of the river embankments, kept the river from freezing in London as it had in earlier times (see River Thames frost fairs). On 20 January, 283 workers had to be rescued by RAF helicopters from Fylingdales, where they had been snowbound for several days.[8][19] The ice was thick enough in some places that people were skating on it,[8] and on 22 January a car was driven across the frozen Thames at Oxford.[8][19] Icicles hung from many roof gutterings, some as long as 3 feet (0.9\u00a0m).

A board known as the Pools Panel was set up to adjudicate postponed matches to provide the football pool results.[20] From 8 December to 16 February, Bolton Wanderers played no competitive matches.[21] Both codes of rugby, union and league, suffered much the same fate.[22] The delays occurred before under-soil heating became widespread at major venues. When the thaw arrived, a backlog of fixtures had to be hastily determined. The Football League season was extended by four weeks from its original finishing date of 27 April. The final league fixtures (scheduled sports events) took place one day before the rescheduled FA Cup final. Some lower-level competitions did not complete the season. National Hunt horse racing was also affected by the weather. Ninety-four meetings were cancelled during the freeze. There was no racing in England between 23 December and 7 March, although a meeting at Ayr in Scotland occurred on 5 January.[23]"

The 2017 Christmas special and first episode of season seven of Call the Midwife were set during the winter of 1962\u20131963. The cold was a factor in several of the drama's plot points.[24] Actress Jenny Agutter, who plays Sister Julienne, wrote an article in The Times about her memories of the 1962\u201363 winter to coincide with the Christmas special.[25] Several episodes of the television drama series The Edgar Wallace Mysteries were filmed during the 1962\u20131963 winter, and the effects of the Big Freeze on both urban and rural locations were captured on film. The 1963 crime film Calculated Risk was filmed during The Big Freeze and makes ample use of the weather, with music composed by George Martin while he was working with The Beatles. The 2001 Doctor Who novella Time and Relative written by Kim Newman and published by Telos Publishing was set during the winter of 62/63 and the author posits that it is an alien 'cold' entity which is causing the wintery conditions.

The phenomenon was caused by an unusually strong high pressure system over Saskatchewan with a core pressure of 1055mb (31.15 inHg), a level rarely seen outside of permanent polar areas such as Siberia and Antarctica. A recent snowfall had left the ground without any way to hold on to its heat and temperatures dropped precipitously. This mass of cold air was so strong that the temperature at Mequon, Wisconsin, dropped to \u221240\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221240\u00a0\u00b0C);[citation needed] the previous record was \u221228\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221233\u00a0\u00b0C) and temperatures below \u221220\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221229\u00a0\u00b0C) had been felt there only six times in the previous 100 years. The lowest temperature recorded that day in the United States was \u221252\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221247\u00a0\u00b0C), measured near Tower, Minnesota. Below is a partial list of cities which set all-time record low temperatures in the United States.

The third named tropical cyclone of the 2013 Pacific hurricane season, the storm system formed from a tropical wave south of Manzanillo, Colima, on June\u00a023. The cyclone intensified into a tropical storm on June\u00a024, and soon after strengthened into a hurricane on June\u00a025. Early the following day, Cosme attained its peak intensity as a Category\u00a01 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale with maximum sustained winds of 85\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 980\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.94\u00a0inHg). However, Cosme then began to encounter stable air and lower sea surface temperatures, causing the system to weaken to a tropical storm late on June\u00a026. The system continued to weaken and degenerated into a remnant low pressure surface trough about 690\u00a0mi (1,110\u00a0km) west-southwest of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, on June\u00a027. The remnants persisted until dissipating well east-southeast of the Hawaiian Islands on July\u00a01. In anticipation of the storm, the Servicio Meteorol\u00f3gico Nacional of Mexico issued a blue alert (minimum risk) for the states of Guerrero, Nayarit, and Baja California Sur; and a green alert (low risk) for Michoacan, Jalisco, and Colima. The outer rainbands brought moderate rains to Guerrero, causing minor flooding in Acapulco. Across the state, the storm generated 24 landslides, which blocked highways. Two people were killed in the Guerrero, one a tourist that drowned in Zihuatanejo and the other a police officer in an airplane crash that injured 19 others. High seas flooded numerous buildings across coastal towns in Colima, damaging 34 tourist facilities and killing one person. Additionally, many restaurants built of wood and coconut were damaged. The port in Manzanillo was closed to small craft, as was the port of Mazatlan. Overall, 50 homes were damaged by the storm. Cosme also brought rough seas and gale force winds to the Revillagigedo Islands."

        "header": "Meteorological history",
        "content": "Hurricane Cosme can be traced to a tropical wave that formed on the west coast of Africa on or around June\u00a08. That westward moving wave, which was also responsible for the formation of Tropical Storm Barry in the Caribbean Sea,[1] eventually reached the Eastern Pacific Ocean. The progress of the wave was slowed by a southwesterly movement within the Intertropical Convergence Zone.[2] During the morning hours of June\u00a020, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring a broad area of disturbed weather several hundred miles southeast of Acapulco, Mexico.[3] Assessed with a low chance of tropical cyclone formation within a two-day interval, conditions at the time were unfavorable but expected to become more conducive for development over subsequent days.[4] As the disturbance tracked generally west-northwestward, a broad area of low pressure developed; the NHC increased the chances of formation accordingly.[5] Convection \u2013 shower and thunderstorm activity \u2013 became steadily concentrated around the low-level center and spiral banding became evident. Following organizational improvement on satellite and microwave images,[6] the system became Tropical Depression Three-E at 12:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a023 while located about 500\u00a0mi (800\u00a0km) south of Manzanillo, Colima.[2] Several hours later, the NHC stated that, \"the largest negative factor is probably the size of the depression...which could keep it from rapidly intensifying.\"[7] The depression did not become better organized initially, with meager central convection and a lack of well-defined cloud features; by early on June\u00a024, however, shower and thunderstorm activity began forming over the center. Two Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) passes indicated several 39 to 43\u00a0mph (63 to 69\u00a0km/h) wind vectors,[8] and the cyclone became Tropical Storm Cosme around 00:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a024.[2] A small central dense overcast-like feature was observed at the time.[8] Tracking west-northwestward around the southwestern periphery of a mid-level ridge over central Mexico,[9] Cosme became better organized on June\u00a024. A large area of very cold cloud-tops developed over and just southeast of the center of the storm, and convective banding wrapping into the mass began to form, mainly in the north and east semicircles.[10] Though the cloud pattern became elongated north to south during the pre-dawn hours of the following day,[11] a rapid improvement of the inner core on microwave and the structure on satellite imagery became apparent. A timely AMSU pass indicated an eyewall nearly closed with an accompanying intensity estimate of 77\u00a0mph (124\u00a0km/h), and a transient eye became visible on early morning satellite images. As a result, the National Hurricane Center upgraded Cosme to a Category\u00a01 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale on June\u00a025.[12] Given the light wind shear, warm sea surface temperature, and moist air environment, the agency predicted further intensification for the following hours.[13] Around 00:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a026, Cosme attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 85\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 980\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.94\u00a0inHg).[2] Thereafter, a decrease in sea surface temperatures caused convection on the west side of the circulation center began to erode significantly.[14] Late on June\u00a026, the system weakened to a tropical storm.[2] The tropical storm wind radii expanded early the following day, but the inner core of Cosme, specifically the structure of the eye, began to degrade; the low-level circulation became decoupled with the upper-level circulation as well, and all thunderstorm activity dissipated.[15] Reduced to a swirl of low to mid-level clouds, winds decreased below tropical storm-force and deep convection did not reform over the center.[16] At approximately 12:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a027, Cosme degenerated into a remnant low pressure area while situated about 690\u00a0mi (1,110\u00a0km) west-southwest of Cabo San Lucas, Baja California Sur. The remnant low of Cosme continued northwestward for the next several days, before degenerating into an open trough on July 1 about 1,610\u00a0mi (2,590\u00a0km) east-southeast of the Hawaiian Islands.[2]"

Mexican authorities remained active throughout the disturbance and government officials began surveying and rebuilding damaged infrastructure as early as June\u00a027. Multiple ports closed down small craft operation because of the weather. During the storm the port of Manzanillo and Mazatlan closed down for small craft operation.[17][18]  At least one death was caused when a tourist ignored these closures and was thrown overboard while operating a small boat during the storm.[19] When Cosme became a tropical storm on June\u00a024, the Mexican National Weather Service (Servicio Meteorologico Nacional NWS) reported that it could produce heavy rains in the western area of the country. Rainfall as a result of the storm was predicted to range from \"intense\" to \"heavy\" in the states of Colima, Jalisco, Guerrero, Michoacan, and Oaxaca. The Mexican NWS also that \"because of its wide circulation, [Cosme] generates significant potential for landslides and intense rain...waves 4 to 5 meters high and strong gusts of wind along the coast.\"[20] Based on these forecasts the SINAPROC initially issued a green alert \"low risk\" hurricane warning within the states of Jalisco, Michoacan, and Colima, as well as a blue alert \"minimum risk hurricane warning  for the states of Nayarit and Guerrero.[21] The continued strengthening of Cosme caused SINAPROC to issue a blue alert to Baja California Sur, stating that the system has strong potential to cause heavy rains despite its relatively long distance off shore.[22] Upon passing near  the Revillagigedo Islands on June\u00a025\u201326, Cosme generated large waves and strong winds. The Mexican Navy station on Socorro Island reported a gust of 46\u00a0mph (74\u00a0km/h).[2][23] Hurricane Cosme caused minor, but widespread, damage on mainland Mexico. Unstable structures, such as those made of wood and coconut, suffered the most damage as a result of the storm. Flooding and multiple landslides also left damaged and caused road blockages.[24][25] Heavy rains were reported in southwest and south central Mexico, particularly in Michoacan. High waves were reported along the coast from Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco, to Acapulco, Guerrero.[26] In Guerrero, rain caused at least 24\u00a0landslides, blocking state highways in several locations. Precipitation as a result of the storm system also resulted in flooding in the port city of Acapulco.[27] Storm flooding damaged 50\u00a0homes, mainly due to the overflown streams of the Tlapa River.[24] In Colima, coastal flooding induced by a storm surge damaged 34 tourist facilities, according to the Secretary of State Economic Development. Most of these facilities were located in the municipalities of Tecomny and Armory.[17][18] Several injuries and three deaths were attributed to the storm, two of which occurred in Guerrero. The first was an auxiliary member of the Mexican Highway patrol whose vehicle collided with a truck on the Mexico City-Acapulco road during inclement weather. Four others were injured in the same accident.[28] Another 19\u00a0injuries resulted from two similar accidents that were also attributed to weather caused by the hurricane.[citation needed] The second death associated with the storm occurred after a man was thrown overboard his boat by high waves and drowned.[19] In the wake of the storm system, the body of a middle aged man was discovered on a beach in Cuyutlan, Colima.  However, it is questionable whether or not he was killed as a result of the hurricane because his injuries indicate that he had been dead for several days.[25]"

        "content": " The 1928 Haiti hurricane was considered the worst tropical cyclone in Haiti since the 1886 Indianola hurricane. The second tropical cyclone and second hurricane of the season, the storm developed from a tropical wave near Tobago on August\u00a07. Steadily intensifying as it moved northwestward, the system passed through the southern Windward Islands. Upon entering the Caribbean Sea early on August\u00a08, the tropical depression strengthened into a tropical storm. On August\u00a09, the storm strengthened to the equivalent of a Category\u00a01 hurricane. The next day, the hurricane peaked with winds of 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h). After striking the Tiburon Peninsula of Haiti, the cyclone began weakening and fell to tropical storm intensity on August\u00a012. By midday on the following day, the storm made landfall near Cienfuegos, Cuba. Upon emerging into the Straits of Florida, the storm began to re-strengthen. Early on August\u00a013, it struck Big Pine Key, Florida, as a strong tropical storm. Weakening slowly while moving north-northwestward, the system made another landfall near St. George Island. After moving inland, the tropical storm slowly deteriorated and dissipated over West Virginia on August\u00a017. In Haiti, the storm completely wiped out livestock and many crops, particularly coffee, cocoa, and sugar. Several villages were also destroyed, rendering approximately 10,000\u00a0people homeless. Damage reached $1\u00a0million and there were at least 200\u00a0deaths.[nb 1] The only impact in Cuba was downed banana trees. In Florida, the storm left minor wind damage along the coast. A Seaboard Air Line Railroad station was destroyed in Boca Grande, while signs, trees, and telephone poles were knocked down in Sarasota. Several streets in St. Petersburg were closed due to flooding or debris. Between Cedar Key and the Florida Panhandle, several vessels capsized. Water washed up along the side of roads and in wooded areas. The storm contributed to flooding onset by the previous hurricane, with rainfall peaking at 13.5\u00a0in (340\u00a0mm) in Caesars Head, South Carolina. The worst impact from flooding occurred in North Carolina, where several houses were destroyed. Six people were killed in the state, of which four due to flooding. Property damage in the state totaled over $1\u00a0million. Overall, the storm caused at least $2\u00a0million in damage and 210\u00a0fatalities."

Initially, the storm was considered a \"disturbance of slight to moderate intensity\". Moving northwestward, the system passed through the Windward Islands just south of Carriacou and Petite Martinique. Upon entering the Caribbean Sea early on August\u00a08, a ship reported winds of 46\u00a0mph (74\u00a0km/h). As a result, HURDAT indicates that the depression became a tropical storm at 00:00\u00a0UTC. On August\u00a09, the storm strengthened into a Category\u00a01 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale, while located about 155\u00a0mi (249\u00a0km) south of San Pedro de Macor\u00eds, Dominican Republic. At 12:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a010, the cyclone attained its peak intensity as strong Category\u00a01 hurricane with maximum sustained winds with winds of 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 998\u00a0mbar (29.5\u00a0inHg). Early on August\u00a09, the storm made landfall in the Tiburon Peninsula of Haiti, based on \"belated reports [indicating] that a very small but destructive disturbance passed over extreme southwest Haiti\". The quickly re-emerged into the Caribbean Sea later that day.[1] A small cyclone, the hurricane passed between Cuba and Jamaica and weakened to a tropical storm early on August\u00a012. By midday, the storm made landfall near Cienfuegos, Cuba, with winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h). Several telegraphic reports indicated that \"the center [of the storm] was not definitely traceable for the next 24 to 36 hours\", but other reports noted that the center passed over then-Oriente Province. Hours later, the system reached the Straits of Florida and immediately began to re-intensify. Early on August 13, it struck Big Pine Key, Florida, as a strong tropical storm with winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h). Thereafter, the storm moved north-northwestward over the Gulf of Mexico. At 14:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a014, it made landfall near St. George Island, Florida, with winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h). After moving inland, the tropical storm slowly deteriorated, falling to tropical depression intensity over east-central Alabama on August 15. Thereafter, the depression moved north-northeastward and dissipated over West Virginia on August\u00a017.[1]"

Many villages were completely destroyed, leaving over 10,000\u00a0people homeless.[3] The city of Saint-Louis-du-Sud was almost completely wiped out, with only two buildings retaining their roofs.[4] Additionally, approximately 80% of buildings in Grand-Boucan and Petit Trou were flattened. Overall, most municipalities were flooded with 8 to 20\u00a0ft (2.4 to 6.1\u00a0m) of water. At least 200\u00a0deaths were recorded,[3] including 26\u00a0in Mirago\u00e2ne and 12 at a single dwellings in Belle-Riviere. In the most devastated areas, flooding also killed all farm animals and entire coffee, cocoa, and sugar crops were wiped out. An estimated three to six months was required to regrow the lost agriculture.[5] Along the coast, rough seas capsized or washed ashore many small crafts. The storm was described as the worst in Haiti since the 1886 Indianola hurricane.[3] The storm destroyed most of the unpaved, vehicular trails in its path.[6] Overall, the damage to roadways, communications, and public services was estimated at $1\u00a0million.[3] After the storm, approximately 100,000\u00a0people were facing starvation. Then-Haitian president Louis Borno reported that the government had inefficient resources for recovery and asked citizens to assist with repairing infrastructure and providing food and shelter to others.[5] The Government of Haiti, in turn, appropriated $200,000 for relief. Eleven storages with relief supplies were established throughout the country.[7] The approximately 10,000\u00a0people left homeless were temporarily houses in larger, undamaged buildings.[8] Within a few months after the storm, 299\u00a0homes were rebuilt or repaired, costing almost $37,000. The vehicular paths destroyed by the hurricane were eventually replaced by 10\u00a0ft (3.0\u00a0m)-wide paved gravel roads.[6] In September, the American Red Cross donated $10,000 to the Haitian Red Cross.[4] In Cuba, the storm brought gusty winds and excessive rainfall, but impact was primarily limited to fallen banana trees in an area then known as Oriente Province.[1]"

However, the highest observed wind speed was only 36\u00a0mph (58\u00a0km/h).[1] Between Cedar Key and the Florida Panhandle, some residents took refuge at churches and schools.[9] In the mainland of Florida, winds resulted in generally minor damage along the west coast. In Boca Grande, a Seaboard Air Line Railroad station was destroyed. Plate glass was damaged and signs, trees, and telephone poles were knocked down in Sarasota. Rough seas began smashing a revenue cutter service ship docked at the Coast Guard station in St. Petersburg against the wharves; bumpers were placed between the ship and pilings to further damage. Several streets were closed due to flooding or debris. One street closed after roof tiles started falling from a theater. At one intersection, several cars were stranded due to 3\u00a0ft (0.91\u00a0m) of water covering the road. Although some coastal areas experienced rough seas, others reported their lowest tides in years, especially Pass-a-Grille and Tampa, with almost all of the water blown out of Boca Ciega Bay, which is located adjacent to the former.[10] Several vessels, mostly small fishing crafts, capsized. Water washed up along the side of roads and in wooded areas, while many trees were toppled.[9] The storm also contributed to ongoing flooding in the Southeastern United States onset by the previous hurricane. In Georgia, hydroelectric dams in Quitman were overtopped by creeks and rivers. One highway was completely submerged and four bridges were swept away. A railroad passenger train was abandoned due to water rising above the tracks. The Ocmulgee River at Macon crested at 20.9\u00a0ft (6.4\u00a0m). Additionally, the Withlacoochee River was expect to reach its highest level in years. Overall, crops, highways, and railroads across the southern portion of the state were severely damaged. Milledgeville was left without water due to flooding. The Oconee River was expected to reach 34\u00a0ft (10\u00a0m) in height at the city's river gauge. A bridge across the Oconee was swept away as was approximately 1,500\u00a0ft (460\u00a0m) of railroad tracks.[11] About 200\u00a0families in Augusta evacuated due to the rising Savannah River. In South Carolina, rainfall peaked at 13.5\u00a0in (340\u00a0mm) in Caesars Head, which is the highest precipitation total associated with the storm.[12] The city of Spartanburg prepared for its worst flood since 1916. Throughout Upstate South Carolina, highways, railroads, and crops were flooded. In Bath, a \"freakish\" tornado destroyed at least 50\u00a0homes and injured one person. Additionally, a wind storm in Newberry County severely damaged \"scores\" of dwellings.[9] Two deaths occurred in South Carolina.[13] In North Carolina, rainfall caused the Catawba, French Broad, Swannanoa, and Yadkin rivers to overflow their banks. Many nearby homes and structures were swept away.[13] Families along the South Pacolet River near Tryon were evacuated. Additionally, two shelters were set up in Asheville, one at a Salvation Army post and another at the municipal auditorium, where hundreds of cots were set-up. A mudslide near Asheville moved across a railroad track, blocking the route to locomotive traffic.[9] Several feet of water covered highways near Marshall, leaving many roads impassable. Extensive crop losses also occurred in western North Carolina, with agricultural losses reaching $250,000 in Burke County alone.[13] Six people were killed in the state, of which four due to flooding and two others from a tornado in Ashley Heights.[13] Property damage totaled over $1\u00a0million.[14] Rainfall from both the previous hurricane and this storm brought flooding to Virginia. Major flooding was reported along the Roanoke River from Brookneal to Roanoke. At the former, the river crested at 14\u00a0ft (4.3\u00a0m) above flood stage.[15] In Altavista, crops were ruined and 11\u00a0buildings were flooded. Route 17 north of Fincastle was inundated, blocking traffic between Clifton Forge and Covington. Two deaths occurred in Virginia, one from drowning and another from fright while crossing the Roanoke River.[13]"

        "content": " Hurricane Gordon was an erratic, long-lived, and catastrophic late-season hurricane of the 1994 Atlantic hurricane season. The twelfth and final tropical cyclone of the season, Gordon formed as a tropical depression in the southwestern Caribbean on November\u00a08. Without strengthening, the depression made landfall on Nicaragua. Later on November 10, the system began to strengthen as it tracked further from land, and it quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Gordon, the seventh named storm that season. Gordon also made landfalls in Jamaica and Cuba while a minimal tropical storm. It entered the southwestern Atlantic while resembling a subtropical cyclone. By the time it entered the Gulf of Mexico, the storm was fully tropical again. Tropical Storm Gordon later crossed the Florida Keys, and turning to the northeast it made landfall in Fort Myers, Florida. Gordon strengthened after it re-entered the Atlantic Ocean, becoming a hurricane on November 17. It briefly threatened North Carolina while turning to the northwest, although it turned to the south and weakened. Gordon deteriorated into a tropical depression and struck Florida again at that intensity on November\u00a020. It turned to the north and dissipated the next day over South Carolina. Gordon first caused flooding in northern Costa Rica that destroyed 700\u00a0houses and caused $30\u00a0million in damage. There were six deaths in the country and an additional two deaths in neighboring Panama. Upon affecting Jamaica, the storm was responsible $11.8\u00a0million in damage and four deaths. Damage was heaviest in Haiti, after a prolonged southwesterly flow dropped 14\u00a0in (360\u00a0mm) of rainfall in a 24\u2011hour period. The rains resulted in extensive mudslides and flooding that disrupted transportation and damaged 10,800\u00a0houses, with another 3,500 destroyed. There were 1,122\u00a0deaths in the country, partially due to deforested hills, and damage was estimated at $50\u00a0million. In the neighboring Dominican Republic, there were five additional deaths, as well as flooding near its capital. In Cuba, Gordon caused $100\u00a0million in damage, and 5,906\u00a0houses were damaged or destroyed. Due to large-scale evacuations, there were only two deaths in the country. In Florida, the storm caused $400\u00a0million in damage (1994 USD, equivalent to about $700\u00a0million in 2023[1]), much of it agricultural, and there were eleven deaths, eight of them direct. Gordon later affected North Carolina with high waves, causing beach erosion and destroying five houses. Overall damage was $594 million due to Gordon (1994 USD, equivalent to about $900 million in 2023[1]). International governments and agencies through the United Nations sent relief supplies and monetary assistance to Haiti, following Gordon's devastating impact there. American soldiers were already stationed in the country to restore the ousted Jean-Bertrand Aristide to the presidency. The troops helped in rescues and worked to restore a damaged road between Port-au-Prince and Jacmel. Despite the deaths and damage, the name was not retired following the season."

        "content": "The origins of Gordon were from a tropical wave in the southwestern Caribbean Sea, which developed a circulation north of Panama early on November\u00a06. It gradually organized, becoming Tropical Depression Twelve on November\u00a08 offshore eastern Nicaragua.[2] Proximity to land prevented strengthening, and early on November\u00a010 it made landfall near Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua. Shortly thereafter, an upper-level trough turned the depression to the northeast, and late on November\u00a010 it intensified into Tropical Storm Gordon after reaching open waters. The circulation of the cyclone was initially very broad, covering much of the western Caribbean Sea, and wind shear prevented significant strengthening. Early on November 13, Gordon struck Jamaica near Kingston as a minimal tropical storm, and later that day made landfall near Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba.[2] Around the time of Gordon crossing Jamaica, an upper-level trough spawned a low-level disturbance over the central Bahamas. From surface synoptic reports, the National Hurricane Center estimates Tropical Storm Gordon rapidly crossed Cuba and became the dominant system between Cuba and the Bahamas,[2] but other meteorologists believe Gordon dissipated and that a second cyclone became the dominant system.[3] The resultant storm north of Cuba became much larger, spreading rain across much of Florida.[4] A ridge to the north turned Gordon to the west-northwest, and by November 14 the cloud pattern resembled that of a subtropical cyclone, with little convection near and the strongest winds well-removed from the center. The storm paralleled the northern coast of Cuba and gradually developed convection near the center. On November\u00a015, the broad center crossed the Florida Keys near Key West.[2] An approaching trough turned Gordon to the northeast, bringing it ashore near Fort Myers, Florida on November 16 with winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h). Tropical Storm Gordon crossed the Florida peninsula in about nine hours, emerging into the Atlantic Ocean near Vero Beach.[2] As it reached the Gulf Stream, a small but intense area of convection developed over the center,[5] and after the Hurricane Hunters reported flight-level winds in excess of 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h),[6] Gordon attained hurricane status late on November\u00a017 about 245 miles (394\u00a0km) southeast of Cape Fear, North Carolina. Shortly thereafter, it reached peak winds of 85\u00a0mph (137\u00a0km/h), and the trough that had turned the hurricane to the north was replaced by a ridge. Gordon turned abruptly northwestward,[2] and was briefly expected to cross the Outer Banks as a minimal hurricane.[7] The hurricane turned to the south and south-southeast, weakening into a tropical storm due to stronger shear and drier air. On November\u00a019, the storm turned to the southwest and later to the west. Gordon weakened into a tropical depression, before striking Florida again near Cape Canaveral on November\u00a020. It later turned to the north and dissipated over South Carolina on November\u00a021.[2]"

The same day, a tropical storm warning was issued for southeastern Cuba from Camag\u00fcey to Guantanamo. On November\u00a013, a tropical storm warning was issued for the southwest peninsula of Haiti, and later that day the same warning was issued for the Bahamas.[2] Due to the storm, 65,000\u00a0people evacuated to safer locations in Cuba. Schools were closed in New Providence and Grand Bahama due to the storm, and Nassau International Airport was briefly shut down.[8] A flight between Havana and Miami was canceled.[8] In Cuba, officials forced 36,518\u00a0people to evacuate their homes, and workers also moved 68,780\u00a0livestock.[9] After Gordon emerged into the Atlantic north of Cuba, the National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm warning for southern Florida from Jupiter to the Dry Tortugas, and later extended it to Boca Grande up along the west coast; this was extended to Bayport on the west coast and to Titusville on the east coast while the storm was approaching the Florida Keys. When Gordon attained hurricane status and turned suddenly to the northwest, a hurricane warning was issued from Bogue Banks to the North Carolina/Virginia border.[2] Florida governor Lawton Chiles activated the state's Emergency Operations Center.[10] In the Florida Keys, state parks were closed, which forced some campers to leave,[11] and all schools were closed.[12] On the mainland, University of Miami and Miami Dade College were also closed.[13] Space Shuttle Atlantis was forced to land at Edwards Air Force Base in California instead of Kennedy Space Center. The storm caused flights to be canceled or delayed at Miami International Airport,[12] and nearly all flights were canceled to and from the Florida Keys.[13] Hundreds of people evacuated to shelters in five counties in east-central Florida.[14] In North Carolina, officials suggested people in low-lying areas to go to higher ground, but they did not issue evacuation orders.[15]"

This caused a prolonged period of heavy rainfall, reaching 14\u00a0in (360\u00a0mm) in Les Cayes in a 24\u2011hour period, and over 9\u00a0in (230\u00a0mm) in the same duration in the capital city, Port-au-Prince.[8] In Jacmel, Gordon dropped 13\u00a0in (330\u00a0mm) in about 12\u00a0hours.[26] The rains resulted in flooding and landslides across the country.[2] There was knee-deep flooding in the shantytown of Cit\u00e9 Soleil,[25] and in Jacmel, the rains increased levels along three rivers. There, the storm washed out the road connecting with Port-au-Prince,[27] and three bridges were destroyed. In Jacmel, 725\u00a0houses were destroyed, forcing 1,500\u00a0people to stay at shelters.[28] Gordon left portions of southeastern Haiti without water access.[27] About 10,800\u00a0houses were damaged to some degree, and an additional 3,500\u00a0homes were destroyed.[29] About 1.5\u00a0million people were directly affected in the country, mostly near Port-au-Prince and in the southern portion,[28] and more than 89,000\u00a0people were left homeless.[29] In Port-au-Prince, about 20,000\u00a0homes were flooded,[29] and the bridge connecting the city with northern Haiti was also flooded.[25] Overall damage in the country was estimated at $50\u00a0million.[18] The floods and mudslides killed many people in Haiti, although the exact total will likely never be known. On November\u00a019, officials reported 531\u00a0deaths, and by two days later the total was potentially as high as 2,000. On November\u00a024, the death toll reached 824, and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported on December\u00a021 that Gordon killed 1,122\u00a0people in the country.[2] Most of the deaths occurred in Port-au-Prince, Jacmel, and L\u00e9og\u00e2ne.[29] Damage was heavier in Haiti than elsewhere along Gordon's track due to poor infrastructure consisting of shacks on flood-prone denuded hills.[28] The country suffers large death tolls from many hurricanes, caused in part by human activity. Large-scale deforestation left Haiti with about 1.4% of its forests as of 2004, leaving denuded mountain slopes that allows rainwater to wash down unimpeded. The lack of tree cover contributed to the devastating floods that caused most of Gordon's deaths.[30] In neighboring Dominican Republic, Gordon caused flooding and landslides that disrupted travel and communications to the interior portions of the country. Several slums around Santo Domingo flooded.[8] The storm killed five people in the country.[2]"

The winds were not representative of the storm, and Gordon's landfall intensity was estimated at 46\u00a0mph (74\u00a0km/h).[2] The storm caused widespread power outages and forced several roads to close.[8] Damage was heaviest in Guant\u00e1namo Province, where 9\u00a0mi (14\u00a0km) of seawalls and two aqueducts were destroyed. The storm damaged or destroyed 43\u00a0bridges, damaged 1,106\u00a0mi (1,780\u00a0km) of roads, and wrecked 16.5\u00a0mi (26.6\u00a0km) of rail lines. About 3\u00a0mi (4.8\u00a0km) of underground electrical cables were damaged. There was heavy agricultural damage in southeastern Cuba, estimated at $45\u00a0million. Gordon damaged 7,482 acres (3,028 hectares) of sugar cane fields and damaged or destroyed about 5.5\u00a0million banana trees. About 100,000\u00a0sacks of coffee were wrecked, amounting to $3.5\u00a0million in damage, and 50,000\u00a0litres of milk were ruined. While Gordon was paralleling northern Cuba, it produced high seas that caused flooding, including in Havana. Nationwide, the storm damaged 5,750\u00a0houses and destroyed 156\u00a0others. The cost of damage and reconstruction of homes and roads was $47.4\u00a0million, and there was an additional $9.5\u00a0million in damage to public buildings. Gordon killed two people in the country, which was kept to a minimum due to evacuations,[9] and damage totaled $102\u00a0million.[18] Two people were injured at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base.[25] The flooding from Gordon followed two other similarly damaging events in the preceding year.[9] Gordon also affected the nearby Bahamas, producing 46\u00a0mph (74\u00a0km/h) sustained winds at Kemps Bay, Andros.[2]"

        "content": "In the Florida Keys, wind gusts up to 49\u00a0mph (79\u00a0km/h) caused minor damage to trees and motor homes. Intense rainbands caused flooding in low-lying and poorly-draining areas, mostly in the upper Florida Keys. High tides closed portions of U.S. 1.[11] In the Tampa Bay area, outer rainbands downed power lines and trees, one of which fell onto a car.[31] The external tank used on Space Shuttle mission STS-71[32] was involved in an at-sea rescue during the storm and a subsequent court case.[33] The tank was being delivered by barge to the launch site when the tow vehicle encountered issues on November 15 due to the storm. Their mayday signal was picked up by an oil tanker, which responded and towed the tug and its cargo to safety.[34] NASA offered $5 million to the crew of the tanker as a reward, but the United States Department of Justice reduced the offer to $1 million.[34] The tanker company and crew sued and were awarded $6.4 million, believed to be the largest such award in U.S. history.[34] This was reduced to $4.125 million on appeal.[33] While Gordon was moving across southern Florida, Virginia Key reported sustained winds of 53\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h), which was the highest in the state. Gusts reached 83\u00a0mph (134\u00a0km/h) at a location in southern Dade County. Similar to the Caribbean, the storm dropped heavy rainfall in southern Florida, with widespread areas reporting over 6\u00a0in (150\u00a0mm) in the eastern portion of the state.[2] Rainfall peaked at 16.1\u00a0in (410\u00a0mm) in Coopertown.[35] High waves from Gordon severely eroded beaches along the state's eastern coastline,[2] and damaged coral and artificial reef systems. Waves flooded coastal roads up to 2\u00a0ft (0.61\u00a0m) deep in Miami Beach, and also damaged seawalls.[19] Near Fort Lauderdale, the storm washed a 508\u00a0ft (155\u00a0m) cargo ship aground less than 150\u00a0ft (46\u00a0m) from the beach.[2] Several other boats sank or were beached, which prompted 37\u00a0rescues. One woman was rescued after being swept 3,000\u00a0ft (910\u00a0m) off a fishing pier in Boynton Beach.[19] Gordon spawned six tornadoes in the state, of which two did no damage and two caused minor damage. A tornado in Lake Worth damaged 39\u00a0homes and two businesses.[2] The most damaging tornado was an F2 in southern Brevard County, which originated as a waterspout and moved onshore near Barefoot Bay. It moved through a mobile home community, destroying 62\u00a0homes and damaging 227\u00a0others to some extent; damage from the tornado was estimated at $10\u00a0million. The same tornado injured 40\u00a0people, causing six to be hospitalized, and killed an elderly man who died due to head trauma.[2][19] Across Florida, Gordon's winds damaged power lines and knocked down trees and traffic signals; about 425,000\u00a0people lost power due to the storm. The rains caused flooding in Dade and Collier counties, which damaged $275\u00a0million worth of crops,[2] mostly to vegetables and sugar cane.[36] In some locations, the crop damage was worse than during Hurricane Andrew in 1992, due to fewer crops being planted when Andrew struck the state.[37] Along Elliott Key, Gordon damaged the coral reef system to a greater extent than Andrew.[38] Inland flooding damaged buildings due to fast-rising water and roof collapses. In Volusia County, floods entered 1,236\u00a0buildings, causing $26\u00a0million in damage.[19] Flooding caused dozens of roads to close, some of which were washed out.[14] In the Everglades, flooding killed several deer.[19] Statewide, two people drowned in separate instances after driving into flooded areas. Three people drowned along beaches, including one man who died in a rip current while attempting to rescue his son. In Hillsboro Inlet, two people drowned after their boat was overturned by high waves.[2] Throughout Florida, Gordon directly killed eight people, and injured 43\u00a0people. There were also three indirect deaths; two were from traffic accidents, and one was related to a heart attack after a person pushed a stalled car in a flooded road. Statewide damage was estimated at $400\u00a0million (1994 USD$, 822\u00a0million 2024\u00a0USD).[19]"

The waves closed several portions of North Carolina Highway 12 for up to four days,[41] and also closed a portion of U.S. Route 70 in eastern Carteret County.[42] Heavy dune damage occurred on Ocracoke Island.[43] North of Hatteras Village, the high waves washed out 225\u00a0ft (69\u00a0m) of dunes,[44] and portions of the Outer Banks between Hatteras and Frisco were flooded up to 2.5\u00a0ft (0.76\u00a0m) deep.[19] The effects were similar to that of the 1991 Perfect Storm, although damage was lighter during Gordon.[41] The hurricane destroyed five homes in Kitty Hawk,[44] which were condemned after being previously damaged by Hurricane Emily in 1993.[2] Also in Kitty Hawk, the storm damaged 52\u00a0houses and 2\u00a0businesses. In Rodanthe, two homes sustained water damage. The cost of the storm in the state was estimated at $314,000.[45] Effects further south in North Carolina were lesser, although serious beach erosion was reported.[46] Offshore, a family of four required rescue from the Coast Guard after their boat began filling with water in the midst of 17\u00a0ft (5.2\u00a0m) surf.[47] A 49\u00a0ft (15\u00a0m) sailboat was disabled about 115\u00a0mi (185\u00a0km) offshore Norfolk, Virginia, and the crew of three were also rescued by the Coast Guard.[2] The sailboat was sailing from Bermuda to Oxford, Maryland, but was halted after the engine failed, the anchor was ripped off, and the mainstay was torn.[48] The interaction between Gordon and a ridge over New England produced coastal flooding in eastern Virginia. Tides reached 4\u00a0ft (1.2\u00a0m) above normal in Virginia Beach, which washed away 100\u00a0ft (30\u00a0m) of a fishing pier. The high tides caused road damage and minor housing damage.[19]"

He sought $15\u00a0million in aid from the Inter-American Development Bank.[16] The country's government handled relief efforts through its Red Cross and federal and non-governmental organizations.[21] The government of Cuba issued an appeal to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs for financial assistance; as a result, the agency provided $30,000, and the United Nations Development Programme provided $50,000. The government of Luxembourg sent $37,000 worth of construction materials, and the European Union sent $443,000 to the country.[9] On November\u00a016, the government of Haiti issued an appeal to the international community for assistance. In response, agencies through the United Nations donated $735,000, including 20,000 water units and 3,000\u00a0blankets. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs flew 30\u00a0tons of supplies, financed by Italy and Luxembourg. The European Union donated about $3.8\u00a0million to the country, and various countries sent about $1.8\u00a0million in cash or the equivalent thereof in relief items.[29] The Canadian government donated $485,000, and the government of Japan sent $400,000 in aid. The government of France provided blankets, clothing, and tarpaulins, and the United States sent 5,000\u00a0blankets.[29] In the days after the storm, the Haitian Army and international workers made emergency repairs to the road between Jacmel and Port-au-Prince,[27] which was permanently reopened on November\u00a025.[49] The Haitian government provided $3.2\u00a0million to repair damage and assist those affected by the storm.[28] The government sent about $112,000 to cities to provide for clearing roads, housing repairs, and for the funerals of storm victims. Workers from the United Nations set up relief work in Port-au-Prince. Assistance quickly reached the ravaged town of Jacmel, including 116\u00a0tons of food, 9\u00a0tons of medicine, and clothing.[29] Six soldiers from the United States Special Forces rescued 35\u00a0Haitians using an inflatable boat.[50] About 100\u00a0soldiers from the 10th Mountain Division assisted in relief operations in Jacmel, rescuing hundreds of people.[26] About 12,000\u00a0United States troops were already in the country when Gordon struck to restore democracy under ousted president Jean-Bertrand Aristide.[51] Due to the crop damage in Florida, the price of vegetables across the United States rose.[37] There were about 25,000\u00a0insurance claims following the storm's passage.[52] Despite the devastation in Haiti and the extensive damage in Cuba and Florida, Gordon was not retired by the World Meteorological Organization in Spring of 1995.[53] Out of all the names on the North Atlantic naming list that have not been retired, Gordon is still considered the strongest candidate for retirement.[54][55][56] The World Meteorological Organization issued an official statement crediting Jamaica and Cuba's warning infrastructure for the low loss of life there from Gordon, and blaming Haiti's lack of such a system for the large number of deaths there.[57] To this day, Gordon remains the deadliest hurricane to not have its name retired.[58]"

Over low to moderate wind shear, it moved slowly to the west, strengthening to a tropical depression on the same day. Despite favorable conditions, upper-level easterlies inhibited the storm for further intensification while moving westward.

        "content": " The 1945 Texas hurricane was a slow-moving tropical cyclone which paralleled the Texas Gulf Coast, causing extensive damage in late-August\u00a01945. The fifth tropical storm and second hurricane of the annual hurricane season, the storm formed out of an area of disturbed weather which had been situated over the Bay of Campeche on August\u00a024. In favorable conditions, the system quickly intensified as it steadily moved northward, attaining hurricane intensity later that day. As it approached the coast, however, the hurricane quickly slowed in forward motion, allowing it time to intensify off the Texas coast. After reaching major hurricane status,[nb 1] the storm reached peak intensity on August\u00a026 as a minimal Category 3 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 115 miles per hour (185\u00a0km/h). Later that day, the cyclone executed a slight curve toward the Texas coast, and early the next day made landfall near Seadrift at peak intensity. Once inland, it quickly weakened, and degenerated into a remnant low on August\u00a029 over Central Texas. The storm was the first major hurricane to form in the Gulf of Mexico since 1941. The hurricane's slow movement and strong intensity was a catalyst for extensive and damaging impacts in Texas. Prior to making landfall, thousands of people were ordered to evacuate from cities along coastal regions. Upon making landfall, the storm brought strong winds, which caused widespread power outages and infrastructural damage. A peak gust of 135\u00a0mph (217\u00a0km/h) measured in Collegeport, Texas. Northeast of Houston, Texas, a tornado killed a person after traveling for 22\u00a0mi (35\u00a0km). At the coast, the hurricane produced a strong storm surge which swept and damaged port cities. Port Lavaca, Texas was inundated by a 15\u00a0ft (4.6\u00a0m) storm surge, which at the time was the third highest ever recorded in the state. Damage in the port alone was estimated to be as high as $1\u00a0million.[nb 2] The strong wave action killed two people when it capsized a fishing vessel. Further inland, the storm produced torrential rainfall, which was also aided by the hurricane's slow movement. Rainfall peaked at 19.6\u00a0in (500\u00a0mm) in Hockley, Texas. The heavy rains caused extensive crop damage, particularly to cotton and rice crops. Damage to cotton in the Corpus Christi, Texas area alone was estimated at $1.5\u00a0million. Overall, the hurricane caused $20.1\u00a0million in damage, mostly to crops, and three deaths."

        "content": "Towards the end of August\u00a01945, an area of squally weather persisted in the Bay of Campeche, near the Gulf Coast of Mexico. After a prolonged period of marginal development, the cluster of thunderstorms began to quickly organize beginning on August\u00a024.[2] According to HURDAT\u00a0\u2013 the official database listing positions and intensities of Atlantic tropical cyclones dating back to 1851\u00a0\u2013 the disturbance became sufficiently organized to be classified as a tropical storm by 0000\u00a0UTC on August\u00a024. At the time, the storm already maintained maximum sustained winds of 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h). Initially, the tropical storm moved generally northward at approximately 18\u00a0mph (29\u00a0km/h), but gradually slowed as it neared the United States Gulf Coast. Quickly developing past tropical cyclogenesis, the system reached the equivalent of a modern-day Category 1 hurricane at 0600\u00a0UTC on August\u00a025.[3] Its forward motion continued to slow until it moved nearly stationary at roughly 5\u00a0mph (8.0\u00a0km/h), which allowed the system to remain a tropical cyclone for an extended period of time, despite its proximity to the coast.[2] The hurricane's intensity continued to quickly increase, and by 1200 UTC on August 26, the storm had attained major hurricane status, the equivalent of a modern-day Category 3 hurricane.[3] The hurricane executed a slight curve to the northeast later that day, causing it to move inland over the Texas coast.[3] Initially, the major hurricane was analyzed to have made landfall early on August\u00a027 over Port Aransas with winds of 140\u00a0mph (225\u00a0km/h), equivalent to a modern-day Category 4 hurricane.[2][3] However, a reanalysis was conducted on the system, and concluded that it had only attained Category 3 intensity before making landfall at 1200\u00a0UTC that day. The reanalysis moved the landfall point closer to Seadrift as well.[3] At the time, the storm had maximum sustained winds confined within an area about 10 miles (16\u00a0km) from the hurricane's center. The reanalysis also concluded that the storm contained a minimum central pressure of 963 millibars (28.44\u00a0inHg) at landfall.[4] Once inland, the hurricane slowly weakened, but maintained hurricane intensity until 1200\u00a0UTC on August 28. After further weakening to a tropical depression by 0000\u00a0UTC the next day, the disturbance dissipated over the Texas interior at 1800\u00a0UTC on August\u00a029.[2][3]"

        "content": "Upon classification as a hurricane by the former United States Weather Bureau (USWB) on August\u00a025, a hurricane warning was issued for coastal areas between Corpus Christi and Brownsville, Texas, and between Galveston, Texas and Lake Charles, Louisiana. At the time, the storm was forecast to make landfall between Port O'Connor and Freeport, Texas.[5] However, all small craft offshore from the mouth of the Rio Grande and Burrwood, Louisiana were warned to remain in port or return to the coast. All other shipping in the western Gulf of Mexico were advised to exercise extreme caution.[6] Despite having just formed, forecasters already suggested that it would be potentially the most destructive storm of the hurricane season thus far.[7] As a result of the storm's intensity and repeated warnings, thousands evacuated potentially affected coastal regions.[8] In Freeport, Texas, 20,000\u00a0people evacuated.[9] Mustang Island was fully evacuated prior to the storm impacting land.[10] Throughout the hurricane's early developmental stages, reconnaissance flights were periodically made into the storm to gather data.[11] Though situated on the opposite side of the Gulf of Mexico as Florida, tropical moisture extending from the hurricane caused torrential rainfall in the state. In St. Petersburg, the heavy rains set a 30-year record and flooded low-lying areas. Inundated streets blocked traffic and delayed transit bus routes. In Booker and Salt Creeks, the floodwaters backed up sewage systems. Though there were no deaths as a result of the floods, two people were rescued by police after their house was surrounded by water. Telecommunications in the Tampa Bay Area were delayed for up to two hours due to damage sustained to communication lines as a result of the rains. Despite its nearby proximity, effects in Tampa, Florida were much less severe, with only small showers and gusts never exceeding 25\u00a0mph (40\u00a0km/h).[11] Upon making landfall on the Texas coast late on August\u00a027, the hurricane caused a wide swath of destruction, and was considered one of the worst hurricanes to impact the state in at least 25\u00a0years. A 400\u00a0mi (645\u00a0km) wide swath of land experienced moderate to severe impacts during the storm.[12] Strong winds were reported in various locations, with a peak gust of 135\u00a0mph (217\u00a0km/h) measured in Collegeport, Texas.[8] At a weather station in Naval Air Station Corpus Christi, a wind gust of 101\u00a0mph (163\u00a0km/h) was measured. Across Corpus Christi, the strong winds knocked down communication and power lines, causing widespread power outages. Thus, all local radio stations were off air for a period of time. However, power was quickly restored within an hour after cutoff. Winds within the city peaked at 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h).[13] Damage in the city was estimated to be below $100,000.[14] Further south in Port Isabel, Texas, winds peaked at 76\u00a0mph (122\u00a0km/h). However, in nearby Brownsville, Texas, damage associated with the hurricane.[13] In El Campo, Texas, strong winds blew the roof off of a local hospital. Thus, 30\u00a0patients were evacuated to hospitals in Wharton, Texas.[12] Power in Wharton was temporarily knocked out for a short time.[15] As the storm progressed further inland, additional damage was reported. In Bay City, Texas, gusts uprooted trees and scattered debris over the city streets. Heavy rains there inundated roads under as much as 2\u00a0ft (0.61\u00a0m) of water. As a result, only one highway remained open. In Rockport, Texas, additional homes were unroofed, with damages estimated at $500,000.[9] Offshore, the hurricane produced strong waves which caused coastal impacts. In Port Aransas, Texas, waves inundated roads to a depth of 4\u00a0ft (1.2\u00a0m).[13] The strong waves later separated the port from the mainland, and destroyed or damage all buildings and structures there, causing an estimated $750,000\u00a0in damage there.[16][17] Power in Port Aransas was disrupted during the night of August\u00a027. At Aransas Pass, surf was as high as automotive running boards.[13] At Port Lavaca, Texas, the tide rose up to 15\u00a0ft (4.6\u00a0m) above normal, inundating the coastal city and forcing the coastline to retreat 50\u00a0ft (15\u00a0m) from its initial position.[8] At the time, the measured storm surge was only the third highest recorded in Texas history, behind peak measurements taken during the 1900 Galveston hurricane and 1919 Florida Keys hurricane.[18] Damage estimates for Port Lavaca ranged from $750,000\u2013$1\u00a0million.[16] Offshore of Port Isabel, the strong waves capsized a fishing vessel, killing all two of its crew members.[13] The hurricane's slow movement parallel to the Texas coast resulted in torrential rainfall, peaking at 19.6\u00a0in (500\u00a0mm) near Hockley over a period of a little over three days.[19] The excessive precipitation helped increase monthly rainfall amounts in the region to three times above average.[20] Cotton and rice crops were badly damaged during the storm.[12] The American Crop Growers Association estimated that up to 20% of the rice crop was lost during the stom.[16] Damage to unpicked cotton in the Corpus Christi area alone totaled to $1,500,000.[21] In Houston, the heavy rains halted traffic and increased flood risk to property near the city's bayous. Precipitation in the city peaked at 15.65\u00a0in (398\u00a0mm) in a 24-hour period.[12] However, the Barker Dam prevented a large scale flooding event in the city.[22] A gust of 55\u00a0mph (89\u00a0km/h) collapsed a suburban residence, killing the occupant inside.[12] Approximately 8\u00a0mi (13\u00a0km) north-northeast of Houston, an F3 tornado formed and traversed for 22\u00a0mi (35\u00a0km) across the northern suburbs of the city,[2] killing a person and causing 15\u00a0injuries.[23] The tornado also had a path width of 75\u00a0yd (69\u00a0m), and damage to property was estimated at $35,000.[2][24] Heavy rainfall from the storm was reported as far west as San Antonio, Texas.[25] Overall, the hurricane caused $20.1\u00a0million in damages, with $14\u00a0million attributable to agricultural losses, $5.883\u00a0million to infrastructural damage, and $250,000 to cattle and poultry losses. Despite the large swath of devastation, only three people were killed due to the extensive precautionary measures taken before the storm.[2] After the hurricane passed, the American Red Cross and other relief agencies began to survey damage and assist in repair and rehabilitation activities. Red Cross personnel in the central coastal area assisted 15,000\u00a0refugees with food and care necessities. Robert Edison, then-director of the Midwest sector of the agency, requested 5,000,000\u00a0ft (1,500,000\u00a0m) of lumber and 52\u00a0tons (47\u00a0tonnes) of steel.[21] The Salvation Army, stationed in Houston, issued an appeal for clothing materials. State health department and agency crews were dispatched to check water and other sanitation facilities.[17]"

The fourth named storm within the northwestern Pacific that year, Linfa developed as a tropical depression just off the western coast of Luzon on May\u00a025. The disturbance quickly intensified to reach tropical storm intensity a few hours after cyclogenesis. However, intensification leveled off as Linfa executed a small clockwise loop before a subsequent landfall on Luzon on May\u00a027. Due to land interaction the storm temporarily weakened and decoupled before reforming in the Philippine Sea. Afterwards Linfa began reintensifying and reached its peak intensity on May\u00a029 with maximum sustained winds of 100\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph) and a barometric pressure of 980\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.94\u00a0inHg).[nb 1] Following its peak the tropical storm began to deteriorate and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on May\u00a030; these extratropical remnants continued to track northward through Japan before dissipating in the Sea of Okhotsk on June\u00a04. The erratic and slow movement of Linfa off the western Philippines was the catalyst for extreme rainfall and flooding, killing 41\u00a0persons in the archipelago. Precipitation peaked at 723\u00a0mm (28.5\u00a0in) near Dagupan. Rising floodwaters resulted in numerous mudslides and the temporary shutdown of government offices. In addition, strong winds caused widespread power outages. Overall damage from Linfa in the Philippines amounted to \u20b1192.3\u00a0million (US$3.65\u00a0million).[nb 2] The floods also displaced 8,367\u00a0people in 1,686\u00a0families and destroyed 178\u00a0homes. Linfa and its extratropical remnants later brought torrential rainfall and widespread flooding to Japan, particularly southwestern regions. Rainfall there peaked at 727\u00a0mm (28.62\u00a0in). Flood damage was worst in K\u014dchi and Tokushima Prefectures, where several buildings were destroyed by floodwater. Other locations in Japan experienced considerable agricultural damage as well as numerous landslides. Overall, Linfa caused roughly $28.2\u00a0million in damage, much of which occurred in Japan, though the entirety of deaths associated with the cyclone took place in the Philippines."

        "content": "In late-May an area of disturbed weather began to persist roughly 650\u00a0km (400\u00a0mi) west of Manila, Philippines in the South China Sea.[1] Late on May\u00a023, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center\u00a0(JTWC) began to monitor the area for potential signs of tropical cyclogenesis.[2] Over the next few days the disturbance began to consolidate towards a common low pressure center, resulting in a burst in convective activity.[1] At 0000\u00a0UTC on May\u00a025, the JTWC classified the resulting system as a tropical depression west of Luzon;[2] six hours later both the Japan Meteorological Agency\u00a0(JMA) and the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration\u00a0(PAGASA) began to monitor the newly formed tropical cyclone, though the latter classified it as a tropical storm.[1][3] During these initial stages of development the tropical cyclone slowly intensified as it slowly tracked in a clockwise loop throughout the course of the day.[1] At 1800\u00a0UTC, the JTWC upgraded the depression to tropical storm status while the JMA followed suit six hours later,[2][3] thus designating the cyclone with the name Linfa.[1] In response to a strengthening ridge to the south, Linfa began tracking eastward.[2] Despite its proximity to land, the tropical storm's slow forward motion allowed for additional strengthening,[1] and according to the JMA, Linfa reached an initial peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 90\u00a0km/h (50\u00a0mph) at 0000\u00a0UTC on May\u00a027, just within the threshold of severe tropical storm status.[3] Concurrently the cyclone made landfall near Dagupan, Luzon.[2] Upon landfall, Linfa began to weaken as it crossed Luzon before emerging into the Pacific as a minimal tropical storm late that day. However, as a result of land interaction the initial surface circulation center of Linfa greatly weakened and was overtaken by a newly formed low-level circulation center on May\u00a028, resulting in the storm's position to shift well northeastward. This was the primary basis on which the JTWC downgraded Linfa to tropical depression status early on May\u00a028,[1] though the JMA continued to analyze the system as a weak tropical storm.[3] Afterwards, as the cyclone began to track northeastward, the new circulation center became more organized,[1] resulting in the JTWC reclassifying Linfa as a tropical storm at 0600\u00a0UTC the following day.[2] Gradual strengthening followed, and at 1800\u00a0UTC that day Linfa reached peak intensity with winds of 100\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 980\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.94\u00a0inHg) south of Okinawa.[3] Subsequently, the system began to take a more northward course and undergo extratropical transition, which was completed at 1200\u00a0UTC on May\u00a030. Though by this time most tropical cyclone monitoring agencies ceased the monitoring of these extratropical remnants by this time,[1] the JMA continued to track them as they made landfall near Uwajima, Ehime at 2130\u00a0UTC.[3] Linfa's remnants then paralleled the western coast of Japan before dissipating on June\u00a04 well into the Sea of Okhotsk.[3]"

        "content": "Linfa's slow movement off the western coast of Luzon, followed by its eventual landfall, allowed for copious amounts of rain to occur in areas of the Philippines, leading to widespread flooding.[1] Prior to landfall, waves generated by Linfa offshore hampered search and rescue operations following the collision of the MV San Nicholas and SuperFerry 12 ships on May\u00a025.[4] Over land, precipitation amounts officially peaked at a station in Dagupan, near the tropical storm's point of landfall. There, 723\u00a0mm (28.5\u00a0in) of rainfall was observed, including 629\u00a0mm (24.8\u00a0in) of rain in a 12\u2011hour period. The second highest precipitation total from a station operated by the World Meteorological Organization observed 364\u00a0mm (14.3\u00a0in) of rain in Baguio. These rainfall totals were further enhanced by the concurrent southwesterly monsoon.[1] The resulting floods forced then-President of the Philippines Gloria Macapagal Arroyo to order the temporary shutdown of government offices and mobilize city officials to aid in clearing threatened areas of people.[5] In addition, commuter bus operations were forced to cease.[6] The first documented fatality associated with the storm occurred in Taytay, Rizal, after heavy rains on May\u00a027 triggered a mudslide that killed an infant and injured three other people. That same day the rains resulted in thick traffic jams in Manila.[7] Strong winds in the capital city also toppled billboards and electric posts.[8] Floodwaters forced over 600\u00a0families to evacuate in Valenzuela, a suburb located northwest of Manila. Similarly strong winds in Pangasinan caused widespread power outage to much of the province.[5] Areas in the central parts of the province experienced their worst flooding conditions in at least 60\u00a0years.[9] Two ferries capsized off of Minalabac, Camarines Sur, killing six people. Sixty-seven others were rescued in the search and rescue operation that followed the incident.[10] Overall, Linfa killed 41\u00a0people in the Philippines due to flooding. Damage associated with the tropical storm included \u20b166\u00a0million (US$1.25\u00a0million) to agriculture and livestock, \u20b183.4\u00a0million (US$1.58\u00a0million) to fisheries, and \u20b142.9\u00a0million (US$800,000) to infrastructure, equating to a total of \u20b1192.3\u00a0million (US$3.65\u00a0million) in damage in the Philippines.[1] Nationwide, 8,367\u00a0persons in roughly 1,686\u00a0families evacuated into 44\u00a0evacuation centers at the height of the storm.[11][12] The floods destroyed 178\u00a0homes and damaged an additional 2,040.[13] In the immediate aftermath of the storm and associated flooding, the Department of Agriculture readied for the distribution of 3\u00a0million bangus fry, 250,000\u00a0tilapia fry, and 315\u00a0bags of rice seeds to affected regions. Furthermore, the National Food Authority allocated 200\u00a0sacks of rice to Pangasinan.[14] The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council assisted in relief operations by allocating \u20b110\u00a0million (US$200,000) and 800\u00a0bags of rice for such efforts. In addition, one of eight regional Filipino health offices distributed roughly \u20b1600,000 (US$10,000) worth of various medicines to Dagupan and Urdaneta, Pangasinan.[13] According to the National Disaster Coordinating Council, \u20b115.7\u00a0million (US$300,000) worth in relief operations was allocated.[15]"

However, a station in Owase, Mie observed 497\u00a0mm (19.56\u00a0in) of rain in 24\u00a0hours, greater than any other location for that period of time.[20] Despite making landfall on Ehime Prefecture, Linfa did not cause as much damage there relative to other provinces, particularly those bordering Ehime. Nonetheless, nearly 300\u00a0homes lost power during the storm there.[21] Linfa's worst impacts occurred in K\u014dchi Prefecture, where severe flooding inundated several buildings and triggered numerous landslides. Damage there totaled \u00a51.28\u00a0billion (US$10.7\u00a0million).[22] Similar effects took place in Tokushima Prefecture, in addition to widespread evacuations from impacted areas. Damage accrued by Linfa in Tokushima Prefecture reached \u00a51.22\u00a0billion (US$10.3\u00a0million).[23] Located near the coast, high seas generated by Linfa were reported in Wakayama Prefecture, resulting in cancellations of offshore activities and transportation. However, much of the damage in Wakayama Prefecture was caused by torrential precipitation, damaging roads in seven locations, amounting to \u00a5197.45\u00a0million (US$1.65\u00a0million).[24] Severe flooding in Mie Prefecture resulted from heavy, prolonged rainfall, which peaked prefecture-wide at 497\u00a0mm (19.57\u00a0in) in Owase. Precipitation in Mie caused widespread power outages. As many as 65\u00a0buildings were flooded, and approximately 87\u00a0ha (215\u00a0ac) of arable land was inundated by rainwater. In addition to surface inundation, the rains caused twenty landslides, blocking roads the traffic and suspending some rail operations.[25] Power outages were also widespread in Hy\u014dgo Prefecture, including a localized outage stripping electricity from 900\u00a0homes in the Kita-ku ward in Kobe;[26] similar impacts occurred in Osaka Prefecture.[27] Rising floodwater in Kanagawa Prefecture engulfed the first floors of several office buildings and residences. The rain also deluged roads in Yokohama, Fujisawa, Chigasaki and Odawara.[28] On Nishino-shima Island in Honshu's Shimane Prefecture, precipitation caused the deterioration of surface sediments, resulting in landslides that damaged several buildings. Agricultural damage totaled to \u00a5660,000 (US$5,500), and three flights were cancelled at Oki Airport.[29] Multiple landslides occurred in Miyagi Prefecture. In Kesennuma, the rains triggered a rockfall, prompting evacuations and damaging a home. A second rockfall incident occurred on June\u00a02, destroying several buildings. Residents of Ogachi and Ishinomaki were ordered to evacuate due to the threat of additional rockfalls and landslides.[30] In both Hino and Kurayoshi, Tottori, heavy rain caused damage to roads and farmland erosion. The precipitation also caused a river to flow over its banks, flooding adjacent land. Damage in Tottori Prefecture amounted to \u00a58.9\u00a0million (US$75,000).[31] Significant damage occurred in \u014cita Prefecture, where heavy rains caused landslides and suspended rail operations. Most of the damage in \u014cita Prefecture was done to crops, particularly vegetables, and totaled \u00a527.37\u00a0million (US$230,000).[32] Damage to sweet potato and tobacco crops alone in Kagoshima Prefecture reached \u00a521\u00a0million (US$180,000), while damage to agricultural infrastructure totaled \u00a52\u00a0million (US$16,800).[33] Damage to tobacco crops in Miyazaki Prefecture were estimated even higher at \u00a550.57\u00a0million (US$420,000).[34] In Nagasaki Prefecture, the rains also damaged forests, with damage estimated at \u00a523\u00a0million (US$190,000); other agricultural damage was estimated at \u00a560\u00a0million (US$500,000). Voluntary evacuation procedures took place in Fukue, Nagasaki due to the threat of building collapse.[35] Despite transitioning into an extratropical cyclone during its passage of Japan, Linfa still maintained strong winds, which caused heavy damage to susceptible structures.[1] The highest wind associated with Linfa in Japan was clocked at 119\u00a0km/h (74\u00a0mph) in Murotomisaki, K\u014dchi Prefecture.[20] Operations on the T\u014dhoku Main Line were delayed as a result of strong winds onset by Linfa.[36] Wind gusts as high as 55\u00a0km/h (35\u00a0mph) in Nakatsugawa in Tochigi Prefecture caused the complete destruction of at least five buildings and damaged several others, resulting in \u00a5$760,000 (US$6,400) in damage.[37] More considerable damage occurred in Shiga Prefecture, where strong winds caused damage to greenhouses and nearby crops, accruing \u00a536.75\u00a0million (US$308,700) in damage. In addition, two people were injured after winds threw a section of plywood into the car they were occupying.[38]"

Around the same time, the JMA recognized the system as a tropical depression, with the JTWC issuing a TCFA for the disturbance. The storm slowly moved northwestward towards China, and on July 19, the system strengthened into a tropical storm and was given the name Cempaka by the JMA. On the next day, Cempaka reached its peak intensity, peaking as a Category 1-equivalent typhoon, before making landfall on China later that day. Afterward, Cempaka rapidly weakened as it moved inland, weakening into a tropical depression on July 21. The storm subsequently initiated a counterclockwise loop, moving westward across southern China, and turning southward and emerging into the Gulf of Tonkin on July 23. Afterward, Cempaka turned eastward for the next few days, before dissipating over southern Hainan on July 26."

Analysis on the conditions in the South China Sea depicted a favorable environment for development, with warm sea surface temperatures up to 31\u201332\u00a0\u00b0C (88\u201390\u00a0\u00b0F) and good radial outflow, being inhibited by low to moderate amounts of wind shear.[4] The system's tropical cyclone development potential was later upgraded to medium,[5] and by 23:00 UTC, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the system as the system became more organized.[6] By the next day, the JTWC had upgraded the system to a tropical depression, designating it as 10W, since it had an improved convective structure and had developed a defined low level circulation.[7][8] The JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical storm, as its low-level circulation center had organized more, with improved banding structure.[9] At 00:00 UTC the next day, the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm and assigned the name Cempaka.[10] At 21:00 UTC, the JTWC declared Cempaka to be a Category 1 typhoon, as it developed a 15\u00a0nmi (28\u00a0km; 17\u00a0mi) wide ragged eye.[11][12] The JMA later upgraded it to a severe tropical storm at 00:00 UTC on the next day.[13] In their post-storm analysis, the JMA determined that Cempaka attained typhoon intensity on the same day. The storm made landfall near Yangjiang, on July 20,[14] and subsequently rapidly weakened into a tropical depression on July 21. For the next few days, the system moved southwestward, crossed M\u00f3ng C\u00e1i City, Qu\u1ea3ng Ninh Province in Vietnam on the night of July 22 and then moving into the Gulf of Tonkin on July 23. Afterward, the storm turned eastward, and continued this motion for another few days. On July 26, Cempaka dissipated over the southern coast of Hainan.[15]"

The fourteenth tropical cyclone and twelfth named storm of the 2017 Pacific hurricane season, Lidia developed from a large area of disturbed weather west of the Pacific Coast of Mexico on August\u00a031. The storm intensified while moving generally northward or northwestward, peaking with maximum sustained winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) later that day. On September\u00a01, Lidia made landfall in Mexico near Puerto Chale, Baja California Sur, at peak intensity. The storm weakened while traversing the peninsula, ultimately emerging over the Pacific Ocean on September\u00a03, where the storm degenerated into a remnant low. The system brought thunderstorms and wind gusts to Southern California, before dissipating on September 4. In anticipation of the storm, several tropical cyclone warnings and watches were issued in the Baja California Peninsula and other areas along the Gulf of California. Flooding in Mexico City resulted in water entering hundreds of homes, while sinkholes formed on some roads. Overall, there were twenty fatalities, including two from electrocution and two from drowning."

        "content": "A low-pressure area offshore the west coast of Mexico developed in late August 2017. Early on August\u00a026, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) first discussed the probability of tropical cyclogenesis in a tropical weather outlook (TWO). Initially, the NHC assessed a 0% chance of development within two days and 30% chance within five days, citing marginally favorable conditions.[2] An elongated trough of low pressure formed by late on August\u00a027 and was initially composed of disorganized showers and thunderstorms.[3] After environmental conditions became more favorable and the storm organized significantly \u2013 but still lacked a well-defined center \u2013 the NHC began classifying the low-pressure area as Potential Tropical Cyclone Fourteen-E at 21:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a029.[4] The low soon developed banding features and intensified throughout the day on August\u00a030.[5][6] After data from an unmanned NASA Global Hawk and observation stations indicated that the broad circulation became more consolidated,[7] the NHC initiated advisories on Tropical Storm Lidia at 18:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a030 about 315\u00a0mi (507\u00a0km) south-southeast of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula.[1] The storm, which was relatively large, moved north-northwestward due to flow from a weak ridge over Mexico and a weak cyclonic gyre to the west. Favorable conditions such as warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear allowed Lidia to intensify,[7][1] and by 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a01, the storm peaked with maximum sustained winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) and a minimum atmospheric pressure of 986\u00a0mbar (986\u00a0hPa; 29.1\u00a0inHg), which was based on Dvorak estimates with the hints of an eye feature.[1][8] Around 12:00\u00a0UTC on the following day, Lidia made landfall near Punta Marquez, Baja California Sur, with winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h).[1] Shortly after landfall, satellite imagery indicated that convection associated with Lidia was becoming disorganized. The cyclone weakened significantly while traversing the mountainous terrain of the Baja California Peninsula, and by early on September\u00a02, deep convection was mainly limited to a few strong clusters near the center. Around that time, Lidia briefly moved offshore,[9] before making another landfall near Punta Abreojos a few hours later, with winds of 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h).[1] By that time, Lidia weakened steadily,[10] and emerged over the Pacific Ocean on September\u00a02.[11] However, Lidia continued to weaken due to cold sea surface temperatures.[12] After failing to produce deep convection for about 12\u201315 hours, the NHC declared that Lidia had degenerated into a remnant low-pressure area at 09:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a03, about 40\u00a0mi (64\u00a0km) southwest of Punta Baja, Baja California.[13] On September 3, Lidia's remnants brought thunderstorms, wind gusts, and flash flooding to Southern California, before being absorbed by another upper-level low off the coast of California, on September 4.[14]"

Additionally, a tropical storm watch became in effect from Bahia Tempehuaya to Huatabampito in Sinaloa.[17] Three tropical storm warnings were issued at 21:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a030 from Bahia Tempehuaya to Huatabampito, from La Paz to San Evaristo, and from Santa Fe to Puerto Cortes in Baja California Sur, while a tropical storm watch was posted from Puerto Cortes to Puerto San Andresito.[18] At 09:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a031, tropical storm warnings were extended from north of Puerto Cortes to Puerto San Andresito, north of San Evaristo to Loreto, and north of Huatabampito to Guaymas, Sonora. Simultaneously, a tropical storm watch was issued from north of Puerto San Andresito to Punta Abreojos, north of Loreto to Bahia San Juan Bautista in the state of Baja California, and north of Guaymas to Bah\u00eda Kino in Sonora.[19] In Mexico City, heavy rainfall disrupted the public transportation network at several locations. A number of roads were flooded, including parts of the Circuito Interior and Avenida Ocean\u00eda.[20] A large sinkhole engulfed an entire central street and measured at least 33\u00a0ft (10\u00a0m) in width and 23\u00a0ft (7.0\u00a0m) in depth.[21][22] Hundreds of homes in the city were flooded. Bad weather conditions at Mexico City International Airport resulted in the cancellation 18\u00a0flights and the diversion of about 150\u00a0other flights. In Cuautitl\u00e1n Izcalli, about 300\u00a0people were evacuated after the El \u00c1ngulo dam collapsed, with water entering hundreds of dwellings, while many other homes were flooded with sewage in Ecatepec de Morelos after a canal overflowed. Flooding triggered red alerts on the color coded alert system in the municipalities of Azcapotzalco, Cuajimalpa, Gustavo A. Madero, Miguel Hidalgo, and Venustiano Carranza, while an orange alert was issued for Cuauht\u00e9moc.[20] Heavy precipitation was also reported in northwestern Mexico, with nearly 12\u00a0in (300\u00a0mm) of rain observed in San Jos\u00e9 del Cabo.[23] Nationwide, twenty deaths were attributed to the storm,[24] including two from electrocution and two from drowning.[25] Wind advisories were issued for parts of Southern California as the remnants of Lidia continued to move northward. A microburst event in Santa Barbara associated with the remnants of Lidia seriously injured a teenager as she was struck by a canoe at the beach.[26] Damages in Baja California Sur were calculated at MX$2.2\u00a0billion (US$123\u00a0million),[27] including MX$187\u00a0million (US$10.5\u00a0million) in infrastructural sector.[28]"

Most recorded tornadoes form in the U.S., although some events may take place internationally. Tornado statistics for older years like this often appear significantly lower than modern years due to fewer reports or confirmed tornadoes. All documented significant tornadoes prior to 1950 in the United States were given unofficial ratings by tornado experts like Thomas P. Grazulis, which this article uses for the ratings below. Most of these records are limited to significant tornadoes; those rated F2 or higher on the Fujita scale, or which caused a fatality. Some listed events were tornado families rather than single tornadoes.[2] There are also no official tornado counts for each month, but every month had tornadoes and are thus included in this article. In subsequent years, the documentation of tornadoes became much more widespread and efficient, with the average annual tornado count being around\u00a01,253.[3] Outside the United States, various meteorological organizations, like the European Severe Storms Laboratory rated tornadoes, which are considered official ratings."

Over one hundred sheep and cattle were killed by the tornado.[5] On May 16, an F2 tornado unroofed a large farmhouse and destroyed multiple smaller farmhouses near Sandy Ridge, Alabama.[5] On May 17, a long-tracked and deadly F3 tornado impacted four counties in Illinois along its path of 27 miles (43\u00a0km). The tornado struck the edge of Norris City, where three homes were nearly leveled, and one fatality occurred. Outside of Norris City, the tornado damaged six homes and twelve barns.[5] On May 18, two violent and deadly F4 tornadoes struck Texas.[5] The first tornado completely \"splintered and scatted\" a church in Stoneburg. In the church, a linen scarf was untouched by the tornado as it laid on the pulpit as the church was destroyed.[5][12] Along the tornado\u2019s 30 miles (48\u00a0km) path, multiple homes and barns were damaged or destroyed. At one of the destroyed homes, a man was killed by the tornado, and his wife was severely injured, though it is noted, she may have died from her injuries. Along the path, a \"prominent elderly couple\" was killed when their new ranch home was leveled along with all of their barns by the tornado northeast of Bowie, Texas.[5] The second tornado struck around the city of Sanger. On the north side of the city, a home was leveled by the tornado, and three other homes were leveled four miles east of the city. On the east side of Sanger, a 9-year-old girl was killed by flying debris as she ran out of a storm cellar. It is noted by Grazulis that both F4 tornadoes are \"related,\" indicating they may have been produced by the same supercell.[5] On May 19, an F2 tornado destroyed a grocery store and unroofed four homes in Morgan City, Louisiana.[5] On May 20, a deadly and long-tracked F3 tornado occurred in North Carolina. The tornado started near Seven Springs, passing near Kinston before ending its 25 miles (40\u00a0km) path near Grifton, North Carolina.

The cyclone attained its first peak of 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h) before hitting Cabo Rojo early on July\u00a024.[1] San Juan recorded maximum winds of around 66\u00a0mph (106\u00a0km/h) and a low barometric pressure of 1,005 millibars (29.68\u00a0inHg) as the eye of the hurricane passed near the extreme southwest corner of Puerto Rico.[2] The storm continued northwest and tracked just east of Hispaniola, losing some intensity to land interaction; by 18:00 UTC on July\u00a024 its winds diminished to 85\u00a0mph (137\u00a0km/h).[1] However, the storm began rapid re-intensification as it moved over the Turks and Caicos Islands early on July\u00a025.[1] The storm continued strengthening, attaining the equivalence of major hurricane status by 12:00 UTC that day. By the time it reached the central Bahamas at 00:00 UTC on July\u00a026, it reached winds of 140\u00a0mph (225\u00a0km/h).[1] After 12:00 UTC, while still moving northwest, the cyclone made landfall on New Providence and crossed over Nassau, where winds were unofficially estimated at 135\u00a0mph (217\u00a0km/h).[3] Reducing its forward speed, the storm weakened considerably after passing New Providence, losing major hurricane status by 06:00 UTC on July\u00a027.[1] As the storm neared the Florida coast, it curved somewhat to the north-northwest and passed just east of Cape Canaveral early on July\u00a028. It made landfall at 10:00 UTC near present-day Edgewater, near the Canaveral National Seashore just south of New Smyrna Beach, with winds of 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h).[1] Prior to reanalysis in 2010, the storm was estimated to have made landfall farther south, near Cocoa Beach.[4] In Florida, the storm's lowest known barometric pressure of 967\u00a0mb (28.6\u00a0inHg) was estimated,[5] although it was likely deeper near the Bahamas. After landfall, the storm curved northwestward and weakened rapidly as it moved inland, weakening to a tropical storm southwest of Jacksonville.[1] On July\u00a029, it moved across Georgia as a weakening tropical storm and entered Alabama as a tropical depression. It continued across the southeastern United States while losing tropical characteristics, gradually beginning to curve northeastward over Arkansas, Missouri, and the Ohio Valley, becoming extratropical by 00:00 UTC on August\u00a01.[1] It finally dissipated the following day as it moved northeastward over Lake Ontario."

The second tropical cyclone and hurricane of the annual hurricane season, it formed from a frontal low off the west coast of Florida on August\u00a03. Initially a weak disturbance, it moved generally westward, slowly gaining in intensity. Early on August\u00a04, the depression attained tropical storm intensity. Ships in the vicinity of the storm reported a much stronger tropical cyclone than initially suggested. After reaching hurricane strength on August\u00a05 south of the Mississippi River Delta, the storm strengthened further into a Category\u00a02\u00a0hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 100\u00a0mph and a minimum barometric pressure of 972\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.71 inHg) at 0600\u00a0UTC on August\u00a07. The hurricane moved ashore near Sabine Pass, Texas later that day at peak strength. Once inland, the storm executed a sharp curve to the north and quickly weakened, degenerating into a tropical storm on August\u00a08 before dissipating over Arkansas on August\u00a010. Reports of a potentially destructive hurricane near the United States Gulf Coast forced thousands of residents in low-lying areas to evacuate prior to the storm moving inland. Offshore, the hurricane generated rough seas and a strong storm surge, peaking at 6.4\u00a0ft (1.95\u00a0m) on the western edge of Lake Pontchartrain. The anomalously high tides flooded many of Louisiana's outlying islands, inundating resorts. Strong winds caused moderate infrastructural damage, primarily in Texas, though its impact was mainly to communication networks along the US Gulf Coast which were disrupted by the winds. However, much of the property and crop damage wrought by the hurricane was due to the torrential rainfall it produced in low-lying areas, setting off record floods. Rainfall peaked at 37.5\u00a0in (953\u00a0mm) in Miller Island off Louisiana, making it the wettest tropical cyclone in state history. Nineteen official weather stations in both Texas and Louisiana recorded record-level 24-hour rainfall totals for the month of August as a result of the slow-moving hurricane. Property, livestock, and crops\u2013especially cotton, corn, and pecan crops\u2013were heavily damaged. Entire ecosystems were also altered by the rainfall. Overall, the storm caused $10.75\u00a0million in damages and seven fatalities.[nb 1]"

        "content": "In early August, an extratropical trough moved off the coast of South Carolina and Georgia, with a stationary front extending from it.[1][2] A weak low-pressure area began to develop at the southern end of the front just offshore of Jacksonville, Florida.[1] Initially, the storm had an open center of circulation and remained a frontal low as it moved southwestward across Florida, and thus was not considered a fully tropical system at the time. Upon entering the Gulf of Mexico, however, observations indicated that the disturbance developed a closed center of circulation.[2] As a result, the storm was analyzed to have developed into a tropical depression off the western coast of Florida at 1200\u00a0UTC on August\u00a03.[3] At the time, weather reports revealed a definite cyclonic rotation, though the depression had a shallow minimum barometric pressure of 1012.5\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.90\u00a0inHg).[1] Moving west-southwest, the depression steadily intensified and attained tropical storm intensity at 0000\u00a0UTC on August\u00a04.[3] Late that evening, the tropical storm executed a slight northward curve.[1] Strengthening continued into the following day, and ships in the storm's vicinity began to report a much stronger storm than was previously suggested. A ship reported the first gale-force winds associated with the storm at 2100\u00a0UTC on August\u00a04.[2] The S.S. Connecticut observed force\u00a011 winds, the strongest wind measurement associated with the storm as recorded by vessel.[1] A minimum pressure of 995\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.39\u00a0inHg) was analyzed for the system at 0600\u00a0UTC on August\u00a05 based on an observation from a nearby ship.[2] At 1800\u00a0UTC on August\u00a05, the storm strengthened to hurricane strength, the first tropical cyclone of the season to do so. At the time, the hurricane was moving very slowly westward, allowing it to strengthen despite its close proximity to land. The hurricane reached Category\u00a02 intensity by 0600\u00a0UTC on August\u00a07.[3] The storm made landfall at peak intensity at around 2100\u00a0UTC later that day near Sabine Pass, Texas. At the time, the hurricane had maximum sustained winds of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h), with the storm's maximum winds extending out 10\u00a0mi (15\u00a0km) from its center.[2] A weather station in Sabine Pass recorded a barometric pressure of 972\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.71\u00a0inHg), which was analyzed to have been the lowest pressure measured in association with the storm.[2][3] After moving inland, the storm immediately curved northward and began to gradually weaken.[1] At 0600\u00a0UTC on August\u00a08, the cyclone weakened to tropical storm strength while situated over East Texas, and later degenerated to a tropical depression by 1200\u00a0UTC the following day. The depression persisted into Arkansas,[4] where it transitioned into a trough of low pressure at 1800\u00a0UTC on August\u00a010 after its center of circulation lacked the well-defined closed circulation characteristic of tropical cyclones.[2]"

        "content": "Upon reaching hurricane strength off the United States Gulf Coast, hurricane warnings were issued for coastal regions from Lake Charles, Louisiana to Sabine Pass, Texas on August\u00a07.[5] Storm warnings were placed for areas east of Lake Charles to Grand Isle, Louisiana and areas west of Sabine Pass to Velasco, Texas.[6] Offshore vessels were also warned of the storm in areas between Bay St. Louis, Mississippi and Galveston, Texas.[7] At the time, the hurricane was forecast to make landfall slightly east of Port Arthur, Texas.[5] In Texas, these warnings were delivered to residents via factory whistles. Evacuation procedures also began as a result of the approaching storm. The Spindletop near Beaumont, Texas and other nearby oil fields were evacuated. Coastal cities near Port Arthur, Texas were also evacuated by state highway police.[6][8] Evacuees took shelter in refitted schools nearby.[8] In the New Orleans, Louisiana area, several thousand residents were evacuated in advance of the storm.[9] On Delacroix Island, Louisiana, 1,000\u00a0residents evacuated.[10] Rail and airline operations were halted as a precautionary measure, but were later resumed after the storm passed.[8] All storm warnings were ceased by midnight on August\u00a08.[11] Even before making landfall, the hurricane caused extensive damage in Louisiana, due in part to the hurricane's slow speed and close proximity to the state coast. Winds as high as 60\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h) brushed the coastline, causing extensive damage. Storm surge pushed coastal waters to near-record heights, inundating low-lying areas. Near Morgan City, Louisiana, 19\u00a0people went missing after going on a fishing trip;[5] they were later found marooned at Atchafalaya Basin.[9] The schooner J.W. Clise was abandoned during the storm 135\u00a0mi (215\u00a0km) south of the Mississippi River Delta, though its crew was also later rescued.[12] Storm surge peaked at 6.4\u00a0ft (1.95\u00a0m) above-average in western portions of Lake Pontchartrain. A bridge crossing Thunder Bayou, which extended west of the lake, was washed out by the waves. Similarly, a station at Calcasieu Pass reported a storm surge 4.8\u00a0ft (1.46\u00a0m) high.[12] Conservation officials feared the disturbance would disrupt the seafood and muskrat production.[5] After the storm, it was estimated 75,000\u00a0muskrats were killed by the storm's effects.[13] Offshore, Grand Isle was inundated by the strong waves.[10] Around Houma, sugar cane crops were damaged.[14] The hurricane was the strongest to impact Cameron since the tenth hurricane of the 1886 Atlantic hurricane season;[12] strong gusts peaked at 70\u00a0mph (115\u00a0km/h), disrupting communication lines, thus isolating the city from other locations in the state. The high tides inundated town streets under 2\u00a0ft (0.6\u00a0m).[9] Other areas extending from western Louisiana to Mobile, Alabama reported communication disruptions. In New Orleans, strong winds uprooted signboards and blew debris across the city streets.[10] Several houses in Shell Beach and Delacroix Island were leveled by strong winds.[12] Due to the storm's slow movement just offshore the Louisiana coast, the hurricane became the wettest tropical cyclone in state history, with numerous locations reporting record rainfall across the state. Of the state's ten highest official rainfall measurements associated with tropical cyclones, the two highest were measurements taken during the hurricane.[12] Precipitation peaked at 37.5\u00a0in (953\u00a0mm) on Miller Island. For any given 20,000\u00a0mi2 (50,000\u00a0km/h2) area of Louisiana, the maximum rainfall averaged 12.1\u00a0in (307.3\u00a0mm).[15] Thirteen official weather stations in the state reported monthly 24-hour rainfall total records. The highest of these was in Crowley, where 19.76\u00a0in (501.9\u00a0mm) of precipitation fell on August\u00a09; the station would record 33.71\u00a0in (856.2\u00a0mm) of rain over the course of the storm. The torrential rainfall submerged the city under 2\u00a0ft (0.6\u00a0m) of floodwater.[12] In Cameron, the storm dropped 21\u00a0in (533\u00a0mm) of rain was reported.[16] In St. Landry Parish, bayous flowed over their banks, causing refugees to evacuate to Opelousas. In the Acadiana region of southern Louisiana, the resulting floods were considered worse than the floods that resulted from the Sauv\u00e9's Crevasse in 1849. There, whooping crane populations were severely impacted by the rainfall, and only one was known to be alive by 1947. The floods inundated roughly 2,000,000\u00a0acres (800,000\u00a0hectares) of land in Louisiana. Much of the lowland areas remained underwater until October\u00a01940. As a result, cotton and corn crops experienced significant losses, as well as pecans. Livestock also saw large losses. Impassable areas caused by rising floodwaters prevented firefighters from extinguishing a fire which burned down much of the Shell Oil Company's offices and supply warehouses in the town of Iowa. Across the state, the hurricane caused $9\u00a0million in damages, though only six fatalities resulted, relatively less than most storms of similar scale. The low death count was attributed to large evacuation procedures which underwent prior to the storm, as well as guidance provided from the newly opened Weather Bureau east of Lake Charles.[12] In East Texas, where the hurricane made landfall late on August\u00a07, strong winds were felt across the region. Sustained winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) were widespread, with occasional gusts peaking in excess of 90\u00a0mph (145\u00a0km/h). In Port Arthur, a barometer recorded a minimum pressure of 978\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.87\u00a0inHg), establishing a new record for the lowest pressure measured by the particular weather station.[6] The same station recorded 5.87\u00a0in (149.1\u00a0mm) of rainfall.[17] Elsewhere in Port Arthur, strong winds caused significant damage to local oil refineries, with slight to moderate damage to other homes and businesses.[2] Six people were injured in the city.[11] Property damage in Jefferson County, containing Port Arthur and nearby suburbs, was estimated at $1\u00a0million.[2] The city's communication and power service was cut during the storm.[18] A weather station near Sabine Pass recorded a similarly low pressure of 973\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.74\u00a0inHg). In Sabine Pass, strong winds unroofed houses, uprooted trees, and destroyed billboards. At the nearby Ged Oil Field, four wooden oil derricks were blown down.[17] In Beaumont, three people were injured due to flying window and structural debris.[19] Further inland, the hurricane produced considerable rainfall, though relatively less than in Louisiana. Six weather stations in the state set new 24\u2013hour precipitation records for August. A measurement of 6.99\u00a0in (177.4\u00a0mm) on August\u00a08 in Kirbyville was the highest of these records.[17] However, maximum rainfall in the state was estimated to be in excess of 10\u00a0in (255\u00a0mm).[15] The rice crop was particularly damaged by the rainfall. In Jefferson County, crop damage was estimated between $450,000\u2013$500,000.[2] In Texas, the hurricane caused $1.75\u00a0million in damages and resulted in one fatality.[17]"

        "content": "At the end of the sixteenth century Pope Clement VIII, who had purchased the lordship over Nettuno (the territory of which incorporated Anzio[11] [12]) for the Apostolic Chamber, gave instructions to Monsignor Bartolomeo Cesi to take steps to safeguard the building heritage of Anzio.[13] A century later, in the last decade of the seventeenth century, by the will of Pope Innocent XII the port was rebuilt which gave rise to a notable economic recovery in the area, which continued throughout the eighteenth century. At the end of the 17th century Innocent XII and Clement XI restored the harbour, not on the old site of the Roman one of Nero, but to the east of it, with the opening to the east, a mistake which leads to its being frequently silted up; it has a depth of about 5 metres (16\u00a0ft).  The sea is encroaching slightly at Anzio, but some kilometres farther north-west the old Roman coast-line now lies slightly inland (see Tiber).[9] A village arose and developed after the construction of the new harbour - completed in 1700 - with the Roman aristocracy discovering the area.[14] [10] In 1857 Pope Pius IX founded the modern municipality (comune) of Anzio, with the boundaries of Nettuno being redrawn to accommodate the new town;[10] however, the official name of the new municipality was Porto d'Anzio until 1885.[8] Anzio knew a remarkable development as a seaside resort at the end of the 19th century.[15] In 1925, Anzio became one of the central places of the telecommunication revolution. On 16 March 1925, the \"Station\" of the submarine telegraph cable was inaugurated in Anzio, the first telecommunication cable connected directly from Anzio to New York. The following submarine telegraph cable united Italy with Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay through this \"Station\" in Anzio.[16]"

The Commonwealth Anzio War Cemetery and Beach Head War Cemetery are located here. In February 1944 American soldiers (the U.S. Fifth Army) were surrounded by Germans in the caves of Pozzoli for a week, suffering heavy casualties. A film based on the events called Anzio (1968, directed by Edward Dmytryk) was made, starring Robert Mitchum and based on a book by Wynford Vaughan-Thomas. On 18 February 1944, the British light cruiser Penelope was struck by two torpedoes off the coast of Anzio and sunk with a loss of 417 crew. In the same region Lieutenant Eric Fletcher Waters of the British Army lost his life in battle while serving as a member of the 8th Battalion, Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment), part of the 167th (London) Infantry Brigade of the 56th (London) Infantry Division which fought at Anzio for nearly six weeks. His son, Roger Waters, became the bassist and main lyricist of progressive rock band, Pink Floyd. In his honour and remembrance Roger Waters recorded the song \"The Fletcher Memorial Home\", which is the maiden name of Eric Waters' mother. (Also see \"When the Tigers Broke Free\".)"

There are also the ruins of the villa of Cicero.[19] In Anzio can be found the Anzio War Cemetery, located close to the Communal Cemetery and Beachhead Museum. The Beach Head War Cemetery is located 5-kilometre north on No207 Road.\nThe Sicily-Rome American Cemetery and Memorial is in nearby Nettuno. About 8 kilometres (5 miles) north of the town there is a WWF park with sulphur springs and a medieval tower, Tor Caldara. Near the ruins of the Villa of Nero, in scenic position near the beach, lies the military sanatorium of the Italian Army, one of the most important works of Florestano Di Fausto, built-in 1930\u20131933. All along the coast a large number of beaches and sea resorts can be found, including hotels and the famous fish restaurants of the port of Anzio.

Salling and four companions each received a governor's commission from the state of Virginia to explore the territory east of the Mississippi River, in return for 10,000-acre (4,000\u00a0ha) land grants. It was this group that also discovered coal along the banks of the Coal River. It was not until after the Revolutionary War that European settlers began moving into the area. Even then, the few[33] who survived the attacks of the native peoples usually fled to safer destinations. But by around 1800, a gristmill[34] was established by Joseph Thomas at the Upper Falls which continued in operation until the 1930s. Beginning about 1830, timber harvested from the region was floated on the Coal River to Saint Albans. At the same time, great quantities of marketable cannel coal were found on the upper Coal River. However, only at periods of high water could logs and shallow wooden boats loaded with coal be drifted over the Upper Falls and Lower Falls and on down the river. A system of wooden-crib locks and dams designed to make Coal River navigable[35] was constructed in the 1850s to transport cannel coal, bituminous coal, coal oil and timber to market. This began the era of two-way commercial steamboat traffic on the river. The Upper Falls was the site of Upper Falls Lock and Dam,[36][37] and Edward Kenna, who also developed a sawmill[38] at the Upper Falls around 1850, was lockmaster;[39] his son, John Edward Kenna, later served as U.S. senator from West Virginia. Damage caused by ongoing flooding and the outbreak of the Civil War suspended steam tug navigation of Coal River. Traffic resumed after the war, but ended permanently in 1881. From 1858, at least ten failed attempts were made to build a rail line up the Coal River. Finally, under the direction of General Cornelius Clarkson Watts, a Confederate veteran, construction of the Coal River and Western Railway began in 1902 and was completed in 1904. The lasting economic boom brought by the railroad to the region saw the bustling Upper Falls Station[40] offer daily service for both passengers and freight. Timber extraction largely ended in the 1920s, but the rail line,[41] now owned by CSX Transportation, still transports massive amounts of bituminous coal to global markets. There was a rapid influx of people to the area during and soon after World War II, and many came to live in Tornado. They found employment in the defense and chemical manufacturing industries in the Kanawha Valley and benefited from economic prosperity as a result. Today, the community is a residential suburb and recreation destination of the Charleston metropolitan area.[42]"

        "content": " Tropical Storm Julia was a weak tropical cyclone that caused minor damage across the Eastern United States in September\u00a02016. The tenth named storm of the 2016 Atlantic hurricane season, Julia developed from a tropical wave near the coast of east-central Florida on September\u00a013. Initially a tropical depression, the system soon made landfall near Jensen Beach. Despite moving inland, the cyclone intensified into a tropical storm, shortly before strengthening further to reach maximum sustained winds of 50\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h). Julia then  drifted north-northwestward and then northeastward, moving offshore the Southeastern United States on September\u00a014. A cyclonic loop occurred as strong westerly air developed in the region, with the shear causing fluctuations in intensity. By September\u00a019, Julia degenerated into a remnant low, which later transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and moved inland over North Carolina before dissipating on September\u00a021. Due to Julia's asymmetrical structure and fairly weak intensity, the storm caused generally minor wind and flooding damage in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. However, parts of North Carolina received as much as 12\u00a0in (300\u00a0mm) of rain, while as much as 18\u00a0in (460\u00a0mm) fell in the Hampton Roads area of Virginia. One million gallons of sewage from Elizabeth City flowed into the Pasquotank River and Charles Creek. The Cashie River in Windsor, reached 15\u00a0ft (4.6\u00a0m), 2\u00a0ft (0.6\u00a0m) above flood stage. Several businesses and approximately 60\u00a0homes in the town were destroyed. In Bertie County alone, a total of 72\u00a0people had to be rescued from their homes, while 61\u00a0others were evacuated from nursing homes. Schools were closed in Bertie, Currituck and Hertford counties for at least two days. In Virginia, flooding overwhelmed the sewer system in Chesapeake and inundated numerous roads in the southeastern portion of the state. Damage from the storm amounted to $6.13\u00a0million."

        "content": "A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa on September\u00a01. Due to entrainment of dry air, the wave struggled to maintain convection as it progressed westwards.[1] The National Hurricane Center (NHC) did not begin monitoring the system in its Tropical Weather Outlooks until a concentrated area of low pressure developed about 350\u00a0mi (560\u00a0km) east of the Leeward Islands on September\u00a08.[2] The convection quickly diminished and mainly consisted of only sporadically bursts of shower and thunderstorm activity.[3] Little change in organization took place as the disturbance tracked through the Bahamas on September\u00a011 and September\u00a012. However, the disturbance quickly organized and developed more thunderstorm activity while approaching Florida. A tropical depression is estimated to have formed at 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a013, around the time it was making landfall in Jensen Beach, Florida. Within a few hours, a strong band of deep convection formed in the northeast quadrant of the cyclone, though westerly wind shear prevented any significant convection from developing on the western side of the storm.[1] Radar and surface observations indicate that the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Julia around 12:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a013, about six hours after forming, becoming the first tropical cyclone to intensify into a tropical storm while over land. Once designated as a tropical storm, Julia reached its peak intensity of 50\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h) while inland,[1] At 03:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a014, the NHC initiated advisories on Julia \u2013 which was then centered near Jacksonville \u2013 and initially predicted that the storm would move north-northwestward and become extratropical or a remnant low pressure area over Georgia by September\u00a016.[4] Shortly thereafter, Julia weakened slightly due to moderate to high wind shear. Periodic bursts of convection occurred near the center of the system as it moved over water and paralleled the coast of Florida and Georgia.[1] However, these bursts were short-lived due to strong wind shear, causing its elongated circulation to become far removed from the deep convection. Operationally, the NHC erroneously downgraded Julia to a tropical depression on September\u00a015.[5] At 00:00\u00a0UTC that day, Julia attained its minimum barometric pressure of 1007\u00a0mbar (29.7\u00a0inHg).[1] Julia consisted of mainly a low-level swirl of clouds by late on September\u00a016; however, minimal convection kept the storm at the minimum requirements for a tropical cyclone.[6] Early on September\u00a017, Julia weakened to a tropical depression.[1] Despite a slight increase in convection and organization, wind shear and dry air continued to take its toll on the increasingly ill-defined storm, and Julia degenerated into a remnant low by early on September 19 after being devoid of convection for nearly 12\u00a0hours.[7] While moving north, the remnants of Julia then transitioned into a weak extratropical cyclone and made a small westward turn before dissipating inland over North Carolina on September\u00a021.[1]"

Nine hours later, the tropical storm warning was discontinued as the cyclone began moving offshore Georgia.[1] Additionally, flash flood watches were issued between Florida and North Carolina, as up to 10\u00a0in (250\u00a0mm) of rainfall was possible in some areas. Florida governor Rick Scott urged residents to prepare in case an evacuation became necessary and to dump standing water to control mosquitoes that could be carrying the Zika virus.[8] Jacksonville mayor Lenny Curry released a statement telling those in the path of the storm to stay off the roadways due to the rain and wind and potential flash flooding.[9] In Florida, the storm produced wind gusts of 30 to 48\u00a0mph (48 to 77\u00a0km/h) along the First Coast, causing some structural damage,[10] including ripping apart the roof of a Chevron gas station in Neptune Beach and carrying it over two blocks before dropping it.[9] While Julia was still in its precursor stages as it paralleled the coast of Florida, an EF0 tornado was reported and later confirmed in the areas of Barefoot Bay, with sustained winds as high as 85\u00a0mph (137\u00a0km/h). One home had its roof partially ripped off by the tornado as it tracked through the area.[9] Flooding rain impacted the Space Coast and the First Coast, with 3.3\u00a0in (84\u00a0mm) of precipitation reported in Melbourne.[11] The storm knocked out power to over 1,300\u00a0people in Georgia, especially in and near the Sea Islands and St. Simons. In South Carolina, rainfall from Julia caused flash flooding in a number of locations, such as the Charleston metropolitan area, where flooding resulted in the closure of several roads. Accumulations peaked at 3.67\u00a0in (93\u00a0mm) on September\u00a014. Sporadic power outages were also reported.[9] As the remnants of Julia interacted with a cold front near the coastline, parts of North Carolina received as much as 12\u00a0in (300\u00a0mm) of rain. One million gallons of sewage from Elizabeth City flowed into the Pasquotank River and Charles Creek. The Cashie River in Windsor, crested at 15\u00a0ft (4.6\u00a0m) on September\u00a022, about 2\u00a0ft (0.61\u00a0m) above major flood stage. In Windsor, several businesses and approximately 60\u00a0homes suffered water damage.[12] In Bertie County alone, 72\u00a0people had to be rescued from their homes and vehicles, while 61\u00a0others were evacuated from nursing homes.[13] A shelter was opened for displaced residents.[14] Damage in the county reached about $5\u00a0million in damage, including $4\u00a0million to property and $1\u00a0million to agriculture.[15] Flooding in Bertie, Currituck, and Hertford counties resulted in school closures for at least two days.[12] On September\u00a022, then-Governor Pat McCrory declared a state of emergency for Bertie, Camden, Chowan, Currituck, Dare, Gates, Halifax, Hertford, Northampton, Pasquotank, and Perquimans.[13] A disaster declaration was approved following Hurricane Matthew in October, which also included aid for victims of flooding during Julia.[16] The declaration allowed businesses and non-profit organizations in  Bertie, Chowan, Halifax, Hertford, Martin, Northampton, and Washington counties to apply for low-interest loans via the Small Business Administration, while loans up to $200,000\u00a0became available for needy homeowners.[17] Heavy rainfall was reported in southeastern Virginia, with 17.85\u00a0in (453\u00a0mm) of precipitation observed near Great Bridge. Numerous roads were washed out in several counties and independent cities, including Chesapeake, Franklin, Isle of Wight, Norfolk, Portsmouth, Southampton, Suffolk, and Virginia Beach.[18] In Chesapeake, flood waters overwhelmed the sewer system, causing sewage to enter the city's water system and local waterways.[12] Farther north, the remnants of the storm interacted with a frontal boundary, resulting in heavy rainfall in some portions of Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.[18] Throughout its path, damage from the storm amounted to about $6.13\u00a0million.[19]"

It formed on October\u00a01 in the Caribbean Sea as the seventeenth tropical storm, and initially moved slowly to the north. While passing west of Jamaica, the storm damaged banana plantations and killed one person. On October\u00a03, the storm became a hurricane, and the next day crossed western Cuba. Advance warning in the country prevented any storm-related fatalities, although four people suspected of looting were shot and killed during a curfew in Havana. The German travel writer Richard Katz witnessed the hurricane while in Havana, and described the experience in his book \"Loafing Around the Globe\" (\"Ein Bummel um Die Welt\").[3] After entering the Florida Straits, the hurricane turned to the northeast, producing tropical storm winds along the Florida Keys. High rainfall caused flooding, while three tornadoes spawned by the storm damaged houses in the Miami area. The hurricane reached peak winds of 125\u00a0mph (201\u00a0km/h) on October\u00a06 while moving through the Bahamas. It subsequently weakened and became extratropical on October\u00a08. The former hurricane lashed the coast of Nova Scotia with high winds and rain, leaving about $1\u00a0million (1933\u00a0CAD) in damage. Rough seas sank several ships and killed nine people in the region. The remnants of the hurricane eventually dissipated on October\u00a09 to the south of Newfoundland."

The next day, observations from a station at Cabo Gracias a Dios and a ship indicated a tropical storm had developed off the eastern coast of Honduras. Low atmospheric pressure suggested the system had winds of tropical storm force despite lack of direct observations. Moving northward, the storm gained size as it slowly intensified. Based on observations and interpolation of data, it is estimated the storm became a hurricane early on October\u00a03 while passing west of Jamaica.[5] That day, a station at South Negril Point that day reported a force\u00a08 on the Beaufort scale, well to the east of the center.[4] While approaching the southern coast of Cuba, the hurricane reached estimated winds of 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h).[5] At 0900\u00a0UTC on October\u00a04, the hurricane made landfall on the Zapata Peninsula of Cuba, followed by a second landfall on the Cuban mainland three hours later. Beginning at 1600\u00a0UTC that day, the capital, Havana, observed the passage of the eye, where a pressure of 976\u00a0mbar (28.8\u00a0inHg) was reported.[5] The hurricane weakened slightly over land before emerging into the Straits of Florida and re-intensifying. On October\u00a05, it turned to the northeast while remaining southeast of the Florida mainland, although the strongest winds remained over water. Early on October\u00a06 while the hurricane was moving through the Bahamas, a ship reported a pressure of 958\u00a0mbar (28.3\u00a0inHg), although it was unknown if it was in the center or the periphery of the storm. Based on the data, the maximum sustained winds were estimated at 125\u00a0mph (201\u00a0km/h), although the ship estimated winds of 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h). The storm maintained peak winds for about 18\u00a0hours, after which it weakened while accelerating to the northeast. After passing to the west of Bermuda on October\u00a07, the hurricane became extratropical the next day while still maintaining hurricane-force winds. The storm brushed the coast of Nova Scotia before it was last noted approaching another extratropical storm on October\u00a09 to the south of Atlantic Canada.[5]"

The storm wrecked small houses and damaged the local banana industry. There was one death in Jamaica.[6] The hurricane crossed western Cuba with winds estimated at 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h).[5] This prompted officials to declare a curfew for the capital in the midst of political upheaval following a coup. A newspaper described the curfew before the storm as \"the most peaceful night in a week.\"[7] However, the government ordered soldiers in Havana to shoot anyone suspected of looting, and four looters were killed during the storm's passage.[8] Heavy associated rainfall caused rivers to overflow in three provinces, flooding low-lying areas. In Cienfuegos, the storm destroyed several houses. Offshore northern Cuba, two United States ships took shelter at the port in Matanzas due to rough seas.[9] High tides flooded the Havana waterfront up to 3\u00a0ft (0.91\u00a0m) deep,[10] and several boats sank at the city's harbor.[8] Due to advance warning and evacuations, there were no direct deaths in the country,[9] and 20\u00a0people were injured.[8] Storm warnings were issued on the west coast of Florida to Boca Grande and on the east coast to Titusville, with hurricane warnings for the Florida Keys.[11] Although the hurricane passed just southeast of the Florida Keys, the highest winds reported in Florida were 44\u00a0mph (71\u00a0km/h) in Key West. The storm passed closest to Long Key, where winds were estimated at 63\u00a0mph (101\u00a0km/h), due to being on the weak side of the storm. Farther north, Miami reported winds of 35\u00a0mph (56\u00a0km/h).[5] Rainfall reached over 11\u00a0in (280\u00a0mm) in 24\u00a0hours in Key West.[12] There, the storm knocked over several trees and caused some power outages. Portions of the city were flooded while boats were washed ashore.[13] Elsewhere in Florida, three tornadoes were reported during the hurricane's passage. In Fort Lauderdale, a tornado injured one person, and another one in Miami knocked down four homes and injured two. The third tornado was in Hollywood, where several houses were damaged.[13][14] Later as the hurricane moved through the Bahamas, it produced winds of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) at Hope Town and 91\u00a0mph (146\u00a0km/h) at Millville, both on Abaco. The outer periphery of the storm brushed Nantucket to the west with winds of 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h) and Bermuda to the east with 46\u00a0mph (74\u00a0km/h).[5] While moving offshore Atlantic Canada, the former hurricane produced gale-force winds, peaking at 52\u00a0mph (84\u00a0km/h) in Halifax, Nova Scotia.[5] There, the storm also dropped heavy rainfall reaching 9.84\u00a0in (250\u00a0mm) over two days, including 3.6\u00a0in (91\u00a0mm) in 24\u00a0hours. Flooding covered streets in the province, causing traffic jams, and farmlands. In Annapolis Valley, the rainfall washed out a bridge while the winds damaged about one-third of the apple crop. The dam at Chocolate Lake overflowed due to the rainfall, and a dam broke in Great Village, destroying a nearby bridge. Many trees fell during the storm, resulting in power outages after some fell onto lines. Outside Nova Scotia, the storm produced winds of 51\u00a0mph (82\u00a0km/h) in Shediac, New Brunswick, where high waves left coastal damage. In Newfoundland, the storm washed out three bridges, as well as portions of roads and rails, and flooded one house. Throughout Atlantic Canada, high waves washed ashore, sank, or broke at least ten boats from their moorings, killing nine people including seven from an overturned boat sailing from Boston to Yarmouth. Overall damage in Canada was estimated at $1\u00a0million (1933\u00a0CAD), including $250,000 in lost apple crop.[15][nb 2]"

It drifted westward over the subsequent days, and on October\u00a015, while located over the South China Sea, the disturbance was classified as a tropical depression. Late the following day, the system was briefly upgraded into a tropical storm, but the storm dissipated quickly after making landfall in Vietnam early on October\u00a017. After trekking across Indochina, the remnants of Kim moved into the Andaman Sea and re-developed into a tropical cyclone on October\u00a019. However, Kim dissipated for good the next day while located inland over Burma. Tropical Storm Kim contributed to the worst monsoon rains in Thailand in 30 years. Sixteen of Thailand's 73\u00a0provinces were inundated due to the storm. In the capital of Bangkok, almost every street and alley sustained flooding, stranding motorists. Throughout the country, a total of 190 bridges and at least 1,000\u00a0roads were damaged. The tropical storm also destroyed 300\u00a0boats, 3,000\u00a0houses, and 19,750\u00a0acres (8,000\u00a0ha) of rice. Damage from both Kim and Tropical Storm Herbert, which affected the same areas as Kim a few weeks earlier, totaled $26 million (1983\u00a0USD). Due to Kim alone, over 200\u00a0people died in Thailand, and an additional 100\u00a0were killed due to widespread flooding in Bangladesh."

        "content": "Tropical Storm Kim originated from a weak tropical disturbance that formed to the northeast of Truk on October 9.[1] Over the next few days, the disturbance persisted while moving west; however, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) initially expected the disturbance to dissipate over the southern Philippines without further development. On October\u00a014, the disturbance became less organized over the Sulu Sea, only to move into the South China Sea the next day, where the disturbance was upgraded into a tropical depression by the JTWC. By this time, the monsoon trough was well developed in the South China Sea and provided a favorable environment aloft for further development.[1] At 18:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a015, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started monitoring the system.[2][nb 1][nb 2] Early on October\u00a016, a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) was issued,[1] and at midday, the JTWC reported that the system attained tropical storm status.[5] Later on October 16, the JMA upgraded Kim into a tropical storm, with winds of 75\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph), its peak intensity.[6] Five hours later, the JTWC reported that Kim made landfall on the coast of Vietnam at its peak intensity of 75\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph).[5] Operationally, the JTWC stopped issuing advisories early the next day after Kim's atmospheric circulation became less defined,[1] though intensity estimates from the JMA suggested that Kim maintained tropical storm intensity during this time.[1] Following a decrease in organization,[1] the JMA ceased tracking the system on October 18.[2] The remnants of Kim moved into Cambodia and then across the rest of Indochina while producing a large amount of convection. Under the anticipation of regeneration in the Andaman Sea, a TCFA was again issued by the JTWC during the afternoon hours on October\u00a018. Early the next day, the JTWC classified Kim as a tropical depression. Initially, the regenerated depression was expected to move across the southern tip of Burma and intensify further in the Bay of Bengal. Even though Kim moved across southern Burma as expected, it never moved into the Bay of Bengal. Instead, it drifted northwards along the coast of Burma, parallel to the Arakan Mountain Range and gradually weakened.[1] The JTWC issued their last warning on Kim at 18:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a020 while located over the Arakan Mountains.[1][5]"

In addition, several airline flights in and out of the city were delayed or canceled. The road that connected the city's airport was flooded, resulting in hundreds of cars abandoned.[9] During the first two weeks of October, 400\u00a0mm (15.7\u00a0in) of rain fell in Bangkok\u2013the most rainfall recorded in that time frame in thirty years\u2013much of the rain accumulating during the two weeks was due to Kim.[8] Elsewhere, more than 510,000 acres (206,390\u00a0ha) of farmland were submerged in the central and northeastern part of the country.[9] A total of 190\u00a0bridges and at least 1,000\u00a0roads were damaged.[9] In all, 844\u00a0houses and 76,533\u00a0fishing ponds were damaged,[10] while the tropical storm also destroyed or severely damaged 1,344\u00a0roads, 242\u00a0bridges, and 240\u00a0irrigation ditches.[11] An additional 300\u00a0boats, 3,000\u00a0houses, and 19,750\u00a0acres (8,000\u00a0ha) of rice were destroyed.[1][12] Nationwide, damage from both Kim and Herbert totaled $26\u00a0million.[13] Due to Kim alone, over 200\u00a0people were killed,[7] including four that were electrocuted and \"several\" children that drowned due to flash flooding.[9] Tropical Storm Kim contributed the worst monsoon season in Thailand in 30\u00a0years,[8] which continued for four months after the storm.[12] Elsewhere, remnants of the storm was responsible for flooding in Bangladesh, killing 100.[14]"

Many reports claimed that the yacht was irreparable, but it was later claimed that the damage was not serious and could be repaired.[clarification needed] A barge was destroyed, as was a large portion of the San Pedro wharf.[1] El Monte was buffeted by high winds, damaging corn crops and trees. Los Angeles and Visalia noted large amounts of rain, as much as 7 inches (180\u00a0mm), but wind strength as low.[1] Two researchers with NOAA, Michael Chenoweth and Christopher Landsea reconstructed the path of the hurricane using accounts from newspapers of the strong winds.

However, the Senior Meteorological Officer of the National Weather Center MetMalaysia, Dr Mohd Hisham Mohd Anip, do not rule out the possibility of the formation of a tornado frequency in this country on a regular basis, the three cases in nearly a month, has to do with changes in monsoon. Therefore, he said, it will conduct a study on the phenomenon to find the main reason why Malaysia is now seen as synonymous with the formation of a tornado that normally forms around the continental United States. \"Tornado ever recorded hit several states around the peninsula in 2010 and located in Penang, Perlis and Selangor, but the incident did not occur as frequently as in Kedah since lately. \"Whatever we will study the reasons for this phenomenon can be formed in Kedah including assessing why it happened and what the sources and criteria that cause a tornado to form the most important ... we want to know why Kedah to its destination,\" he told BH. On 14 October, at least 10 involving residential premises and a school around Kampung Alor Besar in Limavady, was hit by a tornado severely damaged confirmed of type 'landspout', before another similar incident hit five areas especially in Kampung Ulu Ulu, Kampung Sungai Kampung Baru dan Batin, here, causes 72 homes and damaged rural clinics, last Friday. Recently, strong winds as if a tornado confirmed type 'downdraft' also hit the area Taman Wira Imam, here, yesterday afternoon causing around 13 houses were damaged. Asked about the inter-monsoon which most closely associated as a cause of the formation of a tornado in Kedah, Mohd Hisham said, it causes the wind coming from different directions, but the atmosphere is also active during this leads to easy formation of storm clouds. \"The situation is thus facilitating the formation of a tornado, but in terms of its scientific we got quite sure why the phenomenon occurs frequently and it is concentrated in Kedah alone. \"The fact that the weather forecast system either in this country or in foreign countries, do not have the ability to detect the formation of a tornado's ... meaning we do not know where a tornado will start or formed. \"In fact, its size is too small tornado that is less than one kilometer (km) also complicate efforts to trace formation. Let's take the example of a tornado that swept ashore several areas in Kedah, it is only about the size of 20 to 30 meters with 30 movements kilometers per hour (km / h), \"he said.[1]"

Steering currents brought the storm northward, and it approached Charleston, South Carolina on 22\u00a0August, where a generally easterly flow preceded the storm indicated its passage far east of the city.[2] The hurricane made landfall at the mouth of the Cape Fear River in North Carolina later that day,[3] though the earliest impacts from the storm started several days earlier, with gusts initially toward the northeast but later curving southwestward. Reports of similar wind shifts throughout the region suggested that the gale persisted, stationary, for several hours. It eventually moved back out to sea while south of Norfolk, Virginia,[4] departing the region on 24\u00a0August.[2] The hurricane maintained 1-minute maximum sustained winds of 110\u00a0mph (175\u00a0km/h) while offshore,[5] equivalent to a Category\u00a02 system on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale.

The lighthouse on North Island flanking Winyah Bay collapsed under high winds, and in Georgetown proper, the hurricane was considered to be the worst since the 1804 Antigua\u2013Charleston hurricane, despite its storm surge being of a lesser size. A cotton field covering 94\u00a0acres was ruined nearby.[4] At Smithville, North Carolina, numerous ships experienced damage, while considerable destruction to structures was observed, with many wharves wrecked. Meanwhile, at Wilmington, the hurricane inflicted widespread damage, with many wharves severely damaged, and significant losses sustained by salt, sugar, rice, and lumber industries. The gable sections of three masonry houses were destroyed by wind or water, and wooden houses suffered especially badly, with many obliterated and those under construction flattened. One individual died after a wall collapsed and several slaves were killed, one by drowning, at local plantations.[7] At Bald Head Island, the United States Revenue Cutter Service vessel Governor Williams was stripped of its foremast and subsequently ran ashore before being repaired and continuing on its journey. A second boat owned by the agency, the Diligence, was tethered at port in Wilmington and endured no damage; similarly, little impact occurred at New Bern.[8] Throughout the storm, several vessels and supplies of stranded sailors were driven aground along the North Carolinan coast. On the Bogue Banks, the remains of the Adolphus and Atlantic were discovered, and at the Core Banks, a dead body was washed ashore, partially eaten by fish.[9] Moderate damage occurred upon the hurricane's arrival in Norfolk, Virginia. Winds toppled a number of newly built structures and chimneys, uprooted trees and fences, and washed two watercraft aground.[10] After the storm, alterations to the shoreline around the Chesapeake Bay permitted the full establishment of a town at Willoughby Spit.[11] The Rose-in-Bloom was caught in the hurricane while offshore of Barnegat Inlet, New Jersey,[12] en route to New York City from Charleston,[11] but was struck by a large wave which overturned the ship, resulting in the deaths of 21\u00a0of its 48\u00a0passengers and the loss of $171,000 of its $180,000 (1806\u00a0USD) cargo. The vessel only barely stayed afloat, with 30\u00a0bales of cotton preventing it from sinking entirely;[12] survivors were ferried to New York by the British brig Swift, which had then been traveling toward St. John's, Newfoundland.[11] The hurricane produced strong gusts within the vicinity of New York City, and at Belleville, New Jersey, several peach trees were defoliated and uprooted. Cape Cod, Massachusetts was struck by heavy rain and observed minor damage to its port. At Edgartown, meanwhile, an individual witnessed torrential rainfall, recording that a barrel was filled with 30\u00a0in (76\u00a0cm) of water, and estimating total rainfall reached 36\u00a0in (91\u00a0cm) there, where the storm devastated local crops and beached five cargo ships. At Brewster, meanwhile, severe damage to crops and salterns was noted, and 18\u00a0in (46\u00a0cm) of rainfall was recorded.[10] Reports in Boston, however, indicate more modest rainfall amounts, with a precipitation rate of 0.40\u00a0in (1.0\u00a0cm) per hour noted.[13]"

The U.S. Geological Survey estimated 53% of the state received more than six inches of rain,[2] (the greatest recorded amount being 9.86 inches (250\u00a0mm) in Somerset) which caused rivers throughout the state to flood.[3] The flood is considered the worst flood in Vermont, with the only comparisons being the 2011 Hurricane Irene floods and those of July 2023.[3][4]"

This low had abundant moisture associated with the remnants of a former tropical storm. As the low moved up the coast, a strong southeast air flow developed. This moisture-laden air was forced to rise as it encountered the Green Mountains, resulting in torrential downpours along and east of the mountains. Rainfall amounts at the Weather Bureau station in Northfield, for example, totaled 1.65 inches (42\u00a0mm) from 4 am to 11 am on the 3rd, with 4.24 inches (108\u00a0mm) falling from 11 am to 8 pm.

Floodwaters destroyed many bridges which were the towns' responsibility to maintain and repair, but many towns lacked the resources to rebuild their bridges.  The state government undertook the task and in so doing assumed a larger role in the statewide road system.[7][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] The next year, President Calvin Coolidge (a native of Vermont) visited the state. He saw how Vermont had recovered from the flood and made a famous speech in Bennington in which he observed, \u201cI love Vermont because of her hills and valleys, her scenery and invigorating climate, but most of all because of her indomitable people.\u201d He went on to praise \u201cthe people of this brave little state of Vermont\u201d for their endurance.[8]"

Bebinca originated as a low-pressure area south of Hong Kong. As the disturbance is moving westward, favorable conditions allow the system to organize into a tropical depression. On June 21, the depression was upgraded into a tropical storm despite the wind shear, which generated by a subtropical ridge. Bebinca slightly weakened back into a depression and made landfall over Hainan. It remained as a depression as it enters Gulf of Tonkin. Bebinca made its final landfall over Hanoi before finally dissipated on June 24."

Bebinca's passage weakened the system to tropical depression strength, and, despite moving over the Gulf of Tonkin, failed to restrengthen before making its final landfall on June 23 east of Hanoi.[9]"

A six-day tornado outbreak sequence, most of the tornadoes developed in a corridor from Lake Superior southwest to central Texas, while isolated tornadoes occurred in other areas. An especially destructive EF5 tornado destroyed one-third of Joplin, Missouri, resulting in 158 deaths and over 1,000 injuries.[7][8] The Joplin tornado was the deadliest in the United States since April 9, 1947, when an intense tornado killed 181 in the Woodward, Oklahoma, area. Tornado-related deaths also occurred in Arkansas, Kansas, Minnesota, and Oklahoma. Overall, the tornado outbreak resulted in 186 deaths, 8 of those non-tornadic, making it second only to the 2011 Super Outbreak as the deadliest since 1974. It was the second costliest tornado outbreak in United States history behind that same April 2011 outbreak, with insured damage estimated at $4\u20137 billion.[4]"

        "content": "April 2011 was the most active month for tornadoes on record, capped by a very large tornado outbreak (the largest on record) that killed 324 people in the final week. In contrast, the first three weeks of May were remarkably quiet; only a few isolated tornadoes were confirmed. However, this pattern changed abruptly as a strong low-pressure area, associated dry line and cold front tracked eastward. On May 21, a small system of thunderstorms developed in Brown County, Kansas, while another system formed to the southeast of Emporia, Kansas. The Brown county system spawned a brief tornado over Topeka, Kansas, causing minor damage. This system also caused significant damage in Oskaloosa, Kansas, and other communities. Meanwhile, the Emporia system spawned an EF3 tornado that struck Reading, Kansas; one person was killed, several others were injured, and at least 20 houses were destroyed.[9] These two systems developed several other tornadoes throughout the evening.[10] A moderate risk of severe weather was issued for much of the Midwest, as well as further south to Oklahoma for May 22. The first tornadic supercell developed in the mid-afternoon hours over the western Twin Cities in Minnesota, and caused moderate damage in the Minneapolis area.[11] Shortly thereafter, an intense tornado crept towards Harmony, Minnesota, prompting the National Weather Service to issue the first tornado emergency of the outbreak. Late that afternoon, a large, intense EF5 multiple-vortex tornado left catastrophic destruction in Joplin, Missouri. Causing 158 fatalities, it was the deadliest single tornado in the U.S. since at least 1947. Once again, a moderate risk of severe weather was issued on May 23\u2014this time for the southern Plains and the lower Great Lakes. Forecasts showed that the main threats would be damaging wind and large hail instead of frequent tornadoes; the stationary front lacked the necessary wind shear to sustain the type of tornadic supercells seen on May 22. This prediction came to light, as only scattered, and mostly weak tornadoes were reported throughout the day. However, an EF2 tornado caused significant damage in Tennessee and Kentucky. On May 24, a high risk of severe weather was issued for parts of south-central Kansas, central and eastern Oklahoma, and extreme north-central Texas; a moderate risk was issued for surrounding areas in those three states plus northwestern Arkansas and southwestern Missouri. Throughout this region, strong to violent tornadoes were considered to be highly probable for three reasons: (1) the stationary front was expected to maintain its position over the region, (2) wind shear was expected to greatly increase, and (3) these elements would be associated with an incoming trough. Late that morning, the tornado threat increased to 45%, a rare occurrence matching the widespread April 27 outbreak.[12] At 12:50\u00a0p.m. CDT, the SPC issued a Particularly Dangerous Situation (PDS) tornado watch for parts of central Oklahoma, including Oklahoma City and northern Texas, in effect until 10:00\u00a0p.m. CDT.[13] Numerous tornadoes touched down in several regions, with the first activity being in western Oklahoma that afternoon where several very intense tornadoes developed, including another EF5 (the sixth of the year). They did not cause extensive damage in Oklahoma City, but 11 deaths were reported among extensive damage just to the southwest of the OKC metro. Other tornado clusters developed in central Kansas that afternoon and in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex that evening. Once again on May 25, a high risk of severe storms was issued for the middle Mississippi River valley from near Memphis, Tennessee, northward to north of Evansville, Indiana, and was expanded late that morning northward to near Indianapolis, Indiana, northwest to near St. Louis, Missouri, southeast to just west of Nashville, Tennessee, and southwest to near Little Rock, Arkansas.[14] Several hours before the outbreak was expected to begin, a PDS tornado watch was issued for western Kentucky, southern Indiana, the southern half of Illinois and eastern Missouri. The entire state of Indiana, southern Michigan, and most of Missouri were under tornado watches. Widespread tornado activity occurred that day across the central and eastern U.S. An EF3 destroyed many homes in the town of Bedford, Indiana, and an EF2 wedge tornado caused severe damage in Sedalia, Missouri. Tornado activity continued on May 26, but most were weak. Eight separate EF1 tornadoes touched down across Pennsylvania, and an isolated EF3 tornado destroyed multiple homes near Bush, Louisiana."

        "content": "On May 22, a large, devastating EF5 tornado tracked through Joplin, Missouri, leaving behind catastrophic damage. The tornado was multiple-vortex in nature and was up to one mile (1.6\u00a0km) wide. Mainly the southern part of the city was affected, with most structures in the area either damaged or destroyed. 158 people[15][16][17] were directly killed by the tornado, with at least eight more indirect fatalities, making it the deadliest United States tornado since 1947 and one of the deadliest single tornadoes ever recorded. The tornado first touched down in Newton County, Missouri, just east of the Missouri\u2013Kansas state line at 5:34\u00a0p.m. CDT (22:34 UTC), initially knocking down large trees.[18] The tornado moved east-northeast and strengthened to EF1 intensity as it continued through rural areas towards Joplin, snapping trees and power poles and damaging outbuildings. Widening, the tornado then tracked into the more densely populated southwest corner of the city near the Twin Hills Country Club. It heavily damaged several homes at a subdivision in this area at up to EF3 strength. The tornado continued to cause EF3 damage as it moved through another subdivision just east of Iron Gates Road.[19] Numerous homes were destroyed and multiple vehicles tossed around, some of which were thrown onto or rolled into homes. The tornado reached EF4 intensity just before crossing S. Schifferdecker Avenue.[18] The tornado began producing EF4 damage only four minutes after touching down, as several small but well-built commercial buildings were flattened. Consistent EF4 to EF5 damage was noted east of S. Schifferdecker Avenue and continued through most of southern Joplin. Numerous homes, businesses, and medical buildings were flattened in this area, with concrete walls collapsed and crushed into the foundations. A large steel-reinforced step and floor structure leading to a completely destroyed medical building was \"deflected upward several inches and cracked\". Steel trusses were deformed, vehicles were thrown and mangled, and several 300-pound concrete parking stops anchored with rebar were torn from a parking lot in this area and thrown up to 60 yards (55\u00a0m) away. Widespread, catastrophic damage occurred around the St. John's Regional Medical Center, which itself lost nearly every window on three sides, interior walls, ceilings, and part of its roof. The hospital's life flight helicopter was also blown away and destroyed. The building was later torn down due to the severity of the structural damage.[18] Wind-rowing of debris was noted in this area, more concrete parking stops were removed from the St. John's parking lot, and virtually every house near McClelland Boulevard and 26th Street was flattened. Some homes were swept completely away, and trees sustained severe debarking.[18] The tornado maintained EF5 intensity as it moved to the east, either heavily damaging or completely destroying nearly every structure directly in its path, including several larger institutional buildings. Entire neighborhoods were leveled, trees were stripped completely of their bark, vehicles were tossed up to several blocks.[18] A large church, a nursing home, Franklin Technology Center, St. Mary's Catholic Church and School, and Joplin High School were all destroyed, and the Greenbriar Nursing Home was completely leveled, with 21 fatalities. Several large apartment buildings, a Dillons grocery store, and a bank were destroyed near Connecticut Avenue. Along Rangeline Road, a large commercial district was impacted, where a Walmart and a Home Depot were completely destroyed, along with numerous other businesses and restaurants. The manager of the Pizza Hut was sucked out of the freezer and killed, although others survived inside.[20][21] High-end damage continued around Duquesne Road in southeast Joplin, where many houses and industrial and commercial buildings were flattened. Large metal warehouse structures were swept cleanly from their foundations, and heavy industrial vehicles were thrown up to 400 yards (370\u00a0m). A Cummins warehouse, a concrete block and steel building, was destroyed, and a nearby Fastrip gas station and convenience store was completely destroyed as the last area of EF5 damage was noted. Many homes were destroyed in a nearby subdivision at EF3\u2013EF4 intensity, and East Middle School sustained major damage.[18] The tornado continued on an east to east-southeast trajectory towards I-44 where it weakened. EF2\u2013EF3 damage occurred near US 71 (exit 11; now the I-49 interchange). The weakening tornado continued to track into the rural areas of southeastern Jasper County and northeastern Newton County where damage was generally minor to moderate, with trees, mobile homes, outbuildings, and frame homes damaged mainly at EF0 to EF1 strength. The tornado lifted east of Diamond at 6:20\u00a0p.m. CDT (23:20 UTC), according to aerial surveys. The damage path was 22.1 miles (35.6\u00a0km) long through Jasper and Newton counties. In addition to 158 deaths, over 1,150 others were injured along the path.[18] A separate EF2 tornado touched down near Wentworth from the same supercell about 25 miles (40\u00a0km) east-southeast of Joplin, beginning roughly ten minutes before the dissipation of this tornado. Damage was estimated at $2.8\u00a0billion (2011 USD).[18]"

        "content": "During the early evening of May 24, a long-tracked, extremely violent, multiple vortex, EF5 wedge tornado touched down east-southeast Hinton, Oklahoma, and produced extreme damage in rural portions of Canadian County, Kingfisher, and Logan counties, killing nine people and injuring 181 others along a 63.1-mile (101.5\u00a0km) long path.[22][23] Shortly after an EF3 tornado in Caddo County dissipated, this tornado began in southwestern Canadian County and quickly became violent, debarking numerous trees as it passed through areas several miles southwest of Calumet. As it approached and crossed I-40 west of El Reno, it reached its maximum intensity. Three people were killed as two vehicles were tossed more than 1,093 yards (999\u00a0m) from the road and obliterated, the victims being found stripped of clothing 1\u20444 mile (0.40\u00a0km) from the interstate and left \"unrecognizable\". Only pieces of the vehicle's frames were reportedly recovered.[24][25][26] A nearby 20,000-pound (9,100\u00a0kg) oil tanker truck that was parked at an oil production site near the interstate was thrown approximately one mile (1.6\u00a0km) into a wooded gully.[23][27] Several homes were swept completely away along I-40, trees were completely debarked, and the ground was heavily scoured in some areas.[28][29] At the nearby Cactus-117 oil rig site, a 1,900,000-pound (860,000\u00a0kg) oil derrick was blown over and rolled three times. Due to the extreme nature of the damage at the Cactus-117 oil rig and along I-40, damage in that area was rated EF5. The tornado weakened slightly as it passed north of El Reno and continued northeast, producing EF3 to EF4 damage in rural areas.[22][25] The tornado then reintensified and passed northwest of Piedmont as a high-end EF4, leveling multiple homes and causing additional fatalities. The Falcon Lake subdivision was particularly hard hit, and multiple homes and vehicles were swept into the lake. One home had nothing left but the foundation slab and an above ground reinforced concrete shelter sustained damage to its metal door from debris impacts. An SUV in this area was thrown 780 yards (710\u00a0m) into a wooded thicket, and had its frame torn from the vehicle body, which was found crumpled around a debarked tree. The frame was twisted apart and was found nearby, along with the engine block and axles.[23][30] The tornado weakened to EF3 strength as it crossed into Kingfisher County debarking trees and heavily damaging structures. The tornado then weakened further to EF2 strength, with damage confined to outbuildings and trees.[22] Crossing into Logan County south of Cashion, the tornado reintensified slightly, producing a mixture of EF2 and EF3 damage as large high-tension towers were toppled and manufactured homes were destroyed. Frame homes were left with only interior rooms standing in this area, and two people who were caught outside during the tornado were killed. The tornado then rapidly weakened, causing EF0 to EF1 damage along the north side of Guthrie before dissipating.[25][31] The mesonet station at El Reno recorded a wind gust of 151\u00a0mph (243\u00a0km/h) as the tornado passed by, which set a record for the highest wind speed observed by the Oklahoma Mesonet.[32] This was the first EF5 tornado to strike Oklahoma since 1999, when an F5 tornado killed 36 people in and around southern and central parts of the Oklahoma City metropolitan area.[31] Another intense EF3 tornado struck the El Reno area two years later on May 31, 2013, and also struck several storm chasers, three of whom were killed, in addition to a local resident that was following the storm and four other people. A QLCS EF3 tornado also struck the town on May 25, 2019, killing two people.[33]"

        "content": "As the EF5 El Reno\u2013Piedmont tornado dissipated on the evening of the May 24, a separate supercell thunderstorm produced another violent tornado further to the south in Grady County.[34] The tornado touched down along the southwest side of Chickasha as a narrow cone shaped tornado, initially causing EF0 damage to roofs, trees, and fences. Continuing northeastward across the south side of town, the tornado reached EF2 strength as it struck a mobile home park, killing one person at that location. A car wash, automotive shop, gas station, and car dealership were damaged nearby. Several apartment buildings and a strip mall sustained major structural damage as the tornado exited town.[34][35] The tornado destroyed outbuildings, snapped trees, and tossed farming equipment as it crossed US 62 east of town. After crossing the highway, the tornado began to rapidly grow in size and intensity, reaching EF3 strength as homes lost their exterior walls and trees were debarked nearby. Several metal buildings and homes were destroyed at EF2 to EF3 strength along the south side of Friend Road. The tornado crossed the road and became large and wedge-shaped, reaching EF4 intensity, scouring the ground to bare soil, debarking trees, and leveling homes, one of which was reduced to a bare slab (though this home was nailed rather than bolted to its foundation). Several vehicles were thrown hundreds of yards nearby, including an SUV that was carried 300 yards (270\u00a0m) and crumpled into a ball.[35] The tornado maintained EF4 strength crossed E1340 Road further to the northeast, reducing two well-built homes to rubble and destroying two nearby metal buildings. Many trees were debarked in this area, and a mixture of scoured crops, mud, and straw was found piled up to a depth of six feet (1.8\u00a0m) against a nearby fence line. A third home sustained collapse of its exterior walls. Further along the path, another well-built home was flattened at EF4 strength, a metal building was destroyed, and vehicles were thrown up to 300 yards (270\u00a0m) away along Ballard Road before the violent tornado tore across a series of open fields further to the northeast, leaving behind a continuous swath of debarked trees and scoured grass. An oil pump jack was also destroyed in this area.[35] The tornado weakened momentarily as it passed to the northwest of the Indian Ridge Golf Course, producing only EF1 tree damage. The tornado re-intensified as it crossed NW 25th Street, completely debarking numerous trees and obliterating several metal buildings, outbuildings, and mobile homes. Several vehicles parked near a residence along N2980 Road were thrown up to 400 yards (370\u00a0m) away, some of which were wrapped around trees or stripped down to their frames, and severe ground scouring occurred in this area. Numerous homes were heavily damaged or destroyed in a nearby semi-rural subdivision, one of which was leveled at EF4 intensity.[35] The tornado then crossed into McClain County, tearing through residential areas along the north edge of Blanchard. According to NWS damage surveyors, the tornado shrunk and tightened to \"plausibly EF5 strength\"[35] as it approached and crossed Kitty Hawk Road, scouring away a large area of pavement. Sections of asphalt were gouged out by high-velocity debris impacts further along the road, and nearby trees were reduced to completely debarked stumps. As the now narrow, but very intense tornado ripped through the front lawn of a nearby house, all grass and several inches of topsoil was scoured away in a narrow swath. Several homes were reduced to bare slabs in this area, and vehicles were thrown up to 600 yards (550\u00a0m) away, including a pickup truck that was torn into multiple pieces.[30][35] Due to intensity of the damage in this area, surveyors noted that the tornado was \"plausibly EF5\" as it clipped the north side of Blanchard, though the fact that the homes swept away were missing some of their anchor bolt washers led to a high-end EF4 rating being assigned instead. Just to the northeast, the tornado maintained its strength as it struck a steel-reinforced concrete dome home, which was shredded by flying debris and sustained partial cracking of its frame. Asphalt was scoured from the home's paved driveway.[35] The tornado then weakened to EF3 strength as it crossed Sandrock Road, debarking trees and heavily damaging or destroying several homes in nearby subdivisions. Several cars were blown out from underneath a nearby overpass and mangled. The tornado weakened further as it passed southeast of Newcastle, with mainly tree and power pole damage noted in that area. Additional minor damage to trees, power lines, and outbuildings occurred as the tornado crossed into Cleveland County, executing a loop in a field before dissipating just west of Moore.[34][35] Overall, one person was killed and 48 other people were injured by this tornado along its 32-mile (51\u00a0km) long path. This tornado followed a similar path to that of the May 1999 Bridge Creek\u2013Moore tornado.[34]"

        "content": "During the evening of May 24, this narrow but violent EF4 tornado caused major damage in rural parts of Grady and McClain Counties at the same time another violent tornado from a separate supercell storm was devastating areas in and around Chickasha and Blanchard.[36] The tornado touched down west of Bradley, causing EF0 to EF1 tree damage as it crossed SH-19. Continuing to the northeast, the tornado intensified further to EF3 strength as it passed through rural areas of Grady County, snapping and debarking numerous trees. An extensive swath of ground scouring began as the tornado crossed into McClain County. The tornado then reached EF4 strength as it crossed SH-76, leveling and sweeping away several well-built homes. Vehicles were thrown long distances and mangled almost beyond recognition nearby. The tornado weakened and narrowed as it crossed CR 410, with EF2 to EF3-strength damage occurring in that area. The tornado re-intensified to EF4 strength further to the northeast as it passed between Dibble and Washington. Numerous well-built homes were leveled in that area, and some were swept completely away. Unusual cycloidal debris impact scars were noted in open fields as well.[28] One well-built home in this area with numerous anchor bolts was reduced to a bare slab, though a metal fence immediately next to the house remained standing and grass on the property was not scoured. Another home that was reduced to a bare slab in this area had anchor bolts spaced every two feet (well above the standard of anchoring required for an EF5 rating), though a closer inspection of the home site revealed that a large mobile home frame had smashed into the house during the tornado, and a Jacuzzi found in the rubble behind the house was still in usable condition. Due to these contextual discrepancies, damage in this area was rated high-end EF4 rather than EF5.[30][36][37] The tornado curved sharply to the north and weakened to EF3 strength as it continued north of Washington, though one final area of EF4 damage occurred southwest of Goldsby as a large, well-built home was completely swept away with only the slab remaining, and large metal storage tanks behind the house were tossed. This home was specifically engineered to be tornado resistant, though close inspection of the foundation revealed that some of the anchor bolt washers were missing, and the ones that were present were slightly too small, preventing a rating higher than EF4. Further to the north, minor EF0 damage occurred near David Jay Perry Airport before the tornado dissipated. Large amounts of debris from this tornado reportedly fell from the sky in Norman.[28][30][36] Overall, the tornado was on the ground for 23 miles (37\u00a0km). 61 people were injured, though no fatalities occurred. Despite the presence of multiple well-built, anchor-bolted homes being swept completely away along the path, the tornado was not rated EF5 due to several contextual discrepancies and minor anchoring flaws. A high-end EF4 rating was applied as a result. Despite this, much like the Chickasha\u2013Blanchard tornado, the EF4 rating is disputed, and the tornado is suspected by some in the academic sector to have been an EF5.[23][permanent dead link][36][38]"

The tornado touched down at 11:53\u00a0p.m. CDT (04:53 UTC) as an EF1 south of Branch in Franklin County, snapping trees and power poles and damaging a mobile home.[39] The tornado then clipped a section of Logan County, snapping multiple trees before crossing back into Franklin county, where it grew to nearly one mile (1.6\u00a0km) wide and reached low-end EF4 strength as it tore through the small community of Etna, completely destroying numerous frame homes, mobile homes, and a metal building. Some of the homes were well-built, but were left with only a small amount of debris on their foundations. Several trees were debarked, power poles were snapped, outbuildings were destroyed, and the ground was scarred by debris impacts. One person in Etna was killed, and six others were seriously injured. Past Etna, the tornado destroyed a very well-built steel-frame home, leaving only interior walls standing. The structure was not entirely flattened, though a low-end EF4 rating was applied due to how well-constructed the house was. As the tornado crossed back into Logan County, it weakened to EF2 strength but grew extremely large, expanding to 1+1\u20444 miles (2.0\u00a0km) in width and snapping numerous trees.[40][41][42] The tornado then intensified to EF3 strength, and once again crossed back into Franklin County, striking the town of Denning. Numerous homes and mobile homes were destroyed in Denning, many trees and power poles were snapped, and large 100-foot tall metal high-tension poles were bent to the ground. Two people were killed in town and 11 others were injured.[43] The tornado then continued into Johnson County and weakened to EF2 strength, heavily damaging several homes in Centerpoint, and downing numerous trees in the community cemetery. The tornado then struck the community of Bethlehem, where frame homes were damaged, mobile homes were destroyed, and one person was killed. Continuing through the Harmony community, the tornado damaged multiple residences, barns, chicken houses, and outbuildings before continuing into the Ozark National Forest and dissipating southeast of Rosetta at 12:50\u00a0a.m. CDT (05:50 UTC).[44][45] The tornado was on the ground for a total of 45.71 miles (73.56\u00a0km), killing four people and injuring 27 others.[45]"

Along with the 1921 Tampa Bay hurricane, it is one of only two major hurricanes to make landfall along Central Florida's west coast since Florida became a United States territory in 1821. The 1848 storm is believed to have formed in the Gulf of Mexico and made landfall near modern-day Clearwater in Pinellas County on September 24. It generated the highest storm surge ever recorded in Tampa Bay, reshaping parts of the nearby coastline and destroying many of the small settlements in the area at the time. Although precise records are unavailable, the storm's barometric pressure and storm surge are consistent with at least a Category\u00a04 hurricane.[1][2][3] The storm made its way across the largely uninhabited Florida peninsula over the next two days, and although weakened by the time it emerged in the Atlantic Ocean, it caused substantial damage on the east coast as well. Early Florida pioneer William Whitaker called the storm \"the granddaddy of all hurricanes.\"[4]"

The water near Fort Brooke at the mouth of the Hillsborough River rose about 15 feet (4.6\u00a0m),[7] the Interbay Peninsula where South Tampa and MacDill Air Force Base currently reside was mostly submerged as \"Old Tampa Bay and Hillsborough Bay met\",[8][9] and the peninsula of modern Pinellas County was inundated \"to the waist.\"[9][10] The storm destroyed the fishing rancho of Antonio M\u00e1ximo Hern\u00e1ndez, reputedly lower Pinellas' first white settler, forcing him to emigrate permanently.[11] The storm almost obliterated the citrus crop and destroyed the main house at St. Helena plantation on the northwest corner of Tampa Bay \u2014 now part of Safety Harbor \u2014 forcing the residents to shelter on an elevated Tocobaga midden. Even so, they nearly drowned as the storm tide eroded part of the five-hundred-year-old mound.[11] Winds also felled almost all of the trees along what is now Indian Rocks Road in Largo.[12] General R. D. A. Wade, commanding at Fort Brooke, reported the destruction of the wharves, public buildings, and storehouses with very few structures remaining.[9] B. P. Curry, the fort's assistant surgeon, reported the hospital destroyed.  Only five houses were left standing in the town of Tampa, and they were all damaged.[9] The water rose twelve feet higher than had even been recorded, and strong winds downed many ancient live oak trees in and around the fort.[13] The storm substantially altered the coastal geography of the Tampa Bay area, cutting new inlets, filling in others, and altering the shape of bays and keys, thereby making navigational charts useless to mariners.[13][14] Allen's Creek was widened from less than 200 feet (61.0\u00a0m) to about half a mile at its mouth. Passage Key, between Egmont Key and Anna Maria, was obliterated but reformed later. The storm created what would become known as \"Soldier's Hole\" at Mullet Key, so called because soldiers at Fort De Soto used it as a swimming hole. An inlet at John's Pass was cut by the surge but has since shifted north. The storm destroyed the lighthouse on Egmont Key, and the keeper (Marvel Edwards) rode out hurricane in a rowboat tied to a palm tree. The end of the rope was later found 9\u00a0ft (2.74\u00a0m) off the ground, which had an elevation of about 6\u00a0ft (1.83\u00a0m). At Englewood, Stump Pass was cut. Casey's Pass was opened at Venice. New Pass was opened between Sarasota Bay and the Gulf, splitting Palm Island into Longboat and Lido Keys.[15]  Farther south, the storm significantly damaged the Charlotte Harbor area near present-day Fort Myers.[6] Elsewhere, ships also encountered the storm. A brig, sighted in the Gulf of Mexico near Cedar Key, encountered the storm while at most 80 miles (129\u00a0km) from St. Marks, Florida; the ship lost its mast to the storm.[6] Damage on the east coast may have been less severe, but the storm still produced significant effects and was described in the Savannah Republican as, \"blowing 'great guns' \u2013 the hardest blow felt [on the St. Johns River] for several years.\" It blew down houses in Jacksonville and caused flooding in St. Augustine, as well as interference with shipping on the St. Johns River.[16]"

The most affected province[a] was Nghe An, with one fatality.[18] In the Qu\u1ea3ng B\u00ecnh Province, fishing boats were washed ashore by waves as high as 5\u00a0m (16\u00a0ft); there, seven people were injured. A boat carrying eight weather officials were rescued by the national guard because of the storm. During July 17, flooded streets and disrupted train services stranded more than 4,000 passengers in the capital. Railway services from Hanoi to Vinh were canceled while trains from Hanoi to Saigon were delayed by five to seven hours.[19] The storm also hit the provinces of Thanh H\u00f3a and H\u00e0 T\u0129nh.[20] The Irrigation Department General Thongplew Kongjun stated that the department had multiple plans and measures to tame the impact caused by the storm. Including ordering every district to have an irrigation office and/or adding pumps.[21] The storm also caused multiple severe traffic jams, and capsized a ship, injuring seven people.[22] Power lines in three provinces were also damaged as a result of the storm.[23] Eight flights were also cancelled by the airline VietJet Air.[24] Multiple other airlines also cancelled ten other flights.[25] Overall, in Vietnam, the storm left 14 people dead and damaged around 2,700 houses.[26] About 50 boats sank.

It has been estimated that a similar hurricane would cause about $250 billion in damages if a similar storm were to occur in 2014.[2] Despite that, a even earlier and more intense hurricane struck the greater area during the pre-Columbian era (between 1278\u20131438) which left evidence that was detected in South Jersey via paleotempestological research.[3] A third and more recent storm was the 1893 New York hurricane, while the fourth was Hurricane Irene in 2011. The storm was the first of three tropical cyclones recorded in the 1821 Atlantic hurricane season, and was first observed off the southeast United States coast on September 1 likely as a major hurricane. It then moved ashore near Wilmington, North Carolina during the late part of September 2. It then passed near Norfolk, Virginia before moving striking the Delmarva Peninsula and New Jersey on September 3. Shortly after, the hurricane struck modern day Jamaica Bay, which would later become part of New York City.

Initially, it was believed to be the same storm that struck Guadeloupe on the same day, though subsequent research indicated there were two separate storms.[4] The hurricane then tracked by the Bahamas, and had likely already attained major hurricane status while in the open Atlantic. It then began approaching the United States coastline with sustained winds estimated of at least 130\u00a0mph (210\u00a0km/h). Some estimates suggest the storm likely reached high-end Category 4 to Category 5 status on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale sometime before making landfall near Wilmington, North Carolina.[5] This would make it the most intense tropical cyclone to make landfall at such a latitude in the world. It later turned to the northeast to cross the Pamlico Sound.[6] The hurricane then accelerated northeastward, and passed over the Hampton Roads area early on September 3. After crossing the Chesapeake Bay, the cyclone made its 2nd landfall around Assateague Island shortly before striking modern day Ocean City, Maryland likely as a high-end Category 3 or Category 4 storm.[6] It then continued to traversed the Delmarva Peninsula near the Atlantic coastline. At ~1500 UTC, the eye passed directly over Cape Henlopen, Delaware where a thirty-minute period of calm was reported. The storm then began its journey across the Delaware Bay until it made landfall and passed over Cape May, New Jersey where a fifteen-minute calm was also reported.[7] Modern researchers estimate it was still a Category 3 or 4 hurricane upon striking New Jersey, and one of few hurricanes to hit the state.[8][9] The hurricane continued to parallel the coastline just inland until it exited into Lower New York Bay where the hurricane made its fourth and final landfall in New York City at ~1930 UTC, during a very low tide.[3] Some researchers suggest it was still a Category 3 at the time, which would make it the only major hurricane to directly hit the city.[10] The storm had a unusually fast forward speed of 35\u00a0mph (55\u00a0km/h) and pressure of 965 mbar upon moving ashore.[10][1] The storm then continued northeastward through New England, and began losing its identity upon entering Massachusetts on September 4.[11] One researcher suggest that the cyclone tracked northeastward over southeastern Maine,[6] while another assessed the storm as passing far west of Maine.[12] Based on the arrangement of effects caused in New England from the storm, meteorologist William C. Redfield deduced that the wind field & center of tropical cyclones are circular in nature. Previous of this, they were believed to have been in a straight line.[12]"

Strong winds occurred across eastern North Carolina, resulting in at least 76 destroyed houses. Numerous people were killed in Currituck.[7] The strongest winds of the hurricane lasted for about an hour in southeastern Virginia, after which the storm rapidly abated. Several houses were completely destroyed, with many others receiving moderate to severe damage. The winds destroyed most of the roof of the courthouse, and uprooted trees across the region; fallen tree limbs damaged a stone bridge in Norfolk. The hurricane produced a strong storm surge along the Virginia coastline, which reached at least 10 feet (3.0\u00a0m) at Pungoteague along the Delmarva Peninsula. The storm surge, which reached several hundred yards inland, destroyed two bridges and flooded many warehouses along the Elizabeth River. Rough waves grounded the USS\u00a0Guerriere and the USS\u00a0Congress, and also destroyed several schooners and brigs. Along the eastern shore, the storm surge flooded barrier islands along the Atlantic coastline, causing severe crop damage and downing many trees. Several houses were destroyed, and at Pungoteague the impact of the hurricane was described as \"unexampled destruction\". At least five people drowned in Chincoteague. The storm is considered to be one of the most violent hurricanes on record in the Mid-Atlantic, and caused $200,000 in damage in Virginia (1821 USD, or ~$5.6 million 2024 USD).[6] Gale-force winds affected the Delmarva Peninsula and on Poplar Island in Talbot County, Maryland, where winds peaked ~1600 UTC on September 3.[7] The strongest winds were confined to the Atlantic coastline, however outer rainbands still produced heavy rainfall in greater Baltimore-Washington D.C. area.[13] Fierce winds were observed in Cape Henlopen, Delaware, with the strongest gales occurring after the eye passed over the area.[7] Upon making landfall on Cape May, New Jersey, the cyclone produced a 5-foot (1.5\u00a0m) storm surge on the Delaware Bay side of the city.[13] Lasting for several hours, the hurricane-force winds were described as \"blowing with great violence\",[7] and caused widespread devastation across the region.[13] Wind gusts in Cape May County reached over 110\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h), and around 130\u00a0mph (210\u00a0km/h) in Atlantic County.[14] In Little Egg Harbor, the hurricane caused catastrophic damaged to the port. Strong winds reached as far inland as Philadelphia, where winds of over 40\u00a0mph (65\u00a0km/h) downed trees and chimneys. Precipitation in the city accrued to 3.92 inches (100\u00a0mm). Further to the north, the hurricane destroyed a windmill at Bergen Point, New Jersey.[13] Despite the hurricane occurring during low tide, it still produced a storm surge of over 29 feet (8.8\u00a0m) along several portions of the New Jersey coastline, causing significant overwash.[3] The hurricane also produced a extraordinarily high storm surge of 13 feet (4.0\u00a0m) in merely an hour at Battery Park; a record only broken 191 years later by Hurricane Sandy. Manhattan Island was completely flooded to Canal Street. Even despite the record flooding, the storm surge would have been much greater if it had not struck at low tide.[15] Fortunately, only a few deaths were reported in the city due to the affected neighborhoods being much less populated than the modern day.[16] The hurricane also brought light rainfall and strong winds that left severe damage across the city. High tides occurred along the Hudson River. Strong waves and winds blew many ships ashore along Long Island in which sinking ship killed 17 people. Along Long Island, the winds destroyed several buildings and left crops destroyed.[13] In New England, the hurricane produced widespread gale-force winds, with damage being greatest in Connecticut.[11]  The Black Rock Harbor Light in Black Rock, Connecticut was later destroyed on September 21, due to the storm.[13][17] Elsewhere in the state, the winds damaged & destroyed many churches, houses and buildings. Moderate crop damage to fruit was reported as well. The strong winds extended into eastern Massachusetts as well, though little damage was reported in the Boston area.[11] Hurricane-force winds reached as far north as Maine.[14]"

        "content": " Tropical Storm Fay was the first tropical cyclone to make landfall in the U.S state of New Jersey since Hurricane Irene in 2011. The sixth named storm of the very active 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, Fay was the earliest sixth named storm on record in the basin when it formed on July\u00a09. Fay originated from a surface low that formed over the Northern Gulf of Mexico on July 3 and slowly drifted eastward, before crossing over the Florida Panhandle. The system subsequently drifted across the Southeastern United States as a well-defined low pressure system, before emerging off the coast of North Carolina on July 8. From there, the storm utilized favorable conditions for development, or tropical cyclogenesis, and coalesced into a tropical storm on July\u00a09. The storm intensified, reaching its peak intensity on July 10, with maximum 1-minute sustained winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 998 millibars (29.5\u00a0inHg). While moving northward, Fay made landfall on New Jersey later that day. After making landfall, the storm quickly lost most of its organization and rapidly transitioned into a post-tropical cyclone over New York on July\u00a011, before being absorbed by a larger extratropical low over Quebec on July 12. Fay's precursor disturbance was responsible for extensive rainfall and flash flooding in the Southeastern United States, especially within Georgia and South Carolina. After its landfall, Tropical Storm Fay brought high winds and stormy weather to much of the Mid-Atlantic states and the Northeastern United States, with the heaviest rains occurring west of Long Island. Six people were killed by rip currents and flooding related to the storm. Many interstates and other principal highways throughout the Philadelphia and New York City metropolitan areas were flooded and were left impassable, leading to widespread road closures and disruption to commuters. Uprooted trees and damaged power lines from windy conditions caused thousands of power outages in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Total economic losses from Fay in the United States exceeded US$220 million."

        "content": "Fay can first be traced back to a decaying trough of frontal origin, which was drifting across the southeastern United States on July 1\u20132.[1] A portion of the trough formed into a low pressure system off the coast of Georgia, which would later become Tropical Storm Edouard, and the remaining section of the trough persisted over the northern Gulf of Mexico and proceeded to spawn an elongated region of low atmospheric pressure.[1] By July\u00a04, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) first mentioned the possibility of eventual tropical cyclogenesis from this trough in the northern Gulf of Mexico, which at that time consisted of disorganized convection, or thunderstorms.[2] A smaller-scale low pressure center formed within the disturbance, but before the feature could further consolidate, it moved inland near Panama City, Florida around 06:00 UTC on July 6.[1] Surface and Doppler weather radar observations confirmed the feature had a small 90 nmi radius of 1-minute sustained winds up to 35\u00a0mph (56\u00a0km/h), characteristic of a tropical cyclone, but was accompanied by a large, disorganized area of thunderstorms and thus, didn't meet the NHC's criteria to be deemed a tropical cyclone.[1] While inland, the NHC assessed a 50% probability that the weather system would become a tropical or subtropical cyclone, which the agency soon raised to a 70% probability.[3][4] The low moved through Georgia and proceeded to turned eastward under the influence of the southern edge of the mid-latitude westerly winds, crossing over southern South Carolina, before emerging into the Western Atlantic on July 8.[1] On July 9, the thunderstorm activity of the low increased as it moved northeastward, parallel to the coast of North Carolina even as the system experienced a sudden slowing in its forward motion.[1] Late on July\u00a09, United States Air Force hurricane hunters flew into the system and detected a low-level circulation center near the edge of its thunderstorms, which indicated a reformation of the original low-level circulation center, with the development of strong convection just east of Cape Hatteras.[1][5] Based on the organization of the system, and observations of 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h) sustained winds, the NHC initiated advisories on Tropical Storm Fay at 21:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a09.[6] The storm was located over the warm waters of the Gulf Stream and in an area of light to moderate wind shear; these environmental factors favored intensification of the tropical cyclone.[5] The elongated circulation of the developing storm was steered generally northward by a ridge over the western Atlantic Ocean and by an approaching trough from the south.[7] On July 10, Fay strengthened throughout the day, reaching its peak intensity, with 1-minute sustained winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 998 millibars (29.5\u00a0inHg), despite some southwesterly wind shear. This wind shear caused the storm to entrain dry air, which gave it a non-classical tropical cyclone structure.[1][8] At that time, Fay had a small circulation center exposed just east of the Delmarva peninsula, which was rotating around a larger circulation.[9] Around 20:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a010, Fay made landfall just north-northeast of Atlantic City, New Jersey with maximum sustained winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h).[1] By that time, the system was already losing some of its tropical characteristics, with rapidly decreasing amounts of thunderstorms near the center and the deepest convection displaced well to the east and southeast of the center.[10] Fay continued weakening as it moved northward through New Jersey, and weakened into a tropical depression as it crossed into southeastern New York.[11] Early on July 11, the system transitioned into a post-tropical cyclone as the center became devoid of deep convection.[12] Afterward, Fay's remnants were drawn into the circulation of an approaching extratropical storm, before being fully absorbed into the approaching system over Quebec on July 12.[13]"

Due to concerns of the COVID-19 pandemic, the rally was supposed to be held outdoors. However, forecasters expected heavy rainfall and gusty winds from Fay or its remnants, which led the Trump campaign to postpone the rally, due to safety precautions.[19] Lifeguards restricted swimming in three Delaware beaches due to the threat for rip currents.[20] Jersey Shore locals were advised to avoid the coast, due to the threat of high waves, while community leaders began to take precautions to diminish flooding threats, such as lowering water levels in nearby lakes.[21] New York Governor Andrew Cuomo released a statement on July 9, urging New York State residents to stay alert and cautious, due to the impending severe weather conditions, highlighting a significant chance of flash flooding.[22] Residents of New York City were advised by New York City Emergency Management to take emergency precautions and to prepare for power outages and locally strong wind gusts.[23]"

In 1913 a further two-mile strip of land on the southern boundary was given, but returned in 1915 when it was identified the Cot\u00e9 people had lost too much of their best agricultural land. In 1963, further acres surrendered in 1905 were also reconstituted as reserve land. The interest in and surrender of land from the reserve's southern boundary\u2014nearest the Kamsack town site\u2014resulted partly from speculation of its value for settlement. The lands around what is now Kamsack were settled in the 1880s by a handful of agricultural settlers. The farming area around Kamsack was well settled by 1905. These farms consisted of a variety of ethnic groups which are still present to this day: Doukhobors, Ukrainians, Europeans, Americans and Eastern Canadians were all among the early settlers to the area. In 1903 the Canadian Northern Railway and Kamsack railway station were built which literally forced the birth of Kamsack. The town is served today by Via Rail's Winnipeg\u2013Churchill train.  The name Kamsack came from an early post office of the same name, which was in one of the early settlers' homes. \nThe name is derived from kamesak k\u00eekway (Cree for 'large, something large')[5]\u00a0\u2013  compare the name of the Manitoba electoral district The Pas-Kameesak. In the 1900s, the Doukhobor village called Nadezhda (\u2039See Tfd\u203aRussian: \u041d\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0430, 'Hope'), some 15\u00a0km to the northwest of Kamsack, was the site of the annual general meetings of the Doukhobor community of Saskatchewan. By around 1910, the meeting site has shifted to the village of Veregin, some 10\u00a0km west of Kamsack, where a permanent Doukhobor central office was established.[6] The first buildings were constructed in 1904 along the north side of the Canadian Northern Railway. These included a general store, drug store, pool room, hotel and post office. In the spring of 1905 the first school was opened in the Hallson building (named after a local businessman and town councillor). The village grew rapidly and by 1911 it had a population of over 500 people and was declared a town. The town continued to expand and by 1913 its property assessment totalled $1.2 million. In the summer of 1914 construction was started on the waterworks, sewage system and electric light plant. By 1921 the population was in excess of 2,000 people and the expansion of services continued to take place.[6] During the depression years Kamsack suffered, as did all communities during the period, and as a result the town's population dropped to 1,800 people.  This exodus of people was small compared to many other communities and Kamsack survived. During the summer of 1944 Kamsack once again faced adversity when it was hit by a tornado that is now referred to as the \"Kamsack Cyclone\".  The devastation involved 400 homes and 100 businesses and caused over $2 million damage. The rebuilding process began again with the help of the veterans returning from World War II. As it turned out, this period turned into the biggest building boom in the town's history.[6] This building period included business, public and residential sections of the town. Water and sewer systems were extended, streets were paved and cement sidewalks were built. The building boom continued right up to 1961 when the census showed 2,941 residents in the town. In the 1970s Kamsack saw its business district continue to grow with the arrival of the Royal Bank, the construction of the \"Kamplex\" (a dual purpose hockey and curling rink) and construction began on the new hospital.[6]"

        "content": "On July 14, 2000, at approximately 7 PM, an F3 tornado tore through the Green Acres Campground at Pine Lake in central Alberta, killing 12 people and critically injuring more than 100 others. Pine Lake is a recreational area approximately 25\u00a0km (16\u00a0mi) southeast of Red Deer, Alberta and 150\u00a0km (93\u00a0mi) northeast of the city of Calgary. The tornado formed out of a severe thunderstorm which formed on the eastern slopes of the Canadian Rockies and moved rapidly eastward, encountering a narrow band of low-level moisture that caused it to develop into a supercell thunderstorm. It touched down about 5\u00a0km (3.1\u00a0mi) west of the campground and was on the ground for approximately 20\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi). Damage occurred in a swath 800 to 1,500 metres (0.50 to 0.93\u00a0mi) wide. The heaviest damage occurred in a  500 metres (0.31\u00a0mi) central corridor. Damage assessment suggests that winds within the central corridor reached 300 kilometres per hour (190\u00a0mph). In addition, Weather Watchers reported hail as large as baseballs. An average of 16 tornadoes occur in Alberta every year, and an average of 41 tornadoes occur each year in the Prairie Provinces. The highest death toll due to a single tornado in Alberta occurred on July 31, 1987, colloquially referred to as Black Friday. Canada ranks second in the world for tornado occurrences after the United States."

These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most storms form in the Atlantic basin. The season had very little activity, with only seven tropical depressions, four of which reached tropical storm strength or higher. This led to the lowest accumulated cyclone energy count since 1977. The season began later than normal; the first tropical depression formed on July 23 and the second on July 27. Neither tropical depressions strengthened and they dissipated soon thereafter. Hurricane Alicia formed as Tropical Depression Three on August 15, quickly intensified into a hurricane on August 16 and made landfall in Texas on August 18. Alicia caused $3\u00a0billion in damage in Texas. Hurricane Barry formed on August 25, crossed Florida and strengthened into a hurricane. Barry made landfall near the Mexico\u2013United States border, and dissipated over land on August 30. Hurricane Chantal, the third and final hurricane in 1983, formed on September 10. It strengthened into a hurricane, but stayed out at sea, and was absorbed by a frontal system on September 15. Tropical Depression Six formed on September 18 and caused heavy rains in the Caribbean before degenerating into a wave on September 20. Tropical Storm Dean was the final storm of the season, forming on September 26. It originally tracked to the north, peaking at 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) winds, and made landfall in the Delmarva Peninsula on September 29. It dissipated over the coast of Virginia on the following day."

Gray and his associates at Colorado State University (CSU).[3] A normal season, as defined by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in the period from 1981 to 2010, has approximately 12\u00a0named storms, with 6\u00a0of those reaching hurricane status. About 3\u00a0hurricane strengthen into major hurricanes, which are tropical cyclones that reach at least Category\u00a03 intensity on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale.[1] The July\u00a023, 1983, forecasters at CSU predicted that after the slow start to the season, a total of eight tropical storms would develop, and five of the storms would reach hurricane status. The forecast did not specify how many of the hurricanes would reach major hurricane status. CSU based this prediction on an ongoing El Ni\u00f1o event, sea-level pressures, and wind currents.[3] However, the prediction issued by CSU proved to be too high, with only four named storms forming by the end of the season and three of those reaching hurricane status.[4] The CSU attributed the overforecast to the El Ni\u00f1o event being stronger and more persistent than they expected.[5]"

        "header": "Seasonal summary",
        "content": "The season, which began on June 1 and ended on November 30,[6] was very inactive because of strong upper-level wind shear. The wind shear was unusually strong throughout the Caribbean and open Atlantic, and disrupted convection in areas of disturbed weather so they could not develop. Over 60\u00a0African systems had formed and made it westward, but when they reached the Lesser Antilles, they were dissolved easily. The only area where the shear was minimal\u2014a region encompassing the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic north of the Bahamas and east of Florida\u2014was where the four named storms developed. Another contributing factor to the low number of storms may have been the decaying 1982\u201383 El Ni\u00f1o event. The season total of four named storms was the fewest in the satellite era, while the 1983 season was the least active since 1930, which had only three storms. This season and the previous became the first example of two consecutive years to have no storms form in the Caribbean since reliable record began. Additionally, the 1983 season was the first on record in which a system did not reach tropical storm intensity south of 25\u00b0N latitude.[4] The National Hurricane Center also issued numeric landfall probabilities for the first time in 1983. Probabilities had been calculated for prior storms for use in the issuing of hurricane watches and warnings, but this was the first time the raw numeric probabilities were released to the public.[4] The probabilities issued were accurate during Alicia, indicating that Galveston and surrounding portions of the upper Texas coast were the most likely area to be struck.[7] Tropical cyclogenesis began on July\u00a023, when Tropical Depression One formed over the deep Atlantic. After crossing the Windward Islands, the depression dissipated over the eastern Caribbean on July\u00a028. As the previous system moved across the Caribbean, another depression formed on July\u00a027 to the southwest of the Cape Verde Islands. The depression traversed the Atlantic in a west-northwestward direction and also failed to reach tropical storm intensity before dissipating near the northern Leeward Islands on August\u00a02. Later in August, hurricanes Alicia and Barry developed. The former also became the most intense tropical cyclone of the season, peaking as a Category\u00a03 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h).[8] Alicia caused 21\u00a0fatalities and approximately $3\u00a0billion in damage, mostly in Texas.[9][10] Three tropical cyclones formed in September \u2013 Hurricane Chantal, Tropical Depression Six, and Tropical Storm Dean. The dissipation of Dean on September\u00a030 marked the end of tropical cyclone activity.[8] The season's activity was reflected with a very low cumulative accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 17, one of the lowest on record,[11] which is classified as \"below normal\".[12] ACE is a metric used to express the energy used by a tropical cyclone during its lifetime. Therefore, storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h), which is the threshold for tropical storm intensity.[11]"

Pressures in the Gulf of Mexico were high and stayed high during the early development stages. On August 15, a ship recorded a minimal pressure of 1015\u00a0millibars (29.99\u00a0inHg), when the system was upgraded into Tropical Storm Alicia. With high environmental pressures around it, Alicia remained a small system.[9] Steering currents above Alicia remained weak during the storm's lifetime.[9] However, a ridge was well formed to the north of the developing storms. With fluctuations in the pressures, Alicia began to drift to west on August 16. This was short-lived, as Alicia turned to the northwest towards Texas. During the period of August 16 to August 18, an anticyclone had formed over Alicia and along with slow movement over warm waters, caused Alicia to intensify rapidly. The pressure in Alicia decreased one millibar an hour in the 40\u00a0hours before landfall. Alicia peaked at 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h) in winds and 962 millibars (28.4\u00a0inHg) in pressure on August 18. Alicia made landfall near Galveston on August 18 as a Category\u00a03\u00a0hurricane. Alicia weakened quickly over land and accelerated over the Midwest, before dissipating over Nebraska on August 21.[9] As Alicia moved northward, the remnants caused moderate to heavy rainfall in several states.[16] Houston suffered heavy damage, including thousands of shattered glass panes from downtown skyscrapers. Overall, Alicia killed 21\u00a0people and caused $3\u00a0billion (1983\u00a0USD) in damage.[16][17][10]"

Due to these conditions, the disturbance was unable to strengthen until August 22 as it was approaching the Bahamas. A weak trough moved the disturbance into an area of low wind shear, and the disturbance intensified into Tropical Depression Four on the evening of August 23. The depression was just to the northeast of the northern Bahamian Islands where it strengthened into Tropical Storm Barry on the morning of August 24.[18] Tropical Storm Barry subsequently turned to the west into an area of increased wind shear and weakened rapidly.[18] It was able to make landfall near Melbourne, Florida, on the morning of August 25 as a 45\u00a0mph tropical storm, before weakening to a tropical depression over Florida. After Tropical Depression Barry emerged from central Florida, it was still under pressure from high-level winds. The depression entered the central Gulf of Mexico, and after meandering west for a day or so, returned to tropical storm strength. Just off the coast of Mexico, Barry rapidly intensified into a hurricane on August 28, just before making landfall near Matamoros that afternoon. Before landfall, Barry peaked with 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) winds and a pressure of 986\u00a0millibars (29.11\u00a0inHg). The remnants quickly dissipated over the Sierra Madre Oriental on August 29.[18]"

This particular area of disturbed weather become part of the northeast portion of a low-pressure system. On September 10, a reconnaissance aircraft found sustained winds of 30\u00a0mph (50\u00a0km/h) and a 1010\u00a0millibar (29.83\u00a0inHg) pressure reading, indicating development into a tropical depression.[19] The depression moved to within 100 miles (160 kilometers) of Bermuda and slowly intensified.[19] Late that afternoon, Tropical Depression Five had intensified into a 40\u00a0mph (65\u00a0km/h) storm and was named Chantal. Chantal intensified rapidly, intensifying to hurricane status late on September 11. It then turned to the east and gained a weak upper-level cirrus-cloud outflow. The structure of the system changed little over the next 24\u00a0hours, before Chantal lost organization and was downgraded to a tropical storm on the night of the 12th.[19] Overnight, all convection in Chantal dissipated, and its forward speed decreased as it headed north.[19] A frontal system attracted and absorbed the remnants of Chantal by the night of September 14. Effects on Bermuda were minimal, with the island getting winds only up to 20\u00a0mph (30\u00a0km/h) and a few thundershowers.[19] However, Chantal generated swells of 30\u201340\u00a0ft (9.1\u201312.2\u00a0m) offshore.[20]"

A pressure of 999\u00a0mbar (29.5\u00a0inHg) indicated that Dean was strengthening as it headed northward. Additionally, satellite pictures showed that the subtropical cyclone was emerging from the cloud. Consequently, the system became a tropical storm late on September 27.[23] Dean's winds peaked at 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) on September 28 as it headed northward.[23] Dean's circulation turned to the northwest on September 29 then struck the Delmarva Peninsula and dissipated over land on September 30.[23] Gale warnings were from North Carolina to Rhode Island in association with Dean.[24] Rainfall produced by the storm spread from the North Carolina\u2013Virginia state line all the way to New England. Virginia reported rains of 1\u00a0in (25\u00a0mm) with 3\u00a0in (76\u00a0mm) at the border.[25] Rains peaked at 4.62\u00a0in (117\u00a0mm) at Cockaponset Ranger Station in Connecticut.[25] Damage was limited to minor beach erosion and flooding along the portion of Mid-Atlantic coast states.[23]"

The seventh and final tropical cyclone of the very inactive 1983 Atlantic hurricane season, Dean developed from a frontal low to the northeast of the Bahamas on September\u00a026. Initially subtropical, it gained characteristics of a tropical cyclone while tracking slowly north-northeastward. By September\u00a027, the system was reclassified as Tropical Storm Dean. While tracking northward on September\u00a028, Dean peaked with winds of 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h), shortly before curving west-northwestward and slowly leveling-off in intensity. Eventually, Dean made landfall in Virginia on the Delmarva Peninsula on September\u00a029 as a weakening tropical storm. Dean rapidly weakened over land and was no longer classifiable as a tropical cyclone by early on October\u00a01. Offshore Virginia, swells generated by the storm stranded a tugboat and injured two people. Waves along the coast also caused beach erosion, especially in Virginia and North Carolina. Inland, effects were minor and generally limited to mostly light rainfall. More than 100\u00a0campers on the Outer Banks of North Carolina were forced to evacuate due to flooding on North Carolina Highway 12.

During the next few days, the cloud band became stationary while stretching from The Bahamas to northeast of Bermuda. Around that time, a 1,035\u00a0mbar (30.6\u00a0inHg) high pressure stalled over the Northeastern United States, producing a strong pressure gradient and gale force winds over the East Coast of the United States. While located about 455\u00a0mi (732\u00a0km) east of Vero Beach, Florida, a low-level circulation developed within the frontal cloud band on September\u00a026. At around 1800\u00a0UTC that day, the NHC classified the system as a subtropical storm, due to a ship report of gale force winds 230\u00a0mi (370\u00a0km) from the center. Initially, it tracked north-northeastward under the influence of the frontal cloud band that spawned the storm.[1] The wind field quickly condensed, while the storm itself separated from the frontal cloud band.[2] As a result, it was re-classified as Tropical Storm Dean at 1800\u00a0UTC on September\u00a027 while approximately 575\u00a0mi (925\u00a0km) east of Jacksonville, Florida.[1] The National Hurricane Center, which initiated advisories on the storm at 2200\u00a0UTC on the same day, indicated that a weak ridge to the north and a cold low moving offshore of the Southeastern United States would cause Dean to move slowly and possibly curve northwestward.[3] Early on September\u00a028, a reconnaissance aircraft recorded Dean's minimum barometric pressure of 999\u00a0mbar (29.5\u00a0inHg).[4] Although forecast models initially indicated that the storm would continue northeastward,[2] they quickly switched to a westward movement on September\u00a029.[5] After curving northwestward later that day, Dean attained its maximum sustained wind speed of 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h), as reported by a ship.[4] While a reconnaissance aircraft flew into Dean north of center late on September\u00a029, it reported hurricane-force wind gusts.[6] However, the storm soon began to weaken. At around 1200\u00a0UTC on September\u00a030, Dean made landfall in Virginia on the Delmarva Peninsula with winds of 45\u00a0mph (75\u00a0km/h).[7] Operationally, the National Hurricane Center discontinued advisories four hours after Dean struck the state.[8] At 1800\u00a0UTC on September\u00a030, the storm weakened to a tropical depression. At 0000\u00a0UTC on October\u00a01, Dean became unidentifiable as a tropical cyclone while located over Virginia near the mouth of the Potomac River.[7] The remnants continued northwestward, before curving to the northeast while near the border of Virginia and West Virginia. It crossed the Mid-Atlantic and New England before re-emerging into the Atlantic Ocean near Boston, Massachusetts. By October\u00a02, the remnants of Dean had dissipated just offshore of the East Coast of the United States.[9]"

In Norfolk, Virginia, the naval station was placed under \"hurricane condition 3\", meaning that destructive winds were anticipated within 48\u00a0hours. In parts of North Carolina, residents were urged to prepare for the storm and remain out of the rough coastal waters.[10] As the storm moved inland over Virginia, its outer bands and high winds prompted more than 100\u00a0campers on Ocracoke Island and Cape Hatteras to evacuate after 1\u00a0ft (0.30\u00a0m) of water flooded North Carolina Highway 12.[11][12] Along the coast, wave between 6 and 10\u00a0ft (1.8 and 3.0\u00a0m) were measured. Minor beach erosion ensued, although some beaches lost as much as 20\u00a0ft (6.1\u00a0m) of sand.[11] Squall lines associated with Dean brought near-hurricane-force wind gusts and brief, heavy rainfall.[12] Winds caused little effect other than isolated power outages, especially on the Outer Banks.[11] Aside from the minor damage caused by Dean, there was also a positive side to the storm. Throughout coastal waters off North Carolina, king mackerel appeared in near-record numbers, improving the local fishing industry. Some catchers stated that they were finding some fish weighing up to 30\u00a0lb (14\u00a0kg).[13] About 300\u00a0mi (480\u00a0km) off the coast of Virginia,[10] large swells from Dean stranded a tugboat on September\u00a029 with six people on board. Two of the crew were injured during the incident; however, they were not seriously hurt. The ship was towed to Cape May, New Jersey later that day by the United States Coast Guard.[14] Waves up to 8\u00a0ft (2.4\u00a0m) caused beach erosion across the Virginia coastline.[15] In addition to minor erosion, waves caused \"slight flooding\" at Buckroe Beach, totaling to $500\u00a0to $5,000\u00a0in damage (1983\u00a0USD).[11] Although winds were estimated to have been around 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h) as the storm moved inland, structural damage was minimal.[16] Many areas near Dean's path experienced light rainfall of 1 to 3\u00a0in (25 to 76\u00a0mm) of rain, especially in Virginia where the statewide peak was 1.29\u00a0in (33\u00a0mm) in Richmond.[9][17] In Maryland, thousands of tons of sand was removed by rough seas near Ocean City; beach erosion also occurred at nearby Assateague Island. Additionally, wind gusts between 50 and 55\u00a0mph (80 and 89\u00a0km/h) resulted in minor damage, while minimal flooding was reported following rainfall. Damage in Maryland was light, totaling to between $500\u00a0and $5,000 (1983\u00a0USD). Minor effects were reported in Delaware, limited to winds gusts up to 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h), which caused the loss of tons of sand along beaches. In coastal New Jersey, locally heavy rainfall resulted in traffic jams, downed power lines, and numerous commuting problems. In some areas of New York, especially in the southeastern portions of the state, rainfall exceeding 2\u00a0in (51\u00a0mm) in 24\u00a0hours flooded roadways and delayed trains.[11] The remnants of Dean dropped light precipitation in New England. Rainfall from the storm peaked at 4.62\u00a0in (117\u00a0mm) at the Cockaponset Ranger Station in Connecticut.[9]"

        "content": " Hurricane Beta was a compact and intense tropical cyclone that impacted the southwestern Caribbean in late October\u00a02005. Beta was the twenty-fourth tropical storm, fourteenth hurricane, and seventh and final major hurricane of the record-breaking 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. On October\u00a021, a developing tropical wave entered the eastern Caribbean Sea and spawned Tropical Storm Alpha the following day. As the wave entered the southwestern Caribbean, convection redeveloped and on October\u00a026, the system spawned another low-pressure area which developed into Tropical Depression Twenty-six. The depression intensified into a tropical storm the next morning and was named Beta. By the morning of October\u00a028, the storm intensified into a hurricane, the fourteenth of the season. Beta underwent rapid intensification for several hours to attain its peak intensity with winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h) on October\u00a030. The storm began to deteriorate before landfall, weakening to Category\u00a02 status as it crossed the Nicaraguan coastline. Rapid weakening followed landfall, and the storm dissipated early the next morning. Due to the storm's proximity to Central America, several countries were placed on alert and began allocating supplies for a potential disaster. Several hurricane watches and warnings were raised for the small Colombian island of Providencia as well as the Nicaragua and Honduras coastlines. An estimated 150,000 people were evacuated from dangerous regions in Nicaragua and more than 125,000 more were evacuated in Honduras. As a tropical storm, Beta produced heavy rains over northern Panama, amounting up to 3 inches (76\u00a0mm), which caused several mudslides as well as three fatalities. On October\u00a029, the storm passed over Providencia Island, caused significant damage to structures, and injured 30 people. In Honduras and Nicaragua, over 1,000 structures were damaged by the storm, hundreds of which were destroyed. Ten people were initially feared dead after their boat went adrift during the storm. However, a Panamanian vessel rescued the men after drifting in the water for several hours. Rains in Honduras totaled to 21.82 and 6.39\u00a0in (554 and 162\u00a0mm) in Nicaragua. Six people were killed in Nicaragua as a result of the storm and the cost to repair damages exceeded 300\u00a0million c\u00f3rdoba (US$14.5\u00a0million). Overall, Beta was responsible for nine fatalities and more than $15.5\u00a0million in damage across four countries."

        "content": "On October\u00a021, a westward-moving tropical wave entered the Caribbean.[1] The wave quickly developed organized convection, indicating that a possible low-pressure area had developed along the wave.[2] Continued development led to the formation of Tropical Depression Twenty-Five (which would later be named Alpha).[3] The wave continued to move towards the west, producing minimal shower and thunderstorm activity.[4] Once in the southwestern Caribbean, the wave slowed, and convection gradually redeveloped on October\u00a025.[5] The next day, with continued organization, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) stated that a tropical depression could develop in the following day or two.[6] At around 18:00\u00a0UTC, the NHC determined that Tropical Depression Twenty-Six had developed about 105 miles (169\u00a0km) north of the central cost of Panama.[4] Located within an area of weak vertical wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures, the depression intensified. By 06:00\u00a0UTC the next morning, the depression was upgraded to a tropical storm and given the name Beta by the NHC.[4] Beta was slowly moving towards the north-northwest in response to a mid-tropospheric shortwave trough over the Gulf of Mexico and mid-tropospheric ridge to the northeast of the storm. Deep convection developed near the center of circulation, signifying a developing system. With favorable conditions for development, Beta was forecast to intensify into a hurricane before making landfall in central Nicaragua.[7] An eyewall rapidly developed around the center of circulation, fuelling further intensification. With the formation of an eyewall and the compact size of the storm, rapid intensification was anticipated.[8] By the end of October\u00a027, maximum sustained winds around the center of Beta were estimated at 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h). An increase in wind shear caused a minor disruption of the storm's structure, briefly preventing strengthening.[4] After maintaining its intensity for 30\u00a0hours, the shear weakened, and Beta began to intensify again.[4] Around 00:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a029, the storm passed near Providencia Island with winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h), just below hurricane-status. At this time, the cyclone began to turn towards the west.[4][9] Beta intensified into a hurricane several hours later, with winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h), as an eye became pronounced on infrared satellite images. Located south of a weakness within the subtropical ridge, the hurricane's motion slowed to a westward drift.[10] With the formation of an eye, the chances of rapid intensification reached 62%, and the storm could possibly become a major hurricane\u2014a hurricane with winds of 111\u00a0mph (179\u00a0km/h) or higher\u2014before landfall.[11] Beta continued to intensify as convection deepened around the 11.5\u00a0mi (18.5\u00a0km) wide eye,[12] strengthening into a Category 2 hurricane with winds of 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h).[4] After undergoing a brief period of rapid intensification from 18:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a029 \u2013 06:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a030, the hurricane reached its peak intensity as a Category 3 hurricane with winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 962\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.42\u00a0inHg). The storm also began to turn towards the south-southwest as it reached its peak intensity and its maximum size, with tropical storm-force winds extending out 60\u00a0mi (97\u00a0km) from the center.[4] However, as it neared the coast, cloud tops around the eye began to warm, signifying weakening.[13] Around 12:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a030, Beta made landfall in central Nicaragua near La Barra del Rio Grande with winds of 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h).[4] After making landfall, the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm, with winds decreasing to 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h), as the structure of the storm began to deteriorate.[14][15] Early on October\u00a031, Beta weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated a few hours later over the mountains of central Nicaragua.[4]"

Records show that in 1877 there were eight cyclones, of which five were tropical storms and three were hurricanes, one of which became a major hurricane (Category 3+). However, in the absence of modern satellite and other remote-sensing technologies, only storms that affected populated land areas or encountered ships at sea were recorded, so the actual total could be higher. An undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 and zero to four per year between 1886 and 1910 has been estimated.[1]"

The first storm was a tropical storm which formed near the Turks & Caicos Islands on August\u00a01. It traveled parallel to the US east coast to make landfall in New Brunswick on August\u00a05. The second storm of the season formed as a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico on September\u00a014. It developed into a Category 1 hurricane which first struck Louisiana on September\u00a018, then Florida the next day before dissipating in the Atlantic on\nSeptember\u00a021. Hurricane Three was a Category 1 hurricane that existed between September\u00a016 and 22 without making landfall. Hurricane Four was the strongest and most destructive storm of the season and impacted both Venezuela and Florida. Most notably, Hurricane Four caused 84 fatalities in the United States. Tropical Storm Five existed between September\u00a024 and September\u00a029 in which period it traveled from north of Hispaniola to a point off the south-east coast of the United States. Tropical Storm Six existed for a few days in mid-October without making landfall. Tropical Storm Seven formed in the western Gulf of Mexico, tracked parallel to the US Gulf coast and crossed the Florida peninsula between October\u00a024 and October\u00a028. The last storm of the season was known to have existed for two days in November. It dissipated off the Newfoundland coast on November\u00a029."

The storm then remained close to the coast of South America while strengthening, becoming a Category\u00a02 hurricane on the present-day Saffir\u2013Simpson scale on September\u00a023. Early on the next day, the system curved west-northwestward before striking Venezuela's Paraguan\u00e1 Peninsula and Colombia's Guajira Peninsula. The cyclone turned northwestward by September\u00a026, passing near the northeast tip of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula of Mexico.[7] Upon reaching the central Gulf of Mexico, the storm began trekking to the north-northeast on October\u00a01 and then to the northeast by the next day. Early on October\u00a03, the system intensified into a Category\u00a03 hurricane, shortly before making landfall near present-day Mexico Beach, Florida,[7] with winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 955\u00a0mbar (28.2\u00a0inHg).[5] The storm rapidly weakened after moving inland, falling to tropical storm intensity over south-central Georgia several hours later. While passing over North Carolina on October\u00a04, the system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, which continued northeastward until dissipating offshore Nova Scotia on the next day.[7] Strong winds generated by the storm on Grenada downed some trees and telegraph lines and damaged some roofs. Saint Vincent also reported strong winds and heavy rains, but little damage occurred. The cyclone left catastrophic impacts on Cura\u00e7ao. The New York Times noted that in Willemstad, \"many of the most solid structures were crushed as if they were things of paper and many persons were buried in their ruins.\"[6] Waves completely swept away a nunnery, with only one nun surviving. Numerous ships were lost in the vicinity of Cura\u00e7ao. It is estimated that the storm caused at least 70\u00a0deaths and about $2\u00a0million on the island.[8] In Cuba, winds and rains generated by the storm left damage and the loss of some lives in the western portion of Pinar del R\u00edo Province.[6] It caused a storm tide of 12 feet (3.7\u00a0m) at St. Marks, Florida.[5] The storm caused heavy rain and flooding throughout North Carolina.

This same system had been causing an outbreak of tornadoes over Wisconsin the day before. As shown in the map to the left, there was up to 50\u00a0mm (2.0\u00a0in) of precipitable water in the warm air mass invading Southern Ontario with a strong southwesterly low level jet parallel to the cold front and the presence of an upper jet-stream. All of these were very favorable for the development of severe thunderstorms. Furthermore, the wind shear in the lower troposphere was creating a large helicity value conducive to a tornado potential.[3] With the advancing cold front, two lines of thunderstorms developed. The first one was near Stratford, Ontario (20\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi) west of Kitchener), and spread as far north as Georgian Bay near Collingwood, Ontario while the second one was following behind near the shores of Lake Huron.[3] They tracked eastward and reached as far as Oshawa during the afternoon.[1] Dozens of storm cells populated the line, two of them developing into tornadic supercells. At their worst, the tornadoes reached the F2 level, with gusts between 180 and 250\u00a0km/h (110 and 160\u00a0mph).[1] Severe thunderstorm warnings were sent, mentioning the possibility of tornadoes in view of the radar output and the potential analysis.[3] The main storm, later dubbed the Toronto Supercell, spawned a first tornado tracking through Milverton (43\u00b034\u203200\u2033N 80\u00b056\u203200\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff43.56667\u00b0N 80.93333\u00b0W\ufeff / 43.56667; -80.93333\ufeff (Milverton)) to Conestogo Lake (43\u00b041\u203210\u2033N 80\u00b043\u203250\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff43.68611\u00b0N 80.73056\u00b0W\ufeff / 43.68611; -80.73056\ufeff (Conestoga Lake)) (west of Elmira) from 12:40 to 1:20 pm local time.

It produced winds of well over 100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph), golf ball sized hail, but mostly heavy rain flooding many parts of the city between 2 and 4 pm.[1] Finally, another severe storm passing Southeast of Stratford, in the Tavistock area (43\u00b012\u203245\u2033N 80\u00b050\u203251\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff43.21250\u00b0N 80.84750\u00b0W\ufeff / 43.21250; -80.84750), gave an F1 tornado with winds between 120 and 150 kilometres per hour (75 and 93\u00a0mph) by 3:20 pm.[4]"

Convective storm detection showed on weather radars a hook echo, a BWER and a strong mesocyclone but the vortex left the ground after the second tornado.[3] Studies were made to try to explain the change in behavior to an extremely high producer of rain. One area of Thornhill, just north of the Toronto City limits recorded 175 millimetres (7\u00a0in) of rain in less than one hour.[1][3] Toronto is situated by Lake Ontario and a lake breeze often develops during the day. This wind brings cooler air at the surface and causes a marine temperature inversion which could have been enough to keep the rotation aloft.[3] To the west of the city, there is the Niagara Escarpment, reaching 1,500 feet (460\u00a0m) above sea level (ASL), while the shores of Lake Ontario are just 250 feet (76\u00a0m) ASL. This drop could equally have cut off the rotation from the surface.[3] The lightning shows that there was a strong peak during the F2 tornadoes, dominated by the positive cloud-to-ground strikes. Studies have shown that this is often the case in tornadic storms. It was followed by a sharp drop and then another peak, but this one dominated by negative lightning during the flooding phase of the storm.[3]"

A volunteer storm spotter reported a tornado in the north part of the city but it was not confirmed by Environment Canada.[5] The rain washed out a portion of Finch Avenue near Sentinel Ave in North York. It overflowed storm drains which caused severe basement flooding to many thousands of homes and two floors of the MSC building. Around Toronto, torrential rains snarled traffic and stranded drivers. Fire services responded to more than 1,000 calls. Marine services personnel rescued four people who fell into the fast-moving currents of the Don River.[1]"

Though some upper-level wind field parameters were sufficient for tornadic activity, they were marginal at best when coupled with the synoptic pattern at hand (a highly atypical pattern compared to previous major tornado events in the lower Great Lakes region).[4] Goderich is also located in the \"lake shadow\" of Lake Huron, which is much less likely to be hit by tornadoes than other parts of Southwestern Ontario where lake convergence fronts collide.[5] By 11:00\u00a0am that morning, showers and thunderstorms began to develop over southwestern Ontario. Initially they were weak, but began to intensify in some localized areas. Hail and heavy rain came down with a line of storms tracking from northwest of Kitchener toward the Brampton area early that afternoon. There were reports of localized flooding and marginally damaging wind gusts associated with these storms. A brief tornado was also reported in Gananoque at 12:45\u00a0pm. Later confirmed as an F1, this tornado caused minor damage in an area 1.5 kilometres long and 60 metres wide.[6] Environment Canada issued a severe thunderstorm watch for most of southern Ontario as a result. The town of Goderich and surrounding areas of Huron County were included.[7] At around the same time, an intense thunderstorm had developed over northern Michigan in Alcona County. Hail of up to two inches in diameter was reported to the National Weather Service and a velocity couplet appeared on Doppler weather radar at around 1:30\u00a0pm.[8] A tornado warning was subsequently issued, but the storm moved out over the relatively warm waters of Lake Huron shortly after. It weakened for a time, but began to intensify once again as it crossed the border into Canada by 3:00\u00a0pm. Strong rotation began to develop on the southwest side of this thunderstorm as resolved by velocity images on the Exeter, Ontario radar, and a textbook-style hook echo soon appeared on reflectivity images too (see image to left). With the powerful storm closing in on Goderich from the northwest at approximately 75\u00a0km/h, Environment Canada issued a tornado warning at 3:48\u00a0pm. The meteorologists estimated the storm would make landfall there in approximately ten minutes. Later on that day after this tornado, an EF2 tornado was confirmed in western New York, near Conquest.[9] An EF1 tornado also occurred in Grafton County, New Hampshire."

As a result, the tornado took most area residents by surprise despite the twelve-minute lead time of the tornado warning. The relatively low casualty rate was attributed to the fact that an earlier thunderstorm had cleared downtown Goderich of hundreds of market-goers attending a weekend festival, most of whom were still outdoors as little as two hours before the tornado struck."

        "content": "In the minutes prior, the tornadic supercell was closing in on the Lake Huron shoreline. Photos and video of these initial moments reveal no funnel, merely a thick, rotating wall of rain curtains.[10] Not unlike the Barrie tornado in 1985, this storm was also heavily rain-wrapped. At this point, the only sign of the approaching tornado was a loud roar; some witnesses falsely interpreted it to be the engine from a nearby freighter (Cooper and Cove, 2011). Moving on to land by 3:55\u00a0pm,[11][12] the tornado made its first destructive appearance at the Sifto Salt mine located on Indian Island at the mouth of the Maitland River. It tore large portions of roof from the salt storage domes and brick outbuildings at the facility. Pieces of sheet metal were also ripped from some of the higher-profile structures, such as the salt evaporator. A 61-year-old crane operator was killed when his boom collapsed.[13] After crossing the river, the tornado tore more sheet metal from the upper portion of a nearby grain elevator before plowing up the bluff overlooking Lake Huron, in a swath several hundred metres wide. The tornado then moved into the neighbourhood immediately northwest of Goderich's downtown core. Hardest hit was the Waterloo Street and St. Georges Crescent area, which was closest to the immediate edge of the bluff. Power poles and trees were snapped or uprooted in addition to many homes either losing their roofs or sustaining further structural damage after initial roof loss. Most buildings in the historic octagonal downtown, housing century-old brick buildings, suffered blown out windows or much worse. This included the sturdy and relatively unscathed Huron County courthouse, which also suffered major interior damage (Cooper and Cove, 2011). Others were not so lucky as roofs were completely torn off, leaving little structural integrity to face the wind. The upper floors of several of these buildings were completely destroyed. The remaining loose brick and mortar fascia collapsed, crushing vehicles and other similarly sized objects. Vehicles parked in more open areas were subsequently overturned or impaled by flying debris, trees were removed of most of their limbs with sheet metal and other foreign objects wrapped around them. Immediately surrounding the downtown, a church built in 1878 (see photograph to left) at the intersection of Kings Highway 21 and St. David Street was severely damaged. A carwash facility adjacent to the church suffered a similar fate. Three people were injured at the carwash when the roof was torn off and the bays underneath became exposed to the wind. A van with two people inside had its windows smashed out when debris wrapped itself around it. Another man on a Harley-Davidson motorcycle had both his legs broken when he became pinned between his bike and a collapsed wall from one of the bays. The three had been seeking shelter from the storm at that time, mainly from the golfball to baseball size hail that preceded the tornado. Crossing Kings Highway 21, the tornado moved into the easternmost residential areas of Goderich, north of Elgin Street. More homes sustained significant damage here, with most of those affected receiving some form of roof or window damage. Those with clapboard siding had pock marks and some of their paint stripped. Other homes lost vast portions of their roofs and commercial buildings near Oxford Street and Maitland Road had partial roof removal and exterior wall damage. Some of these walls partially collapsed, crushing more vehicles. Timber power poles were snapped, and concrete light posts were partially toppled near this location. Moving to the east-southeast, the tornado left Goderich, on its way toward the hamlet of Benmiller approximately 8 kilometres away. Now emerging from the rain curtains as a menacing, stovepipe-shaped funnel, and roughly following the Maitland River, the tornado's path widened.[14] In this mostly rural area, there was extensive tree damage in a swath about 1 kilometre wide. Passing through Benmiller it caused extensive damage to several more structures, including the Benmiller Inn. Large swaths of trees were downed on both sides of the Maitland River, as well as in town. Witnesses also reported that the tornado briefly reversed the river's flow as it approached (Cooper and Cove, 2011). Structural debris from Benmiller was deposited into the river, and the damage became more erratic as the tornado crossed uneven terrain; structures on higher ground were more severely damaged. Leaving Benmiller, the tornado entered into a more rural area once again, as it began to enter its final stages. Many tree limbs were removed by the tornado in addition to it toppling the trees themselves. The damage path also became more evident as it passed through open cornfields, downing large swaths of corn in an area about 200 metres wide. Crossing Sharpes Creek Line (Huron Road 31) there was more tree and corn damage by the tornado, though it was becoming increasingly weaker and sporadic in nature. The tornado eventually dissipated in the open fields between Base Line (Huron Road 8) and London Road (Kings Highway 4), southwest of the village of Londesborough, after some 15 to 20 kilometres on the ground."

        "content": "Following the tornado, one person was dead and 37 more were injured along the tornado's track from Lake Huron to near Londesborough. In the hours after the disaster, the Ontario Provincial Police closed all roads leading into Goderich in order to allow streets to be cleared of debris, and to deal with the numerous gas leaks across the town of 8,000. Town officials quickly declared a state of emergency as urban search and rescue teams combed the town for missing individuals. No one was left unaccounted for in spite of the severe damage.[15] The day after the storm, Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty visited Huron County and pledged $5 million in disaster assistance from the province of Ontario, half of which was allotted to the town of Goderich. Local hardware stores also donated many of their products to assist in the recovery effort. News reports later estimated that in Goderich, one hundred houses, 25 buildings and thousands of 150-plus-year-old trees were seriously damaged or destroyed.[16] In the days following the storm, as power was restored, roads became passable, and damaged structures shored up, local public works crews established fencing and concrete barriers around the entire perimeter of historic downtown Goderich to prevent looting and trespassing. These measures were also enforced by the Ontario Provincial Police, who barred anyone other than those contracted for cleanup efforts to stay out of the area. By the end of August, the question of restoration of many of the oldest structures in Goderich was one of major debate.[17] The town square was finally reopened on Friday, September 9.[18] However, several of the historic structures (including the opera house on Kingston Street, the church on Victoria Street, and a studio on Montreal Street) were all razed in October.[19] The recovery process is ongoing, and will take many months or potentially years to fully complete, amid significant controversy regarding insurance settlements for private property owners. The Insurance Bureau of Canada estimates the tornado caused $75 million in damage, but the Mayor of Goderich estimates the total bill will top $100 million.[1] A city relief fund has also been set up, entitled the Goderich Disaster Relief Fund, in which anyone can make a donation at chartered banks and the Goderich Community Credit Union.[20] Early in 2012, this latter effort is expected to match the assistance issued by the province, owing to contributions from those all over Canada and the United States. In addition, a book immortalizing the disaster, entitled Not Like Any Other Sunday, has been published and is available as of December, 2011.[21] All proceeds go to relief efforts such as the Victim Services of Huron County and the Goderich Trees reforestation project.[22] In the months following the tornado disaster, Huron County officials began discussing the use of tornado sirens. The community of Clinton in the Central Huron Municipality implemented its volunteer fire department's siren to be used for severe weather, which is now one of the few Ontario communities to do so.[23][24] Huron County asked for a government grant to purchase 30 tornado sirens for communities across the county, but the grant request was denied.[25] Officials are now working on a plan to use the remaining fire department and Cold War air raid sirens for severe weather."

A visitor to the area nearly four years after the event found that the park had re-opened with a new band shell. New trees, greenery, a statue and a water feature had been installed in front of the court house. Much of the area around the park had been reconstructed including commercial building on Kingston Street and The Square. The last work to be completed was the Kingston block of commercial buildings on Kingston Street and The Square. Although the farmers' market and flea market had closed before the tornado, it re-opened again.[27] A postgraduate researcher from Wilfrid Laurier University visited the downtown area in May 2016 and described it as absolutely gorgeous. \"The only visible signs of the tornado's aftermath were some fallen trees and debris in a cemetery.\"[28]"

The storm formed from the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) on August 12 well to the east of the Windward Islands, but advisories were not issued until the next day when Alma was at peak intensity. Alma entered the southeastern Caribbean Sea at an unusually brisk westward pace of between 20\u00a0mph (32\u00a0km/h) to 25\u00a0mph (40\u00a0km/h), prompting numerous watches and gale warnings throughout the nations in this region. After crossing Trinidad, Alma became one of only four tropical storms to traverse the Paria Peninsula of northeastern Venezuela. The storm dissipated on August 15 over the high terrain of Venezuela. Alma left heavy damage in Trinidad, amounting to about US$5 million (value in 1974), making it the most destructive cyclone of the 20th century on the island at that time. Alma damaged about 5,000 buildings, leaving 500 people homeless. The storm also wrecked 17,750 acres (7,180\u00a0ha) of crop fields. There were two deaths in Trinidad, including one person who was struck by flying debris. Alma's heavy rainfall was responsible for a plane crash on Isla Margarita off the Venezuelan coast, killing the 49 people on board."

        "content": "A disturbance associated with the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) left the coast of West Africa on August 9,[1] producing mid-level winds of 75\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h) in Dakar, Senegal.[2] A weak circulation formed near the sea surface on August 10 within an area of thunderstorms.[3] The disturbance moved slowly westward over the Atlantic Ocean, developing into a tropical depression at 18:00 UTC on August 12, around the 10th parallel north,[2] an unusually southern latitude the cyclone would remain around throughout its lifetime.[4] On August 13, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Alma about 375\u00a0mi (605\u00a0km) east of Trinidad and Tobago, as indicated by a Hurricane Hunters flight reporting winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h).[2] This same flight observed a circular eye with a diameter of 36\u00a0mi (58\u00a0km), the only report of an eye-like structure from this storm.[5] The center of Alma was elongated, causing gale-force winds to extend 75\u00a0mi (120\u00a0km) to the north while extending only 25 miles (40\u00a0km) to the south.[6] On August 14 the Hurricane Hunters measured gusts of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h); however, the storm's overall wind pattern weakened after its initial peak.[2] Alma continued westward at 23\u00a0mph (37\u00a0km/h), which National Hurricane Center (NHC) Director Neil Frank noted was unusually rapid for a tropical cyclone at this time and location.[6] Alma was able to maintain its low latitude westward movement due to a strong subtropical ridge to its north, which was at an unseasonably low latitude for the month of August.[1] On August 14, Alma made landfall on Trinidad with winds of 55\u00a0mph (90\u00a0km/h),[7] the southernmost landfall on that island since a storm in 1933.[1] Even though the storm traversed Trinidad in only three hours,[8] its time over land was sufficient to disrupt the circulation.[9] The storm crossed the Gulf of Paria and made its second and final landfall on the Paria Peninsula of Venezuela,[8] one of only four storms on record to do so; the others were in 1605, 1725, and 1933.[10] The high mountains in Venezuela took a toll on the storm, ripping the circulation and causing Alma to be downgraded to a tropical depression on August 15.[2] At 02:00\u00a0UTC that day, Alma's circulation passed near Caracas. The convection rapidly diminished, and the storm's presence on satellite imagery faded, though the NHC noted the potential for redevelopment once it reached open waters.[11] The storm did not survive its trek over land; late on August 15, the NHC issued the final advisory after the circulation dissipated near the border of Venezuela and Colombia.[12] The remnants of Alma continued westward across South and Central America, reaching the Pacific Ocean where they would eventually restrengthen into Hurricane Joyce.[13]"

As Alma progressed westward, gale warnings were also issued for the Paria and Paraguan\u00e1 peninsulas of Venezuela, the Guajira Peninsula, and the ABC islands.[2] Initially, the Trinidad and Tobago weather service anticipated Alma would strike Tobago, but as the storm approached, the trajectory over Trinidad became apparent.[14] While moving across Trinidad, Alma produced sustained winds of only 35\u00a0mph (56\u00a0km/h) at Piarco,[2] yet gusts reached 91\u00a0mph (147\u00a0km/h) at Savonetta.[15] Rainfall at Piarco did not exceed 1 inch (25\u00a0mm) during the storm's passage.[16] The strong gusts downed trees and power lines,[9] and damaged about 5,000\u00a0buildings, including schools, hospitals,[14] and hundreds of households, wrecking everything inside.[17] This left about 500\u00a0people homeless.[14] Alma also caused widespread damage to agriculture,[17] mostly to sugar, resulting in 17,750 acres (7,180\u00a0ha) of ruined fields. Several highways in the country suffered damage.[14] The winds flung debris from a roof, which struck and killed a woman.[9] There was also an indirect death on the island,[15] along with several injuries.[18] Damage estimates on the island totaled $5\u00a0million (1974\u00a0USD);[19] the American embassy in the country considered Alma to be the most destructive storm in Trinidad during the 20th century.[17] After the storm, local Red Cross volunteers provided meals and clothing to thousands of storm victims. The government allocated $5.1\u00a0million (Trinidad and Tobago dollars) for relief work,[17] to be coordinated by the National Emergency Relief Organization of Trinidad and Tobago, which was established following the damaging Hurricane Flora in 1963. This helped rebuild damage houses, clear roads, and assist affected farmers. The United States Agency for International Development sent about US$5,000 in assistance, after the country's ambassador sent a formal request to Washington, D.C. The Amoco oil company also sent a $500 donation to the country's Red Cross.[14] While moving through the Windward Islands, Alma produced strong wind gusts on Grenada.[20] The outer rainbands of Alma spread over Venezuela while the center was still over Trinidad.[2] At about 13:00\u00a0UTC on August 14, the rains caused a Linea Aeropostal Venezolana Vickers Viscount 749 turboprop airliner circling the airport on Isla Margarita to crash.[21] The aircraft struck the side of La Gloria, 26\u00a0ft (8\u00a0m) below the summit. All but one of the 49 people aboard died on impact; the co-pilot survived for 17 more days before dying from irreversible brain damage.[22] Elsewhere in Venezuela, Alma's heavy rainfall triggered several landslides.[10]"

In 1881, the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway laid tracks a mile south of the community, across the Bosque River. Merchants, hoping to benefit from the railroad, began moving their stores across the river, to the tracks. On February 17, 1882, a cyclone (tornado) hit the new townsite, destroying a large number of buildings. Nevertheless, the remaining residents from the community's original site moved across the river and rebuilt their homes. Thus, by the end of 1882 Valley Mills had extended into McLennan County. Dairy farming and stock raising were the principal industries of the community. By 1900, however, the railroad and the nearby Chisholm Trail had made Valley Mills a prosperous retail and trading center for Bosque and McLennan counties. The community's population reached 855 by 1905. Like many rural Texas communities, Valley Mills declined during the 1930s. Following World War II, however, as farm prices increased and ranching prospered, the economy grew, and the population, which had declined to 803 by 1937, increased to 1,037 by the mid-1950s. During the next three decades Valley Mills maintained its position as a leading retail market and shipping point for Bosque and McLennan counties. The town was hit by an F-5 tornado on May 6, 1973, nearly 20 years after the infamous 1953 Waco Tornado, and despite its F-5 rating, there were no deaths in the Valley Mills tornado. In 1984, it had a newspaper, a municipal airport, more than 25 businesses, several dairy farms and ranches, and a population of 1,236. A new school was opened in 1988; it and four churches were the social centers of the community. In 1990, the population was 1,085. In 2010, the population was 1,203."

        "content": " Amarillo (/\u02cc\u00e6m\u0259\u02c8r\u026alo\u028a/[6] AM-\u0259-RIL-oh; Spanish for \"yellow\") is a city in the U.S. state of Texas and the seat of Potter County. It is the 14th-most populous city in Texas and the most populous city in the Texas panhandle.[7] A portion of the city extends into Randall County. The estimated population of Amarillo was 200,393 as of April 1, 2020, comprising nearly half of the population of the panhandle.[8] The Amarillo metropolitan area had an estimated population of 308,297 as of 2020.[9] The city of Amarillo, originally named Oneida, is situated in the Llano Estacado region.[10] The availability of the railroad and freight service provided by the Fort Worth and Denver City Railroad contributed to the city's growth as a cattle-marketing center in the late 19th century.[11] Amarillo was once the self-proclaimed \"Helium Capital of the World\" for having one of the country's most productive helium fields.[12] The city is also known as \"The Yellow Rose of Texas\" (as the city takes its name from the Spanish word for yellow),[13] \"Yellow City\" for its name, and \"Rotor City, USA\" for its V-22 Osprey hybrid aircraft assembly plant. Amarillo operates one of the largest meat-packing areas in the United States. Pantex, the only nuclear weapons assembly and disassembly facility in the country, is also a major employer. The location of this facility also gave rise to the nickname \"Bomb City\".[14]"

        "content": "During April 1887, J. I. Berry established a site for a town after he chose a well-watered section along the right-of-way of the Fort Worth and Denver City Railroad, which had begun building across the Texas Panhandle. Berry and Colorado City, Texas, merchants wanted to make their new town site the region's main trading center. On August 30, 1887, Berry's town site won the county seat election and was established in Potter County. Availability of the railroad and freight service after the county seat election made the town a fast-growing cattle-marketing center.[11] The settlement originally was called Oneida; it later changed its name to Amarillo, which probably derived from yellow wildflowers that were plentiful during the spring and summer or the nearby Amarillo Lake and Amarillo Creek, named in turn for the yellow soil along their banks and shores (Amarillo is the Spanish word for the color yellow). Early residents originally pronounced the city's name more similar to the Spanish pronunciation /\u02cc\u0251\u02d0m\u0259\u02c8ri\u02d0jo\u028a/ ah-m\u0259-REE-yoh, which was later displaced by the current pronunciation.[15] On June 19, 1888, Henry B. Sanborn, who is given credit as the \"Father of Amarillo\",[16] and his business partner Joseph F. Glidden began buying land to the east to move Amarillo after arguing that Berry's site was on low ground and would flood during rainstorms. Sanborn also offered to trade lots in the new location to businesses in the original city's site and help with the expense of moving to new buildings. His incentives gradually won over people, who moved their businesses to Polk Street in the new commercial district.[17] Heavy rains almost flooded Berry's part of the town in 1889, prompting more people to move to Sanborn's location. This eventually led to another county seat election making Sanborn's town the new county seat in 1893.[11] By the late 1890s, Amarillo had emerged as one of the world's busiest cattle-shipping points, and its population grew significantly. The city became a grain elevator, milling, and feed-manufacturing center after an increase in production of wheat and small grains during the early 1900s. Discovery of natural gas in 1918 and oil three years later brought oil and gas companies to the Amarillo area.[11] The United States government bought the Cliffside Gas Field with high helium content in 1927 and the Federal Bureau of Mines began operating the Amarillo Helium plant two years later.[18] The plant was the sole producer of commercial helium in the world for a number of years.[19] The U.S. National Helium Reserve is stored in the Bush Dome Reservoir at the Cliffside facility.[20] Following the lead of the Fort Worth and Denver City Railroad, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad established services to and from Amarillo. Each of these three carriers maintained substantial freight and passenger depots and repair facilities in the city through most of the 20th century and were major employers within the community.[21] Amarillo was hit by the Dust Bowl and entered an economic depression. U.S. Routes 60, 87, 287, and 66 intersected at Amarillo, making it a major tourist stop with numerous motels, restaurants, and curio shops. World War II led the establishment of Amarillo Army Air Field in east Amarillo and the nearby Pantex Army Ordnance Plant, which produced bombs and ammunition. After the end of the war, both of the facilities were closed. The Pantex Plant was reopened in 1950 and produced nuclear weapons throughout the Cold War.[11] In 1949, a deadly F4 tornado devastated much of Amarillo, shortly after nightfall on May 15, tearing through the south and east sides of the city, killing seven people, and injuring more than 80 others. The tornado touched down southwest of Amarillo, near the town of Hereford, then tracked its way northward, on a collision course with Amarillo. The tornado, shortly after 8 pm, ripped through Amarillo's most densely populated areas, demolishing almost half of the city, causing catastrophic damage and loss of life. In 1951, the army air base was reactivated as Amarillo Air Force Base and expanded to accommodate a Strategic Air Command B-52 Stratofortress wing.[22] The arrival of servicemen and their families ended the city's depression. Between 1950 and 1960, Amarillo's population grew from 74,443 to 137,969. However, the closure of Amarillo Air Force Base on December 31, 1968, contributed to a decrease in population to 127,010 by 1970. In 1970, the U.S. Census Bureau reported Amarillo's population as 6.1% Hispanic and 88.5% non-Hispanic white.[23] In the 1980s, ASARCO, Iowa Beef Processors (present day Tyson Foods), Owens-Corning, and Weyerhaeuser built plants at Amarillo. The Eastridge neighborhood houses many immigrants from countries such as Vietnam, Laos, and Burma. Many of them found employment at the nearby Iowa Beef Processors plant.[24] The following decade, Amarillo's city limits encompassed 60 square miles (155\u00a0km2) in Potter and Randall Counties. Interstate 27 highway connecting Lubbock to Amarillo was built mostly during the 1980s.[11] In May 1982, a strong F3 tornado struck Amarillo's western suburbs, devastating parts of Dawn, and Bushland. No fatalities were reported."

        "header": "Geography",
        "content": "Amarillo is located near the middle of the Texas Panhandle. It does not share similar weather characteristics with south and east Texas. It is situated in the grasslands of the Texas Panhandle, and is surrounded by dense prairie. Amarillo is infamous for its unpredictable weather patterns, with massive temperature changes on a daily basis, raging winds, devastating hailstorms and \"northers\", long periods of drought, late frosts, spring tornadoes, dust-storms, and floods. Though urbanization, agricultural farming, and construction have taken place over the last century in and around Amarillo, the native grasslands that dominate this region have remained largely untouched. Amarillo sits closer in proximity to the Oklahoma, New Mexico and Colorado state capitals than it does to Austin. The region's surface is relatively flat and has little soil drainage. Due to the lack of developed drainage, much of the rainfall either evaporates, infiltrates into the ground, or accumulates in playa lakes.[10] According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 90.3 square miles (234\u00a0km2), with 89.9\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (233\u00a0km2) of it land and 0.4\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (1.0\u00a0km2) of it (0.50%) covered by water. The Amarillo metropolitan area covers four counties: Armstrong, Carson, Potter, and Randall. About 20 miles (32\u00a0km) northeast of Amarillo is the Canadian River, which divides the Western High Plains ecological region. The southern divide of the Western High Plains is the Llano Estacado or Staked Plains geographical region. The river is dammed to form Lake Meredith, a major source of drinking water in the Texas Panhandle region.[25] The city is situated near the Panhandle Field, in a productive gas and oil area, covering 200,000 acres (81,000\u00a0ha) in Hartley, Potter, Moore, Hutchinson, Carson, Gray, Wheeler, and Collingsworth Counties. The Potter County portion had the nation's largest natural gas reserve.[26] Approximately 25 miles (40\u00a0km) south of Amarillo is the canyon system, Palo Duro Canyon. The tallest peak is reported to be 2,500 feet (760\u00a0m) underground in northeastern Potter County under the Alibates Flint Quarries National Monument.[27]"

        "header": "Climate",
        "content": "Like most of the Texas Panhandle, Amarillo has a temperate semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification BSk).[28] Both the city and most of the county as a whole lie in USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 7a.[29] Amarillo is characterized by a winter season featuring large diurnal temperature variation, great day-to-day variability, possible sudden and/or severe Arctic air outbreaks (in Texas, called \"blue northers\"), possible blizzards and hot summers with generally low humidity. The average annual precipitation is 20.4 inches or 520 millimeters. Much of Amarillo's precipitation falls during heavy convective showers and thunderstorms during the late spring and summer months. According to 'Cities Ranked and Rated' (Bert Sperling and Peter Sander), Amarillo averages 48 days per year during which thunder and lightning is reported. This is above the national average. These storms can be severe: Amarillo and the Texas Panhandle are situated in the western portion of \"Tornado Alley\" and are prone to severe weather events, occurring primarily between April and July. Severe thunderstorms can produce damaging straight-line winds, large hail, tornadoes, and flash flooding. Amarillo is no stranger to devastating tornadoes. Tornadoes have occurred in and around the city in 1968, 1970, 1982, 1986, 2001, 2007, and most recently in 2013, 2015 and 2016. The strongest tornado to ever hit Amarillo was a deadly F4 tornado that struck the city in the night time hours of May 15, 1949. Amarillo suffered a direct hit, causing catastrophic damage and loss of life in Amarillo's most densely populated areas. The tornado devastated the south and east sides of the city, killing 7 people, and injuring more than 80 others. The monthly daily average temperature ranges from 38.6\u00a0\u00b0F (3.7\u00a0\u00b0C) in January to 79.6\u00a0\u00b0F (26.4\u00a0\u00b0C) in July. Sunny weather prevails year-round, with nearly 3300 hours of bright sunshine annually. The National Weather Service in Amarillo forecasts and provides climatic data for the city. Extreme temperatures range from \u221216\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221226.7\u00a0\u00b0C) on February 12, 1899 to 111\u00a0\u00b0F (43.9\u00a0\u00b0C) on June 26, 2011, but lows do not typically dip to 0\u00a0\u00b0F or \u221217.8\u00a0\u00b0C in most years, while highs above 100\u00a0\u00b0F or 37.8\u00a0\u00b0C are seen on 4.7 days on average. On average, there are 5.9 days of lows at or below 10\u00a0\u00b0F or \u221212.2\u00a0\u00b0C, 8.8 days where the temperature fails to rise above freezing, and 61 days of 90\u00a0\u00b0F (32.2\u00a0\u00b0C)+ highs. Unlike in the Rio Grande Valley or eastern portions of Texas, days where the low does not fall below 70\u00a0\u00b0F or 21.1\u00a0\u00b0C are relatively rare, due to the aridity and elevation. Blizzards occur occasionally, but snowfall is typically light, averaging nearly 18 inches or 46 centimeters seasonally and the median figure is near 10 inches or 25 centimeters.[30] Amarillo is also recorded as the windiest city in the U.S. by the Weather Channel.[31]"

        "content": "Most of Amarillo's population growth and commercial development are occurring in the southern and northwestern parts of the city.[47] Similar to many towns in the Texas Panhandle, the city's downtown has suffered economic deterioration throughout the years.[48] To help revitalize it, the organization Center City of Amarillo was formed to establish partnerships with groups who have a large presence in the city.[49] Since its conception in the 1990s, Center City has sponsored public art projects and started block parties in the downtown area.[50] The 31-story FirstBank Southwest Tower was opened in Amarillo's downtown in 1971.[51] Completed in the same year as the FirstBank Southwest Tower, the Amarillo National Bank Plaza One building houses the headquarters of Amarillo National Bank, the city's largest financial institution.[52][53] The Santa Fe Building, completed in 1930, was the regional offices of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, but was vacant for several years until Potter County bought the building for $426,000 in 1995 to gain new office spaces.[54] Amarillo's historic homes and buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places reflect the economic growth from around 1900 to the start of World War II. Polk Street contains many of the city's historic downtown buildings and homes. The large historic homes on this street were built close to downtown, and homes were located on the west side of the street as a symbol of status because they would be greeted with the sunrise every morning.[55] The city of Amarillo's Parks and Recreation Department operates over 50 municipal parks, including a skatepark west of the city. Amarillo's largest parks are Medical Park, Thompson Memorial Park, and Memorial Park, near Amarillo College's Washington Street Campus. From 1978 to 2002, the Junior League of Amarillo and the city of Amarillo's Parks and Recreation Department co-sponsored Funfest, a family entertainment festival, benefiting the city parks and the league's Community Chest Trust Fund. Funfest was held in Thompson Memorial Park during Memorial Day weekend.[56]"

The meat packing industry is a major employer in Amarillo;[64] about one-quarter of the United States' beef supply is processed in the area. The city is also the location of headquarters for the Texas Cattle Feeders Association. Petroleum extraction is also a major industry. The helium industry has decreased in significance since the federal government privatized local operations in the late 1990s. Bell Helicopter Textron opened a helicopter assembly plant near the city's international airport in 1999.[62] The city's largest employer in 2005 was Tyson Foods, with 3,700 employees. The Amarillo Independent School District was next with 3,659 employees followed by Pantex, Baptist St. Anthony's Health Care System, City of Amarillo, Northwest Texas Healthcare System, Amarillo College, Wal-mart, and United Supermarkets.[65] Other major employers include Bell Helicopter Textron, Owens-Corning, Amarillo National Bank and ASARCO. Approximately 14\u00a0million acres (57,000\u00a0km2) of agricultural land surrounds the city with corn, wheat, and cotton as the primary crops. Other crops in the area include sorghum, silage, hay, and soybeans.[66] The Texas Panhandle, particularly in Hereford, Texas, serves as a fast-growing milk producing area as several multimillion-dollar state of the art dairies were built in the early 2000s.[67] The Amarillo Economic Development Corporation (AEDC) is funded by a city sales tax, and it provides aggressive incentive packages to existing and prospective employers. In the mid-to-late 1990s, the AEDC gained notoriety by sending mock checks to businesses across the country, placing full-page advertisements in The Wall Street Journal, and paying an annual $1 million subsidy to American Airlines to retain jet service.[68][69] The AEDC is largely responsible for bringing Bell Helicopter Textron's development of the V-22 Osprey hybrid aircraft and the future site of Marine One assembly in Amarillo.[70] From 2020 to 2021, Amarillo experienced its greatest amount of economic development in 30 years.[71] Amazon, Asset Protection Unit, and Texas Tech University Vet School were named some major organizations contributing to the city and metropolitan area's economic growth. Through the COVID-19 pandemic in Texas, the Amarillo Chamber of Commerce announced a new initiative to help local businesses rebound from the pandemic.[72] Its tourism industry also rebounded.[73]"

The Palo Duro Canyon State Park is the United States' second largest canyon system, after the Grand Canyon and is located south of Amarillo. The canyon is a prominent mountain biking destination and hosts the annual 50-mile Palo Duro Canyon Trail Run.[74] Palo Duro has a distinct hoodoo that resembles a lighthouse. Another natural landmark near the city, the Alibates Flint Quarries National Monument is located 30 miles (48\u00a0km) north of Amarillo. It is once known as the site for prehistoric inhabitants to obtain flint in order to make tools and weapons. About 100 miles (160\u00a0km) southeast of Amarillo in Briscoe County is Caprock Canyons State Park and Trailway, the state park is the home of the official Texas State Bison Herd, who were captured and taken care of by cattle rancher Charles Goodnight.[75] Local millionaire Stanley Marsh 3 funded many public art projects in the city including the Cadillac Ranch, located west of Amarillo on Interstate 40, a monument of painted Cadillac automobiles that were dug into the ground head first. Marsh also participated in an ongoing art project called the Dynamite Museum, which consists of thousands of mock traffic signs. These signs, bearing messages such as \"Road does not end\" or displaying a random picture, are scattered throughout the city of Amarillo.[76] Besides these works, one can find close to the city the final earthwork of Robert Smithson (and another commission by Marsh), Amarillo Ramp. The city has events and attractions honoring the cowboy and Texas culture. During the third week of September, the Tri-State Fair & Rodeo brings participants mostly from Oklahoma, New Mexico and Texas to Amarillo since 1921.[77] On the Tri-State Exposition grounds, the Amarillo National Center is a special events center for events ranging from national equestrian competitions to motor sports and rodeos. The World Championship Ranch Rodeo sponsored by the Working Ranch Cowboys Association is held every November in the Amarillo Civic Center.[78] The Amarillo Livestock Auction on Bull Road holds a free-to-the-public cattle auction on Tuesdays. Now located on Interstate 40, The Big Texan Steak Ranch is famous by offering visitors a free 72\u00a0ounce (2\u00a0kg) beef steak if it (and its accompanying dinner) is eaten in under an hour. Globe-News Center for the Performing Arts, opened in 2006, houses the Amarillo Opera, Amarillo Symphony, and Lone Star Ballet concerts. The facility, located just across the Amarillo Civic Center, features a 1,300-seat auditorium. The Globe-News Center was built in hope by city officials and others that it will revitalize the downtown area.[79] The nonprofit community theater group, Amarillo Little Theatre, has its season run from September to May. The theater group's two facilities, the Mainstage and the Adventure Space, are located west of Amarillo's downtown. The Pioneer Amphitheater, located in nearby Palo Duro Canyon, is the setting for the outdoor musical drama Texas, which plays nightly during the summer. The musical depicts a story about the history of Texas Panhandle settlers throughout the years. In 2002, the producers changed its name to Texas Legacies after retiring the previous script that was used for 37 years for a more historically accurate one, but attendance declined over the next four seasons, so it was decided to revert to the original Paul Green script in 2006.[80][81] The Amarillo Public Library is affiliated with the Harrington Library Consortium. The consortium consist of public, college, and school libraries located in the Texas Panhandle that share resources and cooperate with one another. Other members include the Amarillo's public schools, Amarillo College, Canyon Area Library, Lovett Memorial Library in Pampa, Texas, and Hutchinson County Library in Borger, Texas.[82] The Amarillo Public Library's main branch is located in downtown and operates four neighborhood branches. Wonderland Amusement Park is located in northern Amarillo at Thompson Park, named for Ernest Thompson. The park also houses the Amarillo zoo and offers picnicking. Amarillo residents are known as Amarilloans. Notable Amarilloans include actress Ann Doran (1911\u20132000), old-style journalist Bascom N. Timmons, the Dory Funk wrestling family, former UFC Champions Heath Herring and Evan Tanner, astronaut Rick Husband, professional golfer Ryan Palmer, rockabilly pioneer Buddy Knox, actress Carolyn Jones, actress and dancer Cyd Charisse, actor and poet Harry Northup, State Senator Max Sherman, Republican state chairman Tom Mechler, politicians Beau Boulter and John Marvin Jones, businessman T.

The organization is headquartered in Amarillo and has a museum. There is also an American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame exhibited in the museum. In addition, the AQHA and Center City of Amarillo co-sponsors the project, \"Hoof Prints of the American Quarter Horse\" which consist of horse statues located in front of several Amarillo businesses, such as the downtown Amarillo National building, Nationwide Insurance, and Edward Jones. An area business would purchase a horse statue and a local artist paints on it.[83] Two of the Amarillo area's higher education institutions have at least one museum in their campuses. The Amarillo Art Center [1], opened in 1972, is a building complex with the Amarillo Museum of Art (AMoA)[84] and concert hall located on the Washington Street Campus of Amarillo College. Located on the campus of West Texas A&M University, the Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum claims to be the largest historical museum in Texas. Don Harrington Discovery Center, located in the city's hospital district, is an interactive science center and space theater with over 60 hands-on exhibits.[85] Outside of the building is a steel structure called the Helium Monument which has time capsules and designates Amarillo the \"Helium Capital of the World.\"[11] Near the proximity of the Discovery Center, the Amarillo Botanical Gardens has gardens, indoor exhibits, and a library for visitation throughout the year. The Texas Pharmacy Museum claims to be the only Texas museum specialized in the research, collection, preservation, and exhibition of the history of pharmacy, is also located in the city's hospital district.[86] Founded in 2013, by businessman Tom Warren, The Amarillo Historical Museum is Amarillo's only local museum to exclusively feature local history.[87] Other notable museums in the area are the Kwahadi Kiva Indian Museum and the English Field Air & Space Museum. The Kwahadi Kiva Indian Museum features a collection of Native American artifacts and provides dance performances. The English Field Air & Space Museum, which had been operated by the Texas Aviation Historical Society featuring aircraft and space exhibits, in 2007 closed its doors and lost many of its aircraft. The museum is now rebuilding its aircraft collection as Texas Air & Space Museum and is located on American Drive on the south side of the airport."

During the trial, Winfrey hired Dallas-based jury consultant Phil McGraw to aid her attorneys on selecting and analyzing the members of the jury.[113] McGraw would later become a regular guest on Winfrey's television show and subsequently started his own talk show, Dr. Phil, in 2002. Another notable trial in Amarillo includes the Fort Worth-area murder case of T. Cullen Davis, which involved one of the richest men in the United States, his former wife, and her daughter and boyfriend. The trial was moved from Fort Worth to Amarillo in 1977 on a change of venue.[114] The 1997 murder of Brian Deneke and subsequent trial also brought national attention because it highlighted social divisions in the community that mirrored those in America as a whole. The defendant in the trial was convicted of voluntary manslaughter and received a light sentence.[115] The movie Bomb City is based on the events surrounding Deneke's murder. The small town of Tulia, Texas, approximately 47 miles (76\u00a0km) south from Amarillo, was the scene of a controversial drug sting in 1999. Local civil rights attorney Jeff Blackburn took up the case of the Tulia defendants, which became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre and resulted in the exoneration and pardon of the defendants.[116] A federal lawsuit directed at the officials responsible for the sting operation was held in Amarillo. In the final settlement, the City of Amarillo agreed to pay $5\u00a0million in damages to the former Tulia defendants; disband the Panhandle Regional Narcotics Task Force that it set up to oversee the sting operation; and require early retirement for two Amarillo Police Department officers who were responsible for supervising the sting's sole undercover agent.[117][118] On May 5, 2020, Amarillo ranked 13th in the nation for Highest Average Daily Growth Rate of COVID-19 cases by the New York Times.[119]"

Christie's version, which only managed to reach 18 when originally released in 1971, made it to the number 1 spot in the UK Singles Chart in 2005 for 7 weeks.[120][121] Amarillo is also mentioned in the song \"My Rifle, My Pony and Me\" by Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson, from the 1959 Western Rio Bravo, which was subsequently featured in a number of episodes of The Sopranos. The Amarillo Film Commission is a division of the Amarillo Convention and Visitor Council that was created to provide film crews with locations and other assistance when filming in Amarillo.[122] Amarillo was the setting for several motion pictures, including Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Switchback, and The Plutonium Circus, the 1995 South by Southwest Film Festival winner for best documentary feature.

ACT operates bus services that include fixed route transit and demand response paratransit which are designed for people with disabilities. The ACT transports approximately 350,000 passengers per year on the fixed route and 30,000 paratransit passengers.[65] Amarillo has no passenger rail service but remains an important part of the rail freight system. The last passenger train out of the city was the Santa Fe Railroad's San Francisco Chief, from Chicago, which had its last run in 1971. Previously, the Texas Zephyr to Denver and Dallas, last served Amarillo in 1967. The BNSF Railway complex in Amarillo continues to serve a heavy daily traffic load, approximately 100\u2013110 trains per day.[127] The Union Pacific Railroad also sends substantial shipments to or through Amarillo. In addition to intermodal and general goods, a big portion of rail shipments involve grains and coal. There have been various proposals over the years to add passenger service. One, the Caprock Chief, would have seen daily service as part of a Fort Worth, Texas\u2014Denver, Colorado service, but it failed to gain traction. The streets in Amarillo's downtown area conform to a grid pattern. The city's original street layout was set up by William H. Bush, beginning at the west end of the town moving to the east. Bush named the north to south streets for past United States presidents, in chronological order except for John Quincy Adams because the surname was taken with the second president, John Adams.[128] (The last president so honored was Grover Cleveland; though the city has expanded eastward, the pattern was not continued.) While the streets running north\u2013south honor past presidents and are designated 'streets', east\u2013west streets are numbered and are designated 'avenues'. North of the Fort Worth & Denver (now Burlington Northern-Santa Fe) railyard, the numbers are \"NW\" (northwest) west of Polk Street, and \"NE\" (northeast) east of Polk. South of the railyard (including the downtown-city center area), numbers are officially \"SW\" (southwest) west of Polk, and \"SE\" (southeast) east of Polk. Colloquially, though, most tend to dub the SW and SE avenues as W (west) and E (east), respectively. One example of the numbering difference regards the former U.S. Highway 66 routing west of downtown and into the San Jacinto neighborhood. Most call it 'West Sixth Street' when its actually SW Sixth Avenue. In 1910, the Amarillo voters approved to pay for street paving and the materials used to pave the streets were bricks.[129] As of 2003, the city still has 16.2 miles (26.1\u00a0km) of brick streets in some parts of the downtown area. In 2002, the city spent $200,000 to restore one block of brick street on Ninth Avenue between Polk and Tyler streets.[130]"

North of downtown the highway becomes US 87 & 287 and continues northward to Dumas.[62] Interstate 40, the city's major east\u2013west thoroughfare was completed entirely through Amarillo in November 1968 across the center of the city. Previously, Route 66 was the major east\u2013west highway through the city, generally following Amarillo Boulevard to the north of the downtown area and then curving southwest to leave the city near the Veterans Hospital. A city route (which was an original alignment of US 66 through central and west Amarillo) followed Fillmore south into the downtown area and turned on West 6th through the San Jacinto Heights district which is now home to many antique shops, restaurants and other businesses, passing the Amarillo Country Club and veering onto West 9th Street and Bushland Boulevard before tying into the through route at a traffic circle near the Veterans Hospital.\nLoop 335 circles around Amarillo in all four directions and consists of four-lane roadway on its northeast and southwest quadrants and two-lane paving to the southeast and northwest.

It will accommodate six lanes at the mainlane bridge along with a complete stack interchange with direct connectors to and from I-27. Furthermore, another triple-level interchange will be built to accommodate Soncy Road, Helium Road, I-27 and the new loop.[133]  Also, another new mainlane bridge that accommodates up to six lanes is also in the works for I-40 near Helium Rd. providing easier access to the new freeway.[134]  Although construction started in 2016, the entire project, which includes converting the entire loop to Interstate Specifications, is not expected to be complete until 2024.[135][136]"

Forming as the twenty-seventh named storm of the 2018 Pacific typhoon season, Toraji developed as a tropical depression to the southeast of Vietnam on November 16. Quickly organising, the system strengthened into a tropical storm the next day. Toraji rapidly weakened thereafter early on November 18, when the storm made landfall over southeastern Vietnam, later dissipating. The storm's remnants moved into the Gulf of Thailand when Toraji re-organised back into a tropical depression on November 20. However Toraji quickly deteriorated on the same day as it moved closer to the Malay Peninsula. Despite being a weak storm, Toraji brought heavy rainfall which lead to flash flooding and landslides, mostly in the southern provinces of Vietnam. This resulted in a total of 32 people dead, with the majority of them being in the Khanh Hoa province. Damages were toppled up to \u20ab1.24 billion (US$53.9 million)."

By 09:00 UTC of November 20, satellite imagery showed a new burst of convection along convective banding wrapping into the system's center.[12] This prompted the JTWC to re-issue advisories on Toraji.[13] However, Toraji's convective signature did not last long within the JTWC's next advisory.[14] Therefore, the JTWC issued its final advisory on Toraji on 21:00 UTC of the same day, as the storm made landfall on the Malay Peninsula.[15]"

In the province of Khanh Hoa, a two-day rainfall from November 17\u201318 were measured to up to 200\u00a0mm (7.9\u00a0in).[20] The city of Nha Trang experienced a rain total of 380\u00a0mm (15\u00a0in).[20] Low-lying communities saw houses being submerged by more than one meter.[21] To ensure the safety of the students from the damages, schools were closed on November 19,[20] where an estimated total of 90,000 students were forced to stay at home.[21] Villages over mountainous areas experiences landslides that buried homes. The main highway that linked Northern and Southern Vietnam was temporarily blocked along with interruptions of rail service due to heavy debris,[22] where 400 train passengers have remained stranded.[21] At least 17 people have perished from the storm in Nha Trang alone. The city's chairman criticised the local authorities for \"late responses\" to the damages caused, and the areas where landslides have killed people weren't included in the list of landslide-prone areas given to city authorities.[23] A report a few months after the storm stated that a total of 20 people have died, with total damages measured at \u20ab1.24 billion (US$53.9 million).[24]"

Forming out of a tropical wave on September\u00a03, Babe began as a subtropical cyclone in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. The storm gradually intensified as it tracked westward. On September\u00a05, the storm turned north and acquired tropical characteristics. Later that day, Babe intensified into a hurricane and attained its peak strength with winds of 75\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h) and a barometric pressure of 995\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.38\u00a0inHg). Several hours later, the hurricane made landfall in Louisiana and quickly weakened. By September\u00a06, Babe had weakened to a tropical depression and later dissipated early on September\u00a09 over North Carolina. Hurricane Babe produced minimal impact throughout its path in the United States. The most significant impact occurred in Louisiana where the storm caused $10\u00a0million (1977\u00a0USD; $50.3\u00a0million 2024\u00a0USD) in damage, mainly from crop losses. An additional $3\u00a0million (1977\u00a0USD; $15.1\u00a0million 2024\u00a0USD) in losses resulted from tornadoes spawned by Babe. Heavy rainfall in North Carolina, peaking at 8.99\u00a0in (228\u00a0mm) triggered flash flooding but little damage. No fatalities resulted from the hurricane. Coincidentally, a typhoon, also named Babe, existed at exactly the same time as Hurricane Babe.[1]"

Tracking westward, the wave eventually entered the Gulf of Mexico on September\u00a02. Upon entering the gulf, a surface circulation developed; however, convection associated with the system was not concentrated around the center. The newly formed system then interacted with an upper tropospheric cyclonic vortex situated near the Florida coastline. The following day,  Convective banding features around the cyclone led to the National Hurricane Center (NHC) upgrading the system to Tropical Storm Babe.[2] Although classified a tropical storm, Babe was not fully tropical, it was later classified as a subtropical cyclone.[3] The forward motion of Babe had slowed significantly from when it was a wave[2] but maintained the westward direction.[3] By September\u00a04, the maximum winds were found closer to the center of circulation and the cyclone developed a warmer core, a main feature in tropical cyclones. An anticyclone also developed over Babe and later that day, the storm transitioned into a tropical cyclone.[2] By this time, Babe had turned nearly due north and was near hurricane-status.[3] Around this time, reconnaissance missions into the storm found a closed eyewall with an eye measuring roughly 23\u00a0mi (37\u00a0km) in diameter.[4] Another reconnaissance flight that day found sustained winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h); however, these winds were located roughly 65\u00a0mi (100\u00a0km) from the center and considered to be unrepresentative of the storm's actual intensity.[2] Early on September\u00a05, reconnaissance found a central barometric pressure of 995\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.38\u00a0inHg), the lowest recorded in relation to the storm.[4] Around this time, Babe also intensified into a hurricane, attaining maximum winds of 75\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h).[2] Later that day, Hurricane Babe made landfall near Cocodrie, Louisiana and quickly weakened to a tropical storm.[3] By landfall, the eye of Babe had contracted to roughly 14\u00a0mi (23\u00a0km).[4] On September\u00a06, the storm had weakened to a tropical depression and was moving northeast into Mississippi. The system continued this movement for the following two days.[2][3] While crossing South Carolina, forecasters thought that the system would emerge into the Atlantic Ocean and regenerate into a tropical depression.[5] However, the remnants of Babe dissipated shortly before crossing into North Carolina early on September\u00a09.[3]"

These warnings were later discontinued as the system moved over land. Ahead of the storm, up to 30,000 residents in low-lying parts of the state moved inland.[2] However, press reports indicate that upwards of 45,000 residents had evacuated from coastal regions prior to the storm. In Grand Isle, roughly 200 civil defense workers stayed behind in the town hall after the cities 2,300 residents evacuated.[6] In Cameron Parish, roughly 8,000 residents evacuated inland.[7] Emergency shelters were set up throughout Louisiana to house evacuees during the storm.[8] As Hurricane Babe began to weaken over Louisiana, forecasters anticipated the formation of tornadoes and issued tornado watches for parts of Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia and Florida.[9]"

Most of North Carolina received between 3 and 5\u00a0in (76 and 127\u00a0mm) of rain with isolated areas exceeding 7\u00a0in (180\u00a0mm).[10] A state maximum of 8.99\u00a0in (228\u00a0mm) fell in Lake Toxaway, North Carolina, 7.05\u00a0in (179\u00a0mm) in Caesars Head, South Carolina and 6.62\u00a0in (168\u00a0mm) in Chattanooga, Tennessee.[11] Upon making landfall, Babe produced a storm surge of 5\u00a0ft (1.5\u00a0m), leading to minor coastal flooding.[2] Due to the storm's quick deterioration after moving inland, the NHC presumed that hurricane-force winds did not impact land. The highest wind gust was recorded in Grand Isle, Louisiana at 50\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h) and the highest sustained wind was recorded in Boothville, Louisiana at 45\u00a0mph (75\u00a0km/h).[2] In Jean Lafitte, Louisiana, overflow from the Fleming Canal produced flooding throughout the area.[12] The most significant damage was to croplands inundated by flood waters. Flash flooding occurred throughout the path of the former hurricane in the eastern United States, particularly in North Carolina.[2] Hurricane Babe produced 14 tornadoes between September\u00a05 and 7 along its track in several states.[13] Louisiana recorded the most, with six touchdowns,[14] including one F2 that injured one person and caused $2.5\u00a0million (1977\u00a0USD; $12.6\u00a0million 2024\u00a0USD) in damages near Hammond in Tangipahoa Parish.[9][15] A country store sustained severe damage from the tornado, with most of the back of the store destroyed. Six wood-frame homes were also knocked off their cinder block supports.[9] Another F2 touched down in Tuscaloosa County, Alabama; however, minimal damage was recorded along its 8\u00a0mi (13\u00a0km) track.[15] Another F2 briefly touched down in Harrison County, Mississippi on September\u00a06.[15] It struck an unoccupied elementary school, wrecking six classrooms and leaving $500,000 (1977\u00a0USD; $2.51\u00a0million 2024\u00a0USD) in damages.[9]  Throughout the storm's path, damages amounted to $10\u00a0million (1977\u00a0USD; $50.3\u00a0million 2024\u00a0USD)[2] with an additional $3\u00a0million (1977\u00a0USD; $15.1\u00a0million 2024\u00a0USD) from tornadoes.[14]  There was no loss of life due to Babe.[2]"

Slowly tracking south-southwestward, the system paralleled the eastern shore of Madagascar for several days.[1] On March\u00a09, the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center for the South-West Indian Ocean basin, M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France, classified the low as a tropical depression, the 13th of the season. Situated in a region of weak steering currents, the depression was quasi-stationary and environmental conditions, low wind shear and good divergence, favored gradual development.[2] Within hours of this, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the depression.[1] The formation of convective banding features took place throughout the day and intensification into a moderate tropical storm was anticipated.[3] Though convection tended to fluctuate, a general organizing trend was apparent.[4] Early on March\u00a010, the JTWC classified the system as Tropical Cyclone 18S as deep convection consolidated around the storm's center.[5] Around 1200\u00a0UTC on March\u00a010, M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France upgraded the system to a moderate tropical storm and assigned it with the name Hubert.[6] This corresponded with the early stages of eye formation, as the storm's outer bands wrapped tightly around the center of circulation.[7] Previously quasi-stationary, Hubert gained a southwesterly track in response to a ridge to its south.[2][6] Rapid intensification ensued in the hours before the cyclone made landfall in Madagascar.[8] Just six hours after being named, Hubert attained its peak intensity as a severe tropical storm with winds of 100\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph) along with a barometric pressure of 985\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.09\u00a0inHg).[6] At this time, the storm's radius of maximum winds was 17\u00a0km (11\u00a0mi).[8] The JTWC assessed the system to have been slightly weaker, reporting peak winds of 85\u00a0km/h (50\u00a0mph).[9] Around 2100\u00a0UTC, the center of Hubert moved onshore near the city of Mananjary in Fianarantsoa Province.[10] Once overland, the storm abruptly turned northwestward and rapidly weakened as sustained winds dropped below gale-force.[6] During the latter part of March\u00a011, Hubert resumed a southwesterly track along the northwestern edge of the ridge to its south. Operational advisories on the storm indicated that Hubert would continue to deteriorate over Madagascar before moving over the Mozambique Channel where it could regenerate.[11] This forecast never verified as the remnants of the storm failed to redevelop. The circulation remained over Madagascar through March\u00a013 before it moved offshore near the southern tip of the island. Once over water, the system temporarily had a more westerly tracking component before it turned southeastward. The remnants of Hubert were last noted on March\u00a015 to the south of Madagascar.[9]"

Numerous bridges were destroyed and land access to many towns was impossible months after the storm passed. Wells were contaminated by the floods, prompting fears that an ongoing outbreak of Chikungunya would spread more rampantly.

The heat wave had a comparable intensity to the 1990 heat wave.[2] From 31 August to 3 September, the temperature in the UK exceeded 32\u00a0\u00b0C (90\u00a0\u00b0F) consecutively over much of the UK. In September, Central England and Birmingham recorded a maximum temperature of 31.5\u00a0\u00b0C (88.7\u00a0\u00b0F),[3][4] while Oxford recorded a maximum temperature of 33.1\u00a0\u00b0C (91.6\u00a0\u00b0F).[3] 2 September was the hottest day of the month, as temperatures reached 35.6\u00a0\u00b0C (96.1\u00a0\u00b0F) in Bawtry; this remains the hottest September temperature of any day in the UK and the eighth-hottest day overall in the 20th century.[5] Scotland had temperatures reaching 32.2\u00a0\u00b0C (90.0\u00a0\u00b0F) at Gordon Castle, Moray, while Northern Ireland had temperatures reaching 27.8\u00a0\u00b0C (82.0\u00a0\u00b0F) in Armagh, County Armagh, both recorded on 1 September 1906.[1][failed verification]"

        "header": "Hurricane Camille",
        "content": " Hurricane Camille was a powerful, deadly and destructive Category 5 Atlantic hurricane which became the second most intense tropical cyclone on record to strike the United States (behind the 1935 Labor Day hurricane) and is one of just four Category\u00a05 hurricanes to make landfall in the U.S. The most intense storm of the 1969 Atlantic hurricane season, Camille originated as a tropical depression on August 14, south of Cuba, from a long-tracked tropical wave. Located in a favorable environment for strengthening, the storm quickly intensified into a Category\u00a02 hurricane before striking the western part of Cuba on August 15. Emerging into the Gulf of Mexico, Camille underwent another period of rapid intensification and became a Category 5 hurricane the next day as it moved northward towards Louisiana and Mississippi. Despite weakening slightly on August 17, the hurricane quickly re-intensified back into a Category 5 hurricane before it made landfall a half hour before midnight in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. At peak intensity, the hurricane had peak 1-minute sustained winds of 175 miles per hour (282\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 900\u00a0mbar (26.58\u00a0inHg), the second-lowest pressure recorded for a U.S. landfall behind the 1935 Labor Day hurricane. As Camille pushed inland, it quickly weakened and was a tropical depression by the time it was over the Ohio Valley. Once it emerged offshore, Camille was able to restrengthen to a strong tropical storm before becoming extratropical on August 22. Camille was absorbed by a frontal storm over the North Atlantic later that day. Camille caused tremendous damage in its wake and produced a peak official storm surge of 24 feet (7.3\u00a0m). It flattened nearly everything along the Mississippi coast and caused additional flooding and deaths inland while crossing the Appalachian Mountains of Virginia. In the U.S., Camille killed more than 259\u00a0people[1][2] and caused $1.42\u00a0billion in damages (equivalent to $11.8\u00a0billion in 2023).[3]"

        "content": "Hurricane Camille originated from a tropical wave that moved off the western coast of Africa on August 5, 1969. It tracked quickly westward along the 15th parallel north;[4] several days later, a tropical disturbance became clearly identifiable on satellite imagery on August 9. By that time, the thunderstorm activity in the disturbance concentrated into a circular area of convection. On the next day, the storm moved through the Lesser Antilles, although there was no evidence of a closed circulation. On August 13, the wave passed near or over the southern coast of Jamaica as its convection spread northeastward through the Bahamas. Subsequently, it began a slower motion to the northwest. It is believed that the tropical wave organized into a tropical depression shortly thereafter, early on August 14, and it became a tropical storm a few hours later. On the morning of August 14, the Hurricane Hunters flew to investigate for a closed circulation near the Bahamas and near the Cayman Islands.[5] The crew observed a developing center in the western Caribbean, and winds had reached tropical storm status. By then, the storm had strengthened into a strong tropical storm with winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h), about 50 miles (80\u00a0km) west-northwest of Grand Cayman.[5][6] Upon first being classified as a tropical storm, Camille was located in an area favorable for further strengthening, although initially it slowly intensified. It was located within an area of very light wind shear and an overall warm environment. Additionally, the storm developed strong low-level inflow from the deep southern Caribbean, which continuously brought moisture into the storm.[5] Throughout its duration, it was a small tropical cyclone, although with a radius of gale-force winds spreading 100 miles (160\u00a0km) to the north, the storm's thunderstorm area quickly spread over Cuba. As the storm approached the western coast of Cuba, it began rapid deepening, reaching hurricane status and less than 12\u00a0hours later attained winds of 110\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h). Prior to landfall, its eye was tracked by radar from Havana; it is estimated the hurricane moved ashore between Cape San Antonio and Guane late on August 15 as a strong Category 2 hurricane. Camille was a small hurricane as it crossed western Cuba, and its winds decreased slightly to 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h) over land before it emerged into the Gulf of Mexico.[6] Initially, Hurricane Camille was forecast to turn northeastward toward the Florida panhandle. Instead, it continued northwestward and resumed its rapid intensification trend after leaving Cuba. Its eye contracted to a diameter of less than 8 miles (13\u00a0km), and strong rainbands developed around the entire hurricane. Due to the small eye, Hurricane Hunters at first had difficulties in determining the strength; however a flight late on August 16 found a strong Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale and recorded a very low pressure of 908\u00a0mbar (hPa; 26.82\u00a0inHg), with winds estimated at 175\u00a0mph (282\u00a0km/h).[5] At the time, it was not expected to intensify further.[6] However, a subsequent Hurricane Hunters flight early on August 17 recorded a slightly deeper central pressure of 905\u00a0mbar (hPa; 26.73\u00a0inHg), at the time the lowest pressure recorded by reconnaissance aircraft. That made Camille the most intense hurricane since the 1935 Labor Day hurricane; currently it is the sixth-most intense Atlantic hurricane, as ranked by lowest pressure. There was little change in the wind speed as such levelled out at 175\u00a0mph (282\u00a0km/h) during that time.[7][8] As it continued toward the Gulf Coast of the United States, Camille maintained its small eye, and forecasters continued to anticipate a turn toward Florida.[6] Late on August 17, Camille briefly weakened to a Category 4 storm due to an eyewall replacement cycle; a reconnaissance flight was forced to end its mission early due to a damaged engine.[5] Before they left the storm, the crew recorded a pressure of 919\u00a0mbar (hPa; 27.14\u00a0inHg) and estimated surface winds at 155\u00a0mph (249\u00a0km/h), while Camille was located about 100 miles (160\u00a0km) southeast of the Mississippi River Delta.[6] There were no subsequent Hurricane Hunter flights, but surface observations recorded later suggested that Camille quickly re-strengthened and regained Category 5 intensity.[7] After passing very close to southeastern Louisiana, Hurricane Camille made landfall at 11:30 CDT in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi.[9] Maximum sustained wind speeds near the coastline were estimated to have been about 175\u00a0mph (282\u00a0km/h), with a minimum central pressure of 900\u00a0mbar (hPa; 26.58\u00a0inHg) as analyzed by surface data.[5] The hurricane weakened as it progressed inland, and within 14 hours of moving ashore, Camille weakened to tropical storm status. About 12 hours later, it weakened to tropical depression status, by which time it began a turn to the north and northeast. On August 20, Tropical Depression Camille turned eastward through Kentucky, dropping heavy rainfall in West Virginia and Virginia. Later that day, it emerged into the Atlantic Ocean east of Norfolk, and by that afternoon, as Camille was emerging offshore it regained tropical storm status. Camille accelerated east-northeastward, attaining peak winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) as it interacted with larger Hurricane Debbie to its southeast (although the poor sampling of the region means that it is possible that the storm may have regained hurricane intensity in a location where measurements of wind speed were not taken).[5] Subsequently, Camille began to interact with a frontal storm, causing it to gradually transition into an extratropical cyclone as it entrained cooler air. On August 22, Camille was absorbed by the frontal system to the south of Atlantic Canada.[5][6]"

        "content": "Shortly after Camille formed, the National Hurricane Center advised residents on the Isle of Pines and in western Cuba to prepare for gale-force winds, heavy rains, and rising tides. The agency also recommended small boats to remain in harbor.[6] The threat of the storm prompted officials to evacuate thousands along the western coast of Cuba and on the Isle of Pines; on the island, 10,000\u00a0cattle and 6,000\u00a0turkeys were moved to safer areas.[10] As Camille impacted Cuba, small craft were advised not to venture out too far from the coasts of Florida.[11] On August 15, the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch for a 110 miles (180\u00a0km) stretch of land in Florida, between Apalachicola and Fort Walton Beach. The next day, as these hurricane watches were upgraded to a hurricane warning, thousands of people boarded up their homes and evacuated inland. During the afternoon of August 16, the weather bureau ordered that a hurricane watch should be placed in force for the coastline from Biloxi to St Marks, Florida. Later that day, the hurricane watches were upgraded to a hurricane warning for the northwestern Florida coast, from Fort Walton to St Marks.[citation needed] By Saturday morning, a hurricane watch was issued for the coast from Biloxi eastward. Civil defense organizations in coastal counties went on alert. Keesler Air Force Base and the Naval Construction Battalion Center prepared for the storm. By 5 p.m. on Sunday, a hurricane warning was issued for the coast. This activated the National Guard units. Many refused to believe the reports concerning Camille's intensity that afternoon. Many people living at elevations of 20 feet (6.1\u00a0m) above sea level refused to believe they were going to be submerged. The mayor of Gulfport ordered the release of prisoners from the city jail as winds increased at 9 p.m. on Sunday evening, but none would leave.[12]"

        "content": "Making landfall in Waveland, Mississippi, as a Category\u00a05 hurricane,[7] Camille caused damage and destruction across much of the Gulf Coast of the United States. Because it moved quickly through the region, Hurricane Camille dropped only moderate precipitation in most areas. Areas in and around Pass Christian, its point of landfall, reported from 7 to 10 inches (180 to 250\u00a0mm).[13] The area of total destruction in Harrison County, Mississippi was 68 square miles (180\u00a0km2).[14] The total U.S. estimated cost of damage was $1.42\u00a0billion (1969 USD).[3] This made Camille tied (with Hurricane Betsy) as the most expensive hurricane in the United States, up to that point.[15] The storm directly killed 143\u00a0people along Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana. An additional 153\u00a0people perished as a result of catastrophic flooding in Nelson County, Virginia and other areas nearby. In all, 8,931\u00a0people were injured, 5,662 homes were destroyed, and 13,915 homes experienced major damage, with many of the fatalities being coastal residents who had refused to evacuate."

        "content": "As a developing tropical storm, Camille brought rain showers to Grand Cayman, although there were no reports of damage.[6] Stations in Cuba on the outer fringes of the storm reported winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h). East of where it moved ashore, the city of Guane recorded winds of 92\u00a0mph (148\u00a0km/h), although no wind reports were taken in the landfall location. The hurricane produced up to 10 inches (250\u00a0mm) near Guane, as well as on the Isle of Pines.[6] On the Isle of Pines, the storm inflicted damage to about 100\u00a0houses.[10] Throughout Pinar del R\u00edo Province, Camille caused heavy damage,[16] primarily from river flooding;[17] about 20,000\u00a0people were left homeless in the province. Strong winds downed trees and power lines, which caused power outages eastward through the capital city of Havana. Initially, the government reported no casualties from the storm.[16] Subsequent research indicated the hurricane killed five people in the country during its passage, and damage was estimated at $5\u00a0million (1969\u00a0USD).[18] In the open Gulf of Mexico, the hurricane produced wave heights of at least 70 feet (21\u00a0m), as measured by Shell Oil Company. Along the ocean floor, the storm created mudslides which lowered the ocean floor; its combination with strong waves and winds destroyed three oil platforms, including one that at the time was the deepest oil well. Property damages to the offshore oil industry were initially estimated at $100\u00a0million (1969\u00a0USD).[19]"

Winds gusted to 125 miles per hour (201\u00a0km/h) at Slidell as their pressure sank to 28.75 inches of mercury (974\u00a0hPa) on August 19. Almost total destruction was seen from Venice to Buras. Ostrica Lock measured a storm surge of 16 feet (4.9\u00a0m). Water overwashed U.S. Highway 90 to a depth of 10 feet (3.0\u00a0m).[20] The highest rainfall report from the state was 5.23 inches (133\u00a0mm) from Slidell.[21] Camille caused about $322 million (1969 dollars) of damage in Louisiana.[5] The storm turned just in time to avoid a direct hit to the City of New Orleans, which was devastated just four years prior by Hurricane Betsy. The worst effects in New Orleans proper were flooding from some levees, particularly in the lowest lying areas, including the Lower Ninth Ward, which suffered the most severe flooding during Betsy.[citation needed] In addition, Camille forced the Mississippi River to flow backwards for a river-distance of 125\u00a0miles (from its mouth to a point north of New Orleans). The river further backed up for an additional 120 miles (190\u00a0km), to a point north of Baton Rouge.[22]"

        "content": "In Mississippi, Camille was significantly worse than Hurricane Betsy. Electricity went out during Camille's approach to the Mississippi coastline. United States Highway 90 flooded as a large storm surge overtopped seawalls, leaving a barge along the highway in Gulfport. Fires consumed coastal communities, with the exceptions of Bay St. Louis and Waveland. Camille destroyed the antebellum Trinity Episcopal church in Pass Christian, taking 15 lives. The Dixie White House, where President Woodrow Wilson and his family once stayed, was badly damaged. In Biloxi, Mississippi, the storm surge reached the second floor of the structure[which?].[12] The highest rainfall total recorded was 10.06 inches (256\u00a0mm) at the Mississippi Test Facility.[21] Mississippi received the worst of the damage. Upon making landfall, Camille produced a 24 foot (7.3\u00a0m) storm surge. Along Mississippi's entire shore and for some three to four blocks inland, the destruction was nearly complete. The worst-hit areas were Clermont Harbor, Lakeshore, Waveland, Bay St. Louis, Pass Christian, Long Beach, and the beachfront of Gulfport, Mississippi City, and Biloxi. One of Frank Lloyd Wright's waterfront houses for W. L. Fuller, in Pass Christian, was completely destroyed.[23] More than 11 inches (280\u00a0mm) of rain occurred in Hancock County, and most low-lying areas were flooded with up to 15 feet (4.6\u00a0m) of water. U.S. Highway 90, which is close to the shore, was broken up in many areas, and sand and debris blocked much of it. Totals say that 3,800 homes and businesses were completely destroyed. As Camille came ashore, it passed over Ship Island, off the coast of Mississippi; Camille's strong storm surge and torrential rains literally split the island in two: the body of water between West Ship Island and East Ship Island is now called \"Camille's Cut\". Camille had significant ecological effects in the Gulf Coast region. A barrier island chain off the coast of Mississippi and 70% of Dauphin Island were completely inundated by the storm's surge.[24] Camille caused about $950 million (1969 dollars) of damage in Mississippi.[5]"

In actuality, there was no party; 23 people are known to have stayed in the apartments during the hurricane, eight of whom died despite taking all precautions they knew in order to secure the building. The tale of the party, and the lone survivor, apparently originated with survivor Mary Ann Gerlach,[12] who also told her story in a 1989 episode of Nova. Another survivor, Ben Duckworth, has expressed irritation at the story. \"There was no hurricane party,\" Duckworth reiterated in 2001. \"We were exhausted from boarding up windows and helping the police move cars. We were too tired to party. I can't tell you why that story persists, or why people didn't put two and two together. I guess the hurricane party makes a good story.\"[25][26]"

The highest rainfall report received within Alabama was 6.52 inches (166\u00a0mm) two miles northeast of Fairhope.[21] Camille caused about $8 million (1969 dollars) of damage in Alabama.[5] Places farther east across the western Florida panhandle saw lesser rains, as 4.16 inches (106\u00a0mm) was measured at Pensacola Naval Air Station.[27]"

        "content": "Because the hurricane was expected to quickly dissipate over land, few were prepared for the flash flooding.[30] Arriving in Virginia on the evening of August 19, Camille was no longer a hurricane, but it carried high amounts of moisture and contained sufficient strength and low pressure to pull in additional moisture. A widespread area of western and central Virginia received over 8 inches (200\u00a0mm) of rain from Camille's remains, leading to significant flooding across the state. A total of 153 people lost their lives from blunt trauma sustained during mountain slides, related to the flash flooding, not drowning.[31] More than 123 of these deaths, including 21 members of one family, the Huffmans, were in Nelson County. Seven victims of the hurricane in Nelson County remain unidentified, as well as one in Albemarle County.[32] Landslides occurred on hillsides with a slope greater than 35\u00a0percent.[31] In Nelson County, the number of deaths amounted to over one percent of the county's population.[33] The worst of the damage was reported in Massies Mill, Woods Mill, Roseland, Bryant, Tyro, Montebello, Lovingston, Norwood, Rockfish, and along the Davis and Muddy creeks.[31] The James and Tye rivers crested well above flood stage in many areas, including a record high of 41.3 feet (12.6\u00a0m) at Columbia. Hurricane Camille caused more than $140 million of damage (1969 dollars) in Virginia.[5][6] Camille was considered one of the worst natural disasters in central Virginia's recorded history.[31] The storm dropped torrential rainfall of 12 to 20 inches (30 to 51\u00a0cm), with a maximum of 27 inches (69\u00a0cm).[28] Most of the rainfall occurred in Virginia during a 3\u20135\u00a0hour period on August 19\u201320. More than 5 inches (130\u00a0mm) of rain fell near the North Fork of the Tye River in only half an hour with the grounds already saturated from previous rains.[30] Many rivers flooded across the state, with the worst being the James River in Richmond with a peak crest of 28.6 feet (8.7\u00a0m). Many rivers in Virginia and West Virginia set records for peak flood stages, causing numerous mudslides along mountainsides. In the mountain slopes between Charlottesville and Lynchburg, more than 26 inches (66\u00a0cm) of rain fell in 12 hours, but the worst was in Nelson County where 27 inches (69\u00a0cm) fell. There, rainfall was so heavy that reports were received of birds drowning in trees, cows floating down the Hatt Creek and of survivors having to cup hands around their mouth and nose in order to breathe through the deluge. Though the official rainfall was recorded as 27 inches (69\u00a0cm), unofficial estimates are much greater. Some estimate that more than 40 inches (100\u00a0cm) of rain fell at Davis Creek. Most gauges were washed away; however, it was reported that an empty 55 US gallons (210\u00a0L) drum that was not even in the center of the heaviest rainfall had 31 inches (79\u00a0cm) of water in it after Camille passed.[34][unreliable source?] \"So much rain fell in such a short time in Nelson County that, according to the National Weather Service at the time, it was 'the probable maximum rainfall which meteorologists compute to be theoretically possible.'\"[35] The ensuing flash floods and mudslides killed 153\u00a0people. In Nelson County alone, 133 bridges washed out, while in some places entire communities were under water.[29] The major flooding that occurred downstream cut off all communication between Richmond and the Shenandoah Valley. Waynesboro on the South River saw 8 feet (2.4\u00a0m) of water downtown, and Buena Vista had more than 5 feet (1.5\u00a0m). Throughout Virginia, Camille destroyed 313 houses, 71 trailers, and 430 farm buildings. The hurricane affected 3,765 families in the area, and total damage in the state amounted to $140.8\u00a0million (1969\u00a0USD, $747\u00a0million 2005\u00a0USD).[36][30][37][38]"

        "content": "In the days after the storm struck Cuba, the government deployed medical teams to affected regions to provide typhoid vaccine shots. Officials noted the potential for the spread of disease, due to flooding from Camille as well as previously wet conditions.[10] The response after the storm involved many federal, state, and local agencies and volunteer organizations. The main organization for coordinating the federal response to the disaster was the Office of Emergency Preparedness, which provided $76\u00a0million (1969\u00a0USD, $403\u00a0million 2005\u00a0USD)[36] to administer and coordinate disaster relief programs. Food and shelter were available the day after the storm. On August 19, parts of Mississippi and Louisiana were declared major disaster areas and became eligible for federal disaster relief funds.[39] President Richard Nixon ordered 1450 regular troops and 800 United States Army Engineers into the area to bring tons of food, vehicles, and aircraft.[12] Large organizations contributing to the relief effort included the Federal Power Commission, which helped fully return power to affected areas by November 25, 1969. The Coast Guard (then under the Department of Transportation), Air Force, Army, Army Corps of Engineers, Navy Seabees, and Marine Corps all helped with evacuations, search and rescue, clearing debris, and distribution of food. The Department of Defense contributed $34\u00a0million (1969\u00a0USD, $180\u00a0million 2005\u00a0USD)[36] and 16,500\u00a0military troops overall to the recovery. The Department of Health provided \n$4\u00a0million towards medicine, vaccines and other health related needs.[39] On Monday, the Air National Guard and those at Keesler Air Force Base airlifted patients to Jackson and other more inland locations. Volunteers searched for those injured and dead, as well as helping refugees. When many of the evacuees returned by Tuesday, Governor John Bell Williams declared martial law, blocking highways into the area and leading to a 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew. The governor also opened Camp Shelby, dormitories within the University of Southern Mississippi, and the Robert E. Lee Hotel to serve as shelters for those who lost homes. Sections of Bay St. Louis and Pass Christian were evacuated. Survivors were found for days after the storm, with 35 trapped by high water north of Bay St. Louis rescued on Thursday. Army engineers disposed of 25 tons of dead animals, mostly cows, during the week following Camille. One week after the storm, Keesler-based airplanes sprayed malathion at low altitudes to kill the thriving insect population. Martial law would be lifted on August 27. The federal and state military presence would continue for several weeks. During the evening of September 8, President Nixon visited the Biloxi-Gulfport Regional Airport and gave a speech to elevate the spirits of local residents struggling with the storm's aftermath. During the rebuilding process, stricter building codes were enforced by local governments. In 1973, hurricane hunters and their associated reconnaissance aircraft relocated to Keesler Air Force Base when their previous headquarters at Ramey, Puerto Rico, closed.[12] Long-term redevelopment was overseen by the Department of Commerce, which contributed $30\u00a0million (1969\u00a0USD, $159\u00a0million 2005\u00a0USD)[36] towards planned and coordinated redevelopment of affected areas. NOAA Weather Radio was expanded to coastal locations during the 1970s in the wake of Camille based upon recommendations made by the Department of Commerce in September 1969.[40] The devastation of Camille inspired the implementation of the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale. After the storm, many Gulf Coast residents commented that hurricane warnings were not clear enough in conveying the expected intensity of the coming storm. The Saffir\u2013Simpson scale offered a much more concise statement of storm intensity than barometric pressure and wind-speed measurements, and veterans of previous hurricanes could analogize the power of the approaching storm to those they had experienced.[41] In a 1999 report on Hurricane Camille sponsored by the NOAA Coastal Services Center, the authors concluded: \"With Camille, the preparations for the event and the response were based on processes put in place long before the storm made landfall. Coordination between government agencies as well as with state and local officials was enhanced because of preexisting plans.\"[39] Due to the high death toll and major destruction in much of the Southern United States, the name Camille was retired after the 1969 season, and will never again be used for an Atlantic basin tropical cyclone.[42] The name Cindy was selected to replace Camille in 1973.[43] However, the 4\u2011year lists were replaced in 1971 by a new series of lists running though 1980.[44]"

Camille intensified more rapidly than Katrina, and unlike Katrina, Camille re-intensified a second time and maintained status as a Category 5 hurricane until landfall. Both hurricanes shared the common aspect of undergoing periods of rapid intensification.[51] The size of Camille's radius of maximum wind was less than one-third that of Katrina, more similar to the intense but small Hurricane Andrew. Also unlike Katrina, Camille caused little damage in New Orleans, Louisiana, though Camille itself just barely missed the city.[52] The area of hurricane-force winds within Camille was just over two-thirds the size of Hurricane Katrina. Both storms were moving at a similar forward motion at the time of landfall. Although Camille's wind speed at landfall was higher, Katrina's storm surge exceeded Camille's storm surge at all known locations due to its greater size.[53] Both hurricanes' names were retired."

        "content": "In the 1960s, there were four lists of feminine given names used for Atlantic hurricanes, with each list being used every fourth year.[54] The practice of retiring hurricane names was meant to be temporary, with the guideline that a name be retired for ten years. When the name Carla was retired in 1961 it was replaced on the 1965 list with Carol, a name retired in 1954 when its namesake devastated New England. Since over a decade had passed, Carol was eligible for reuse. Carol entered the 1969 list, but scientists from the National Hurricane Research Laboratory (NHRL) asked the naming committee in January 1969 to permanently retire Carol, Edna, and Hazel since papers were still being written about the storms. The committee agreed but needed a replacement \"C\" name. John Hope's daughter Camille was involved in an advanced science and math program in high school and had carried out a required independent research project. John Hope asked Banner Miller to mentor her in her investigation of hurricanes and long-term atmospheric trends. Miller was impressed by her project and suggested her name for the list. \"We kept it quiet for many years,\" Camille said in a circa 2014 interview.[43]"

        "content": " Tropical Storm Debby was a weak but costly tropical cyclone that affected the Lesser Antilles in September\u00a01994. It was the fourth named tropical storm of the 1994 Atlantic hurricane season; it developed on September\u00a09 east of Barbados. Debby made landfall on Saint Lucia early on September\u00a010, producing heavy rainfall and tropical storm-force wind gusts. The rains caused flooding and landslides, damaging about half of the island's banana plantations. Several villages were isolated after roads and bridges were damaged. Damage totaled about $103\u00a0million (1994\u00a0USD). On nearby Dominica, Debby damaged crops and fisheries. While Debby was crossing Saint Lucia, its strongest thunderstorms were located north and east of the center due to wind shear. A station in Martinique reported hurricane-force winds, and about 20,000\u00a0people on the island lost power. After entering the eastern Caribbean Sea, Debby attained peak winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h), although continued wind shear caused the storm to dissipate on September\u00a011. In Puerto Rico, one person died due to high waves. The storm caused power outages and flooding in the Dominican Republic. Throughout its path, Debby killed nine people."

        "content": "The origins of Tropical Storm Debby were from a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa on September 4. By September 6, satellite images indicated a vigorous tropical wave with intense convection about midway between Africa and the Lesser Antilles. Encountering northwesterly vertical wind shear, convection markedly decreased and weakened on the following day, only to redevelop on September\u00a08 after the shear dropped. Post-analysis indicate that the sixth tropical depression of the season developed on September 9 at 1200\u00a0UTC, about 185\u00a0mi (300\u00a0km) east of Barbados;[1] however, it was not operationally classified as Tropical Depression Six until almost 24\u00a0hours later.[2] Early on September 10, satellite imagery indicated a surface circulation just north of Barbados,[1] around which time the National Hurricane Center (NHC) initiated advisories.[2] The increasing organization of the tropical depression prompted a reconnaissance aircraft investigation, which reported flight-level winds of around 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) in an intense rainband northeast of the center. The same flight estimated surface winds of 58\u00a0mph (93\u00a0km/h), which indicated that the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Debby.[1] However, ongoing wind shear removed all thunderstorms from the circulation.[2] At 0300\u00a0UTC on September\u00a010, the storm made landfall on Saint Lucia with winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h).[3] Although Debby was not very well-organized on satellite imagery, stations on Martinique and nearby ships reported that the storm intensified further in the eastern Caribbean Sea to a peak strength of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) at 0600\u00a0UTC.[1][3] Such winds were not known while the storm was active, and around the time of Debby's peak intensity, the NHC operationally estimated winds of only 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h).[4] The storm continued quickly to the west-northwest, affected by strong wind shear while maintaining strong winds.[1] A reconnaissance flight on September\u00a012 did not observe a closed circulation; as a result, it is estimated that Debby dissipated at around 0600\u00a0UTC that day to the south of Puerto Rico. The remnants of Debby continued to the west and diminished over Mexico on September\u00a015, although residual clouds spread into the Gulf of Mexico.[5]"

        "content": "When the first advisory was issued for Debby, the governments of Barbados, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent, and Dominica issued tropical storm warnings.[6] In addition, the Saint Lucia Meteorological Service issued a flood warning before Debby developed.[7] Although the NHC recommended a tropical storm warning to be issued in Martinique, government officials there issued a heavy rain warning instead.[8] Debby first affected Barbados as it passed the island to the north, producing winds of 27\u00a0mph (43\u00a0km/h).[6] In Saint Vincent to the southwest of Barbados, there was minor roof damage. In Dominica to the north, the storm damaged roads and caused power outages.[9] Across Dominica, the combination of winds and heavy rains damaged 2,800\u00a0acres of bananas, 143\u00a0acres of plantains, 355\u00a0acres of root crops, and 355\u00a0acres of tree crops. Damage to crops and fisheries were estimated at EC$30\u00a0million ($12\u00a0million 1994\u00a0USD).[10] After the storm, Windward Islands Crop Insurance (WINCROP) paid 2189\u00a0claims in the country, amounting to EC$1.6\u00a0million ($660,000 1994\u00a0USD).[11] Tropical Storm Debby struck Saint Lucia, and wind gusts on the island reached 46\u00a0mph (74\u00a0km/h) in Vigie.[6] Damage throughout Debby's path was heaviest on this island,[12] and the storm affected most of Saint Lucia. Debby produced heavy rainfall and thunderstorms over a six-hour period, which caused flooding along rivers and in low-lying areas.[7] High rainfall totals wrecked houses on hillsides,[12] forcing about 150\u00a0people to evacuate to shelters.[9] Roadways were washed out or covered by landslides,[12] and 10\u00a0bridges were destroyed or severely damaged.[7] This limited access to villages across the island.[9] Landslides also affected the town of Fond Saint-Jacques. Heavy rains covered Hewanorra International Airport with 2\u00a0in (51\u00a0mm) of silt, and in Anse La Raye, floods reached waist-deep levels.[12] In that town, residents had to be rescued by boat.[13] The storm damaged about half of the banana plantations on the island.[12] Several towns lost access to their water supplies, which prompted the governments of Martinique and Saint Vincent to provide fresh water to the country.[9] Overall, there were 24\u00a0injuries and 4\u00a0deaths across Saint Lucia; all of the deaths were from two landslides.[12] During the storm, nine prisoners escaped the jail in Castries, and there were also reports of looting.[13] In the capital city of Castries, the storm damaged a ward of an evacuated hospital; it had been scheduled for reconstruction, and the effects from Debby provided a new assessment for the rebuilding.[14] Damage on Saint Lucia was estimated at EC$250\u00a0million ($103\u00a0million 1994\u00a0USD).[7] After the storm, WINCROP paid 5,802\u00a0claims for insured crop damage in the country, totaling EC$7.8\u00a0million ($3.2\u00a0million 1994\u00a0USD). As of 2008, Debby was the largest event in WINCROP's 20-year history of insurance claims for disasters.[11] The Saint Lucia government responded to the damage from Debby by repairing damaged buildings and bridges, diversifying crops, and removing silt from major rivers.[15] While Debby was moving across Saint Lucia, a station in Le Vauclin in southeastern Martinique reported 10\u00a0minute sustained winds of 64\u00a0mph (103\u00a0km/h), with a gust to 97\u00a0mph (156\u00a0km/h); the observation provided the basis for Debby's peak intensity.[5] When the storm was active, however, the strongest winds known at the time were a 10-minute wind of 35\u00a0mph (56\u00a0km/h), and a gust of 58\u00a0mph (93\u00a0km/h) at Martinique Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire International Airport.[12] About half of the island experienced 4\u00a0in (100\u00a0mm) of precipitation, and the highest rainfall total on the island was 7.24\u00a0in (184\u00a0mm) in Saint-Joseph.[5] High rains caused flooding across the island,[12] and one woman drowned when a flooded river washed away her car.[13] High winds downed trees and covered some roads, and there was damage to the banana crop. About 20,000\u00a0people lost power during the storm.[12] When Debby was still active, a NASA satellite fired lasers at the storm to measure cloud heights, the first such experiment.[16] As Debby moved into the Caribbean Sea, a tropical storm warning was issued for Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands.[6] High winds spread across Puerto Rico; Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn International Airport reported a peak wind gust of 44\u00a0mph (71\u00a0km/h). The winds downed trees and power lines across the island and caused isolated roof and house damage. High seas entered several coastal homes and prevented ferry passage from Culebra. In Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico, high waves swept away two men fishing from the coast; one was injured and the other was killed.[17] Later, a tropical storm warning was issued for the southern coasts of the Dominican Republic and Haiti.[6] After Debby dissipated, its remnants maintained strong winds, and a station in the Dominican Republic reported a gust of 62\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h) on September\u00a011.[5] The storm downed power lines, leaving hundreds of homes without electricity and contributing to three deaths. An expressway and some rivers also flooded in the country.[12][18]"

[1] This broke the UK's previous July record by 0.5 \u00b0C set in July 1911, although it fell 2.0 \u00b0C short of the 38.5\u00a0\u00b0C (101.3\u00a0\u00b0F) all-time record of the time set in August 2003. Whilst a disputed 42.0\u00a0\u00b0C (107.6\u00a0\u00b0F) was recorded at Wisley Airfield on 18 July, this figure has never been accepted and the figure of 36.5\u00a0\u00b0C (97.7\u00a0\u00b0F) from 19 July is the highest acceptable value. This figure is generally deemed to be erroneous and it has been suggested that the recorded temperature was in fact 32.0\u00a0\u00b0C (89.6\u00a0\u00b0F). Another theory is that the 42.0\u00a0\u00b0C (107.6\u00a0\u00b0F) record on 18 July 2006 was recorded in the sunshine, not in standard 'shaded' areas. In July 2022, another heatwave brought extremely high temperatures to the UK, and on 19 July, the 16th anniversary of the 2006 36.5\u00a0\u00b0C (97.7\u00a0\u00b0F) July record, temperatures in excess of 40.0\u00a0\u00b0C (104.0\u00a0\u00b0F) were officially recorded for the first time in British history, and the highest recorded temperature of 40.3\u00a0\u00b0C (104.5\u00a0\u00b0F) in Coningsby, Lincolnshire is now accepted as the all-time record. Similar temperatures were recorded in the sunshine during a brief heatwave at Wimbledon on 1 July 2015. The heatwave even warmed the normally cool and wet Scottish summer, with Glasgow having a July high of 22.7\u00a0\u00b0C (72.9\u00a0\u00b0F) and low of 13.7\u00a0\u00b0C (56.7\u00a0\u00b0F), which made it the warmest month on record.[2] Because of the northerly location and marine nature, it was not a heat wave in a general sense, but rather unusually warm weather. Drought was an issue in many parts of the United Kingdom after a very dry winter. There was warning of drought occurring from the early months of 2006. Following the dry winter, with extreme temperatures occurring in the country and little rain, increasing strain  was put on water supplies, and hose-pipe bans were issued in many counties. The Environment Agency claimed that the UK may have had the most severe drought in 100 years. Some power cuts occurred, after lightning strikes and some due to large amounts of electricity used by air conditioners. In Central London on 27 July 2006 a series of power cuts hit Piccadilly Circus, Regent Street, Turner Broadcasting UK and Oxford Circus causing the closure of shops and businesses, when pre-existing faults were worsened by heavy demand. The Met Office confirmed that July 2006 was the warmest July, as well as the warmest single month, overall, across the UK, and a number of regional records were also broken.[3] The tarmac on some roads melted in England, requiring application of crushed rock dust.[4][5]"

To put this into context, average daily maxima in Ireland in only vary from 15 to 20\u00a0\u00b0C (59 to 68\u00a0\u00b0F) in June; and 16 to 23\u00a0\u00b0C (61 to 73\u00a0\u00b0F) in July. Despite the high daytime temperatures, night time temperatures were sometimes below average (6 to 11\u00a0\u00b0C (43 to 52\u00a0\u00b0F) in June; 8 to 13\u00a0\u00b0C (46 to 55\u00a0\u00b0F) in July). Grass temperatures as low as \u22122.3\u00a0\u00b0C (27.9\u00a0\u00b0F) were recorded at Birr, County Offaly on 23 June; however, the lowest air temperature recorded was 2.0\u00a0\u00b0C (35.6\u00a0\u00b0F) at Straide, County Mayo on 14 June. The cool night time temperatures are thought to have made the heat wave more bearable there. Sunshine levels were very high all over the country, with 257\u00a0hours (~8.6\u00a0hours a day) of sunshine recorded at Cork Airport, County Cork in June (making it the sunniest June since records began) and 283\u00a0hours (~9.1\u00a0hours a day) of sunshine at Rosslare, County Wexford in July (sunniest July since 1990). The sunniest day during the two months (and indeed, the year) was on 25 June, when Malin Head, County Donegal, recorded 15.8\u00a0hours of sunshine. Rainfall levels were quite low, with only 13.2 millimetres (0.52\u00a0in) of rain at Derrygreenagh, County Offaly and Fermoy, County Cork in June and 13.0 millimetres (0.51\u00a0in) of rain recorded at Merrion Square, Dublin in July. Parts of Munster and Leinster also recorded 21\u00a0days between 28 May and 17 June where no rainfall was recorded. There was also a period between 9 July and 27 July when no rainfall was recorded in Greater Dublin. Despite the low rainfall, drought was not an issue in Ireland. In Ireland, May 2006 was the warmest for 20 years and sunniest since 2000. June 2006 was the sunniest on record, driest since 1995 and also one of the warmest. July 2006 was the warmest on record, sunniest in 15 years and also driest since 1989. August 2006 was average. September 2006 was the warmest on record. October 2006 was the warmest in many places since 2001 and sunniest since 2000. November 2006 was warmer and sunnier than usual. Overall, Summer 2006 (June, July and August) was the sunniest, driest and warmest summer since 1995 and one of the sunniest, driest and warmest on record. Autumn 2006 (September, October, November) was the warmest on record in many places, and sunshine levels were well above normal. Rainfall levels were also above average. The months of June and July 2006 are regarded as one of the best summers ever due to the high levels of sunshine, warm temperatures and low rainfall. Drought and health problems were not an issue in Ireland, unlike many parts of Europe \u2013 mostly because the heat was not as severe there."

The walking people had to walk on open roads without any shade and there was not enough water for everyone. Paramedics had their hands full with hundreds of people who fainted due to the heat. The walking people had to deal with temperatures in the sun of 42\u00a0\u00b0C (108\u00a0\u00b0F). The air-temperatures on the first day of the four-day march was about 36\u00a0\u00b0C (97\u00a0\u00b0F). Forecasts showed even higher temperatures of 37\u00a0\u00b0C (99\u00a0\u00b0F) for the next day, causing the organisation to cancel the remainder of the event. Vierdaagse The highest temperature was recorded on 19 July, when temperatures reached the mid- to upper 30s\u00a0\u00b0C (mid- to upper 90s\u00a0\u00b0F) for most of the country, especially in the south-east. The all-time record for the month of July was broken. Temperatures soared to 37.2\u00a0\u00b0C (99.0\u00a0\u00b0F). A few hundred meters across the border into Germany, at the weather station Kalkar, located at the airport in Weeze, near Nijmegen, a maximum of 38.6\u00a0\u00b0C (101.5\u00a0\u00b0F) was recorded on 19 July.

The average daytime temperature for the month was 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F) again in the south-east of the Netherlands. The lowest daytime temperature was at some locations 34.1\u00a0\u00b0C (93.4\u00a0\u00b0F) for the whole month of July. For two days the daytime temperatures were below 25\u00a0\u00b0C (77\u00a0\u00b0F), making 29\u00a0days with temperatures of 25\u00a0\u00b0C (77\u00a0\u00b0F) and higher. During days when temperatures reached 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F) or higher, and on days without wind, the smog level was very high. Warnings were broadcast on television and radio, advising people to stay indoors as much as possible because the air pollution was very unhealthy, the smog was very strong and it was dangerously hot. The Netherlands also had to deal with extreme drought in June and July. The rainfall in June was at some locations as low as 0.5 centimetres (0.20\u00a0in), July was also extremely dry. Because of the extreme heat and drought vegetation was very dry, and the humidity levels were very low, causing brushfires. On 30 January 2007, the United Nations published a report of all countries in the world with the most deaths related to natural disasters for 2006. The Netherlands appeared fourth place, with 1,000 heat-related deaths.\nOn 19 July, the temperature reached 37.1\u00b0C in Westdorpe."

This increase in water temperature led to faster evaporation of ocean waters, making August one of the cloudiest and wettest months in recorded history in various western European countries. Many weather experts report this to be a direct consequence of the heat wave, as the high evaporation rate caused the atmosphere to generate many low pressure areas. Despite this, September 2006 was again the warmest September on record, in the UK and elsewhere, due to high ocean temperatures, altered atmospheric pressure zones, and consequent different wind directions over Europe. The pressure zone changes were a consequence of the extra-tropical remnants of Atlantic hurricanes settling over the British Isles.

With temperatures from the north of the Netherlands to the south of Belgium ranging between 16 and 18\u00a0\u00b0C (61 and 64\u00a0\u00b0F) at the end of November, previous records were shattered.

Such a sequence of events is unheard of in the Netherlands meteorological history, estimated to happen every 8,000 years when not taking global warming into account. It's been a result of a unique mixture of the hot summer increasing marine temperatures and Northern Atlantic hurricanes settling as depressions off the coast of Scotland, giving the European continent a constant stream of southern, fast winds rendering it unable to cool down from the Mediterranean through to northern Europe."

Early September brought gusty winds in Poland, near Bydgoszcz in Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship tornado passed, which escaped with the roots of several hundred trees. October 2006 is also inscribed as one of the warmer in the history of meteorological measurements, as well as very dry. For many days the temperature exceeded 20\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00b0F) degrees, reaching up to 26\u00a0\u00b0C (79\u00a0\u00b0F) at the south of the country. It was also very sunny month, because reported about 150 sunshine hours. November 2006 in Poland was the warmest from 10 years. The daily temperature reached up to 20\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00b0F) and at night rarely dropped below 0\u00a0\u00b0C (32\u00a0\u00b0F). November was very wet, usually dropped 100 millimetres (3.9\u00a0in) of water, and the standard is approximately 40 millimetres (1.6\u00a0in). Like in October the wind was blowing strongly, particularly on the coast of the Baltic Sea. At the end of the month, thick fog blocked airports in Warsaw, Krak\u00f3w and Wroc\u0142aw to 3 days. Winter 2006/2007 was extremely warm and rainy, in many cities, the snow lay only a few days, and rain fell for MANY days. At night the temperature increased up to 14\u00a0\u00b0C (57\u00a0\u00b0F) degrees, which at this time of year, it was an unprecedented phenomenon. In January 2007, the maximum temperature increased to 20\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00b0F), especially in the south, where often blow halny \u2013 a foehn wind, and in Elblag during the day 13\u00a0\u00b0C (55\u00a0\u00b0F), and at night 10\u00a0\u00b0C (50\u00a0\u00b0F). The average temperature in winter 2006/2007 in eastern Poland was about 2.5\u00a0\u00b0C (36.5\u00a0\u00b0F), normally \u22122.5\u00a0\u00b0C (27.5\u00a0\u00b0F) and in western Poland 4.5\u00a0\u00b0C (40.1\u00a0\u00b0F), normally 1\u00a0\u00b0C (34\u00a0\u00b0F). This conclusion was the warmest winter since the measurements. In March 2007, in Elblag this month was snow-less, but it rained and the temperature reached up to 17\u00a0\u00b0C (63\u00a0\u00b0F), and at night of 22nd of March 8\u00a0\u00b0C (46\u00a0\u00b0F). Summer 2007 was not that dry. It rained a lot, temperatures reached down to \u22121\u00a0\u00b0C (30\u00a0\u00b0F) in the Polish-Czech/Tatra hills, temps reached up to 35\u00a0\u00b0C (95\u00a0\u00b0F), but it lasted for only 2-3 days, and temperature fell down."

The 19th named storm and final hurricane of the above-average 1987 Pacific hurricane season, Ramon originated from a tropical disturbance that formed in early October. On October\u00a05, a tropical storm had developed several hundred miles southwest of Manzanillo, bypassing the tropical depression stage. Tropical Storm Ramon turned to the west-northwest after initially moving west. It intensified into a hurricane on October\u00a07. Two days later, Hurricane Ramon peaked in intensity with winds of 140\u00a0mph (220\u00a0km/h). After peaking, Ramon turned to the northwest and rapidly weakened over cooler waters. It weakened into a tropical storm on October\u00a011 and a depression on October\u00a012. Ramon dissipated shortly thereafter. While at sea, Ramon brought light rainfall to the Baja California Peninsula. The remnants of Hurricane Ramon produced heavy rainfall that caused flooding in California, indirectly contributing to five traffic-related fatalities. Rainfall was reported as far inland as Utah."

The disturbance became better organized while traversing 84\u00a0\u00b0F (29\u00a0\u00b0C) waters and at 1800\u00a0UTC on October\u00a05, the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center (EPHC) upgraded the disturbance into a tropical storm while centered about 575\u00a0mi (925\u00a0km) southwest of Acapulco.[1] Initially, the storm was expected to move west and not affect land; however, this did not occur.[2] After being named, Tropical Storm Ramon held onto marginal tropical storm intensity for 24 hours. Thereafter, Tropical Storm Ramon turned west-northwestward and began to intensity. At 1200\u00a0UTC on October\u00a07, the EPHC reported that Ramon had intensified into a hurricane. About 24 hours later, the system was upgraded into a Category\u00a02 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (SSHWS). Rapidly intensifying, Ramon reached major hurricane status on October\u00a08 (Category 3 or higher on the SSHWS). At 0600\u00a0UTC on October\u00a09, Ramon was upgraded into a Category\u00a04 hurricane[3] while reaching its peak intensity of 140\u00a0mph (220\u00a0km/h),[1] which it maintained for 24\u00a0hours.[3] After attaining peak intensity, Hurricane Ramon began to weaken. Late on October\u00a010, Ramon weakened slightly while turning northwest. The following morning, the storm reportedly weakened into a Category 2.[3] Hurricane Ramon began to rapidly deteriorate due to a combination of jetstream interactions and increasingly cold sea-surface temperatures.[1] At 0600\u00a0UTC on October\u00a011, the storm was downgraded into a Category\u00a01 on the SSHWS after bypassing the Category\u00a02 stage. It weakened into a tropical storm later that day and was further downgraded to a tropical depression on October\u00a012. Tropical Depression Ramon dissipated on 0600\u00a0UTC that day.[3] The remnant moisture of this hurricane later moved into Southern California, resulting in record rains.[1]"

Tracking west-northwestward, the depression intensified into a tropical storm over the central Philippines before entering the South China Sea. Once over the warm waters of the sea, the system quickly intensified, attaining its peak 10-minute winds of 110\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph) and 1-minute winds of 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph).

Low wind shear and weak diffluence allowed the system to gradually become organized; however, the following day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) ceased monitoring the system for potential development. By June\u00a07, convection redeveloped around the low and the JTWC resumed monitoring the low; later in the day, the Japan Meteorological Agency JMA, the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center for the western Pacific basin, classified it as a tropical depression. The same day, the depression entered the Area of Responsibility (AoR) of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration and was given the local name Gener.[1] On June\u00a08, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the system as they anticipated it to develop into a tropical storm within 24\u00a0hours.[1] At 0000\u00a0UTC on June\u00a09, the JTWC designated the depression as Tropical Storm 08W while located about 795\u00a0km (495\u00a0mi) southeast of Manila, Philippines.[2] Several hours later, the storm made landfall on southern Leyte Island with winds of 55\u00a0km/h (35\u00a0mph 10-minute winds) according to the JMA and 75\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph 1-minute winds) according to the JTWC. Rapidly tracking towards the west-northwest in response to a subtropical ridge to the north, the storm traversed the Philippine islands by June\u00a010.[1] Late on June\u00a010, the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm, at which time it received the name Chanthu; the name was contributed by Cambodia and is a type of flower. Not long after being named, convection associated with the storm became displaced from the center of circulation, leaving the low pressure center partially exposed. As Chanthu neared Vietnam, it tracked over warm sea surface temperatures in the South China Sea, allowing the storm to quickly intensify. Outflow from the storm improved on June\u00a011 and deep convection developed around the center of circulation. During a 12-hour span late on June\u00a011 through early on June\u00a012, the central barometric pressure of Chanthu dropped 15\u00a0hPa (mbar), falling to 975\u00a0hPa (mbar).[1] The maximum sustained winds also rose at this time; the JMA assessed the storm to have peaked with winds of 110\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph 10-minute winds) as a severe tropical storm; however, the JTWC assessed Chanthu to have peaked as a Category 1 typhoon on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale with winds of 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph 1-minute winds). Chanthu made landfall around 1200\u00a0UTC on June\u00a012 near Qui Nh\u01a1n, Vietnam, at this intensity. Due to the interaction with land, the storm rapidly weakened, with the JMA classifying it as a tropical depression early on June\u00a013. The remnants of the storm persisted over Cambodia until June\u00a015 at which time it dissipated.[1]"

Drought often has large impacts on the ecosystems and agriculture of affected regions, and causes harm to the local economy.[2][3] Annual dry seasons in the tropics significantly increase the chances of a drought developing, with subsequent increased wildfire risks.[4] Heat waves can significantly worsen drought conditions by increasing evapotranspiration.[5] This dries out forests and other vegetation, and increases the amount of fuel for wildfires.[4][6] Drought is a recurring feature of the climate in most parts of the world, becoming more extreme and less predictable due to climate change, which dendrochronological studies date back to 1900. There are three kinds of drought effects, environmental, economic and social. Environmental effects include the drying of wetlands, more and larger wildfires, loss of biodiversity. Economic impacts include disruption of water supplies for people, less agricultural productivity and therefore more expensive food production. Another impact is shortages of water for irrigation or hydropower. Social and health costs include the negative effect on the health of people directly exposed to this phenomenon (excessive heat waves), high food costs, stress caused by failed harvests, water scarcity, etc. Prolonged droughts have caused mass migrations and humanitarian crisis.[7][8] Examples for regions with increased drought risks are the Amazon basin, Australia, the Sahel region and India. For example, in 2005, parts of the Amazon basin experienced the worst drought in 100 years.[9][10] Australia could experience more severe droughts and they could become more frequent in the future, a government-commissioned report said on July 6, 2008.[11] The long Australian Millennial drought broke in 2010. The 2020\u20132022 Horn of Africa drought has surpassed the horrific drought in 2010\u20132011 in both duration and severity.[12][13] More than 150 districts in India are drought vulnerable, mostly concentrated in the state of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and its adjoining Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh, northern Karnataka and adjoining Maharashtra of the country.[14] Throughout history, humans have usually viewed droughts as disasters due to the impact on food availability and the rest of society. People have viewed drought as a natural disaster or as something influenced by human activity, or as a result of supernatural forces."

The National Weather Service office of the NOAA defines drought as \"a deficiency of moisture that results in adverse impacts on people, animals, or vegetation over a sizeable area\".[15] Drought is a complex phenomenon \u2212 relating to the absence of water \u2212 which is difficult to monitor and define.[16] By the early 1980s, over 150 definitions of \"drought\" had already been published.[17] The range of definitions reflects differences in regions, needs, and disciplinary approaches."

An agricultural or ecological drought is causing plant stress from a combination of evaporation and low soil moisture.[1]:\u200a1157\u200a Some organizations add another category: socioeconomic drought occurs when the demand for an economic good exceeds supply as a result of a weather-related shortfall in water supply.[16][17] The socioeconomic drought is a similar concept to water scarcity.

This supports the development of site-specific adaptation measures.[22] The application of multiple indices using different datasets helps to better manage and monitor droughts than using a single dataset, This is particularly the case in regions of the world where not enough data is available such as Africa and South America. Using a single dataset can be limiting, as it may not capture the full spectrum of drought characteristics and impacts.[22] Careful monitoring of moisture levels can also help predict increased risk for wildfires."

Droughts occur mainly in areas where normal levels of rainfall are, in themselves, low. If these factors do not support precipitation volumes sufficiently to reach the surface over a sufficient time, the result is a drought. Drought can be triggered by a high level of reflected sunlight and above average prevalence of high pressure systems, winds carrying continental, rather than oceanic air masses, and ridges of high pressure areas aloft can prevent or restrict the developing of thunderstorm activity or rainfall over one certain region. Once a region is within drought, feedback mechanisms such as local arid air,[31] hot conditions which can promote warm core ridging,[32] and minimal evapotranspiration can worsen drought conditions."

Because of the lack of these watering holes, many grazing animals are forced to migrate due to the lack of water in search of more fertile lands. Examples of such animals are zebras, elephants, and wildebeest. Because of the lack of water in the plants, bushfires are common.[35] Since water vapor becomes more energetic with increasing temperature, more water vapor is required to increase relative humidity values to 100% at higher temperatures (or to get the temperature to fall to the dew point).[36] Periods of warmth quicken the pace of fruit and vegetable production,[37] increase evaporation and transpiration from plants,[38] and worsen drought conditions.[39]"

ENSO comprises two patterns of temperature anomalies in the central Pacific Ocean, known as La Ni\u00f1a and El Ni\u00f1o. La Ni\u00f1a events are generally associated with drier and hotter conditions and further exacerbation of drought in California and the Southwestern United States, and to some extent the U.S. Southeast. Meteorological scientists have observed that La Ni\u00f1as have become more frequent over time.[40] Conversely, during El Ni\u00f1o events, drier and hotter weather occurs in parts of the Amazon River Basin, Colombia, and Central America. Winters during the El Ni\u00f1o are warmer and drier than average conditions in the Northwest, northern Midwest, and northern Mideast United States, so those regions experience reduced snowfalls. Conditions are also drier than normal from December to February in south-central Africa, mainly in Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and Botswana. Direct effects of El Ni\u00f1o resulting in drier conditions occur in parts of Southeast Asia and Northern Australia, increasing bush fires, worsening haze, and decreasing air quality dramatically. Drier-than-normal conditions are also in general observed in Queensland, inland Victoria, inland New South Wales, and eastern Tasmania from June to August. As warm water spreads from the west Pacific and the Indian Ocean to the east Pacific, it causes extensive drought in the western Pacific.

In addition, increased climate variability has increased the frequency and severity of drought events. Moreover, the occurrence and impact of droughts are aggravated by anthropogenic activities such as land use change and water management and demand.[22] The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report also pointed out that \"Warming over land drives an increase in atmospheric evaporative demand and in the severity of drought events\"[43]:\u200a1057\u200a and \"Increased atmospheric evaporative demand increases plant water stress, leading to agricultural and ecological drought\".[44]:\u200a578 There is a rise of compound warm-season droughts in Europe that are concurrent with an increase in potential evapotranspiration.[45] Higher temperatures increase evaporation. This dries the soil and increases plant stress. Agriculture suffers as a result. This means even regions where overall rainfall is expected to remain relatively stable will experience these impacts.[48]:\u200a1157\u200a These regions include central and northern Europe. Without climate change mitigation, around one third of land areas are likely to experience moderate or more severe drought by 2100.[48]:\u200a1157\u200a Due to global warming droughts are more frequent and intense than in the past.[49]"

The wind can cause small particles to be lifted and therefore moved to another region (deflation). Suspended particles within the wind may impact on solid objects causing erosion by abrasion (ecological succession). Wind erosion generally occurs in areas with little or no vegetation, often in areas where there is insufficient rainfall to support vegetation.[55]"

        "content": "Droughts can cause land degradation and loss of soil moisture, resulting in the destruction of cropland productivity.[64] This can result in diminished crop growth or yield productions and carrying capacity for livestock. Drought in combination with high levels of grazing pressure can function as the tipping point for an ecosystem, causing woody encroachment.[65] Water stress affects plant development and quality in a variety of ways: firstly drought can cause poor germination and impaired seedling development.[66] At the same time plant growth relies on cellular division, cell enlargement, and differentiation. Drought stress impairs mitosis and cell elongation via loss of turgor pressure which results in poor growth.[67] Development of leaves is also dependent upon turgor pressure, concentration of nutrients, and carbon assimilates[clarification needed] all of which are reduced by drought conditions, thus drought stress lead to a decrease in leaf size and number.[67] Plant height, biomass, leaf size and stem girth has been shown to decrease in maize under water limiting conditions.[67] Crop yield is also negatively effected by drought stress, the reduction in crop yield results from a decrease in photosynthetic rate, changes in leaf development, and altered allocation of resources all due to drought stress.[67] Crop plants exposed to drought stress suffer from reductions in leaf water potential and transpiration rate. Water-use efficiency increases in crops such as wheat while decreasing in others, such as potatoes.[68][69][67] Plants need water for the uptake of nutrients from the soil, and for the transport of nutrients throughout the plant: drought conditions limit these functions leading to stunted growth. Drought stress also causes a decrease in photosynthetic activity in plants due to the reduction of photosynthetic tissues, stomatal closure, and reduced performance of photosynthetic machinery. This reduction in photosynthetic activity contributes to the reduction in plant growth and yields.[67] Another factor influencing reduced plant growth and yields include the allocation of resources; following drought stress plants will allocate more resources to roots to aid in water uptake increasing root growth and reducing the growth of other plant parts while decreasing yields.[67]"

Droughts can also cause limitations of water supplies, increased water pollution levels, high food-costs, stress caused by failed harvests, water scarcity, etc. Reduced water quality can occur because lower water-flows reduce dilution of pollutants and increase contamination of remaining water sources.[70][71] This explains why droughts and water scarcity operate as a factor which increases the gap between developed and developing countries.[72] Effects vary according to vulnerability. For example, subsistence farmers are more likely to migrate during drought because they do not have alternative food-sources. Areas with populations that depend on water sources as a major food-source are more vulnerable to famine. Further examples of social and health consequences include:"

For example, in the Great Plains, it is estimated that soil loss due to wind erosion can be as much as 6100 times greater in drought years than in wet years.[75] Loess is a homogeneous, typically nonstratified, porous, friable, slightly coherent, often calcareous, fine-grained, silty, pale yellow or buff, windblown (Aeolian) sediment.[76] It generally occurs as a widespread blanket deposit that covers areas of hundreds of square kilometers and tens of meters thick. Loess often stands in either steep or vertical faces.[77] Loess tends to develop into highly rich soils. Under appropriate climatic conditions, areas with loess are among the most agriculturally productive in the world.[78] Loess deposits are geologically unstable by nature, and will erode very readily. Therefore, windbreaks (such as big trees and bushes) are often planted by farmers to reduce the wind erosion of loess.[54]"

A 2005 study by Australian and American researchers investigated the desertification of the interior, and suggested that one explanation was related to human settlers who arrived about 50,000 years ago. Regular burning by these settlers could have prevented monsoons from reaching interior Australia.[82] In June 2008 it became known that an expert panel had warned of long term, maybe irreversible, severe ecological damage for the whole Murray-Darling basin if it did not receive sufficient water by October 2008.[83] Australia could experience more severe droughts and they could become more frequent in the future, a government-commissioned report said on July 6, 2008.[11] Australian environmentalist Tim Flannery, predicted that unless it made drastic changes, Perth in Western Australia could become the world's first ghost metropolis, an abandoned city with no more water to sustain its population.[84] The long Australian Millennial drought broke in 2010."

Drought is among the earliest documented climatic events, present in the Epic of Gilgamesh and tied to the Biblical story of Joseph's arrival in and the later Exodus from ancient Egypt.[102] Hunter-gatherer migrations in 9,500 BC Chile have been linked to the phenomenon,[103] as has the exodus of early humans out of Africa and into the rest of the world around 135,000 years ago.[104] Droughts can be scientifically explained in terms of physical mechanisms, which underlie natural disasters and are influenced by human impact on the environment.[105]\nBeliefs about drought are further shaped by cultural factors including local knowledge, perceptions, values, beliefs and religion. In some places and times, droughts have been interpreted as the work of supernatural forces.[106] Globally, people in many societies have been more likely to explain natural events like drought, famine and disease in terms of the supernatural than they are to explain social phenomena like war, murder, and theft.[107][108] Historically, rituals have been used in an attempt to prevent or avert drought. Rainmaking rituals have ranged from dances to scapegoating to human sacrifices. Many ancient practices are now a matter of folklore while others may still be practiced.[109] In areas where people have limited understanding of the scientific basis of drought, beliefs about drought continue to reflect indigenous beliefs in the power of spirits and Christian philosophies that see drought as a divine punishment. Such beliefs can influence people's thinking and affect their resilience and ability to adapt to stress and respond to crises.[106] In the case of Creationism, curricula sometimes give religious explanations of natural phenomena rather than scientific ones. Teaching explicitly denies evolution, that human agency is affecting climate, and that climate change is occurring.[110] Some historical droughts include:"

        "content": " The 2009 southeastern Australia heat wave was a heat wave that commenced in late January and led to record-breaking prolonged high temperatures in the region. The heat wave is considered one of the, if not the, most extreme in the region's history.[2] During the heat wave, fifty separate locations set various records for consecutive, highest daytime and overnight temperatures. The highest temperature recorded during the heat wave was 48.8\u00a0\u00b0C (119.8\u00a0\u00b0F) in Hopetoun, Victoria, a record for the state.[3] Many locations through the region recorded all-time high temperatures including capital cities Adelaide, which reached its third-highest temperature, 45.7\u00a0\u00b0C (114.3\u00a0\u00b0F), and Melbourne, which recorded its highest-ever temperature on record, 46.4\u00a0\u00b0C (115.5\u00a0\u00b0F). Both cities broke records for the most consecutive days over 40\u00a0\u00b0C (104\u00a0\u00b0F), while Mildura, Victoria recorded an all-time record twelve consecutive days over 43\u00a0\u00b0C (109\u00a0\u00b0F). The exceptional heat wave was caused by a slow-moving high-pressure system that settled over the Tasman Sea, with a combination of an intense tropical low located off the North West Australian coast and a monsoon trough over Northern Australia, which produced ideal conditions for hot tropical air to be directed down over southeastern Australia.[3] The heat began in South Australia on 25 January but became more widespread over southeast Australia by 27 January. A weak cool change moved over the southern coastal areas bringing some relief on 30 January,[3] including Melbourne, where the change arrived that evening, dropping temperatures to an average of 30.8\u00a0\u00b0C (87.4\u00a0\u00b0F). Higher temperatures returned on the following weekend with Melbourne recording its hottest day since records began in 1855, 46.4\u00a0\u00b0C (115.5\u00a0\u00b0F).[4] The heat wave generated extreme fire conditions during the peak of the 2008\u201309 Australian bushfire season, causing many bushfires in the affected region, contributing to the extreme bushfire conditions on 7 February, also known as the Black Saturday bushfires, which claimed 173 lives in Victoria.[5]"

During the heat wave, however, many of these regions experienced temperatures over 40\u00a0\u00b0C (104\u00a0\u00b0F) for twice as long or more, on average, than is normal for that time of year. Coastal regions and the ACT experienced slightly lower temperatures; however, these were still above average and lasted for a prolonged period. While coastal regions may have experienced shorter periods of heat wave, for the time that they did experience temperatures over 35\u00a0\u00b0C (95\u00a0\u00b0F), they mostly reached the top 3, top 5 or top 10 all-time temperature records for a number of days.

Hundreds were treated for heat-related illness and 6 fatalities were confirmed, and a number of \"sudden deaths\" were suspected to be caused by the heat. Authorities worked through each case to determine exactly how many fatalities were directly attributable to the heat wave.[47] Commercial news sources vary widely at the number of fatalities, some report only 2 deaths, while others speculate that the toll may ultimately be higher. Fifty-seven deaths were suspected to have occurred in South Australia and 33 in Victoria,[47] however authorities preferred to wait for coronial reports before confirming how many were directly attributable to the heat wave.[48] The Victorian state coroner announced a tripling of dead bodies being placed in the state mortuary during the heat wave, filling the morgue to capacity. Hospitals and funeral homes were relied upon to provide temporary storage of corpses, even before the deaths associated with the Black Saturday bushfires created additional demand for mortuary space.[49] Throughout the heat wave, thousands of people, many of them elderly, were confirmed to have been treated by ambulance officers and placed in hospitals for heat-related illnesses in Victoria and South Australia. Ambulance Victoria reported a 70% increase in emergency calls during the week.[43] It is estimated that around 2,000 people across Victoria and South Australia were treated for heat stroke and other effects of the heat wave. According to a Monash University study of funeral notices, more than 200 people died as a result of the heat wave. A 45% increase in the death rate was noted during the time.[50] A subsequent report by Victoria's chief health officer, Dr John Carnie, put the final figure at 374.[1]"

This behaviour is highly unusual as the animals do not normally drink water and are naturally shy of people.[51] In Melbourne, a city where most trees are non-native, notably the plane trees that line many inner and middle suburban streets, deciduous trees began shedding their leaves by early February, creating the appearance of an early autumn.[52] Water restrictions meant many trees and plants were already stressed, and some street trees and trees in parks where councils had not arranged special watering, died, or suffered die back, as did trees and plants in private gardens."

Situated within a region of low to moderate wind shear and weak outflow, slow development ensued.[1] By June\u00a013, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the disturbance as a tropical depression.[2] A monsoonal system, the depression featured an extensive circulation with the strongest winds well away from the center, contrary to most tropical cyclones. A scatterometer pass revealed winds up to 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph) within a banding feature to the east of the storm's center by the evening of June\u00a013.[3] In accordance with this, the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm 1407 and assigned the name Hagibis to the cyclone.[4] Despite the presence of gale-force winds, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) deemed the system to be below storm intensity and only issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert early on June\u00a014, indicating that it was likely to become a tropical cyclone within 24\u00a0hours.[5] Thereafter, the tropical storm-force winds contracted to within 130\u00a0km (80\u00a0mi) of the center, indicative of a more tropical than monsoonal system. As such, the JTWC initiated advisories on the system as Tropical Storm 07W.[6] Early on June 15, Hagibis made landfall over southern China, and it subsequently weakened to a tropical depression.[7] On the morning of June 16, both agencies issued their final warnings on Hagibis as it weakened further to a land depression. Its remnants still continued to move northward, but by June 17, the remnants of Hagibis curved eastwards due to the jet stream. Later that day, the remnants entered moved back over warm waters, and accompanied by low vertical wind shear, and the storm re-intensified. The JMA upgraded Hagibis to a tropical storm once again, and both the JTWC and the JMA re-initiated advisories on the system. Early on June 18, Hagibis transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, and its circulation was absorbed by a developing extratropical storm to the north on June 21. The system moved out of the basin early on June 23.[8]"

        "content": "Tropical Storm Emily was a weak Atlantic tropical cyclone that brought torrential rains to much of the northern Caribbean in 2011. The fifth named storm of the annual hurricane season, Emily developed from a strong but poorly organized tropical wave that traversed the open Atlantic over the last week July. On August\u00a01, it approached the Lesser Antilles and became more consolidated, producing inclement weather over many of the northern islands. Two days later, the disturbance\u2019s wind flow became more cyclonic with a defined center of circulation, which marked the formation of Tropical Storm Emily. The storm remained fairly irregular in structure, though generating strong thunderstorms and gusty winds along its path over the Caribbean Sea. On August\u00a04, Emily was declassified as a tropical cyclone after the mountainous areas of Hispaniola further disrupted its diffuse circulation. Upon exiting the northeastern Caribbean on August\u00a06, its remnants briefly regenerated into a tropical storm before dissipating completely the next day. Despite the erratic structure of its wind flow, Emily brought severe weather to many Caribbean nations. Gusty winds felled trees and heavy rains caused widespread flooding throughout the Lesser Antilles. The most significant damage was confined to Martinique, where one death occurred. In Puerto Rico, flash floods affected residences and roads, leaving behind US$5\u00a0million in infrastructural damage. Even after Emily\u2019s dissipation, its remnants continued to produce prolonged rainfall over much of Hispaniola. Floods and mudslides in the Dominican Republic displaced over 7,000 residents and caused three people to drown in the capital of Santo Domingo. In neighboring Haiti, hundreds of houses were inundated in the department of Artibonite, forcing their inhabitants to evacuate. Minor wind damage occurred throughout the country's southern peninsula, and one person died in that region."

        "content": "The cyclogenesis of Tropical Storm Emily was complicated, extending over several days from late July into early August. An easterly tropical wave\u2014an equatorward trough of low pressure\u2014exited the west African coast in the fourth week of July, at which point it became largely embedded within the monsoon trough.[2] Located to the south of a ridge of high pressure, the wave moved west-northwestward across the open Atlantic; it retained a broad circulation with little to no precipitation for a day or two.[1][3] Over time, clusters of convection increased around the broad system, and it developed two distinct centers of circulation on July\u00a030.[1][4][5] During the morning of July 31, the large low markedly gained in organization, and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) noted it was close to becoming a tropical depression.[6] Later that day, however, the main circulation became increasingly elongated; its westernmost component soon detached to form a separate tropical wave.[7] This new disturbance featured widely scattered convection and rainbands, which briefly affected the Lesser Antilles.[8] The next day, a new area of deep convection with a dominant center formed as the circulation became better defined. It passed through the Leeward Islands with some improvement in its structure, and the surface winds rose to near tropical storm force.[1][9] A reconnaissance flight into the system revealed the circulation center had become well defined near the deep convection. The system was upgraded to tropical storm status and given the name Emily at 0000\u00a0UTC on August\u00a02, when it was located to the south of Dominica. During the initial stages of its existence, the storm accelerated toward the west-northwest in response to the strong high pressure to its north.[1][10] With a relatively dry environment along its projected path, Emily was expected to strengthen only gradually until its predicted passage through the Greater Antilles.[11] For several hours into August\u00a02, the cyclone fluctuated little in intensity and organization as it developed banding features.[12] Emily's appearance later improved on satellite images, and it developed a ragged central dense overcast; the NHC estimated that the storm had reached its peak sustained winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) by 0000\u00a0UTC on August\u00a03.[1] Nevertheless, reconnaissance revealed that its circulation remained poorly organized, and at the time, several forecast models even supported dissipation prior to landfall in Hispaniola.[13] An increase in upper wind shear removed the deepest convection from the circulation center, and it would remain so for the rest of the storm's duration.[14][15] On August\u00a04, the cloud pattern and convective banding became better organized near the center as the upper outflow over the cyclone expanded.[16] Emily proceeded to track just south of the Dominican Republic,[17] where its weak circulation became increasingly disrupted due to the adjacent high terrain and increasing vertical wind shear. The cyclone accelerated over Hispaniola and degenerated into an open trough around 2100\u00a0UTC that day.[1][18] The remnant trough proceeded northwestward into the Bahamas, where the NHC assessed a high chance of redevelopment based on relenting upper wind shear.[19] Over the next couple of days, it moved over the Bahamas and proceeded east of southern Florida. Late on August\u00a06, the trough developed a new center of circulation and regenerated into a weak tropical depression by 1800\u00a0UTC near Grand Bahama. Emily briefly reattained tropical storm strength six hours later, although it once again dissipated to a remnant low the next day owing to increasing wind shear.[20] The low took on an accelerated east-northeastward motion, bypassing Bermuda before heading eastward over the open Atlantic. It briefly retained a broad area of gale-force winds with deep convection, which prompted the NHC to remonitor the system.[1][21] The combination of strong wind shear and its rapid forward speed inhibited significant development, and the remnant dissipated around 1200\u00a0UTC on August\u00a011, about 980\u00a0mi (1,565\u00a0km) west of the Azores.[1]"

Due to the lack of sturdy structure to ride out a storm, fears arose over how they would fare with a tropical cyclone passing through the country. Emergency officials in the country set aside 22 large buses to evacuate thousands of people at the risk of flooding. Additionally, residents were urged to conserve food and safeguard their belongings. The United Nations placed 11,500 troops in the country on standby to assist in recovery efforts should they be necessitated. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies also put emergency teams on standby to deliver food support in addition to the 125,000 people already assisted.[24] In advance of the storm, authorities closed all airports and landing sites in country.[29]"

Around four days later the system entered the Caribbean Sea, passing over the San Andres islands on June\u00a012.[1] The area of convection, or thunderstorms, spread across Central America. A surface circulation developed offshore El Salvador,[2] and the system formed into a tropical depression on June\u00a014.[3] For much of the summer of 1971, a large pool of anomalously warm water temperatures extended from Central America to the Gulf of California off the Mexican coast, reaching 89.6\u00a0\u00b0F (32\u00a0\u00b0C). This allowed for steady intensification as it tracked through the Gulf of Tehuantepec.[2] Early on June\u00a015, a ship reported winds of 40\u00a0mph (65\u00a0km/h) and 13\u00a0ft (4.0\u00a0m) seas, which prompted the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center (EPHC) to upgrade the depression to Tropical Storm Bridget. The storm maintained a general northwest track toward the southwest Mexican coastline. It gradually intensified, and satellite images late on June\u00a016 indicated that Bridget attained hurricane status about 55\u00a0mi (95\u00a0km) southwest of Puerto \u00c1ngel, Oaxaca.[2] It quickly intensified as it neared the coast, reaching winds of 100\u00a0mph (155\u00a0km/h) just southwest of the Acapulco coastline before weakening.[3] Bridget paralleled the Mexican coastline just offshore before making landfall at 1200\u00a0UTC on June\u00a017, about 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km) southeast of Manzanillo, Colima. The hurricane rapidly weakened over the mountainous terrain, emerging into the Pacific Ocean as a tropical depression after being over land for only a few hours.[2] Bridget turned westward as a weak tropical cyclone, eventually dissipating on June\u00a020 to the south of the Baja California peninsula.[3]"

The sixth named storm and fourth hurricane of the season, Francelia developed from a tropical wave in the southeastern Caribbean Sea on August\u00a029. It moved west-northwestward and strengthened into a tropical storm on the following day. On September\u00a01, Francelia reached hurricane status, shortly before re-curving west-southwest. While approaching Central America, the storm intensified and peaked as a 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) Category\u00a02 hurricane on September\u00a02. Francelia weakened slightly before making landfall near Punta Gorda, Belize (then British Honduras)[nb 1] late on September\u00a03. The storm quickly weakened inland and dissipated by the following day. During its early stages, Francelia brought gusty winds and light rainfall to several islands in the Caribbean Sea. While remaining nearly stationary offshore Central America, heavy precipitation fell in some countries, especially Guatemala where severe flooding killed 269\u00a0people and caused $15\u00a0million in damage.[nb 2] In neighboring Honduras, the hurricane struck after the undeclared Football War, causing additional damage in the northern portions of the country. Damage in Honduras was heaviest on the offshore Bay Islands, and the hurricane damaged or destroyed the majority of two towns there. In El Salvador, flooding isolated towns for several days and caused crop damage. Several rivers in the region flooded, with the Belize River reaching 36 feet (11\u00a0m) above normal. Coastal areas of Belize lost electricity and telephone service, and high winds resulted in extensive damage to banana crops. Francelia ranked as the deadliest tropical cyclone in Guatemala, until Hurricane Mitch in 1998. Overall damage was estimated at $35.6\u00a0million, and there were 271\u00a0deaths."

        "content": "The origins of Hurricane Francelia were from a tropical wave \u2013 an elongated low pressure area \u2013 that exited the western coast of Africa on August\u00a019. It moved westward across the tropical Atlantic Ocean, and the annual summary of 1969 tropical cyclone activity indicated there may have been a tropical depression \u2013 a cyclone with sustained winds of less 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h) \u2013 briefly located within the system. On August\u00a026, an area of convection, or thunderstorms, developed along the wave, about 800 miles (1,300\u00a0km) east of Barbados. A Hurricane Hunters flight two days later reported no low-level circulation. As the system moved through the southern Lesser Antilles, ship and land observations suggested a circulation had developed, signalling the formation of a tropical depression in the extreme southeastern Caribbean Sea early on August\u00a029.[2] The new tropical cyclone moved quickly west-northwestward away from South America, and on August\u00a030 reconnaissance aircraft recorded winds of 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h). Based on the observation, the depression was upgraded to tropical storm status and given the name Francelia. Strengthening continued to near hurricane-force, but the fast-moving circulation outran the convection, causing brief weakening as it passed south of Jamaica. Although initially forecast to continue to the west-northwest, Francelia slowed and turned to the west-southwest on September\u00a01 due to a ridge to its north. Concurrently, the storm intensified into hurricane status after its winds reached 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h), and late on September\u00a01 Francelia passed over Swan Island. During its passage, an atmospheric sounding occurred in its eye; a sounding is a measurement of the physical properties of the atmosphere, and the process had only occurred four times previously.[2] Hurricane Francelia continued west-southwestward toward the northern coast of Central America, strengthening significantly despite its proximity to land. A Hurricane Hunters flight on September\u00a02 reported winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 973\u00a0mbar (28.7\u00a0inHg) as the hurricane crossed over the Bay Islands, only 30 miles (48\u00a0km) off the coast of Honduras. Francelia weakened slightly as its forward movement slowed, but it remained a hurricane as it approached land, based on confirmation from ship reports.[2] Late on September\u00a03, the hurricane made landfall with winds estimated at 110\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h), just north of Punta Gorda in southern Belize, then known as British Honduras.[3] Tropical storm force winds spread across the country, although hurricane-force winds occurred only in a small area near where the hurricane made landfall. Francelia weakened quickly over land, dissipating late on September\u00a04 over Guatemala. The system continued slowly across Central America, crossing into the eastern Pacific Ocean three days after it moved ashore.[2] On September\u00a08, the remnants of Francelia redeveloped into Tropical Storm Glenda off the coast of Mexico, which moved parallel to the southwest Mexican coast before dissipating on September\u00a012.[2][4]"

        "content": "As a developing tropical cyclone, Francelia brought gusty winds to several islands across the eastern Caribbean.[5] A few days later, it passed south of Jamaica, and winds of around 30\u00a0mph (48\u00a0km/h) were recorded,[6] and there was heavy rainfall.[7] Shortly thereafter, the eye of Francelia crossed over Grand Cayman, producing 0.56\u00a0in (14\u00a0mm) in a 16\u2011hour period.[8] On Swan Island, located about 90 miles (140\u00a0km) offshore Honduras, Francelia produced peak winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h). A station on the island recorded a minimum pressure of 994\u00a0mbar (29.4\u00a0inHg),[9] as well as 3.57\u00a0in (91\u00a0mm) of rainfall during the storm's passage.[10] Before Francelia made its final landfall, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued warnings for countries in the western Caribbean, although there were few observations confirming the track while it was active due to inadequate regional weather stations and lack of the Hurricane Hunters close to land.[11] When Francelia nearly stalled off the coast of Central America, it brought prolonged rainfall and extensive flooding.[2] In Guatemala, daily rainfall reached 7.27\u00a0in (185\u00a0mm) at a station along the Achiguate River,[12] and totals reached about 20\u00a0in (510\u00a0mm) in some mountainous areas.[11] Along the Belizean coast, the hurricane produced a storm tide of about 10\u00a0ft (3.0\u00a0m).[13] Mountain rainfall resulted in overflown rivers, with the Belize River rising to over 36 feet (11\u00a0m) above normal.[2] The hurricane forced over 20,000\u00a0people to evacuate their homes.[11] Offshore northern Honduras, the Bay Islands experienced heavy rainfall and high tides from the hurricane. Most of the houses in French Harbor were damaged or destroyed, leaving 400\u00a0families homeless. About half of the town of Coxen Hole on Roat\u00e1n was destroyed, and the rest of the buildings were damaged. Damage was less severe on \u00datila and Guanaja islands. Francelia flooded most of the northern coast of Honduras, inundating the airport in San Pedro Sula to a depth of 10\u00a0ft (3.0\u00a0m). In San Pedro Sula, the storm cut the water supply for several days, and the floods cut road and rail links between there and Puerto Cort\u00e9s along the coast. Across the region, Francelia caused widespread power outages. Along the Ul\u00faa River, several residents were stranded when their cars stalled in flooded roadways. The floods wrecked four bridges on a road between La Lima and Tela. Flooding also ruined over 50% of the United Fruit Company's banana crop, forcing over 15,000 acres (6,100\u00a0ha) to be replaced.[11] Banana damage totaled $4.7\u00a0million,[2] and United Fruit estimated it would take two years to reach production levels before the hurricane. Other damaged crops included corn, sugar, coconut, and bean. Nationwide, the hurricane destroyed about 1,000\u00a0houses, leaving 5,000\u00a0people homeless. Damage was estimated at $19\u00a0million.[11] In neighboring Guatemala, Francelia caused flash flooding along the Pacific coast due to the heavy rainfall. The rains overflowed rivers, canals, and the crater lake of Volc\u00e1n de Agua, causing widespread landslides. The floods and landslides wrecked highways, rail lines, and many boats, leaving several towns isolated. A 135\u00a0ft (41\u00a0m) portion of the Pan-American Highway was washed out in the country's western portion, and another bridge was destroyed by a landslide between Quetzaltenango and Huehuetenango; landslides also forced the closure of two roads in Quich\u00e9 Department. In Amatitl\u00e1n, the floods covered the entire town with mud to shoulder-height. Five entire towns were largely destroyed, leaving 10,200\u00a0people homeless nationwide. Francelia destroyed 1,704\u00a0houses, mostly along rivers and in landslide zones. The floods also damaged power lines and crops. Throughout the country, the hurricane killed 269\u00a0people and caused $15\u00a0million in damage.[11] Francelia's rainfall extended into El Salvador, where about 1,000\u00a0homes were flooded along the Lempa River. Isolated residents along the Paz River required food to be airdropped. The floods damaged corn and sorghum crops, and some livestock were killed. Francelia destroyed 42\u00a0houses in El Salvador, destroyed a bridge, and caused $1.6\u00a0million in damage. The hurricane killed two people and injured 40\u00a0others.[11] Heavy damage also occurred along the Belize coast, and communications were cut.[14] The storm caused extensive damage to crops,[2] including heavy losses to the banana industry. High waves and heavy rainfall caused power outages and flooded coastal roadways.[14]"

        "content": "By September\u00a05, or two days after the hurricane's landfall, floods were receding across Honduras, and flights were restored to the Bay Islands. Floods receded a day later in Guatemala and not until September\u00a09 in El Salvador.[11] Shortly after Francelia struck the Bay Islands, the Honduran health ministry flew a doctor and nurse with medical supplies to the islands. Undamaged boats were used to transport people and supplies to the islands, utilizing relief goods intended for the recovery after a war earlier in 1969. In Guatemala, the president organized the National Emergency Committee to coordinate disaster relief, but after few organizations complied, there was duplicate relief work in some areas and no assistance in other areas. The Guatemalan Red Cross and the country's air force and army helped in the relief efforts. Citizens throughout the country donated over $200,000 worth of food and clothing. The government made widespread road and bridge repairs following the floods with the assistance of the United States, installing two Bailey bridges that were completed by early November; there were delays installing the bridges due to persistent unsettled weather. The United States ultimately provided $281,659 in aid to the country, mostly through the road reconstruction and C-rations. Other countries and Red Cross chapters sent money to Guatemala, including 10\u00a0tons of medicine from Brazil, 500\u00a0blankets from Chile, and 200\u00a0bottles of snake bite serum from Costa Rica. El Salvador also received assistance from the United States, including food and blankets.[11]"

Dew points reached the mid-region of 70\u00a0\u00b0F (21.1\u00a0\u00b0C), creating heat index values of 108 or more in much of the affected areas. The  accompanying high-pressure systems caused drought conditions, especially in areas that were already experiencing drought conditions, such as northern Alabama. It caused drought conditions in  the Ohio and Mississippi River Valleys. The drought decreased soil moisture to below 98-99% of normal levels.[4] August 2007 turned out to be one of the 20 warmest[5] Augusts for the United States since 1895.[4] A heat-wave forecast was issued in June 2007 for the Columbus, Ohio area.[6] In Indiana, heat advisories were issued after at least four days of 90\u00a0\u00b0F (32.2\u00a0\u00b0C) days in early August.[7] In Evansville, Indiana, August had the highest average temperature recorded until that time, 96\u00a0\u00b0F (35.6\u00a0\u00b0C), surpassed in 2012.[8] Indianapolis had a 14-day streak of temperatures of 90\u00a0\u00b0F (32.2\u00a0\u00b0C) or higher.[9] Paducah, Kentucky had 28 straight days of 90\u00a0\u00b0F (32\u00a0\u00b0C)-plus temperatures, a record broken in 2010.[10] North Carolina experienced temperatures over 100\u00a0\u00b0F (37.8\u00a0\u00b0C).

The ridge eventually moved back towards the west, which allowed some short-term relief for the northeastern states and Mid-Atlantic, but in the Mississippi River Valley and the southeast there remained   strong heat for at least several more days."

It became a tropical cyclone on October 27, and ultimately peaked with winds of 105\u00a0mph (165\u00a0km/h). The storm had minor effects on the island of Bermuda as it passed to the south. A developing extratropical storm to the north turned Grace eastward; the hurricane was eventually absorbed into the large circulation of the larger low-pressure system.[1] Fed by the contrast between cold air to the northwest and warm air from the remnants of Grace, this storm became a large and powerful Nor'easter that caused extremely high waves and resulted in severe coastal damage along the East Coast of the United States."

        "content": "The origins of Grace go back to a mid-level area of low pressure that formed on October 23 to the south of Bermuda. Reports from a nearby ship indicated that the low had become a surface feature by October 25. The storm system initially contained subtropical characteristics, and the center of circulation lacked deep convection for several days. The system was designated a subtropical storm on October 26. An area of clouds near Bermuda became increasingly convective, and gradually became entrained into the expanding and developing circulation of the subtropical storm. Thunderstorm activity persisted near the center, and on October 27, the storm attained tropical storm status and was named Grace.[2] Grace continued to organize and intensify; based on satellite intensity estimates and reconnaissance reports, the storm was upgraded to a Category\u00a01 hurricane, the lowest level on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale.[3] Grace reached its peak intensity with winds of 105\u00a0mph (165\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central barometric pressure of 980\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.94\u00a0inHg), ranking as a Category\u00a02.[4] Operationally, however, the peak intensity was thought to have been 75\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h), which would have made it a mere Category\u00a01 at its peak strength.[5] The hurricane tracked generally northwestward until October 28, when an extratropical cyclone formed along an approaching cold front off the New England coast. This storm rapidly intensified and influenced Grace's steering currents, turning the hurricane sharply east.[6] At around the same time, an eye feature associated with Hurricane Grace became apparent on satellite imagery, despite a lack of strong convective activity around the storm's center.[7] Grace accelerated as it continued eastward, and reached its peak intensity of Category\u00a02 status on October 29. However, the storm's rapid forward movement led to an asymmetrical circulation. The center passed approximately 50\u00a0mi (80\u00a0km) south of Bermuda without significantly affecting the island.[3] Hurricane Grace turned northeast later that day, as the rapidly approaching extratropical storm undermined the storm's lower-level center. The system became overtaken by the frontal storm, and subsequently lost its status as a tropical system.[8] Afterward, Grace moved north along the front and merged with the large cyclone to the north.[6] The remnants of Grace became completely indistinguishable by the next day, as it was completely absorbed by the passing extratropical storm on October 30.[9] The nor'easter significantly strengthened as a result of the temperature contrast between the cold air to the northwest and the warmth and humidity associated with the remnants of Hurricane Grace. The low-pressure system continued deepening as it drifted southeastward and then southwestward towards the United States. The cyclone attained its peak intensity 390 miles (630\u00a0km) south of Halifax, Nova Scotia, as a Category\u00a01 hurricane, with sustained winds of 75\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h).

The following day, about 10 hours before the storm's closest approach to the island, the tropical storm warning was upgraded to a hurricane warning. On October 29, the hurricane warning was lowered to a tropical storm warning, which was amended to a gale warning shortly thereafter.[4][10] The island experienced bands of squally weather in association with the storm.[11] Precipitation peaked at 3.21\u00a0in (82\u00a0mm).[12] However, no significant damage was reported.[8] A yacht traveling from Bermuda to New York encountered strong winds and 25\u00a0ft (7.6\u00a0m) seas well off the Virginia coast; its nine occupants were rescued by Coast Guard helicopters.[13][14] Because of its large size, Grace generated large swells along the East Coast of the United States,[8] combined with abnormally high tides; these waves reached at least 15\u00a0ft (4.6\u00a0m). Despite minor beach erosion, no substantial property damage occurred, although Carolina Beach, North Carolina, lost about 1\u00a0ft (0.30\u00a0m) of sand.[15] Despite the light impacts from Hurricane Grace, the resultant nor'easter caused extensive coastal damage, high seas, and powerful winds. Hurricane-force wind gusts were reported in New England. The storm churned the ocean for several days; a wave 101\u00a0ft (31\u00a0m) in height was reported by an offshore buoy. Extensive coastal flooding occurred along the coast of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern U.S., with effects as far north as Newfoundland and as far south as Jamaica. The nor'easter eventually transitioned into another hurricane that made landfall in Nova Scotia.[6] A ship known as the Andrea Gail was lost, along with her six crew members, during the storm. The story of the Andrea Gail inspired Sebastian Junger's 1997 book, The Perfect Storm, and a 2000 motion picture film.[9]"

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration had noted that the depression had continued to organize it's deep convection during the day.[4] At 18:00 UTC, the depression had wind speeds over 39\u00a0mph, therefore had developed into a tropical storm.[4] The storm was designated as Tropical Storm Gil. While forming, the storm had brought thunderstorms and floods up to 1 meter high to Western Mexico, specifically Sinaloa.[5] Tropical Storm Gil had attained peak winds reached only 40 knots[6] and a minimum pressure of 1001 mbar at August 30 at 12:00 UTC. Thereafter, Gil experienced a period of weakening due to both shear and the cooler waters of the Pacific.[1] The cooler waters induced a weakening which lead Tropical Storm Gil degenerating into a remnant low on September 2 at 15:00 UTC.[7][8] Gil dissipated into the cool waters of the Pacific at 06:00 UTC on September 2.[9][6]"

In Culiac\u00e1n, around 100 vehicles were stranded in sectors such as Las Quintas, the city center and Chapultepec, causing severe road congestion. The shuttle service had to be suspended for two hours.

        "content": " Hurricane Belle was a strong tropical cyclone that caused moderate damage across the East Coast of the United States in August\u00a01976. In late July, a tropical wave emerged off the west coast of Africa. Traversing the Atlantic Ocean for more than a week, the system eventually consolidated into a tropical depression near the Bahamas on August\u00a06. Remaining nearly stationary for a day, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm on August\u00a07 and a hurricane later that day as it acquired a northwest motion. Formation of an eye accompanied quick intensification and Belle reached its peak the following day with winds of 120\u00a0mph (190\u00a0km/h). The hurricane subsequently turned north and accelerated, skirting the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Early on August\u00a010, Belle made landfall on Long Island, New York, as a minimal hurricane crossing Long Island Sound and hitting the central coast of Connecticut as a strong tropical storm. Thereafter, Belle transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over New England before moving over Atlantic Canada. The system turned east while over the North Atlantic and ultimately dissipated on August\u00a015 to the south of Iceland. Threatening much of the East Coast of the United States, hurricane warnings were issued from Georgia to Maine. An estimated 500,000\u00a0people evacuated coastal areas accordingly. Overall, impacts from Belle were less than expected and mainly attributed to flooding across New England. Hundreds of thousands of residents lost power due to high winds. A total of 12\u00a0people lost their lives, mostly incidents indirectly related to the hurricane, and damage reached an estimated $100\u00a0million.[nb 1] Portions of New Jersey, New York, and Vermont were later declared major disaster areas by then-President Gerald Ford. Some damage also took place in New Brunswick, Canada, from heavy rain."

        "content": "On July\u00a028, 1976, a tropical wave emerged off the west coast of Africa. An unusually well-organized system for the time of year and location, considerable deep convection accompanied it. A possible low-level circulation consolidated within the system by July\u00a031 as it raced west across the Atlantic Ocean. As it approached the Lesser Antilles in early August, convection separated from the system and moved north of the islands while the wave itself continued into the Caribbean. The northern portion of the system eventually reached a point north of the Bahamas on August\u00a05 and grew increasingly organized. Well-defined upper-level outflow became established that evening. A low-level center formed early on August\u00a06 and became a tropical depression by 06:00\u00a0UTC while situated roughly 290\u00a0mi (470\u00a0km) east-northeast of Nassau, Bahamas.[1][2] Over the next 24\u00a0hours, the system remained almost stationary and executed a small counter-clockwise loop. Early on August\u00a07, the depression acquired gale-force winds and became a tropical storm. Accordingly, it was assigned the name Belle.[1] Acquiring a slow northwest trajectory, Belle steadily intensified on August\u00a07. Reconnaissance aircraft investigating the storm revealed the system to have achieved hurricane strength by 18:00\u00a0UTC as its pressure fell to 985 mbar (hPa; 29.09\u00a0inHg). Additionally, a well-defined eye was present by this time.[1][2] The cyclone turned northward and accelerated on August\u00a08 while reaching major hurricane status that evening.[2] Early on August\u00a09, Belle achieved its peak intensity with maximum estimated surface winds of 120\u00a0mph (190\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 957\u00a0mbar (957\u00a0hPa; 28.3\u00a0inHg). At higher altitudes within the storm, recon reported winds up to 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h).[1] Turning to just east of due north, Belle began weakening shortly thereafter with its eye becoming obscured.[3] Late on August\u00a09, the hurricane passed within 60\u00a0mi (97\u00a0km) of Hatteras Island, North Carolina. Contrary to most storms which threaten the northeastern states, Belle did not accelerate tremendously as it neared land. Accordingly, it weakened quickly in response to cooler waters in the region. Around 05:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a010, Belle made landfall as a minimal hurricane with 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h) winds along Jones Beach, Long Island, New York.[1] Briefly crossing Long Island Sound, Belle made a second landfall as a strong tropical storm near Bridgeport, Connecticut.[1][2] Once inland over New England, the system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while traversing New Hampshire.[1] The remnants accelerated northeast and later due east across Atlantic Canada before emerging over the Labrador Sea on August\u00a012. While situated between the Azores and Greenland, ex-Belle turned north-northeast and ultimately dissipated south of Iceland on August\u00a015.[4]"

        "content": "Owing to Hurricane Belle's proximity to many states along the Eastern Seaboard, hurricane watches and warnings were issued for the entire coast from Georgia to Maine. Accordingly, evacuations took place in numerous states with an estimated 500,000\u00a0people evacuating overall.[1] Officials advised residents near the coastline to evacuate to safer areas further inland.[5] Approximately 40,000\u00a0vacationing in the Outer Banks evacuated; however, roughly 2,500\u00a0residents decided to ride out the storm in their homes. In Kitty Hawk and Nags Head, volunteer firefighters traveled door-to-door urging residents to leave. Schools and hotels across the areas were utilized as shelters for tourists. National Parks across the Outer Banks closed for the duration of the storm. Aircraft at the Marine Corps Camp Lejeune were relocated inland and helicopters were moved to hangars; some helicopters remained available for emergency rescue operations.[6] An estimated 6,200\u00a0residents evacuated to Red Cross shelters in the state.[7] The majority of evacuations in the country were in New Jersey, with 250,000\u00a0residents and tourists relocating.[1] Of this total, 65,000\u00a0were from Long Beach Island and 12,000\u00a0on the Barnegat Peninsula.[8] With Hurricane Belle expected to make landfall around high tide and a full moon, the forecast storm tide was expected to rival that of Hurricane Donna in 1960. This placed roughly 500,000\u00a0people in danger and officials in New York immediately began preparations. Police officers handed out sandbags to residents in low-lying areas and National Guard armories and some public schools were used as evacuation centers.[7] Approximately 30,000\u00a0evacuated in New York City and Suffolk County,[1] 11,000\u00a0of whom utilized the aforementioned shelters.[9] In Staten Island, 225\u00a0patients in a local hospital were relocated to a second facility.[7] A flood watch was issued for the Hudson Valley in southern New York ahead of the hurricane on August\u00a08.[10] Advisories from the National Hurricane Center emphasized the flood risk as well.[1] Numerous flights in and out of New York were cancelled, Wall Street was closed, and the United Nations postponed a meeting.[7] Summer tourists evacuated from most beaches but many residents decided to stay. In Connecticut, 52\u00a0helicopters and 100\u00a0pilots from the National Guard were placed on standby for possible relief missions following the storm.[7] Farther north in Rhode Island, 10,000\u00a0people fled from the coast. Despite evacuation orders, nearly half of the residents in Narragansett, Rhode Island, refused to leave their homes and as a result martial law was implemented to get people to leave.[7][11] The Red Cross reported that about 2,300 people evacuated Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and thousands of tourists left the area.[9] About 70\u00a0flights to and from Boston's Logan International Airport were canceled. Flood warnings were raised across western portions of the state.[11]"

A total of 12\u00a0people lost their lives, mostly due to traffic accidents, and damage amounted to $100\u00a0million.[1][7] Hurricane Belle produced a swath of light to moderate, and locally heavy, rain extending from North Carolina into New England.[1] The highest totals were confined to areas closer to the storm's center, with accumulations of 3 to 5\u00a0in (76 to 127\u00a0mm) common along its track.[12] Notable state maximums included 6.8\u00a0in (170\u00a0mm) in Massachusetts, 6.68\u00a0in (170\u00a0mm) in Maryland, 5.85\u00a0in (149\u00a0mm) in Maine, 5.77\u00a0in (147\u00a0mm) in New York, 5.66\u00a0in (144\u00a0mm) in New Jersey, 5.37\u00a0in (136\u00a0mm) in Connecticut, and 5.3\u00a0in (130\u00a0mm) in Virginia.[13][14] Although on the weaker side of the storm, New Jersey saw the highest winds from Belle, with an estimated peak gust of 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) in Ship Bottom. A similar gust was estimated to have occurred in Jones Beach, New York, where Belle made landfall. Hurricane-force gusts also affected portions of Connecticut, New York, and North Carolina. LaGuardia Airport, near New York City, saw sustained winds of 52\u00a0mph (84\u00a0km/h) with gusts to 63\u00a0mph (101\u00a0km/h), while Bridgeport, Connecticut has gusts to 77\u00a0mph.  Tides of 3\u20134\u00a0ft (0.91\u20131.22\u00a0m) above normal were common from North Carolina to Rhode Island. Atlantic City, New Jersey saw the greatest tides at 8.85\u00a0ft (2.70\u00a0m) above mean low-tide, while Battery Park in lower Manhattan saw a peak value of 7.2\u00a0ft (2.2\u00a0m) above mean low tide.[1] North Carolina escaped relatively unscathed from the hurricane,[1] with only a few reports of wind damage in the Outer Banks. Windows at a hotel in Nags Head were blown out.[15] Along the North Carolina\u2013Virginia border, five people lost their lives in a car accident on a rain-slicked highway.[7] Minor damage took place in Maryland.[11] Although on the weaker side of the storm, gusty winds knocked down numerous power lines in New Jersey, leaving 10,000\u00a0people in the dark and setting off 75\u00a0fire alarms, one of which was a relatively large fire forcing the evacuation of a nursing home.[7][16] Roughly 500\u00a0ft (150\u00a0m) of the Atlantic City boardwalk was damaged or destroyed, with repairs estimated to reach $5\u00a0million. Damage to properties in Monmouth and Ocean counties amounted to $3.6\u00a0million and $1\u00a0million, respectively.[17] On August\u00a021, then-President Gerald Ford issued a major disaster declaration for Atlantic, Cape May, Monmouth, and Ocean counties, allowing them to receive federal funding.[18][19] The high winds knocked down trees and power lines across Long Island, New York, leaving roughly 170,000\u00a0residents without electricity.[16] Power crews from Pennsylvania were called in to assist in restoring electricity.[20] Damage across the island reached $8\u00a0million, of which $3\u00a0million stemmed from erosion at Rockaway Beach.[17] One person was killed in New York when a branch snapped off a tree due to high winds and fell on her.[9] An estimated 36,000\u00a0residents in the lower Hudson Valley lost power.[21] President Ford later declared Nassau, Suffolk, and Rensselaer counties major disaster areas.[22] Effects were similar in Connecticut where approximately 247,000\u00a0people lost electricity.[23] Commuter train service along Conrail's New York\u2013New Haven line was canceled due to power outages, and Amtrak service between Boston and New York was disrupted for two days. A portion of the Merritt Parkway was closed due to downed trees.[16] High winds in Bridgeport toppled many trees and power lines, shattered windows, and sparked two house fires. Five boats in the city's harbor sustained damage.[24] Flooding in and around Danbury prompted evacuations of an apartment complex and motel.[25] One fatality took place in Barkhamsted due to slippery roads.[1] Overall damage in Connecticut was far less than expected, according to state police,[8] with losses reaching $7.1\u00a0million and mostly stemming from Fairfield and New Haven counties.[26][27] Power companies brought in additional personnel to expedite the restoration process, though many remained in the dark days after the storm.[28] A couple and their two dogs in Vernon died from carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator on August\u00a014.[29] Owing to heavy rains that preceded the hurricane, widespread small stream flooding took place in New England,[1] particularly in Vermont where then-governor Thomas P. Salmon declared a state of emergency. Flooding in the state was reported as the worst in 30\u00a0years,[30] with southern areas of the state seeing the greatest damage.[26] Hardest hit was the town of Chester where 35 of its 85\u00a0roads flooded and 5\u00a0bridges were washed out.[23] Otter Creek crested at 5\u00a0ft (1.5\u00a0m) above flood stage.[26] Significant damage also took place in Jamaica, Ludlow, and Londonderry. Two people died in Huntington after the footbridge they were crossing collapsed into the Huntington River.[23] Portions of Route 100 were washed out.[31] Property damage in the state reached $5\u201310\u00a0million.[32] The overall scale of flooding was regarded as a 1-in-10 to 1-in-25\u00a0year event.[33] Immediately following the hurricane, a statewide ban on drinking water was imposed with an order to boil it first. This was later lifted on August\u00a023.[34] Salt accumulation along power lines in Rhode Island cut electricity to 8,000\u00a0residents on Aquidneck Island.[31] Along the Saint John River in Aroostook County, Maine, flooding caused $2.5\u00a0million worth of damage to crops and buildings.[26] Heavy rains across New Brunswick, Canada, amounting to 7\u00a0in (180\u00a0mm) in Edundston, triggered flooding that damaged crops, homes, and roads. Losses from the event were estimated to be at least $1\u00a0million.[35]"

On September 7, 1976, a tropical depression formed; two days later it accelerated north towards the Baja California Peninsula. Kathleen brushed the Pacific coast of the peninsula as a hurricane on September 9 and made landfall as a fast-moving tropical storm the next day. With its circulation intact and still a tropical storm, Kathleen headed north into the United States and affected California and Arizona. Kathleen finally dissipated late on September 11. Damage in the United States was considerable. California received record rainfall, with over a foot of rain falling in some areas. Flooding caused catastrophic destruction to Ocotillo, and six people drowned.[1] Flooding extended west; railway tracks were destroyed in Palm Desert and high winds and severe flooding were recorded in Arizona. Overall, the damage total was $160 million (1976 USD, about $760 million in 2023) and 12 deaths were attributed to the storm."

        "content": "Tropical cyclones do not typically bring high winds to the southwestern United States. Most Pacific hurricanes are embedded in easterly winds south of the subtropical ridge, and thus move westward\u2014away from large land masses\u2014until they dissipate over cold waters.[2] However, during early autumn, tropical cyclones generally form closer to the Mexican shoreline than average, making them more likely to recurve, or to curve again, northward under the influence of an approaching trough. These troughs tend to extend farther to the south during the latter part of the Pacific hurricane season, in the period between late August and early October. They also produce a synoptic-scale flow that is conducive to steering hurricanes towards the southwestern United States.[3] However, many hurricanes that approach the southwestern United States tend to be undergoing extratropical transition as they encounter increased wind shear and markedly cooler sea surface temperatures, and as they interact with the deep troughs that caused them to recurve.[2] Kathleen is one of only six recorded tropical cyclones in the eastern Pacific Ocean known to have brought gale-force or hurricane-force winds to the Continental United States.[4]"

Moving rapidly west-northwest, a tropical depression formed on September 7. While briefly moving towards the east,[5] the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Kathleen. Moving above 83\u00a0\u00b0F (28\u00a0\u00b0C) sea surface temperatures, Kathleen quickly strengthened. Before passing 40\u00a0mi (64\u00a0km) east of Socorro Island, Kathleen reached its secondary peak with winds of 65\u00a0mph (115\u00a0km/h). Kathleen then weakened considerably, and by 0600 UTC September 9, Tropical Storm Kathleen was barely a tropical storm. At this time, the system was located at 55\u00a0mi (89\u00a0km) north of the island. Shortly thereafter, Kathleen turned north-northeast into warmer waters.[6] Subsequently, the tropical storm began to re-strengthen. Despite moving rapidly north, the cyclone strengthened into Hurricane Kathleen. The hurricane passed near several ships, and was intercepted by a Hurricane Hunter aircraft early on September 10. It is estimated that the storm peaked in intensity around that time, with winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) and a barometric pressure of 986\u00a0mb (986\u00a0hPa).  However, Kathleen never developed an eye. About an hour after the first flight reached Kathleen, a second flight suggested that Kathleen had weakened back into a tropical storm. With precipitation falling in the United States, some 700\u00a0mi (1,100\u00a0km) north of the cyclone's atmospheric circulation, Kathleen's motion accelerated to speeds of 35\u00a0mph (56\u00a0km/h)-38\u00a0mph (61\u00a0km/h).[6] After crossing the Point Eugenia peninsula (the cyclone's first landfall) later on the morning of September 10, Kathleen made its second landfall 120\u00a0mi (190\u00a0km) south of Ensenada at 1130 UTC the same day. Unlike most tropical cyclones, Kathleen weakened slowly over California. Tropical Storm Kathleen weakened further into a depression over southern California and shortly thereafter, moved across Death Valley. On September 11, Kathleen entered western Nevada. Finally, the center became difficult to locate,[6] and the depression dissipated later on September 11.[5] After undergoing a Fujiwhara-like interaction, where two circulations interact with each other, with a low-pressure area stalled off the Pacific coast, moisture later spread into the northwestern part of the United States. After the stalled low was pulled inland, Kathleen combined with the low to produce additional rainfall over parts of California.[6]"

Ocotillo was flooded with 4\u00a0ft (1.2\u00a0m)-6\u00a0ft (1.8\u00a0m) of water;[8] subsequently, half the town was destroyed.[10] Six people drowned in the mud and waters in the town[8] and two people were initially reported missing, though they were later found by officials.[11] Overall, Ocotllio was 70%\u201380% destroyed. Officials evacuated 175 people from the flooded area of Ocotillo and the nearby communities that surround the Salton Sea; the sea  rose 6\u00a0in (150\u00a0mm)-8\u00a0in (200\u00a0mm).[6] A quarter mile of Interstate 8 and a 60-foot bridge were destroyed by the flood, which also washed away mobile homes, trucks, and cars.[11] In Los Angeles, two people died of injuries suffered from slippery roads. One man drowned in El Centro.[11] and two people drowned when their cars tumbled into the water near the city.[10] Record flood stage was attained at numerous streams near the Coachella Valley. Widespread property damage was recorded on the eastern slopes of the Sierra Nevada as well as the nearby desert.[8] Across the San Joaquin Valley, 2/3 of the $150 million raisin crop was threatened. Crops including cotton, lettuce, and hay were damaged.[10] About half of the lettuce in the Palo Verde Valley were lost.[12] Homeowners in Palm Desert suffered $4\u00a0million in damage from the storm; the town received more than a year's worth of rainfall in a matter of days. No serious injuries were reported throughout the desert city, though two agricultural dikes broke.[10] Several miles of railway track,[6] including three trestles that belonged to the San Diego and Arizona Eastern Railway, were destroyed and five others were damaged. At more than 50 other locations, tracks were buried by mudslides or had the ground under them washed away. After assessing the damage from Kathleen, the Southern Pacific Transportation Company decided in 1977 to abandon most of the railroad.[13] The United States Gypsum narrow gauge railroad line from Plaster City and the Santa Fe Railway line from Rice to Blythe also had tracks damaged, and a Santa Fe freight train was stranded and quickly rescued.[14] A 700\u00a0ft (210\u00a0m) section of Interstate 8 from Yuma to San Diego was destroyed.[6] Overall, hundreds of homes were damaged or destroyed;[10] Tropical Storm Kathleen was described as a one-in- 160-year event.[8] Total damage was $160\u00a0million, making Kathleen one of the costliest tropical storms in state history.[15]  Parts of California were declared a disaster area,[16] and flash flood watches were issued throughout Southern California, including the desert and mountains.[17] Flash flood warnings were also issued for parts of California, as well as nearby states Nevada and Arizona, but were dropped as the rain tampered off on September 11.[10]"

The sixth tropical depression and the third named storm of the 2011 Pacific typhoon season, Sarika formed from an area of low pressure near Cebu City. As it traversed the Verde Island Passage on June 8, both the JTWC and the JMA started issuing advisories on the system, with the former issuing a TCFA on the system later that day. The next day, the PAGASA upgraded the low-pressure area to a tropical depression, naming it Dodong. Moving to the north, the system struggled to intensify due to strong wind shear and was downgraded by the JTWC to a tropical depression; however, the JMA kept the system as a minimal tropical storm until it made landfall near Shantou on June 11. It dissipated soon thereafter. Despite the system being weak, Sarika caused 3 fatalities in the Philippines, all due to drowning and the rest are from Shantou, which are due to unknown reasons. The total damages from these affected countries are estimated at $248 million (2011 USD).[1]"

Persistent heat and drought had plagued some of the same regions of the country during the previous summers of 2002, 2003, and 2005, although large, frequent storms brought above normal rainfall to many areas in Ontario and Quebec during those years. By mid-month, temperatures had soared to 42.1\u00a0\u00b0C (107.8\u00a0\u00b0F) at Lytton, British Columbia, with three straight days topping 41\u00a0\u00b0C (106\u00a0\u00b0F). Although various daily records were broken, the only overall monthly record in a major city was in Winnipeg, Manitoba where July was not only the driest on record but also had the highest average maximum temperature of any July. In Val Marie, Saskatchewan, the average daily maximum July temperature was 32.3\u00a0\u00b0C (90.1\u00a0\u00b0F), about 5\u00a0\u00b0C (41\u00a0\u00b0F) higher than average.[40] Just north of Toronto at Buttonville Airport, the temperature reached 37.8\u00a0\u00b0C (100.0\u00a0\u00b0F) on August 2, 2006. On the same day, the nighttime minimum temperature in Toronto was the highest ever recorded, only dropping to 27.2\u00a0\u00b0C (81.0\u00a0\u00b0F). In Ottawa, the temperature reached 36.3\u00a0\u00b0C (97.3\u00a0\u00b0F), but with close to 80% humidity factored in, it reached an all-time humidex record of 48\u00a0\u00b0C (118\u00a0\u00b0F).[41] Record power consumption was recorded in Ontario when close to 27,000 MW were used by consumers, beating out a record from the previous summer.[42] Powerful thunderstorms affected parts of Ontario and Quebec on July 17 and July 30 in Peterborough, in eastern Ontario (Ottawa area) in the early morning hours of August 1 and again in Quebec, centred around Montreal that same evening. More than 450,000\u00a0people lost power in Quebec in that storm.[43] On August 2, more storms associated with a relieving cool front caused heavy damage over a wide swath of central and eastern Ontario, resulting in 175,000 residents losing power and thousands of felled trees blocking roads. Seventeen tornadoes were confirmed for August 2\u20133 ranging from F0-F2 in strength, the largest single day tornado outbreak in Ontario eclipsing the 14 recorded during a 1985 outbreak. The intensity of these storms was fueled by the heat bubble to the south. These series of storms killed at least four people and injured many others, in addition to extensive property damage and forest destruction. After early August 2006, the heat only had a sporadic impact through the remainder of the month, mostly in the West. Temperatures returned to normal or even below average in other parts of the country for the remainder of the summer."

Dot was first identified as a strong tropical storm southeast of Hawai\u02bbi on August\u00a01.[nb 1] The storm was potentially a continuation of a previously unnamed tropical cyclone that was monitored west of the Baja California Peninsula from July\u00a024\u201327, but was never confirmed due to a lack of ship reports. Dot was quick to intensify, reaching hurricane intensity six hours after naming. By August\u00a03, Dot reached its peak intensity, with maximum sustained winds reaching 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h). Intensity leveled off afterwards as Dot tracked westward before making a curve towards the northwest on August\u00a05, after which the hurricane weakened at a faster clip. Dot made landfall the next day on Kauai as a minimal hurricane before dissipating west of the Hawaiian Islands on August\u00a08. Dot produced heavy rainfall and gusty winds as it passed south of the Big Island, Lanai, Maui, Molokai, and Oahu, resulting in minor damage. In Oahu, some homes along the coast were unroofed, and damage from wave action was also reported. Damage from these four islands totaled US$150,000, and two indirect deaths occurred in Lanai. Extensive damage occurred on Kauai as Dot made landfall, producing wind gusts as high as 103\u00a0mph (166\u00a0km/h) and toppling trees and power lines. Widespread power outages affected the island, causing telecommunications and water systems to fail. Although infrastructure was damaged to an extent by floodwater and strong winds, crops suffered the most losses. Cane sugar crops sustained US$2.7\u00a0million in losses. Overall, damage from Dot across Hawaii totaled US$6\u00a0million, and a disaster area declaration and state of emergency took effect for the archipelago after the hurricane's passage."

Despite an apparent correlation between Dot and the preceding unnamed tropical cyclone, the lack of ship reports between July\u00a027 and August\u00a01 prevented the agency from confirming that the two systems were the same.[2] Nonetheless, development upon designation was rapid as the system tracked westward, with reports from the SS Sonoma indicating that Dot had intensified to hurricane strength by August\u00a02.[1][3] Rapid intensification continued, and at 0000\u00a0UTC on August\u00a03, reconnaissance aircraft found winds of 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 952\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.11\u00a0inHg), making Dot a Category\u00a04 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale.[2] Later analysis indicated that these figures constituted the hurricane's peak intensity.[3] After peaking, Dot slightly weakened, but maintained its Category\u00a04 status for more than two days; during that time it boasted an unusually large eye spanning as much as 40\u00a0mi (65\u00a0km) in diameter.[1] Late on August\u00a04, a fourth reconnaissance flight into the storm found surface winds of 160\u00a0mph (260\u00a0km/h),[2] but this reading was discounted on the basis that pressures were unusually high for a storm of that intensity. On August\u00a05, Dot passed 90\u00a0mi (145\u00a0km) south of Ka Lae before the storm curved sharply towards the northwest late that day. A more definite weakening phase began after this point, and during the night of August\u00a06,[1] Dot made landfall on Kauai with winds estimated at 85\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h), making the storm a Category\u00a01-equivalent at the time of landfall. After traversing the island, Dot was downgraded to tropical storm intensity and curved back to the west, before eventually dissipating on August\u00a08.[3]"

        "content": "On August\u00a03, the United States Weather Bureau issued a hurricane watch for coastal areas of the Big Island in Kau and Puna districts. As Dot swept by the Hawaiian islands, various gale warnings and small craft warnings shifted westward to reflect the hurricane's predicted path. Due to the storm's sudden northward shift in movement, hurricane warnings were issued for portions of Oahu and the Kauai channel before being issued for only the island of Kauai. All watches and warnings were discontinued on August\u00a07 after Dot weakened below hurricane intensity.[4] Disaster workers in Oahu and Kauai were warned by civil defense agencies and the American Red Cross to prepare for emergency. Roughly 400\u00a0people fled from the beaches of Kauai due to the threat of storm surge,[5] with an additional 500\u00a0people being evacuated by authorities as the storm neared the island.[6] After the storm caused flooding in Kauai, nearly 1,000\u00a0people evacuated out of submerged areas into schools, armories, and public facilities repurposed as emergency shelters.[7] Passing well to the south of the Big Island, Lanai, Maui, Molokai, and Oahu, damage from Dot on these islands was minor.[8] Rainfall on the Big Island peaking at 4\u00a0in (100\u00a0mm) caused localized flooding in some areas, while wave damage occurred at Ka Lae and along the island's Kona coast.[1] Winds at a station on Ka Lae reached 85\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h).[2] Flooding also occurred on Oahu, and along the coast homes were unroofed and cars were damaged by flying projectiles after being subjected to winds estimated at 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h).[1] Off of Lanai, a tugboat captain was indirectly killed after he slipped between two boats in rough seas while attempting to board another ship, crushing him. Another indirect death occurred on Lanai in a traffic incident resulting from Dot's rainfall.[6] Damage on the Hawaiian islands outside of Kauai was estimated at $150,000.[1] Rough surf along the coasts of Kauai combined with torrential rainfall to produce widespread coastal flooding.[1] Waves at Port Allen peaked at 35\u00a0ft (10.7\u00a0m).[9] Pineapple plantations were inundated, with losses exceeding US$200,000. Infrastructure damage as a result of wave action was spotty but nonetheless amounted to US$100,000.[1] The August\u00a01959 rainfall total in Lihue, largely attributed to Dot, measured 8.13\u00a0in (207\u00a0mm), 6\u00a0in (150\u00a0mm) in excess of normal.[10] The heavy rainfall caused rivers and streams to swell and inundate adjacent areas.[2] Despite making landfall as a weak Category\u00a01 hurricane,[3] Dot brought damaging winds inland, with a maximum wind gust of 103\u00a0mph (166\u00a0km/h) reported at Kilauea Light. However, gusts as high as 125\u00a0mph (200\u00a0km/h) were estimated given the snapping of palm trees. Strong winds damaged hundreds of buildings in the areas of Kilauea, Lihue, and Lawai, Hawaii.[1] Extensive losses resulted from the damaging and toppling of macadamia trees.[1] However, of the crops on Kauai, cane suffered the greatest impact with damage figures reaching US$2.7\u00a0million.[8] The toppling of power lines caused power outages across the island; fallen lines also blocked roads.[2] Water supply to some communities failed due to the lack of electricity.[11] With the exception of emergency radio transmitters, telecommunications on Kauai failed.[12] The damage toll from Dot for the entirety of Hawai\u02bbi totaled US$6\u00a0million, making the hurricane the costliest in Hawaiian history before it was surpassed by hurricanes Iwa, Iniki and Iselle in 1982, 1992 and 2014, respectively. Adjusted for inflation, Dot's damage figure nears US$50\u00a0million.[13] Due to the damage wrought by Dot on Kauai, the island was declared a major disaster area.[14] Stepping in for governor William F. Quinn, Hawaiian secretary Edward E. Johnston declared a state of emergency for Hawaii and allocated funds towards the repairing of roads and public property.[15] The United States Weather Bureau awarded the SS Sonoma a public service award on October\u00a07, 1959 for serving as reconnaissance for Hurricane Dot throughout its existence.[16]"

The name Toraji was contributed to the western Pacific typhoon naming list by North Korea and stands for a broad bell flower (Playtycodon gradniflorus).[1] The third named storm of the annual typhoon season, Toraji developed from an area of disturbed weather within the South China Sea on July\u00a04. As a result of its northwesterly track, the tropical depression moved over Hainan shortly after tropical cyclogenesis. Upon its emergence into the Gulf of Tonkin on July\u00a05, Toraji quickly intensified into a tropical storm with winds of 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph);[nb 1][nb 2] this would be the tropical cyclone's peak intensity for its entire duration. However, the JMA indicated that tropical storm intensity had been reached a day earlier. On the evening of July\u00a05, Toraji made its final landfall on Dongxing, Guangxi before rapidly deteriorating inland and degenerating into a remnant low-pressure area by the following day. During its two-day duration, Toraji brought heavy rainfall to areas of southeastern China and Vietnam. Prior to impacting China, 147,000\u00a0people were evacuated from potentially affected regions. In that country, the storm's effects were spread out over a 800,000\u20131,200,000\u00a0km2 (310,000\u2013460,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) area. The torrential rainfall produced by the tropical storm damaged agricultural land and destroyed several hundred homes, while damaging many more. Total damage in China was estimated at CN\u00a573\u00a0million ($9.6\u00a0million).[nb 3] Despite making landfall near the border of Vietnam and China, effects in the former were generally minimal. However, several fishing boats capsized offshore; these sinkings did not result in any deaths."

The system's effects were spread out over a region approximately 800,000\u20131,200,000\u00a0km2 (310,000\u2013460,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in area.[13] In Guangxi, Toraji caused extensive impacts.[4] In Dongxing, a weather station clocked gusts peaking at 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph).[14] Associated rains destroyed approximately 16,600\u00a0acres (6,700\u00a0ha) of farm and agricultural land, and the resulting flooding caused the collapse of 376\u00a0homes. An additional 946\u00a0residences sustained at least partial damage. In China, the total economic loss resulting from Toraji was estimated at approximately CN\u00a573\u00a0million ($9.6\u00a0million).[4] In preparation for the tropical storm, the Government of Vietnam redirected all boats back to port in Ha Long Bay. A hundred people were evacuated from low-lying areas prone to landslides.[15] Off of Vietnam, late reports indicated that several small fishing vessels were sunk by Toraji in Qu\u1ea3ng Ninh Province, located in the northern part of the country.[16] However, no deaths resulted in these sinkings.[17] On Bach Long Vi, a station recorded 152\u00a0mm (5.98\u00a0in) of rain.[18] Further inland, damage from Toraji in Vietnam remained generally minimal.[17] Throughout northern areas of the country, an average of 155\u00a0mm (6.1\u00a0in) of rain fell, leading to flooding and landslides. At least 27\u00a0homes were damaged and 13\u00a0others were destroyed by the storm, leaving millions of Vietnamese \u0111\u1ed3ng in losses. A power station at a nearby military base was also damaged during the storm, causing roughly \u20ab40\u00a0million (US$2,240) in damage.[19]"

For the IMD classification of heat waves, temperatures greater than 46\u00a0\u00b0C (114.8\u00a0\u00b0F) are considered and classified as severe heat waves.[11] Every year India experiences severe heat waves in summer, but in the year 2015, casualties were abnormally high. Most of the deaths were concentrated in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha and Bihar. More than 20,000 people have died of heat-related causes in India since 1990. In the recent past, the most severe period of hot weather occurred in 1995, when 1,677 people died due to a series of heatwaves. 793 people died in 2011 while 1,247 died in 2012 due to heat related causes.

The sudden end of pre-monsoon rain showers, an uncommon trend in India, has contributed to the heat waves.[14][16] Additionally, the monsoon season is later and further south than the normal trend.[17] This weather pattern, coupled with the El Ni\u00f1o effect, which often increases temperatures in Asia, combined to create the record high temperatures. High humidity compounded the effects of the temperatures on residents.[18] The Loo, a dry wind originating from Pakistan and northwest India, has contributed to increasing the temperature in India.[19]"

The system contained an exposed low-level circulation, which intermittently passed beneath a persistent area of convection to its northeast. By early on July 31, ship reports and QuikSCAT observations suggested winds of 35\u00a0mph (56\u00a0km/h), and the center was well-involved enough with the convection for the National Hurricane Center to classify it as Tropical Depression Three while it was located about 270 miles (430\u00a0km) north-northwest of Bermuda, or about 445 miles (716\u00a0km) south-southeast of Chatham, Massachusetts.[4] Upon receiving its classification, the depression consisted of a partially exposed low-level center with deep convection occupying the northeastern semicircle. Located over sea surface temperatures of about 80\u00a0\u00b0F (27\u00a0\u00b0C), one forecaster noted the depression had \"a small window of opportunity... for it to reach tropical storm strength before transitioning to an extratropical cyclone.\"[5] Convection increased further over the center, and at around 0600\u00a0UTC on July 31 the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Chantal while located about 530 miles (850\u00a0km) south of Halifax, Nova Scotia. The storm continued northeastward, under the influence of a mid-level trough,[1] and Chantal quickly developed well-defined curved banding features;[6] six hours after becoming a tropical storm, Chantal reached peak winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h).[1] The storm tracked through an area of progressively cold waters and cooler air,[7] resulting in the weakening of its convection. The circulation became embedded within the approaching frontal zone, and by 0600\u00a0UTC on August 1 Chantal transitioned into an extratropical cyclone.[1] After becoming an extratropical cyclone, Chantal maintained scattered convection near its center, though its main area of convection and clouds extended to its north.[8] Midday on August 1, the cyclone struck Newfoundland along the Avalon Peninsula, hitting the Placentia Area with full force.[9] It subsequently intensified to attain winds of near hurricane-force. On August 3 the cyclone underwent a final weakening trend in the far northern Atlantic Ocean, and on August 5 the extratropical remnants of Chantal merged with another extratropical cyclone to the east of Iceland.[1]"

        "content": "The precursor disturbance to Chantal began affecting Bermuda on July 30, producing scattered storms and increased cloud cover. The next day the system dropped more rainfall as it passed to the west of the island, and in the two-day period precipitation accumulated to 2.12 inches (54\u00a0mm) at the Bermuda International Airport, accounting for 35% of the monthly rainfall total. Thunderstorms were reported on the island, and maximum reported winds on the island reached 46\u00a0mph (74\u00a0km/h).[10] After Chantal passed Bermuda, a ship with the call sign C60Y4 recorded sustained winds of 37\u00a0mph (60\u00a0km/h) over the open waters of the north Atlantic Ocean.[5] At around 2300\u00a0UTC on July 31, a buoy to the southeast of Nova Scotia reported a pressure of 995\u00a0mbar as Chantal passed nearby.[11] Shortly after it first became a tropical storm, the Atlantic Storm Prediction Center of Canada issued gale warnings for the coastal waters off Newfoundland.[12] Later, the Newfoundland Labrador Weather Office issued heavy rainfall warnings for southeastern Newfoundland.[13] In offshore waters, wave heights reached 20 feet (6.1\u00a0m). Onshore, the storm produced moderately strong winds, with an unofficial peak gust of 54\u00a0mph (87\u00a0km/h) reported near where the storm moved ashore. The extratropical remnants of Chantal dropped heavy rainfall in a short duration across Newfoundland; 1.7 inches (43\u00a0mm) fell in 1\u00a0hour at St. John's West, the highest hourly rainfall total. Across the province, precipitation peaked at 7.89 inches (200\u00a0mm) at Argentia. The rainfall caused flooding and street washouts in several towns along the Avalon Peninsula, such as Ship Harbour, Fox Harbour, and Dunville.[14] Several communities in the region declared states of emergencies. In Ship Harbour citizens were isolated for 5 days until a temporary road was made. Also in Spaniard's Bay, the flooding caused a bridge to depress about 1.5 feet (46\u00a0cm);[15] a temporary bridge was built within two months, with a permanent replacement scheduled to be finished by the summer of 2008.[16] Insured damage across the area totaled $25\u00a0million (2007\u00a0CAD, $24.3\u00a0million 2007\u00a0USD).[17]"

        "content": " Tropical Storm Danny was a weak and short-lived tropical cyclone that caused minor damage to the U.S. states of South Carolina and Georgia. The fourth named storm of the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season, the system formed from an area of low-pressure that developed from an upper-level trough over the central Atlantic Ocean on June 22. Moving west-northwestward, the disturbance gradually developed as convection, or showers and thunderstorms, increased over it. Although it was moving over the warm Gulf Stream, the organization of the disturbance was hindered by strong upper-level wind shear. By 18:00\u00a0UTC of June\u00a027, as satellite images showed a well-defined center and thunderstorms, the system was upgraded to a tropical depression by the National Hurricane Center (NHC). At 06:00\u00a0UTC on the next day, the system further strengthened into Tropical Storm Danny east-southeast of Charleston, South Carolina. Danny continued its track towards South Carolina while slowly strengthening, subsequently reaching its peak intensity at that day of 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 1,009\u00a0mbar (29.8\u00a0inHg) at 18:00\u00a0UTC. Danny then made landfall in Pritchards Island, north of Hilton Head, in a slightly weakened state at 23:20\u00a0UTC on the same day, with winds of 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h) and indicating that Danny weakened prior to moving inland. The system then weakened to a tropical depression over east-central Georgia, before dissipating shortly afterward. Danny was one of three systems to make landfall on the U.S. state of South Carolina in the month of June, the others being Hurricane One in 1867 and Tropical Depression One in 1979. Heavy rainfall was recorded in some portions of Georgia and South Carolina, causing minor flooding. In addition to flooding, impacts were also limited to some fallen trees and lightning strikes. Ten rescues were required on two different beaches on North Carolina due to rip currents. No deaths were reported due to Danny, and the damage from it in the Southeastern United States totaled $5,000 (2021 USD)."

        "content": "On June\u00a022, an upper-level trough separated from the jet stream and evolved into an upper-level low-pressure system. Two days later, the low-pressure area turned westward under the influence of a strong ridge to its north. Disorganized convection, or showers and thunderstorms, increased as the system moved over warmer waters. Near this time, a surface trough in relation to the upper-level low became better defined.[1] Over the next few days, the trough moved west-northwestward, and on June\u00a026, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began to monitor the disturbance for development as it passed several hundred miles south of Bermuda.[2][3][4] On June\u00a027, ship observations, buoy, and satellite imagery revealed that a small area of low pressure had developed about 500 miles (800\u00a0km) east-southeast of the Georgia-South Carolina border.[1][5] Surface pressure decreased,[5] and over the next 12 hours, the system continued to organize. At 18:00\u00a0UTC on June\u00a027, the disturbance consolidated into a tropical depression,[1] but operationally, the NHC did not upgrade the system to a tropical depression until 15:00 UTC on June 28, while it was located offshore South Carolina.[6] A short time after formation, convection over the system decreased, and low-level circulation center (LLCC) became partially exposed.[1] Convection remained displaced to the northwest of the center due to strong upper-level wind shear.[7] Nevertheless, an advanced scatterometer  pass discovered peak winds of 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h) \u2013 tropical storm-force \u2013 early on June\u00a028. The NHC estimated that the depression strengthened into a tropical storm at 06:00\u00a0UTC that day, receiving the name Danny.[1] On the morning of June\u00a028, the cloud structure of the cyclone continued to consolidate, sporting deep convection with cloud top temperatures of \u221276\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221260\u00a0\u00b0C) on its western periphery.[8] Later, in the afternoon, a mass of deep convection quickly expanded over Danny's center. A U.S. Air Force Hurricane Hunter reconnaissance aircraft found gale-force surface winds of 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h), and NEXRAD radar in Charleston also found data supporting this value.[1][9] Thus, it is estimated that Danny reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 45\u00a0mph (70\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1009\u00a0mb (29.80\u00a0inHg) at 18:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a028.[1] Steadily maintaining its motion, Danny made landfall on Pritchards Island, South Carolina, north of Hilton Head Island, as a minimal tropical storm at 23:20\u00a0UTC, with winds of 40\u00a0mph (65\u00a0km/h). This indicated that the storm weakened slightly before moving inland.[1][10] While moving ashore, a weather station at Folly Beach recorded a wind gust of 41\u00a0mph (66 kph) as Danny moved inland.[11] Upon entering the east-central portion of Georgia, the system weakened to a tropical depression as evidenced by Doppler weather radar velocity data and surface observations.[10][1] The weakening tropical cyclone dissipated by 06:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a029.[1]"

The seventeenth tropical/subtropical cyclone, sixteenth named storm and sixth hurricane of the 2019 Atlantic hurricane season, Pablo originated from a baroclinic cyclone a few hundred miles west of the Azores Islands. The precursor cyclone formed on October 22, traveling eastward towards the island chain. The system initially had multiple centers of circulation, but they consolidated into one small low-pressure system embedded within the larger extratropical storm. On October 25, the embedded cyclone developed into a subtropical cyclone, receiving the name Pablo. The cyclone continued eastwards, transitioning into a fully-tropical storm later that day. Pablo quickly intensified between October 26 and 27, forming an eye and spiral rainbands. At 12:00\u00a0Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) on October\u00a027, Pablo intensified into a Category 1 hurricane. The storm continued to strengthen, reaching its peak intensity of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 977\u00a0mbar (28.9\u00a0inHg) at 18:00\u00a0UTC on the same day. The storm quickly weakened the next day, becoming extratropical again, and dissipated on October\u00a029. Pablo and its parent low-pressure system brought gale- and storm-force winds to portions of the Azores. A total of 12\u00a0landslides were reported in the island chain. Regional weather centers issued a yellow alert for several islands. A traffic incident in Sao Miguel injured three people. In the British Isles, Pablo's remnants merged with another extratropical cyclone, which caused heavy rain and wind gusts over 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h). Overall damage was minimal, and no deaths were reported."

        "content": "The origins of Pablo can be traced to a baroclinic cyclone that developed on October\u00a022. The system developed gale-force winds soon after formation, and multiple centers of vorticity formed on the next day. The easternmost vorticity center became dominant and developed a small radius of storm-force winds,[1] which were winds greater than 55\u00a0mph (89\u00a0km/h).[2] On October\u00a023, clusters of convection, or showers and thunderstorms, materialized at the center of the cyclone.[3] The small storm traveled southwestward, then southeastward, around the larger baroclinic low on October 24. Central convection associated with the storm increased, and at 00:00\u00a0Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) on October\u00a025, the embedded low transitioned into a subtropical storm with winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h).[1] Operationally, it was believed that Pablo formed later at 21:00\u00a0UTC on the same day.[4] Pablo moved generally northeastward on October\u00a025,[1] while convective activity continued to become better organized.[5] ASCAT data showed that Pablo contained a well-defined circulation, and satellite imagery revealed that the storm developed a central dense overcast with occasional hints of an eye.[1][6] Based on this information, the NHC determined that Pablo had transitioned into a fully tropical cyclone at 18:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a025.[1] Despite the increase in organization, data from a scatterometer showed that Pablo had weakened slightly down to 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h).[1] The eye disappeared early on October\u00a026, although convection persisted, due to an unstable environment.[7] Later that day, the storm's eye became better-defined as it accelerated northeastward.[8] The storm passed about 55\u00a0mi (89\u00a0km) south-southwest of Santa Maria Island in the Azores at 21:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a026,[9] and made its closest pass to the archipelago around 00:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a027.[1] Early on that day, an ASCAT pass showed that Pablo had intensified further to 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h), despite the storm's cloud pattern deteriorating slightly.[10] A few hours later, the structure of the storm improved again, and the Pablo's eye was evident on infrared imagery. Satellite estimates based on the Dvorak technique were as high as 85\u00a0mph (137\u00a0km/h).[11]\u00a0 At 12:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a027, the NHC upgraded Pablo to a Category 1 hurricane at 41\u00b054\u2032N 18\u00b048\u2032W\ufeff / \ufeff41.9\u00b0N 18.8\u00b0W\ufeff / 41.9; -18.8, marking the easternmost intensification into a hurricane since reliable records began in 1950.[1][3][12] Pablo defied predictions and continued to intensify, reaching its peak intensity of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 977\u00a0mbar (28.9\u00a0inHg) at 18:00\u00a0UTC that same day.[1] The NHC described Pablo's appearance as \"\"remarkably impressive\", and a ring of \u221258\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221250\u00a0\u00b0C) cloud tops surrounded the distinct eye of the hurricane.[13] The storm was still minuscule, with hurricane-force winds reaching outward only 10\u00a0mi (16\u00a0km) from the center.[14] Soon after peak intensity, Pablo began weakening rapidly due to water temperatures of only 62.6\u00a0\u00b0F (17.0\u00a0\u00b0C). The storm also began to slow down and travel northward.[15] The storm quickly approached the northeastern side of the parent baroclinic low, nearing a frontal area.[1] The remaining convection was limited to the southeastern quadrant of the storm, and overall convective activity decreased significantly in depth.[14] Pablo subsequently degenerated into a weak extratropical cyclone, after merging with the aforementioned front at 12:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a028.[1] At this time, the storm consisted of low- and mid-level clouds with showers, with no convection left over the center.[16] Pablo's center dissipated the next day, at 06:00\u00a0UTC.[1] On October 30, the remnant front interacted with a stronger extratropical cyclone to the west,[17] which would later become Windstorm Zed, named by the Free University of Berlin on the next day, on October\u00a031. A new center of 1,010\u00a0mbar (30\u00a0inHg) formed west of Ireland on the same day.[18] The remnants were absorbed by the eastward-moving Zed on November\u00a01.[19]"

(2015).[24] Despite this, sea surface temperatures below Pablo were 1.8\u00a0\u00b0F (1.0\u00a0\u00b0C) higher than usual. Additionally, throughout the storm's life, very cold air high in the atmosphere increased instability, which allowed for convection to encircle Pablo's eye. Pablo's northeasterly forward motion concurred with southwesterly upper-level wind flow, minimizing the effects of wind shear on the system. The jet stream also provided good outflow for the storm.[25] Prior to post-analysis, Pablo was never designated as a subtropical storm, as the NHC had classified it as fully tropical by its first advisory.[6] Additionally, Pablo was revealed to have formed 12\u00a0hours before Tropical Storm Olga.[26][1] It was operationally believed that Olga formed at 15:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a025,[27] six hours before Pablo.

In the former, houses and businesses were flooded, and a structure collapsed. In the latter, two landslides occurred in the capital city of Ponta Delgada and two floods occurred elsewhere.

The third named storm and second hurricane of the season, Caroline developed on August\u00a024 north of the Dominican Republic. The system crossed Cuba and briefly degenerated into a tropical wave due to land interaction. However, upon emergence into the western Caribbean Sea, it was once again designated as a tropical depression after a well-defined circulation was observed on satellite imagery. Moving towards the west-northwest, the cyclone clipped the northern portion of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula before entering the Gulf of Mexico. Caroline was upgraded to a tropical storm on August\u00a029 in the central Gulf of Mexico before rapid intensification began. Early on August\u00a031, Caroline reached its peak intensity with winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h), before landfall south of Brownsville, Texas with winds of 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h) shortly thereafter. After moving inland, Caroline quickly weakened and dissipated over the mountainous terrain of northeastern Mexico on September\u00a01. There were only two deaths from Caroline, both indirect. However, there was heavy rainfall in southern Texas and Mexico, including almost 12\u00a0in (300\u00a0mm) at Port Isabel."

On August 18, the system turned northeast away from the ITCZ and slowed by the time it was 600 miles (970\u00a0km) northeast of Puerto Rico. On August 22 and 23, the system changed course for the second time as it turned to the southwest. By noon on August 24, satellite imagery showed the disturbance establishing a closed area of circulation with winds reaching 25\u00a0mph (40\u00a0km/h) and the barometric pressure falling to 1,011 millibars (29.9\u00a0inHg). The disturbance then became Tropical Depression Five as it neared northeastern Cuba and southeastern Bahamas. It crossed Cuba where it momentarily weakened back to a tropical wave. The cyclone then regained tropical depression status on August 27 as it continued westward into the Gulf of Mexico.[1] After brushing the northeastern tip of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, Tropical Depression Five continued to move west at 8\u00a0mph (13\u00a0km/h) as the storm entered an area favorable for intensification. On August 29, the tropical system strengthened to a tropical storm and was named Caroline by the National Hurricane Center. By that time the storm was only 400 miles (640\u00a0km) east-southeast of Brownsville, Texas. Caroline's forward speed slowed to 5\u00a0mph (8.0\u00a0km/h) while intensifying and on the same day, Caroline was upgraded to hurricane status.[1] Before making landfall, two hurricane hunter aircraft's flew into Caroline's center on August 30, where data collected from the aircraft showed a barometric pressure reading of 987 millibars (29.1\u00a0inHg) and winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h). Six hours later the hurricane rapidly intensified, with winds reaching 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h) and the pressure dropping to 973 millibars (28.7\u00a0inHg).[2] The pressure then fell to 963 millibars (28.4\u00a0inHg) before the storm made landfall 100 miles (160\u00a0km) south of Brownsville on August 31.[3] Caroline rapidly weakened to a tropical depression twelve hours after landfall and dissipated on September 1 over northeastern Mexico.[4]"

The experiments were to study and measure the wind velocity and the environment inside and around the eye as well as the boundary layer of the hurricane. The results of the experiments concluded that Caroline had a higher dissipation rate than normal hurricanes, with the dissipating rate averaging at 30%. This conclusion suggested that energy in a hurricane dissipating internally above the surface layer is two times higher than energy dissipating at the surface.[2]"

Relief and clean up organizations were notified of the upcoming threat while several local oil rigs evacuated personnel.[7] In addition, relief squads from the American Red Cross moved to South Texas in case the storm made landfall.[8] Neil Frank, the director of the National Hurricane Center advised campers along the beaches to evacuate, stating that \"he doesn't want them trapped\".[6] Due to Caroline's compact size, sustained winds only reached 48\u00a0mph (77\u00a0km/h) in Brownsville, Texas. The storm also dropped heavy rain the southern portion of the state, as much as 11.93\u00a0in (303\u00a0mm) in Port Isabel.[9] In Brownsville, Caroline broke a record for most rainfall within a 24-hour period during the month of August.[10] The rainfall caused minor flooding.[3] This helped end a prolonged drought in the Rio Grande Valley. It canceled most of the Labor Day holiday season for South Padre Island, one of the busiest weekends for tourism on the island.[8] Caroline also produced storm tides 1\u20134 feet (0.30\u20131.22\u00a0m) above normal along coastal sections of southern Texas. Overall damage in southern Texas was minor, and there were two indirect fatalities due to drowning incidents in Galveston.[11] In Mexico, coastal residents evacuated to storm shelters south of Tampico. Elsewhere, 300 residents were evacuated to storm shelters in Soto la Marina 55 miles (89\u00a0km) from Santa Rosa. In northeast Mexico, 150 residents evacuated to shelters in San Fernando, 85 miles (137\u00a0km) south of Brownsville. The storm produced 10 feet (3.0\u00a0m) storm tides to coastal sections of Mexico and 5\u201310\u00a0in (130\u2013250\u00a0mm) of rain to inland areas. The rainfalls caused moderate flooding which caused 1,000\u00a0people to evacuate and left moderate damage to homes and businesses. The rains broke an eight-month drought that was affecting inland areas of northern Mexico that was affecting the area's corn production.[12] Along the coast, several small villages sustained significant damage from the hurricane's storm surge.[3]"

        "content": " Tropical Storm Arlene, the first named storm of the 2011 Atlantic hurricane season, brought blustery conditions to much of eastern Mexico in late June to early July\u00a02011. Arlene originated from an Atlantic tropical wave, which crossed the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula before emerging over warm waters in the Bay of Campeche. Despite moderate wind shear, the disturbance strengthened and developed a surface circulation, prompting the National Hurricane Center to declare it a tropical storm on June 28. Arlene remained vigorous for most of its existence; the storm peaked in intensity with winds of 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h) on June\u00a030, just before making landfall on the coast of Veracruz. Crossing the mountains of eastern Mexico, Arlene weakened to a depression before dissipating early on July\u00a01. The precursor disturbance to Arlene brought significant rainfall to parts of Central America, killing three people and triggering widespread flooding and landslides. Throughout Mexico, prolonged rains from Arlene and subsequent flooding affected hundreds of homes and several roads, causing many residents to seek shelter. At the height of the storm, power was lost to 285,000\u00a0homes. At least 22\u00a0people in Mexico were killed by Arlene. Elsewhere, rainfall from the storm alleviated ongoing drought conditions in southern Texas and Florida."

        "content": "The origins of Tropical Storm Arlene can be traced to a distinct tropical wave, embedded within an area of deep atmospheric moisture, that emerged off the coast of Africa on June\u00a013, 2011. The wave tracked westward across the Atlantic for several days, reaching the western Caribbean Sea in late June.[1][2] By June\u00a024, it began interacting with the extension of a monsoon trough in the region, generating broad cyclonic flow and scattered convection in conjunction with an upper trough to its northwest. The amplified wave slowly proceeded west-northwestward along Central America, bringing heavy rainfall to the area.[3] Initially, the disturbance's development was impeded by the trough aloft and adjacent land, though the National Hurricane Center (NHC) noted favorable conditions for tropical cyclogenesis over the Bay of Campeche, coupled with abating wind shear.[4] On June\u00a026, the disturbance moved inland over the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, emerging into the bay the next day as it produced a surface low.[5][6] Despite moderate shear, a Hurricane Hunters flight into the system revealed that a closed wind circulation had formed at sea level. Thunderstorm activity became more concentrated, and the NHC initiated advisories on Tropical Storm Arlene at midnight June\u00a029, after the cyclone's surface winds increased to 40\u00a0mph (65\u00a0km/h) about 280\u00a0mi (450\u00a0km) south-southeast of Tampico, Tamaulipas.[7] Over the following hours, deep convection increased around the broad storm, though its circulation center continued to lack in organization.[8]\nArlene curved to the west in response to a ridge of high pressure to its north and northwest. As the shear over the region further decreased, the large storm began to strengthen gradually, developing spiral convective bands closer to its center.[9] Although forecast models supported intensification to hurricane status, significant development was compromised by a lack of distinguishable central features.[10] On June\u00a030, just before Arlene made landfall, Dvorak satellite estimates indicated the storm had reached a peak intensity of 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h) while accelerating off the coast of Veracruz. Arlene moved ashore near Cabo Rojo as a strong tropical storm by 09:00\u00a0UTC, with the severest winds confined to the north of the center.[11] Farther inland, Arlene turned to the west-southwest along the building ridge. The storm decreased in strength upon doing so; its mid- and low-level circulations became increasingly decoupled, with the latter turning elongated and ill-defined.[12] Early on July\u00a01, the NHC downgraded Arlene to a tropical depression, and the cyclone dissipated over the high terrain of the Sierra Madre Mountains shortly thereafter.[13][14] Arlene's remnants continued to produce heavy precipitation over central Mexico, and with high air pressures offshore a tight pressure gradient generated a strong easterly breeze along the country's Pacific coastlines.[15]"

Emergency crews and medical teams were subsequently dispatched to the area in order to supply medical care to possible victims and manage power plant water pumps in case of flooding.[23] An alert was declared for Pemex\u2014a major oil company within the storm's projected path\u2014in consideration of possible impact to refineries and other facilities.[24] Over 50 temporary shelters were made available in flood-prone areas across various municipalities in Veracruz.[25] Authorities in Tamaulipas prepared five shelters and mobilized of 10\u00a0emergency teams to evacuate up to 20,000 people in anticipation of adverse weather conditions.[26] In Hidalgo, 250\u00a0shelters were opened and emergency workers were dispatched as a safety measure.[27] At the risk of flash flooding, public storm shelters were made available in parts of Oaxaca.[28]"

In Chicago, Midway Airport recorded three days with high temperatures of at least 100\u00a0\u00b0F (38\u00a0\u00b0C) between June 14 and 21.[22] On June 17, the heat dome moved over the Mid-Atlantic briefly, causing a record high of 99\u00a0\u00b0F (37\u00a0\u00b0C) in Washington DC, and tying the record high of 96\u00a0\u00b0F (36\u00a0\u00b0C) in Baltimore.[23][24] On June 20, Minneapolis set a daily record high of 101\u00a0\u00b0F (38\u00a0\u00b0C), with a heat index of 105\u00a0\u00b0F (41\u00a0\u00b0C). June 18 saw Mobile, Alabama have a record high of 100\u00a0\u00b0F (38\u00a0\u00b0C).[25] This was the first time Minneapolis saw triple digits in four years. Grand Forks, North Dakota saw a daily high record of 100\u00a0\u00b0F (38\u00a0\u00b0C) in June 19, and Houston and Galveston saw record highs of 101\u00a0\u00b0F (38\u00a0\u00b0C) and 97\u00a0\u00b0F (36\u00a0\u00b0C) respectively on June 20.[26] Heat in Alaska triggered 31 wildfires.[27]"

More than 100 million people were put on heat alerts, and over 85% of the country had temperatures at or above 90\u00a0\u00b0F (32\u00a0\u00b0C). A man died in Dallas County, Texas, and a heat emergency was triggered in Washington DC due to temperatures over 95\u00a0\u00b0F (35\u00a0\u00b0C), on the weekend of July 23\u201324. This extreme heat severely intensifies drought conditions. Arkansas and Missouri went from 1% and 2% of their states from seeing severe drought or worse, to a quarter and a third. On July 17, Winnipeg saw their highest ever dew point, at 27.4\u00a0\u00b0C (81.3\u00a0\u00b0F).[28] Temperatures in Abilene, Texas on July 20 hit 110\u00a0\u00b0F (43\u00a0\u00b0C), breaking a daily record. Austin, Texas also saw a daily high record of 104\u00a0\u00b0F (40\u00a0\u00b0C).

Record warm low temperatures were also set in Galveston (86\u00a0\u00b0F (30\u00a0\u00b0C)), Wichita Falls (84\u00a0\u00b0F (29\u00a0\u00b0C)), Houston (81\u00a0\u00b0F (27\u00a0\u00b0C)) and Laredo (81\u00a0\u00b0F (27\u00a0\u00b0C)), on July 20.[29] The heat wave was responsible for 18 other deaths, including 12 in Maricopa County, Arizona and one at Badlands National Park.[30] Witchita Falls hit 115\u00a0\u00b0F (46\u00a0\u00b0C) on July 20, a record for July, while on that day Oklahoma also reached that mark. Oklahoma City set a monthly record high of 110\u00a0\u00b0F (43\u00a0\u00b0C).[31] Further east, every day from July 20 to 24 in Newark, New Jersey got at or over 100\u00a0\u00b0F (38\u00a0\u00b0C), the longest streak on record. Boston also set a record high on July 24, at 100\u00a0\u00b0F (38\u00a0\u00b0C).[32] When the heat wave broke on July 25, multiple flash flood warnings were issued with the cold front.[33] While most parts of New Jersey exceeded 90\u00a0\u00b0F (32\u00a0\u00b0C) for the 8th day, New York City was kept to 86\u00a0\u00b0F (30\u00a0\u00b0C), thus keeping the heat wave to 6 days there.[34] Also, in New York City, for only the 3rd time, the entire month had highs above 80\u00a0\u00b0F (27\u00a0\u00b0C).[35] Overall, July 2022 was the 3rd warmest July on record, 8th for daily maximum but had the warmest daily minimums at record, at 63.57\u00a0\u00b0F (17.54\u00a0\u00b0C). Texas saw their warmest July on record, with an average high temperature of 100.2\u00a0\u00b0F (37.9\u00a0\u00b0C).[36] Later on in the month, another heat wave in Portland, Oregon causes 14 additional deaths. Portland saw 7 consecutive days at or above 95\u00a0\u00b0F (35\u00a0\u00b0C), while Seattle saw six days at or above 90\u00a0\u00b0F (32\u00a0\u00b0C), both breaking records for duration, by July 31.[37]"

The system was in a marginal environment for development, with satellite imagery showing scattered convection around a poorly organized circulation.[1] By June 10, conditions began to improve and the system began to organize, with the JTWC upgrading its development potential within the next day to medium.[2] On the same day at 06:00 UTC, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began issuing advisories on a tropical depression.[3] At 15:00 UTC, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the system as it was located approximately 185 nautical miles (345\u00a0km; 215\u00a0mi) west-northwest of Manila. At this time, the system was located within favorable conditions for further development, though its circulation still remained broad.[4] On June 11 at 03:00 UTC, the JTWC issued its first warning on Tropical Depression 04W as it continued to organize, with cloud tops in the central dense overcast deepening.[5] Shortly after at 06:00 UTC, the JMA upgraded the depression to a tropical storm, giving it the name Merbok.[6] Advanced Scatterometer data from the MetOp-B satellite at 13:14 UTC showed tropical-storm-force winds in the eastern quadrants of the storm, and at 15:00 UTC, the JTWC also upgraded Merbok to a tropical storm.[7] Merbok continued tracking to the north-northwest influenced by a subtropical steering ridge,[8] and on June 12 at 12:00 UTC, the JMA upgraded Merbok to a severe tropical storm.[9] At the same time, Merbok peaked in intensity, with 10-min winds of 55 knots (100\u00a0km/h; 65\u00a0mph) and a minimum central pressure of 985\u00a0hPa (mbar; 29.09\u00a0inHg).[10] The JTWC estimated peak 1-min winds of 45 knots (85\u00a0km/h; 50\u00a0mph).[11] Merbok made landfall on the city of Shenzhen[12] at 14-15:00 UTC,[13] resulting in the JMA downgrading it to a tropical storm at 18:00 UTC[14] and the JTWC issuing its final advisory on Merbok at 21:00 UTC.[13] The JMA later issued its final advisory on the system on the next day at 00:00 UTC as it weakened into a tropical depression,[15] with its remnants dissipating inland at 12:00 UTC.[10]"

Although meteorological records are sparse and generally incomplete, they indicate that three significant tropical cyclones affected land, each causing some degree of damage. The first system struck North Carolina on July 18, causing significant damage before battering the Mid-Atlantic states with high tides, strong winds, and heavy rainfall. Torrential rainfall caused river flooding from Baltimore to Philadelphia, particularly along the Schuylkill River, which took the lives of 20 people in various incidents. Strong winds damaged property and public facilities in and around New York City, and damaging floods extended into central and northern New England. Crops and railroad infrastructure suffered throughout the entire region. On August 22, a strong hurricane impacted Havana, Cuba, destroying fruit trees and disrupting shipping, before making landfall on the Florida Panhandle with an enormous storm surge. Coastal flooding was severe around Apalachicola, and as the storm moved inland, it generated destructive winds across the Southeastern United States. Abundant precipitation fell from Georgia through Virginia, causing extensive flooding; one river swelled over 20 feet (6.1\u00a0m) above its normal height. The storm blew down crops and trees along its course, and toppled a large railroad bridge near Halifax, North Carolina. Offshore, a pilot boat collided with a larger ship in the rough seas and sank. Considered the worst storm in nearly 30 years in the tidewater region of Virginia, the cyclone briefly reentered the Atlantic off New Jersey before making landfall over New England. Strong winds and moderate to heavy rains plagued much of New England on August 24 and 25. On September 7 and 8, a hurricane brushed the coastline from New York to Cape Cod with gusty winds and appreciable rainfall, and left many ships in distress. The system later struck Atlantic Canada, likely causing \"great loss of property and lives\",[1] though damage reports were limited. Fragmented records exist of other hurricanes, including two which remained over open seas in early September and the middle of October."

Ludlum discusses, in greater detail, three significant tropical cyclones that impacted the United States in 1850. Unusually, all three heavily impacted the Northeastern United States; Ludlum compares the season to 1954, in which three major tropical systems impacted the East Coast of the United States. More traditional hurricane targets, such as Florida, were spared the brunt of seasonal tropical cyclone activity in 1850, while the atmosphere farther north was abnormally tropical. Newark, New Jersey, had its warmest\u2014and one of its rainiest\u2014summers on record at the time, owing to frequent nearby hurricanes and the influx of tropical air.[4][5] Meteorological reports pertaining to the season were largely lost in a Smithsonian Institution fire in 1856, limiting what is known about hurricane activity in 1850.[6] As the season falls outside the scope of the Atlantic hurricane database (1851 onward) and its associated reanalysis project,[7] records are regarded as incomplete. Extant accounts of the storms in 1850 are chiefly based on private weather records and press reports, and only approximate storm tracks are known.[6]"

Onshore, \"great damage\" occurred from Wilmington to Elizabeth City.[12] [13] Intense wave action churned the Chesapeake Bay, while storm-heightened tides up to 6\u00a0ft (1.8\u00a0m) above normal flooded  wharves and coastal communities.[14][15] The Baltimore area endured persistent gale-force winds accompanied by torrential rainfall.[16] As streams and rivers swelled above their banks,[17] cellars and streets became inundated by floodwaters. Many trees were blown down and numerous poorly built or unfinished buildings were destroyed. The storm cut telegraph communications between Baltimore and surrounding areas.[15] In the countryside, low-lying hay fields were flooded and most of the corn crop was decimated. At Bladensburg, Maryland, a train station and locomotive were washed into an adjacent flooded waterway. Arrivals of ships into port were delayed by the storm, which one captain held to be the worst he had ever observed, and some vessels incurred extensive damage.[15] The storm's effects quickly spread northward. Winds at Philadelphia began to increase in the morning on July 18, becoming severe by the evening hours.[12] Air pressure fell to 993 millibars (29.3\u00a0inHg) early on July 19 as the hurricane's center passed to the west,[10][12] and the city received more than 4 inches (100\u00a0mm) of rainfall.[16] The storm wrought significant damage throughout the city, including to trees, signs, and structures.[18] A number of houses were demolished, and many more\u2014including a large brick building near Rittenhouse Square\u2014suffered damage.[19] Major freshwater flooding was observed in the area, especially along the Schuylkill River, which rapidly rose to its highest level since 1838. A large quantity of lumber was swept away, and several docks were submerged. Their \"worst apprehensions realized\", hundreds of residents worked hurriedly to mitigate damage from the flooding. Bridges over the river at Phoenixville were washed away, resulting in the deaths of four individuals. A lock of a dam upstream of Phoenixville gave way, destroying a boat and killing its occupants. Four men and a child reportedly drowned on the river's banks near Conshohocken. Railways were covered with up to 3 feet of water in low-lying spots.[19] Numerous small craft capsized on the Schuylkill and Delaware rivers.[18] Overall, 20 people died in various storm-related tragedies along the Schuylkill.[11] The hurricane took a heavy toll on agriculture in the Mid-Atlantic states. Flooding outside Philadelphia destroyed fruit orchards,[19] and in nearby Burlington, New Jersey, strong winds and heavy rainfall inflicted significant damage to crops on the night of July 18,[12] leaving entire fields of corn blown down.[19] The Delaware River burst its banks at Burlington, inundating nearby lowlands. Notable flooding also took place along the Lehigh River.[11]  Telegraph lines north of Philadelphia were damaged, limiting communications in the storm's aftermath.[18] Throughout the region, downed trees blocked railways.[19] \"The parks are literally carpeted with boughs and leaves, and many beautiful trees are prostrate.\" \u2014The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, July 19, 1850[16] Hurricane-force gusts buffeted Newark, New Jersey, and rainfall exceeded a weather observer's rain gauge capacity of 4.75\u00a0in (121\u00a0mm).[11] Strong winds imperiled New York City late on July 18 into the next morning; there was widespread tree damage, with branches and leaves littering the ground, and many specimens uprooted or snapped. The storm ruined awnings and tore metal roofs off several buildings.[11][16] Some ships in New York Harbor were ripped from their anchors and blown aground; further east, multiple coaster vessels were wrecked along the coast of Long Island. The winds and storm tides destroyed bath houses and other facilities at Coney Island.[11] As the storm tracked northward through central New York State, it produced high southeasterly winds and heavy rainfall across most of New England. At Fort Trumbull along the coast of Connecticut, heavy rainfall starting early on July 19 accumulated to 3.24\u00a0in (82\u00a0mm).[11] At Hartford, flooding caused about $100,000 (1850 USD) in losses.[20] Southeasterly winds peaked at tropical storm-force. Damage to property and crops was confined to western New England, leaving areas such as eastern Massachusetts unscathed. Less substantial rain was reported at Providence, amounting to 1\u00a0in (25\u00a0mm).[11] The rain shield extended into far-northern New England, producing 5\u00a0in (130\u00a0mm) of precipitation at Montpelier, Vermont, and 3.23\u00a0in (82\u00a0mm) at Burlington.[12] The resultant flooding was in some cases the greatest in recent memory.[20]"

The storm destroyed large swaths of banana and plantain trees, and all vessels in Havana Harbor dragged anchors at the height of the hurricane.[22] [23] The storm moved north over the eastern Gulf of Mexico, striking the Florida Panhandle between Pensacola and Panama City on August 23. Extremely high tides bombarded the Apalachicola area, resulting in extensive coastal flooding.[20][24] The hurricane destroyed wharves and left many ships damaged or foundered. Sea water intrusion inundated warehouses and streets in Apalachicola, and one street was made impassable by strewn debris and fallen trees.[25] Farther east, a bridge over the Wakulla River was washed away by raging floodwaters. A long period of high winds was reported at the state's capital city of Tallahassee.[24] The storm produced some strong winds in interior Georgia on its way to the Carolinas. The destruction of homes, crops, and trees was reported from Griffin through Augusta, Georgia. Adverse conditions extended westward to Montgomery, Alabama, where the night of August 23 was marked by high winds and heavy rainfall.[24] Southeasterly gales had a large impact on shipping interests off North Carolina. Several vessels were imperiled;[20] in one case a pilot boat capsized after colliding with another ship.[26] In light of this incident, the hurricane is listed in the National Hurricane Center's contemporary compilation of tropical cyclones that \"may have\" caused at least 25 fatalities.[27] The storm grounded the schooner H. Wescott near Cape Fear.[26] Gales were reported from Savannah, Georgia, to Wilmington, North Carolina.[20][28] Near Halifax, North Carolina, the winds toppled a railroad bridge about 450\u00a0ft (140\u00a0m) long and 60\u00a0ft (18\u00a0m) high.[26] The storm also ravaged farmland in the area, destroying crops, fences, trees, and structures, and injuring several people.[29] Much damage was reported in the Raleigh area,[30] and many trees in New Bern suffered at least some limb breakage; several large trees were fully uprooted. The local corn crop\u2014already diminished from the July hurricane\u2014was judged completely lost, though property damage was negligible. Offshore winds from the storm created a negative storm surge on the Neuse River, leaving docks dry for a time.[31] Torrential rains over a large area from Georgia to Virginia triggered severe river flooding.[32] The Dan River, which flows through North Carolina and Virginia, swelled 20\u00a0ft (6.1\u00a0m), amplified to 40\u00a0ft (12\u00a0m) above normal in narrow channels.[14][28] In the Carolinas, mills, dams, and roads were washed out, and losses in central North Carolina alone totaled an estimated $7 million.[24] Gale-force winds lashed the tidewater region of Virginia in what was considered the worst storm on the lower Chesapeake Bay since the 1821 Norfolk and Long Island hurricane.[20] A ship called the Osceola lost its wheelhouse to the winds, while onshore, the storm razed crops and a few small structures such as barns and outhouses.[33] Affecting many of the same areas as the July hurricane, the cyclone downed trees in and around Baltimore and caused street flooding in Washington, D.C., where a railroad bridge was swept away.[20][34] The storm began to influence the weather at Philadelphia on the night of August 24. Strong winds out of the north and northeast at Philadelphia and Newark, New Jersey, suggest the center moved off the New Jersey coast and reemerged into the Atlantic. In addition to the gales, more than 3\u00a0in (76\u00a0mm) of rain fell on Newark on August 25.[20] Winds at New London, Connecticut, and Providence, Rhode Island, veered from southeast to south, then west, so the storm center likely tracked somewhere over Connecticut. The storm adversely affected shipping on the Long Island Sound, and heavy rain fell across much of New England.[20] Fort Trumbull recorded 4.43\u00a0in (113\u00a0mm) of rain, while 2.5\u00a0in (64\u00a0mm) fell at Providence;[28] the deluge triggered flash flooding, though few details are known about the extent of the damage.[25]"

The system probably continued toward the northeast, passing south of Nantucket, Massachusetts. There, gale-force winds initially blew out of the southeast before shifting to north midday on September 8. Similarly, Cape Cod experienced blustery conditions accompanied by heavy rainfall, though damage in eastern New England was generally inconsequential. Providence, Rhode Island, received 2\u00a0in (51\u00a0mm) of rain.[36] The storm later affected the Canadian Maritimes,[37] causing heavy disruption in Nova Scotia. Downed telegraph wires in the region delayed damage reports until repairs were completed.[36] The cyclone \"undoubtedly caused great loss of property and lives along the coast\", according to a report from the telegraph office at Halifax.[1] [38]"

The storm was the eighth named storm and third hurricane of the annual hurricane season. Originating as a tropical wave off the coast of Africa on September\u00a04, the cyclone tracked a general westward path for much of its initial stages as it gradually intensified, reaching tropical storm intensity shortly after development and then hurricane intensity a day later. After reaching a longitude roughly equal to that of the Lesser Antilles, the hurricane began to curve northward on a parabolic track, bringing it near Bermuda at peak intensity as a Category\u00a04\u00a0hurricane on September\u00a013. Afterwards, the hurricane began to accelerate northeastwards and weaken. The waning tropical cyclone grazed Cape Race before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on September\u00a015; these remnants persisted for an additional day. Despite never making landfall, the tropical cyclone disrupted numerous shipping lanes and inflicted damage on Bermuda and Newfoundland. In the former, the hurricane brought winds in excess of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h), downing power lines and felled trees. Property damage also resulted from the strong winds. Overall damage on the island totaled $400,000.[nb 1] After passing west of Bermuda, the tropical cyclone tracked across numerous shipping lanes. Two ships, the Leicester and Gaspar, encountered the hurricane and became stricken in open waters. Though most people were rescued from both ships, six people perished on the former while one died on the latter. Beginning on September\u00a015, the hurricane tracked east of Newfoundland, producing heavy rainfall on land. The precipitation flooded roads and caused streams to overflow, inundating additional areas. On the island, two people were killed. Overall, the hurricane caused eight fatalities."

This marked the second consecutive year in which a tropical cyclone could be traced back as far east as Africa.[2] In HURDAT\u00a0\u2013 the official database for tropical cyclones in the North Atlantic dating back to 1851 Atlantic hurricane season[3]\u00a0\u2013 the area of disturbed weather is estimated to have organized into a tropical storm by 0600\u00a0UTC the following day.[4] Over the course of the succeeding week, the tropical cyclone moved in a general westward direction as it gradually intensified, reaching hurricane intensity by 0000\u00a0UTC on September\u00a05 and then attaining the equivalent of a modern-day Category\u00a02\u00a0hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale at 0600\u00a0UTC on September\u00a08.[4] Up until this time, its existence and trek across the central Atlantic was only inferred, however, aircraft reconnaissance detected and as such confirmed the existence of the tropical cyclone the following day while the hurricane was situated approximately 900\u00a0mi (1,400\u00a0km) east of Antigua.[2][5] Operationally, however, the reconnaissance flight significantly underestimated the winds of the tropical cyclone, with estimates of tropical storm-force winds at the storm's center.[6] Thereafter, the hurricane began curving northward as it continued to intensify, reaching the equivalent of a modern-day Category\u00a03\u00a0hurricane\u00a0\u2013 a major hurricane[nb 2]\u00a0\u2013 by September\u00a011. Two days later, the storm strengthened further into a Category\u00a04\u00a0hurricane. As no reasonably quantifiable strengthening occurred afterwards, this also marked the storm's official peak intensity as maximum sustained winds were analyzed at 135\u00a0mph (215\u00a0km/h).[4] However, aircraft reconnaissance estimated wind speeds of at least 140\u00a0mph (225\u00a0km/h) at roughly the same time frame. The storm's northward recurvature caused it to track just west of Bermuda late on September\u00a013.[2] Afterwards, a weakening trend began as the hurricane tracked northeastward into more northerly latitudes. By September\u00a015, the storm had been downgraded to minimal hurricane intensity. After passing south of Cape Race later that day, the hurricane transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, and continued to track northward until it was last noted by 1800\u00a0UTC the next day near Greenland.[4] During the storm's twelve-day trek, the hurricane tracked approximately 3,500\u00a0mi (5,600\u00a0km), roughly equidistant to the distance between New York City and London.[2]"

Aircraft from the United States Air Force and Navy stationed in Bermuda were sent to airfields in the United States to avoid the hurricane, while a Navy task force of twelve ships including the escort carrier USS Mindoro (CVE-120) were dispatched from the island.[11] The U.S. naval operating base moved boats from exposed areas into safer parts of the base. Similar precautionary measures were undertaken by the British naval operating base.[12] On Bermuda, the hurricane brought sustained winds estimated between 93\u2013103\u00a0mph (150\u2013166\u00a0km/h), with higher gusts.[12] A minimum pressure of 958\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.30\u00a0inHg) was recorded, though a lower pressure may have occurred on the island as the barometer had been falling at the time.[13] The strong winds downed power lines and felled trees, littering insular streets with debris.[12] As a result, power outages occurred and loss of telecommunications was reported.[14] Radio stations based on the island went silent due to the power loss.[15] An emergency backup power generator at King Edward Memorial Hospital was used to restore electrical power to the facility. However, oil lamps were still used in place of any form of electrical lighting.[14] Several slate roofs were torn from their buildings from the strong winds.[16] Heavy rainfall associated with the hurricane flooded long stretches of roadway.[14] Some roads were blocked and rendered impassable by the rainfall.[17] At the local harbor, six vessels were inundated by the strong offshore wave action.[18] Overall, property damage on the island was estimated at $400,000.[17]"

All flights headed for Torbay Airport were suspended until the storm's passage.[20] Before affecting Newfoundland, however, the hurricane impacted numerous shipping lanes in the open Atlantic. The freighter Leicester, which had departed from London and was headed for New York City, was caught in the hurricane late on September\u00a014 while situated roughly 400\u00a0mi (640\u00a0km) southwest of Cape Race, Newfoundland.[21] As weather conditions deteriorated, the ship began to list, and as such the crew abandoned the ship late the following day. The American steamship Cecil N. Bean and the Argentinian steamship Tropero both assisted in rescue operations and rescued 39\u00a0crew members. However, six other remained unaccounted for and were presumed dead.[22] The Portuguese fishing schooner Gaspar was also caught in the storm roughly 300\u00a0mi (480\u00a0km) off of Newfoundland,[23] and although initial reports presumed that it had already sunk, the United States Coast Guard indicated that the ship was in no need of assistance.[21] However, the ship was still abandoned and 41\u00a0crewmen were rescued, though one person was lost.[20] Much of the effects from the hurricane on Newfoundland occurred on September\u00a015 and continued until September\u00a018. With winds equivalent to that of a Category\u00a01 hurricane, the cyclone brushed east of the island, bringing extensive flooding. Offshore, a ship estimated winds in excess of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) off of Grand Bank. Precipitation peaked at a record 4.5\u00a0in (110\u00a0mm) at Fort Pepperrell. In St. John's, train traffic was effectively halted because of the hurricane. Silt kicked up by the strong winds covered railroad tracks in the southern portions of the city, while heavy rainfall flooded several city streets. Similar problems occurred in Avondale. The nearby Rennie River overflowed its banks, inundating adjacent land. The urban flooding damaged adjacent infrastructure. A three-year-old girl died on September\u00a016 after a landslide triggered by the rain filled the first floor of her home. This was the only death associated with the hurricane on the island. In Holyrood, the local highway was washed out in areas. A small trestle with two concrete abutments were swept off into the adjacent bay. Another road leading to Cape Saint Francis suffered wash outs as deep as 4\u00a0ft (1.2\u00a0m). Small bridges were also damaged, and some were washed away. As with the Rennie River, the Waterford River also overflowed its banks due to excessive recharge, and as such inundated 13\u00a0homes. Another river near Kilbride overflowed, flooding adjacent plots of land and tearing apart pavement. In this manner, several roads were rendered impassable and were cut off to traffic.[20]"

The word Talas is a Filipino word meaning sharpness.[2] It followed five months after Japan was hit by a large tsunami. Throughout Japan, Talas brought heavy rainfall leaving roads flooded. Extremely heavy rainfall of 66.5 millimeters per hour was observed, with rainfall of 69.0\u00a0mm in Yamanakako, Yamanashi, and 49.5\u00a0mm in Ichinoseki, Iwate which exceeded overall records for the entire month of September.

        "content": "Late on August\u00a022, an area of low pressure developed to the west of Guam.[3] At midnight that day, the system became sufficiently well organized that the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started tracking it as a tropical depression.[4] On August 23, the system moved into an environment of low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures prompting the JTWC to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on it.[5] By August 25, the system grew strong enough that the JMA upgraded it to a tropical storm, naming it Talas.[6] Soon the system developed long and expansive convective banding along the eastern and south-western periphery of the broad low level circulation center, similar to a monsoonal depression. The JTWC initiated advisories on the system, designating it with 15W. The JTWC originally anticipated a fujiwhara effect of Typhoon Nanmadol, a stronger tropical cyclone to the west of Talas.[7] However, the two cyclones moved far away from each other with at least 1,000 nautical miles (1,900\u00a0km; 1,200\u00a0mi) of distance between them. This prompted the JTWC to change its forecast on the system, from turning west and interacting with Nanmadol, to continuously move north and intensify into a typhoon.[8] This prompted the JMA to upgrade Talas to a severe tropical storm with winds of 50 knots (95\u00a0km/h; 60\u00a0mph).[9] Multiple competitive steering ridges caused Talas to move in a poleward direction with stronger winds in the periphery and weaker winds near the center. A tropical upper tropospheric trough (TUTT) caused subsidance in the atmosphere which caused a disturbance in the outflow towards the northwest of the system. However, another TUTT cell to the northeast opened an outflow channel which kept Talas from being destroyed by shear.[10] Talas was very loosely organized with a relatively open circulation center and very low consolidation around the core. Convection was also displaced towards the periphery and stronger wind shear kept Talas from strengthening.[11] Talas, being located in a very weak steering environment hardly moved in 24 hours and was effectively trapped between strong subtropical ridges and an anticyclone. Talas failed to strengthen for a very long time and remained loosely organized with all the convection located in the periphery.[12] Early on August 28, Talas started to strengthen after a whole day in dry winds. The low-level circulation center started to get consolidated with deep convective bands wrapping into it. Talas was expected to make landfall over central Japan with strong winds.[13] Talas then moved into an environment favorable for slow development, with moist winds and significantly warm sea surface temperatures. The center became well organized with convective bands tightly wrapped into it.[14] Wind shear decreased and the center was wrapped with more tightly curved banding. The JTWC reported that there was more confidence in the strength and position of the system. They JTWC reported that they were expecting a peak intensity of 90 knots (165\u00a0km/h; 105\u00a0mph).[15] Soon, the subtropical ridge to the west of the storm weakened and the subtropical ridge to the east of the system pushed Talas to the west. As a result, Talas accelerated towards the west maintaining strength and outflow.[16] An upper-level cyclone over the system suppressed the convection and kept it from reaching the center. Therefore, Talas remained weak and did not strengthen further. Convection never managed to consolidate the center and convective banding remained well away from the fully exposed low-level circulation center.[17] Convective banding completely encircled the LLCC but never managed to consolidate over the LLCC because of the strong upper-lever cyclone over the storm. Talas was being steered by a mid-level anticyclone, a part of the developing omega block.[18] On September 1, Talas developed a large annulus of nearly 110 nautical miles (205\u00a0km; 125\u00a0mi) in diameter with multiple weak circulations cyclonically rotating around a centroid within the center. Fragmented deep convective banding broadly wrapped the low-level circulation center with an upper-level cyclone over the center and anticyclonic flow around the periphery of the storm.[19] Soon, Talas turned towards the Kansai region of Japan maintaining intensity with cloud tops warming around the expansive, nearly cloud-free 140 nautical miles (260\u00a0km; 160\u00a0mi) wide low level circulation center (LLCC). Gale-force winds were extending to over 200 nautical miles (370\u00a0km; 230\u00a0mi) towards the north.[20] The convective banding continued to expand more and more with the outer rainbands already brushing parts of Japan. Coastal areas in the nation have already reported gale-force winds several hours before landfall, while the Omega block continued to drive Talas towards the nation.[21] Land interaction weakened Talas, prompting the JMA to downgrade Talas from a typhoon to a severe tropical storm with winds of under 60 knots (110\u00a0km/h; 70\u00a0mph).[22] On September 2, Talas accelerated towards Japan and started making landfall over K\u014dchi Prefecture, Japan. As a result, convective cloud tops started to warm up and banding became more fragmented. Talas maintained its large annulus with better poleward outflow enhanced by the strong mid latitude westerlies.[23] After making landfall over Aki, Japan early on September 3, Talas moved into an area of moderate wind shear (15\u201320 knots) along the western edge of a deep-layered subtropical ridge with a mid-latitude trough approaching from the northwest.[24][25] As a result, the LLCC started weakening and slowed down over land. Also, the mid-latitude trough located to the northwest of the system started to weaken, which made the JTWC anticipate Talas to turn northwestward and accelerate as it enters the Sea of Japan.[26] However, Talas slowly drifted north and entered an area of strong wind shear (30\u201350 knots). On becoming exposed to wind shear and strong upper-level westerlies, Talas became grossly elongated to the northeast and convective banding became more shallow and fragmented.[27] On entering the cold waters of the Sea of Japan, Talas accelerated north at over 13 knots (24\u00a0km/h; 15\u00a0mph). The central convection became significantly eroded and was displaced to the north-east as Talas was exposed to a very strong wind shear of over 50 knots (95\u00a0km/h; 60\u00a0mph) that made the LLCC very distorted and difficult to pin-point. Talas was embedded in a baroclinic zone and the JTWC anticipated an extratropical transition, which prompted them to issue their final warning on the system.[28] On September 5, the JMA issued their final warning on the system, reporting that Talas had become extratropical over the Sea of Japan.[29][30]"

In Shunan, Yamaguchi, extremely heavy rainfall of 66.5 millimeters per hour was observed, with rainfall of 69.0\u00a0mm in Yamanakako, Yamanashi, and 49.5\u00a0mm in Ichinoseki, Iwate which exceeded overall records for the entire month of September.[35] As the typhoon approached, The Fujisankei Classic, an annual golf event on the Japan Golf Tour was disrupted by the heavy rain.[36] Heavy rains triggered flash flooding, which killed one person, and injured 17 leaving three more missing soon after the landfall.[37] Some 3,200 people were evacuated in 16 prefectures after the typhoon slammed the island nation with extremely heavy rains.[38] The Central Japan Railway Company had to suspend its bullet train services on the Tokaido Shinkansen Line between Gifu-Hashima and Maibara railway stations because of the storm.[39] More than 300 houses were flooded while several landslides were reported since the storm's landfall in southern Japan. Also, since the storm was moving unusually slow, it worsened the condition.[40] NHK confirmed that the number of dead was 27, the number of injured was 106 and the number of missing was 49.[41] Some 700 houses were completely inundated by the floodwaters spawned by Talas in eastern and western Japan and about 9,500 households in nine prefectures across the nation were without power after power outages. More than 400 flights were cancelled leaving some 34,000 stranded.[42] Most of the devastation occurred in Osaka, where a flooded river washed away two complete houses and a landslide destroyed four houses. Extremely heavy rainfall of as high as 170 centimetres (67\u00a0in) was dumped over Osaka since Talas approached Japan.[43] The heavy rainfall triggered obvious flooding in the rivers, but so extreme that an entire bridge was washed away.[44] I have to think about how to help the people of the town deal with this disaster. Only after that can I think about my family. I hope that I can find my wife soon to send off my family with my daughter. Talas poured record rainfall across the nation stranding thousands, turning towns into lakes and washed away cars, setting off mudslides.  The storm also damaged the Nij\u014d Castle, a flatland castle located in Kyoto, Japan.[46] On September 5, Japanese rescue workers started digging through the debris to look for the missing since the number of missing is unusually high.[47] Death toll continued to rise after the intense mudslides and flooding triggered by Talas. CNN reported that local authorities raised the death toll to 29 and the number of missing to 56. The Japanese government started an emergency search-and-rescue operation to begin reconstruction of damaged communities and to find those missing.[48] Ever since the typhoon approached land, Talas continuously dumped heavy rain over the Wakayama, Nara and Mie prefectures turning a large portion of the area to swamps. More than 750 Self-Defense Forces have been deployed in order to help local police and firefighters with the rescue and search operations. Talas broke a record of 1,322 millimetres (52.0\u00a0in) rainfall that fell on the southern town of Takachiho in Miyazaki Prefecture in September 2005. Talas's rainfall also exceeded the year round average of rainfall that falls over the city of Tokyo.[49] Most of the deaths were reported in Wakayama Prefecture where at least 17 people are reported to have been killed. The typhoon caused most of the substantial damage in the Kii Peninsula, that is located just a few hundreds of kilometers south of the tsunami-ravaged coast. As of 2023, landslides and infrastructure damage are still highly evident throughout the Kii peninsula, including damage to the Kumano Kodo World Heritage sites.[2] The death toll continued to rise rapidly and on the same day, Kyodo News updated the number of deaths to 32 and the number of missing to 57.  Japan's newly elected Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda said \"We will do everything we can to rescue people and search for the missing\".[50] Both remnants of Talas and the outflow of Tropical Storm Noru together brought heavy rainfall of over 400\u00a0mm in Hokkaido.[51] Electric and telephone lines in Mie, Nara and Wakayama prefectures were damaged, leaving some 194,000 households in the Kansai Electric Power Company's area with power outages.[52] On September 6, aid-laden helicopters landed in the hardest-hit areas while police, firefighters and soldiers started clearing roads and debris so that they could distribute food, medicine and other assistance.[53] However, thousands of people remained isolated for a long time because of the bad conditions of the roads, that prevented rescue workers from quickly reaching the victims. Relief materials such as canned food, rice balls, and drinking water were being supplied to the victims since the operation was started.[54] Talas death toll continued to rise rapidly since the landfall. On September 7, the death toll was said to have increased to 40 with 50 people still missing.[55] Later the same day, death toll continued to rise and reached 54 after reports from the search and rescue operations listed more people as dead.[56] Soon, Air Worldwide reported that the total losses caused by Talas in Japan could have exceeded US$600 million.[57] On September 8, the death toll rose to 59, while 50 others were still missing. Hundreds more remained stranded after several roads were damaged by the typhoon.[58]"

        "content": " Effects Other wikis Hurricane Mitch was the second-deadliest tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin on record. Mitch caused 11,374 fatalities in Central America in 1998, including approximately 7,000 in Honduras and 3,800 in Nicaragua due to cataclysmic flooding from the slow motion of the storm. It was the deadliest hurricane in Central American history, surpassing Hurricane Fifi\u2013Orlene, which killed slightly fewer people in that area in 1974. Mitch was the deadliest Atlantic hurricane in the satellite era, and the second-deadliest on record in the Atlantic, only behind the Great Hurricane of 1780 which killed at least 22,000 people. The thirteenth named storm, ninth hurricane, and third major hurricane of the 1998 Atlantic hurricane season, Mitch formed in the western Caribbean Sea on 22 October, and after responding to extremely favorable conditions, it rapidly strengthened to peak at Category\u00a05 status, the highest possible rating on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale. After drifting southwestward and weakening, the hurricane hit Honduras as a minimal Category 1 hurricane. Mitch roved through Central America, regenerated in the Bay of Campeche, and ultimately impacted Florida as a strong tropical storm. It then became extratropical and accelerated northeastward across the North Atlantic, before dissipating on 9 November. At the time, Mitch was the strongest Atlantic hurricane observed in the month of October, though it has since been surpassed by Hurricane Wilma of the 2005 season. In addition, Mitch is the eighth-most intense Atlantic hurricane on record, tied with Hurricane Dean in 2007 in terms of pressure. Being \"the deadliest Atlantic hurricane\" in over 200 years,[1] Mitch caused catastrophic impacts across its path, but the most disastrous impacts came from Honduras, which suffered over half of the total deaths. The president of Honduras, Carlos Roberto Flores, estimated that Mitch set back about 50\u00a0years of economic development. The storm wrecked about 35,000\u00a0houses and damaged another 50,000, leaving up to 1.5\u00a0million people homeless, about 20 percent of the country's population. Mitch directly caused $2.005\u00a0billion in damage,[nb 1] with an additional $1.8\u00a0billion in indirect costs. Most of the damage were ruined crops, and cash crop exports were cut by 9.4 percent in 1999, largely due to the storm. Over 70 percent of the transportation infrastructure was damaged, mostly damaged highways and bridges. Widespread areas experienced power outages, and about 70 percent of the country lost its water sources after the storm. In Tegucigalpa, a large landslide affected three neighborhoods and formed a temporary dam. Throughout the country, there were at least 7,000\u00a0fatalities, some reported in each department. Following the storm, officials in Honduras requested international assistance, which totaled $2.8\u00a0billion over a several-year period. Despite this, the gross domestic product began decreasing at the end of 1998, and contracted by 1.9 percent in 1999. Officials enacted a widespread curfew following the storm, and for 15\u00a0days temporarily restricted constitutional rights to maintain order. There were outbreaks of various diseases, and many residents faced food and water shortages. Due to the slow motion from 29 October to 3 November, Hurricane Mitch dropped historic amounts of rainfall in Honduras, Guatemala, and Nicaragua, with unofficial reports of up to 75 inches (1,900\u00a0mm). Deaths due to catastrophic flooding made it the second deadliest Atlantic hurricane in history after the Great Hurricane of 1780; at least 11,374\u00a0people were confirmed to have been killed with over 11,000 left missing by the end of 1998; the true death toll is unknown. Additionally, roughly 2.7 million were left homeless as a result of the hurricane. Total damages caused by the hurricane were estimated to be around $6\u00a0billion (1998 USD). The name \"Mitch\" was retired, and will not be used for another Atlantic tropical cyclone.[2]"

        "content": "Tropical Depression Thirteen formed on October\u00a022 over the southwestern Caribbean Sea, from a tropical wave that exited Africa on October\u00a010. It executed a small loop, and while doing so intensified into Tropical Storm Mitch. A weakness in a ridge allowed the storm to track slowly to the north. After becoming disorganized due to wind shear from an upper-level low, Mitch quickly intensified in response to extremely favorable conditions,[4] including warm waters and good outflow.[5][6] It became a hurricane on October\u00a024 and developed an eye.[7] After turning to the west, Mitch rapidly intensified, first into a major hurricane on October\u00a025 and then into a Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale the next day.[4] At peak intensity, Mitch maintained maximum sustained winds of 180\u00a0mph (290\u00a0km/h) while off the northern coast of Honduras. Hurricane Hunters reported a minimum barometric pressure of 905\u00a0mbar (26.7\u00a0inHg), which at the time was the lowest in the month of October and tied for the fourth lowest for any Atlantic hurricane. Initially, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) and various tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated a turn to the north, threatening the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. Instead, Mitch turned to the south, due to a ridge that was not observed while the storm was active.[4] Land interaction imparted weakening,[8] and the hurricane made landfall on Honduras on October\u00a029 with winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h).[4] While over land, Mitch moved slowly westward through Central America, while continuing to produce deep convection over waters.[9] The surface circulation dissipated on November\u00a01. The next day, the remnants of Mitch reached the Bay of Campeche. On November\u00a03, the remnants redeveloped into a tropical storm just off the coast of the Mexican state of Campeche, and a day later the storm made another landfall just north of the city of Campeche. Mitch accelerated to the northeast ahead of a cold front, moving across the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula and re-entering the Gulf of Mexico. The storm retained winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) before it made a final landfall near Naples, Florida on November\u00a05. Shortly after crossing the state, Mitch transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. The NHC tracked this storm until November\u00a09, when former Hurricane Mitch passed north of Scotland.[4]"

The greatest depth recorded was 12.5\u00a0m (41\u00a0ft) on the Ul\u00faa River near Chinda, whilst the greatest width recorded was 359\u00a0m (1,178\u00a0ft) on the R\u00edo Lean near Arizona. The rainfall also caused widespread mudslides across the mountainous country.[24] In the country's interior, particularly the southern portion, the high rainfall caused hundreds of landslides, many of them shallow and about 95% in the form of debris flow. However, two earthflows caused significant damage near Tegucigalpa.[25] Hurricane Mitch wrought significant damage to Honduras, affecting nearly the entire population and causing damage in all 18 departments.[23] The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean estimated that Mitch caused the worst floods of the 20th century in the country.[19] An estimated 70\u201380% of transportation network was destroyed, including most bridges and secondary roads,[11] amounting to $236\u00a0million in damage. Hurricane Mitch left widespread power outages after damaging more than 385\u00a0km (239\u00a0mi) of power lines and several power plants.[19] About 70% of Honduras lost access to fresh water after the storm, although many rural areas had already been experiencing water shortages.[23] The combined damage to transportation, communication, utilities, including power and water, was estimated at $665\u00a0million.[20] High water levels along the Choluteca River affected the capital, Tegucigalpa,[20] reaching levels 10\u00a0m (33\u00a0ft) above their banks.[23] The floods damaged about one-third of buildings, including some more than 350\u00a0years old.[11] Across Honduras, agriculture sustained serious damage, with initial estimates of 70% of crops destroyed.[11] About 50,000\u00a0bovine were killed, as were 60% of the fowl population.[20] Crop and agricultural damage totaled about $1\u00a0billion,[19] which would take the country years to recover.[11] Honduras's Social Fund for Housing estimated that 35,000\u00a0houses nationwide were destroyed with another 50,000\u00a0damaged,[20] leaving 1.5\u00a0million\u00a0people homeless \u2013 about 20% of the total population.[11] This was the highest number of victims from any natural disaster in Honduras's history.[23] Overall, Hurricane Mitch killed about 7,000\u00a0people in Honduras,[23] and damage was estimated at L52,345,000,000 ($3.8\u00a0billion),[20] of which $2.005\u00a0billion was from direct damages and the remainder from indirect costs. The overall impact represented about 70% of Honduras's annual gross domestic product (GDP).[19]"

The resulting mudslide ultimately covered an area 10 miles (16\u00a0km) long and 5 miles (8.0\u00a0km) wide.[11] Two million people in Nicaragua were directly affected by the hurricane.[11] Across the country, Mitch's heavy rains damaged 17,600 houses and destroyed 23,900, displacing 368,300 of the population.[27] 340 schools and 90 health centers were severely damaged or destroyed. Sewage systems and the electricity subsector were severely damaged, and, combined with property, damage totaled to $300\u00a0million (1998\u00a0USD).[28] Transportation was greatly affected by the hurricane, as well. The rainfall left 70% of the roads unusable or destroyed and greatly damaged 92\u00a0bridges.[29] Over 1,700 miles (2,700\u00a0km) of highways or access roads needed replacement subsequent to the storm, especially in the northern part of the country and along portions of the Pan-American Highway. Total transportation damage amounted to $300\u00a0million (1998\u00a0USD). Agricultural losses were significant, including the deaths of 50,000 animals, mostly bovines. Crops and fisheries were affected greatly as well, and, combined with agricultural losses, damage totaled to $185\u00a0million (1998\u00a0USD).[28] The situation was further compounded by a total of 75,000 live land mines\u2014left over from the Contra insurgency of the 1980s\u2014that were calculated to have been uprooted and relocated by the floodwaters.[30] In all, Hurricane Mitch caused at least 3,800 fatalities in Nicaragua, of which more than 2,000 were killed in the towns of El Provenir and Rolando Rodriguez from the landslide at the Casita volcano. The mudslide buried at least four villages completely in several feet of mud. Throughout the entire country, the hurricane left between 500,000 and 800,000 homeless. In all, damage in Nicaragua is estimated at $1\u00a0billion (1998\u00a0USD).[11]"

The schooner, which was sailing near the center of the hurricane, experienced over 50 feet (15\u00a0m) waves and over 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) winds, causing her to sink off the coast of Honduras.[31] On the south coast of Cuba, the hurricane caused waves of up to 13 feet (4.0\u00a0m) high and winds gusts peaking at 42\u00a0mph (68\u00a0km/h), causing numerous tourists and workers on the Isle of Youth and Cayo Largo del Sur to leave for safer grounds.[32] In Jamaica, where officials declared hurricane warnings 12\u00a0hours prior to its closest approach,[4] Mitch caused moderate rainfall and gusty winds for days. Strong waves hit western Jamaica, with wave heights unofficially estimated at nearly 7 feet (2.1\u00a0m) in height. The rainfall in outer rainbands, at times severe, flooded many roads across the island and left them covered with debris. One house in Spanish Town collapsed from the flooding, leaving four homeless. Many other homes and buildings were flooded, forcing many to evacuate. A river in northeastern Jamaica overflowed its banks, while heavy rainfall across the mountainous parts of the country caused numerous mudslides.[33] In all, Mitch killed three people on Jamaica.[11] On the Cayman Islands, the hurricane caused strong waves, gusty winds, and heavy rainfall at times. Damage was relatively minimal, amounting to blown out windows and beach erosion. Strong waves damaged or destroyed many docks on the south shore of the islands, and also sank one dive ship near Grand Cayman. In addition, numerous incoming and outgoing flights were cancelled.[34]"

The flooding washed away a few roads and bridges, and damaged numerous houses and schools, leaving thousands homeless.[35] The hurricane left three casualties in Panama.[11] In Costa Rica, Mitch dropped heavy rains, causing flash flooding and mudslides across the country, mostly in the northeastern part of the country.[11] The storm impacted 2,135 homes to some degree, of which 241 were destroyed,[14] leaving 4,000 homeless.[26] Throughout the country, the rainfall and mudslides affected 126 bridges and 800 miles (1,300\u00a0km) or roads, mostly on the Inter-American Highway which was affected by Hurricane Cesar, two years prior. Mitch affected 115\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (300\u00a0km2) of crop lands, causing damage to both export and domestic crops. In all, Hurricane Mitch caused $92\u00a0million in damage (1998\u00a0USD)[14] and seven deaths.[11] While drifting through El Salvador, the hurricane dropped immense amounts of precipitation, resulting in flash flooding and mudslides through the country. Multiple rivers, including the R\u00edo Grande de San Miguel and the Lempa River overflowed, contributing to overall damage. The flooding damaged more than 10,000 houses, leaving around 84,000 homeless[15] and forcing 500,000 to evacuate.[36] Crop damage was severe, with serious flooding occurring on 386\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (1,000\u00a0km2) of pasture or crop land. The flooding destroyed 37% of the bean production, 19% of the corn production, and 20% losses in sugar canes. There were heavy losses in livestock as well, including the deaths of 10,000 cattle. Total agricultural and livestock damaged amounted to $154 million (1998\u00a0USD). In addition, the flooding destroyed two bridges and damaged 1,200\u00a0mi (1,900\u00a0km) of unpaved roads. In all, Mitch caused nearly $400 million in damage (1998 USD) and 240 deaths.[15] Similar to the rest of Central America, Mitch's heavy rains caused mudslides and severe flooding over Guatemala. The flooding destroyed 6,000 houses and damaged 20,000 others, displacing over 730,000 and forcing over 100,000 to evacuate. In addition, the flooding destroyed 27 schools and damaged 286 others, 175 severely. Flooding caused major damage to crops, while landslides destroyed crop land across the country. The most severely affected crops for domestic consumption were tomatoes, bananas, corn, other vegetables, and beans, with damaged totaling to $48 million (1998 USD). Export crops such as bananas or coffee were greatly damaged as well, with damage amounting to $325 million (1998 USD). Damage to plantations and soil totaled to $121 million (1998 USD). The flooding also caused severe damage to the transportation infrastructure, including the loss of 37 bridges. Across the country, flooding damaged or destroyed 840 miles (1,350\u00a0km) of roads, of which nearly 400 miles (640\u00a0km) were sections of major highways. In all, Hurricane Mitch caused $748 million (1998 USD) and 268 deaths in Guatemala.[16] In addition, Mitch caused 11 indirect deaths when a plane crashed during the storm.[36] In Belize, the hurricane was less severe than initially predicted, though Mitch still caused heavy rainfall across the country.[36] Numerous rivers exceeded their crests, though the rainfall was beneficial to trees in mountainous areas.[37] The flooding caused extensive crop damage and destroyed many roads. Throughout the country, eleven people died because of the hurricane.[36] In Mexico, Mitch produced gusty winds and heavy rains on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, with Canc\u00fan on the Quintana Roo coast being the worst hit.[36] Nine people were killed from the flooding, though damage was relatively minimal.[11] The maximum 24-hour rainfall total from Mitch was 13.4 inches (340\u00a0mm) in Campeche,[38] while the highest rainfall total was 16.85 inches (428.0\u00a0mm) in Ciudad del Carmen.[39]"

Key West International Airport reported peak wind gusts of 55\u00a0mph (89\u00a0km/h) and sustained winds of 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h), the only report of tropical storm force in the state.[4] Offshore, the Fowey Rocks Light reported wind gusts of 73\u00a0mph (117\u00a0km/h).[40] In addition, Mitch caused moderate rainfall, peaking at 7 inches (200\u00a0mm) in Jupiter, though some estimates indicate localized totals of up to 10 inches (250\u00a0mm). The storm spawned five tornadoes over the state, the strongest of which was rated F2.[4] In the Florida Keys, multiple buildings that had been damaged by Hurricane Georges were leveled by Mitch.[11] Tornadoes from the storm damaged or destroyed 645 houses across the state, in addition to injuring 65\u00a0people.[4] Gusty winds left 100,000 without power during the storm's passage.[11] In all, Mitch caused $40\u00a0million in damage (1998\u00a0USD) in Florida and two deaths from drowning when two boats capsized.[4] As an extratropical cyclone, Mitch passed west of Ireland and the United Kingdom. In Ireland, the storm produced gusts as high as 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) and 30\u00a0ft (9.1\u00a0m) waves. The winds knocked down trees and power lines, leaving over 30,000\u00a0homes without power. One tree fell onto a car in Louth, severely injuring the driver. In Dublin, high winds knocked the roof off of a building, and several other buildings nationwide were damaged. The storm caused airports to close and ferry service to be suspended.[41]"

        "content": "As a result of the extreme damage and loss of life caused by Hurricane Mitch, the name Mitch was retired by the World Meteorological Organization following this storm, and will never again be used for a North Atlantic tropical cyclone. It was replaced with Matthew for the 2004 season.[42] After the disaster, countries around the world donated significant aid, totaling $6.3\u00a0billion (1998\u00a0USD). Throughout Central America, which was recovering from an economic crisis that occurred in 1996, many wished to continue the growth of the infrastructure and economy. In addition, after witnessing the vulnerability to hurricanes, the affected governments endeavored to prevent such a disaster from occurring again.[43] Hundreds of thousands of people lost their homes, but many took this as an opportunity to rebuild stronger houses. With a new, structurally improved foundation, homes were redesigned to be able to withstand another hurricane. However, lack of arable crop land took away the jobs from many, decreasing an already low income even lower.[44] Following the passage of Mitch, disease outbreaks occurred throughout Central America, including cholera, leptospirosis, and dengue fever. Over 2,328 cases of cholera were reported, killing 34\u00a0people. Guatemala was most affected by the bacterium, where most of the deaths occurred from contaminated food. 450 cases of leptospirosis were reported in Nicaragua, killing seven people. There were over 1,357 cases of dengue reported, though no deaths were reported from the disease.[45] While stalling over the western Caribbean Sea, Mitch's strong winds produced strong waves, damaging local coral reefs. Later, the storm's immense rainfall led to runoff polluted with debris and fresh water. This resulted in diseases occurring within the coral. However, the hurricane's upwelling cooled the warm water temperatures, preventing significant bleaching and destruction of the coral reef.[46] Mitch caused such massive and widespread damage that Carlos Roberto Flores, the president of Honduras, claimed it destroyed fifty years of progress in the country.[11] Honduras, the country most affected by the hurricane, received significant aid for the millions impacted by the hurricane. Mexico quickly gave help, sending 700\u00a0tons of food, 11\u00a0tons of medicine, four rescue planes, rescue personnel, and trained search dogs. Cuba also volunteered, sending a contingent of physicians to the country.[47] The U.S. administration offered at first troops stationed in Honduras, and then withdrew them a few days after the storm. They also at first offered only $2\u00a0million (1998\u00a0USD) in aid, which came as a shock to residents, and president Carlos Roberto Flores alike. The U.S. later increased their offer to $70\u00a0million (1998\u00a0USD).[48] The Honduran government distributed food, water, and medical services to the hurricane victims, including the more than 4\u00a0million without water.[43] In addition, the country initially experienced a sharp increase in the unemployment rate, largely due to the destruction of crop lands. However, rebuilding provided jobs in the following years.[18] In Costa Rica, reconstruction after the hurricane increased the number of jobs by 5.9%, lowering the unemployment rate slightly.[14]"

The remnants of the storm persisted until November\u00a01, at which time it was absorbed by a cold front on the northern end of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. Throughout Central America, Katrina produced heavy rains, estimated up to 15\u00a0in (380\u00a0mm) in mountainous areas, triggering mudslides and flash flooding. Unlike Mitch, little damage resulted from Katrina and no fatalities were reported.

        "content": "Tropical Storm Katrina originated out of the remnants of a cold front tracking southward through the Caribbean Sea on October\u00a022. By October\u00a026, a broad area of low pressure, associated with disorganized shower and thunderstorm activity, developed over the southwestern Caribbean Sea. The following day, a surface low pressure became apparent after the system showed signs of rotation near the northern Panama coastline. On October\u00a028, a hurricane hunter flight into the circulation revealed a well-defined low pressure system and resulting in the system being declared Tropical Depression Fifteen while situated roughly 175\u00a0mi (280\u00a0km) east of Bluefields, Nicaragua.[2] The center of the newly classified depression was situated on the western edge of deep convection. The depression tracked slowly towards the northeast in response to the mid-level flow it was embedded within.[3] By the morning of October\u00a029, a tropical wave, tracking towards the west, began to interact with the depression and leading to forecasters discussing a possible merger of the two systems.[4] An upper-level anticyclone over the eastern Caribbean produced significant wind shear over the depression, preventing the center from moving under the deep convection. However, a large convective banding feature developed to the north of the system.[5] Several hours later, hurricane hunters flew through the storm and recorded surface winds of 40\u00a0mph (65\u00a0km/h) and a barometric pressure of 999\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.5\u00a0inHg), leading to the upgrade of the depression to a tropical storm.[6] At this time, the storm received the name Katrina and peaked in intensity.[2] By 0000\u00a0UTC on October\u00a030, the center of Katrina made landfall near Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua at peak intensity.[2] Within three hours, the storm weakened to a depression due to interaction with the mountains of Nicaragua and convection was limited to a small area on the western side of the center of circulation.[7] Katrina continued to track over Central America for most of October\u00a030 and began to accelerate. Roughly 24\u00a0hours after landfall, the depression moved back over water, in the Gulf of Honduras;[2] however, by this time, there was no convection remaining around the system.[8] The acceleration of the storm was due to a regeneration of the low-level circulation northward.[9] Due to unfavorable conditions, the weakened system failed to regenerate convection before moving back over land near the northern Belize-Mexico border.[2] Around this time, forecasters reported that the depression would re-intensify once in the Gulf of Mexico before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone.[10] Although situated over land, the depression began to regenerate convection, leading to increased rainfall over the Yucatan Peninsula.[11] By the evening of November\u00a01, the depression weakened again and moved into the Gulf of Mexico; however, unlike previous forecasts, the circulation was absorbed by a cold front hours later.[2]"

        "content": "Despite being a very weak storm, forecasters were wary about Katrina, as Central America was devastated by Hurricane Mitch exactly one year earlier. There was considerable fear of additional flash flooding and mudslides across the mountainous region.[12] Immediately after being declared a tropical depression, a tropical storm warning was issued for Nicaragua,[13] and it was extended to the San Andr\u00e9s islands of Colombia shortly afterward.[3] Officials in Honduras evacuated 71 families from the district of Col\u00f3n and another 17 families from other at-risk areas. Along the coastline of Honduras, a red alert was declared as torrential rains were anticipated to produce deadly mudslides in areas still recovering from Mitch nearly one year ago.[14] Overall, damage was minimal as a result of Katrina. Only a few small mudslides were reported, along with some minor flooding, as the storm tracked across Central America.[12] It was estimated that between 10 and 15\u00a0inches (250 to 375\u00a0mm) of rain fell across parts of the region as a result of Katrina,[15] with one report of 3.58\u00a0inches (91\u00a0mm) in six hours from the island of San Andr\u00e9s east of Nicaragua.[2] Roughly 1,200 people were evacuated to emergency shelters in Honduras due to flooding. At least five bridges sustained damage and the cities of Tocoa and Trujillo were isolated as the Agu\u00e1n and Siline rivers overflowed their banks.[16] The water pipes recently constructed after being destroyed by Hurricane Mitch, worth HNL 170,000 (US$9,000) were once again destroyed by Katrina.[17] The most severely affected area in Honduras was the Valle del Agu\u00e1n.[18] Between October\u00a030 and November\u00a01, the remnants of Katrina produced widespread moderate rainfall across the Yucatan Peninsula, peaking at 6.32\u00a0in (161\u00a0mm) in Cunduac\u00e1n.[19] Moisture from the remnants of the storm enhanced rainfall across southern Florida in association with the cold front that absorbed the system.[20] Already saturated by previous rains, the National Weather Service issued flood watches for the region as torrential rains were expected to fall in relation to the system.[21] Following the storm, the United Nations deployed field assessment teams to survey the damage caused by Katrina. The International Organization for Migration helped relocate affected families and construct at least 300 new residences for victims of Katrina and Hurricane Mitch the year prior. The Pan American Health Organization also deployed assessment teams to survey the area for the possibility of post-storm diseases.[16] Due to the lack of any significant damage, the name Katrina was not retired and was re-used in the 2005 season; however, due to the catastrophic damage caused by the storm, it was retired in 2006 and was replaced with the name Katia.[22][23]"

        "content": " Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm Nilofar was, at the time, the third-strongest cyclone in the Arabian Sea. In late October 2014, it reached peak maximum sustained winds estimated between 205\u00a0km/h (125\u00a0mph) and 215\u00a0km/h (130\u00a0mph). The India Meteorological Department (IMD) named it Nilofar; the name refers to the water lily, and was suggested by Pakistan.[1] The western fringes of the storm caused flash flooding in northeastern Oman, killing four people. Nilofar originated from a low-pressure area between India and the Arabian Peninsula. It developed into a depression on October\u00a025 and moved generally northward through an area of favorable conditions. The system intensified into a cyclonic storm on October\u00a026. Quickly organizing due to the conditions, Nilofar developed a well-defined eye and structure, attaining its peak intensity on October\u00a028. At the time, Nilofar was expected to make landfall in western India, prompting evacuations and preparations. However, high wind shear caused the storm to rapidly weaken, and Nilofar degraded into a remnant low-pressure area on October\u00a031 off the Indian state of Gujarat."

        "content": "Toward the middle of October 2014, the monsoon trough was active over the Arabian Sea off the west coast of India. A circulation formed on October\u00a019 near the Lakshadweep archipelago, remaining nearly stationary for several days. It developed a distinct low-pressure area on October\u00a021,[2] and produced an intense area of convection by the next day. Despite moderate wind shear, conditions favored further development, including warm water temperatures and good outflow,[3] amplified by an anticyclone to its east-northeast.[2] The structure became more organized by October\u00a024, when broken rainbands were rotating around a poorly-defined circulation.[4] That day, the American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified it as a tropical depression, although the agency did not issue warnings at the time.[5] At 00:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a025, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) classified the system as a depression about 1270\u00a0km (790\u00a0mi) southeast of Muscat, Oman.[2] When the system first formed, it benefited from warm water temperatures of 28 to 30\u00a0\u00b0C (82 to 86\u00a0\u00b0F) and a favorable phase of the Madden\u2013Julian oscillation. Moderate wind shear and continued interaction with the monsoon dislocated the bulk of the deepest convection to the western periphery.[2] By 12:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a025, the system organized enough for the JTWC to classify it as Tropical Cyclone 04A, and there were hints of an eye feature within the thunderstorms. By the time of classification, the storm was moving to the northeast, steered by the subtropical ridge to the south,[6] although the motion slowed on October\u00a026 due to competing influence of another subtropical ridge to the northwest.[7] That day, the system strengthened quickly; the IMD upgraded the depression to a deep depression at 03:00\u00a0UTC, to Cyclonic Storm Nilofar at 06:00\u00a0UTC, and further to a severe cyclonic storm at 21:00\u00a0UTC.[2] At 00:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a027, the JTWC upgraded Nilofar to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane, based on the development of a 54\u00a0km (33\u00a0mi) eye.[8] Throughout that day, the cyclone turned more to the northwest as a ridge built to the east, while the inner core of convection became more symmetrical and compact. Also by that time, tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated that Nilofar would eventually recurve to the northeast and make landfall in western India.[9] At 06:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a027, the IMD upgraded Nilofar to a very severe cyclonic storm. The storm was rapidly intensifying at the time, after the wind shear had decreased,[2] and the eye contracted to a diameter of 19\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi).[10] At 09:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a028, the IMD upgraded Nilofar further to an extremely severe cyclonic storm.[2][nb 1] Six hours later, the JTWC estimated peak 1-minute winds of 215\u00a0km/h (130\u00a0mph);[5] at the time, the agency anticipated further strengthening due to the favorable conditions and good organization.[12] At 18:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a028, the IMD estimated peak 3-minute winds of 205\u00a0km/h (125\u00a0mph).[2] At the time, it was the third-strongest storm on record in the Arabian Sea.[13] On October\u00a029, Nilofar started weakening due to increased wind shear, and the convection diminished in intensity.[14] At the same time, the storm turned northeastward while rounding the ridge to the east.[15] Increasingly cooler and drier air, as well as cooler waters, caused the storm to degrade rapidly.[2] The eye, previously small and well defined, dissipated by 06:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a029.[16] Later that day, the center began decoupling from the convection, a sign of rapid weakening,[17] and by 21:00\u00a0UTC the IMD downgraded it to a severe cyclonic storm.[2] Early on October\u00a030, the JTWC downgraded Nilofar to a tropical storm,[18] and subsequently the circulation became exposed from the convection.[19] At 18:00\u00a0UTC that day, the JTWC posted their final advisory.[20] Nilofar weakened further into a depression on October\u00a031, and soon after degenerated into a remnant low off coast of the Indian state of Gujarat.[2]"

National Disaster Response Force deployed rescue and rehabilitation teams at Gandhidham, Dwarka, Porbandar, Veraval, Rajkot and Bhuj while standby teams were stationed at Ahmedabad and Vadodara.[29][30] After facing problems during deadly floods in September and Cyclone Hudhud in October, mobile companies enacted greater preparations during Nilofar to guarantee operations during the storm, including an emergency hotline, setting up internet in shelters, and mobile cell towers.[31] Despite the threat from the storm, Nilofar only produced light rainfall and gusty winds along the Gujarat coast.[26] Unseasonable rainfall damaged mangoes in Maharashtra, causing prices to rise.[32] Shifting air patterns brought cooler temperatures to western India, signaling the end of the monsoon season,[33] while also bringing haze and smog over Delhi from polluting areas to the south.[34] In Pakistan, fishermen were also warned to avoid the sea, and people in coastal areas were evacuated. The country's navy, coast guard, Pakistan Maritime Security Agency, and fishermen organizations helped rescue fishermen stationed offshore.[35] Along the coast of Sindh province, bathing and swimming were banned for several days.[36] There were minor power outages in Karachi due to heavy rainfall from Nilofar.[37]"

It began in early August for areas of the Midwest and western Great Lakes before spreading eastward and intensifying. It waned in most areas by the middle of the month, and although fairly short in duration compared with some other continental heat waves, it was very intense at its peak. The high humidity and high temperatures led to major heat wave that overtook the major Northeast Megalopolis. Temperatures in Central Park, New York City reached a peak of 103\u00a0\u00b0F (39\u00a0\u00b0C). The temperature reached 105\u00a0\u00b0F (41\u00a0\u00b0C) in Newark, New Jersey. Meanwhile, in Ontario and Quebec, extreme temperatures were also reported daily during the first week of August. Ottawa recorded its second-hottest day ever when the mercury approached 37.3\u00a0\u00b0C (99.1\u00a0\u00b0F) on August 9 and at the Toronto Airport it hit 38\u00a0\u00b0C (100\u00a0\u00b0F) on the same day, the hottest day there since 1955 with four straight days topping 35\u00a0\u00b0C (95\u00a0\u00b0F). Numerous records were shattered during the heatwave. Even in Nova Scotia, surrounded by the relatively cool waters of the Atlantic Ocean, temperatures still broke 35\u00a0\u00b0C (95\u00a0\u00b0F) in some locations. Glace Bay, which has a sub-Arctic climate reached a record-breaking 35.5\u00a0\u00b0C (95.9\u00a0\u00b0F) on August 10. National Football League offensive tackle Korey Stringer suffered a heat stroke during the second day of the Minnesota Vikings preseason training camp and died as a result of complications on August 1, 2001.[1] At least four New Yorkers died of hyperthermia.[2] Chicago had at least 21 deaths.[3]"

Lidia moved generally north, and reached its maximum windspeed of 50\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h).[1] Despite encountering warm sea surface temperatures, which are generally favorable for intensification, Lidia slowly weakened as it moved towards the southern portion of the Baja California Peninsula. The tropical cyclone passed over the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula at 17:00 UTC on October 7; at the time of the landfall Lidia was located about 67\u00a0mi (108\u00a0km) northwest of Cabo San Lucas.[2] Two\u00a0hours later,[3] Lidia entered the Gulf of California, and turned to the northeast.[1] Lidia made landfall on the shores of Sinaloa about 23\u00a0mi (37\u00a0km) south of Los Mochis on October 8, with winds of 45\u00a0mph (75\u00a0km/h).[3] At 06:00 UTC that day, the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center ended advisories as the tropical cyclone dissipated inland about 17\u00a0mi (27\u00a0km) northeast of that same place.[3] The remnants of Lidia continued their northeast track, moving over Mexico, and ultimately tracked across the Southern United States, spurring a new frontal wave.[4]"

It also contaminated the water supply in Culiac\u00e1n, leaving many without clean drinking water.[9] Almost a hundred villages were flooded,[8] as were two dams.[10] The Rio Fuerte burst its banks and flooded sixty settlements. It also forced evacuations, which were enforced by the Mexican Army.[8] Mexican Federal Highway 15 was closed due to the storm, as was the Pacific Railroad. The highway was reopened shortly after the storm passed.[9] Nationwide, 100 people were killed.[11] This was enough to make it the deadliest tropical cyclone of its season;[3] most of the casualties occurred in rural areas.[12] A few days later, Hurricane Norma struck similar areas as Lidia escalated the devastation.[3] During the aftermath of the storm, food and clothing was brought to towns isolated by the storm. In Culiac\u00e1n, churches, schools, and a baseball stadium served as temporary shelters for displaced persons.[9] Rescue workers also searched for bodies of victims of both Lidia and the subsequent Hurricane Norma, which hit the same area a few days later. Due to the damage wrought by both Lidia and Norma, Sinaloa Governor Antonio Toledo Corro, declared his state a disaster area. He also asked the Mexican Federal Government for aid.[13] Moisture from the remnants of Tropical Storm Lidia spread over extreme southeastern Arizona.[14]"

It moved to the north-northwest, passing by the Yucatan peninsula before turning to the east in the central Gulf of Mexico on October 1. That day, a reconnaissance aircraft in the system reported gale-force winds and, as a result, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm How. The storm strengthened to just below hurricane force, making landfall near Punta Gorda, Florida with 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) winds (115\u00a0km/h). While it crossed the state, the center was not very organized, and consequently the strongest winds were in the south and southeastern portion of the storm; heavy rains, however, fell across its path.[1] Tropical Storm How emerged into the Atlantic Ocean near Vero Beach, quickly intensifying to hurricane strength by October 3. Turning northeastward, Hurricane How reached peak winds of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) on October 4 as it passed near the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Subsequently, the hurricane embarked on a slow weakening trend, as it briefly posed a threat to New England. It passed southeast of Cape Cod before turning more to the east-northeast. It became an extratropical storm on October 7, and the next day the remnants of How dissipated in the far northern Atlantic.[1]"

Nevertheless, heavy rainfall occurred along its path.[1] The highest total was 15.7 inches (40\u00a0cm) near Bonita Springs, near where it moved ashore.[3] Elsewhere, Fort Myers reported 10.43 inches (26.5\u00a0cm), while Clewiston along the western shore of Lake Okeechobee received about 10 inches (25\u00a0cm); the lake rose about 4 inches (10\u00a0cm) from the rainfall, but no overflow was expected. Elsewhere, the precipitation caused some significant street flooding, while about 7,000 acres (28\u00a0km2) of tomato and bean fields were deluged.[2] Further north, the hurricane threatened to strike or move very close to the Outer Banks. Hurricane warnings were posted from Cape Hatteras to Manteo, and ships were advised to remain at port.[4] Hurricane How produced 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) winds and high tides along the Outer Banks and southeastern Virginia. Some minor damage was reported, and two ships were washed ashore.[5] In New England, the Weather Bureau issued storm warnings from Block Island, Rhode Island to Portland, Maine, with rains, fog, and heavy surf reported. Several roads were closed in Massachusetts due to the tides.[5] Offshore, a ship called Southern Isle was wrecked by the high surf. It had been sailing from Puerto Rico with a full load of iron ore and, as it approached the hurricane, the vessel changed directions and slowed. By October 5, winds were strong and the seas were moderately rough. Very quickly, the ship broke into two, which prevented any time to escape on lifeboats.[6] By the day after the wreck, rescue boats and helicopters found seven people, one of whom later died from their injuries.[7] Ultimately, 17\u00a0people died in the event.[6] Overall, Hurricane How caused about $2\u00a0million (USD) in damage. It was the only storm to strike the United States during the year, and consequently, 1951 had the least tropical cyclone damage in the United States since the 1939 season.[1]"

        "content": " Tropical Storm Flossie yielded stormy weather to Hawaii in late July\u00a02013. The sixth tropical cyclone and named storm of the annual hurricane season, Flossie originated from a tropical wave that emerged off the western coast of Africa on July\u00a09. Tracking westward across the Atlantic with little development, it passed over Central America and into the eastern Pacific Ocean on July\u00a018, where favorable environmental conditions promoted steady organization. By 0600\u00a0UTC on July\u00a025, the wave acquired enough organization to be deemed a tropical depression; it intensified into a tropical storm six hours later. Continuing westward, Flossie attained peak winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) on July\u00a027 before entering the central Pacific Ocean. There, unfavorable upper-level winds established a weakening trend; on July\u00a030, Flossie weakened to a tropical depression, and by 1200\u00a0UTC that same day, the storm degenerated into a remnant low, northeast of Kauai. In advance of Flossie, tropical cyclone warnings and watches were placed into effect for various Hawaiian Islands. In addition, numerous flash flood watches were issued in fear of over a foot of precipitation. Ports and numerous facilities were closed to the public, and authorities opened shelters for refuge. Upon approach, Flossie threatened to become the first tropical storm to make a direct hit on Hawaii in two decades; however, the system weakened prior to doing so. Flossie brought high surf to the state, leading to minor beach erosion. Gusty winds exceeded tropical storm threshold, downing numerous power poles and trees; as a result, several thousand locals were without power for a few days. The storm produced several inches of rainfall across the island, with a peak of 9.27\u00a0in (235\u00a0mm) on Mount Waialeale. Though one man was injured due to lightnings, no fatalities were reported in association with Flossie. Damage totaled to $24,000 (2013 USD) as a consequence of lightning."

        "content": "On July\u00a09, 2013, a tropical wave emerged off the western coast of Africa. Tracking swiftly westward across the Atlantic, it passed across Central America on July\u00a018 and emerged into the eastern Pacific Ocean shortly thereafter.[1] Early on July\u00a021, a broad low-pressure area formed in association with the wave, and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring the disturbance for slow development into a tropical cyclone accordingly.[2] Shower and thunderstorm activity coalesced over the subsequent days, prompting the NHC to increase its chances for development to the high category;[3] despite this, satellite data from early on July\u00a024 did not reveal a well-defined circulation necessary for classification. By that evening, a combination of visible and microwave satellite imagery depicted an improvement of the vortex, and the system was upgraded to a tropical depression at 0000\u00a0UTC on July\u00a025, while situated 980\u00a0miles (1,575\u00a0km) west-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula.[1] The depression tracked west to west-northwest upon classification, steered by a mid-level ridge centered over the southwestern United States. Deep convection increased in coverage and intensity over the following hours, leading to an increase in satellite intensity estimates;[4] at 0600\u00a0UTC, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Flossie. Within an environment of low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures, Flossie gradually intensified over the next two days; a mid-level eye became observable in microwave imagery and intermittently on visible satellite imagery by early on July\u00a027. At 1200\u00a0UTC, the system attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 994\u00a0mb (hPa; 29.35\u00a0inHg). Thereafter, Flossie crossed the 140th meridian west into the central Pacific Ocean, where the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) assumed responsibility of the system. Unfavorable upper-level winds in association with an upper-level trough began to impede the system's organization around this time, and it began a slow weakening trend.[1] In conjunction with high wind shear, marginal ocean temperatures caused deep convection in association with Flossie to weaken and become ragged; as a result, the forecast called for continued weakening.[5] Instead, a brief reprieve in upper-level winds allowed the system to intensify to a secondary peak of 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h) by 1200\u00a0UTC on July\u00a028. An anticyclone northwest of the system increased shear atop the system once again by the following day, and dry air began to become ingested into the circulation.[6] The low-level vortex became exposed to view and progressively ill-defined as outflow boundaries in association with a previous convective burst impeded on the low.[7][8] At 0000\u00a0UTC on July\u00a030, Flossie was downgraded to a tropical depression; after the circulation became indistinguishable on satellite imagery twelve hours later, the system was declared a remnant area of low pressure. At this time, the vortex was centered near the northern coast of Kauai.[1]"

Hawaii Governor Neil Abercrombie signed an emergency proclamation. Three ports were closed, including two on the Big Island and one on Maui.[13] Under the anticipation that Flossie would become the first tropical storm to make landfall in the state since 1992, authorities opened 11 shelters across the state, including four on Maui and seven on Oahu.[14] In total, 177\u00a0persons used these shelters.[15] A scheduled water outage in Hanalei and Waipa was postponed due to the storm.[16] While still offshore, Flossie brought high surf to much of the state.[17] Upon passing narrowly by the island, gusty winds downed trees and power lines: Kahului reported a peak wind gust of 47\u00a0mph (76\u00a0km/h) during Flossie. More than 10,000\u00a0residences were without electricity across the state, with most outages concentrated in Maui and Big Island.[1] Heavy rains impacted several islands; rainfall rates of 3 to 4\u00a0in (76 to 102\u00a0mm) an hour were recorded in Haleakal\u0101.[18] Along the eastern side of Maui, a total of 5.3\u00a0in (130\u00a0mm) was reported in the Kaupo Gap,[19] while a storm-total peak of 9.27\u00a0in (235\u00a0mm) was observed on Mount Waialeale.[1] One man was injured in Maui due to lightning.[20] Damage from lightning across the state amounted to $24,000.[21] Six vehicle accidents were reported and several roads required closure, but overall, damage from Flossie was relatively minor.[22][23]"

Initially, the storm developed with sustained winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h), skipping tropical depression status. It remained stationary and quickly intensified into a hurricane. Martha attained maximum sustained winds of 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) on November\u00a022. Subsequently, Martha weakened and drifted southward. On November\u00a024, Martha made landfall in Veraguas Province, Panama, as a strong tropical storm. The system weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated over land on November\u00a025. Because the storm weakened prior to landfall, strong winds were not expected or reported in the impacted countries. In Panama, more than 13 inches (330\u00a0mm) of precipitation may have fallen in some areas. Agricultural land was flooded in Almirante, Bocas del Toro and streets became inundated in low-lying areas of Puerto Armuelles, Chiriqu\u00ed. The storm also brought significant rains to Costa Rica. Flooding and mudslides isolated most of the capital city of San Jos\u00e9. Numerous streets were inundated in Golfito.

Thus, Martha skipped tropical depression status. Centered about 100 miles (160\u00a0km) northeast of Bocas Town, Bocas del Toro, the storm remained stationary for 24\u00a0hours after tropical cyclogenesis. Martha immediately began deepening, becoming a hurricane at 0000\u00a0UTC on November\u00a022.[3] Operationally, the National Hurricane Center initiated advisories at 0300\u00a0UTC and erroneously indicated that it was a tropical depression and noted that conditions did not favor significant intensification.[4] Later on November\u00a022, a reconnaissance flight indicated Martha deepened to a compact hurricane,[2] and the tropical cyclone attained a maximum sustained wind speed of 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h).[3] Reconnaissance aircraft measured a minimum barometric pressure of 980\u00a0mbar (29\u00a0inHg),[5] though it was later corrected to 979\u00a0mbar (28.9\u00a0inHg) in the post-season analysis.[2][3] The eye feature was about 46 miles (74\u00a0km) wide and it was described as poorly organized, although convection was increasing.[6] After reaching peak intensity, Martha began drifting due south and slowly weakened. At 1200\u00a0UTC on November\u00a023, the tropical cyclone diminished to a tropical storm, after winds decreased to 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h)[3] and a reconnaissance flight recorded an increased barometric pressure of 999\u00a0mbar (29.5\u00a0inHg).[7] The storm maintained that intensity, and shortly before 1800\u00a0UTC on November\u00a024, Martha made landfall in rural Veraguas Province, Panama, about 10 miles (16\u00a0km) east of the mouth of the Calovebora River.[3] Operationally, winds were thought to be only 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) when the storm moved inland.[8] Martha was the only tropical cyclone on record to make landfall in Panama,[9] although it is possible that other Panama tropical cyclones were not detected.[2] The storm rapidly weakened inland, deteriorating to tropical depression status early on November\u00a025, twelve hours before dissipating over southern Ng\u00f6be-Bugl\u00e9 Comarca.[3]"

Since Martha was a relatively weak tropical cyclone, flash floods were emphasized as the greatest threat.

As a result, at least half of agricultural land in Almirante, Bocas del Toro was flooded, causing extensive crop damage. In Puerto Armuelles, Chiriqu\u00ed, persistent rainfall led to street flooding and inundated other areas. Similar conditions were reported in Golfito, Costa Rica.[13] The effects of Martha resulted in five deaths, all of which occurred in Costa Rica.

        "content": "Prior to the advent of modern tropical cyclone tracking technology, notably satellite imagery, many hurricanes that did not affect land directly went unnoticed, and storms that did affect land were not recognized until their onslaught. As a result, information on older hurricane seasons was often incomplete. Modern-day efforts have been made and are still ongoing to reconstruct the tracks of known hurricanes and to identify initially undetected storms. In many cases, the only evidence that a hurricane existed was reports from ships in its path, and judging by the direction of winds experienced by ships, and their location in relation to the storm, it is possible to roughly pinpoint the storm's center of circulation for a given point in time. This is the manner in which all of the eleven known storms in the 1906 season were identified by hurricane expert Jos\u00e9 Fern\u00e1ndez-Partag\u00e1s's reanalysis of hurricane seasons between 1851 and 1910. Partag\u00e1s also extended the known tracks of three other hurricanes previously identified by scholars. The information Partag\u00e1s and his colleague uncovered was largely adopted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Atlantic hurricane reanalysis in their updates to the Atlantic hurricane database (HURDAT), with some slight adjustments. HURDAT is the official source for such hurricane data as track and intensity, although due to a sparsity of available records at the time the storms existed, listings on some storms are incomplete.[2][3] The season's activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 163, the highest total since 1893. ACE is a metric used to express the energy used by a tropical cyclone during its lifetime. Therefore, a storm with a longer duration will have high values of ACE. It is only calculated at six-hour increments in which specific tropical and subtropical systems are either at or above sustained wind speeds of 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h), which is the threshold for tropical storm intensity. Thus, tropical depressions are not included here.[4]"

At the beginning of April 2016, more than 100 people died from heat.[6] In the three Indian cities of Delhi, Telangana and Odisha\u00a0more than 600 died in just one month.[21] In the region of Bihar, 180 people died, and a large number were affected by heat stroke.[22] The National Disaster Management Authority Government of India shows that 1,111 died because of the heat wave in 2016.[17]"

Seven of the city's eight radio stations were still off-the-air the next morning.[6] Up to 97 percent of Northern States Power customers in Eau Claire were left without power following the storm.[7] After seven days, 20,000 customers still had no power.[1] By 10\u00a0p.m., with the most intense part of the storm winding down, the area of low pressure was directly over western Wisconsin. Behind the low, air had cooled considerably, with the Twin Cities reporting temperatures in the upper 60s (\u00b0F). In addition to being tremendously destructive, the storm was considerably long-lived.

Thus, many farmers had to pay hundreds or thousands of dollars in assessments to cover the final losses of the insurance company."

Approximately $3.3M of public property in Eau Claire County was damaged in the storm. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) would have covered that entire amount in theory. But at some point that year, the rule was changed on what FEMA would cover, which amounted to only 75%. That left better more than $800,000 for Wisconsin to pay. No one notified the states when the rule was changed. Theories for the change in coverage include the massive influx of Cubans into the country; the Mount St. Helens eruption of 18 May; the severe tornadoes in Grand Island, Nebraska in June; and flooding in western Pennsylvania during August. The federal government's budget was badly impacted by these and other disasters. In all, there were 22 major disaster declarations in 1980. Compounding problems for the state was that the storm occurred in an election year. Frustrated Wisconsin officials, including Governor Lee Dreyfus, were not prepared for the difficulty in dealing with the federal government during such a time."

In Kansas City, Missouri, the high temperature was below 90\u00a0\u00b0F (32\u00a0\u00b0C) only twice and soared above the century mark (100\u00a0\u00b0F or 38\u00a0\u00b0C) for 17\u00a0days straight; in Memphis, Tennessee, the temperature reached an all-time high of 108\u00a0\u00b0F (42\u00a0\u00b0C) on July 13, 1980, part of a 15-day stretch of temperatures above 100\u00a0\u00b0F (38\u00a0\u00b0C) that lasted from July 6 to 20. In Indianapolis, Indiana on July 15, the temperature reached 100\u00a0\u00b0F (38\u00a0\u00b0C) for the first time since 1954. In Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas, high temperatures exceeded 100\u00a0\u00b0F (38\u00a0\u00b0C) a total of 69 times, including a record 42 consecutive days from June 23 to August 3,[4] of which 28 days were above 105, and five days above 110.  The area saw 29\u00a0days in which the previous record high temperature was either broken or tied, including its all-time high when the temperature hit 113\u00a0\u00b0F (45\u00a0\u00b0C) on three consecutive days (June 26 and 27 at DFW Airport and June 28 at Dallas Love Field). Some 43% of American homes were without air conditioning in 1980.[5] Hurricane Allen briefly paused the heat wave in early August.[6] The 2011 North American heat wave would ultimately surpass the 1980 heat wave in terms of number of days with highs exceeding 100 (with 71 days)[4] and the highest-ever low temperature for a single day (86 degrees); however, that heat wave only had 40 consecutive days of temperatures exceeding 100 (two short of the record) and the 113 degrees of 1980 remains a DFW all-time high. The high temperatures of the 1980 heat wave were worse than 2011, as was its early start in June and its ultimate human toll. On the northern rim of the high pressure ridge, several severe long-lived windstorms called derechos formed. The most notable was the \"More Trees Down Derecho\" that occurred on July 5. It raced from eastern Nebraska to Virginia in 15\u00a0hours, killing six and injuring about 70. The Western Wisconsin Derecho of July 15 killed three, and caused extensive property damage."

        "content": " Tropical Storm Rumbia, known in the Philippines as Tropical Storm Toyang,  brought deadly flooding to the central and southern Philippines in November and December\u00a02000. The last of three consecutive tropical cyclones of at least tropical storm intensity to strike the Philippines, Rumbia began as a tropical depression on November\u00a027, gradually intensifying to reach tropical storm intensity the next day. Strengthening later stagnated, and Rumbia would weaken back to depression status as it made landfall on the central Philippines on December\u00a01. Though the Japan Meteorological Agency\u00a0(JMA) determined Rumbia to have dissipated on December\u00a02, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center\u00a0(JTWC) continued to monitor the system over the next few days as it tracked across the South China Sea. For a period of time beginning on December\u00a05, Rumbia reorganized and strengthened back to tropical storm intensity before wind shear began to weaken the system. Located south of Vietnam on December\u00a07, the storm's circulation center became devoid of convection, and by then Rumbia was declared by the JTWC to have dissipated. In the Philippines, Rumbia caused roughly US$1\u00a0million in damage and 48\u00a0fatalities.[nb 1] Several transportation routes were suspended in the lead-up to the storm's landfall. As a result of the tropical storm, power outages occurred, especially in Surigao. Several towns and villages were flooded, displacing around 70,000\u00a0people and putting 4,100\u00a0people into temporary emergency sheltering."

        "content": "The predecessor to Rumbia developed as an area of convection on November\u00a025, southeast of Palau. The region of disturbed weather was connected with a weak low-pressure area. Embedded within the monsoon trough and tracking westward, the system organized, and as a result the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration\u00a0(PAGASA) designated the storm as Tropical Depression Toyang at 0000\u00a0UTC on November\u00a025. Six hours later, the PAGASA upgraded Toyang to tropical storm status,[1] though at the same time the JMA designated the system as a tropical depression.[2] Despite its cyclogenesis, Toyang maintained monsoonal characteristics for a prolonged period of time. At 1800\u00a0UTC on November\u00a028, the Japan Meteorological Agency\u00a0(JMA) officially upgraded the cyclone to tropical storm status;[2] the system's official name\u2013Rumbia\u2013was designated at that time.[1] Upon attaining tropical storm status, Rumbia was determined to have officially reached its peak intensity, with maximum sustained winds of 75\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 990\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.23\u00a0inHg).[nb 2][2] Concurrently, Rumbia's convection strengthened and increased in areal coverage, though persistent wind shear displaced much of the convection west of the circulation center.[1] At 1800\u00a0UTC on November\u00a030 (0200 on December\u00a001 Philippine Standard Time), the JMA weakened the system to tropical depression status; at the same time Rumbia made landfall over the Central Philippines.[3] Rumbia gradually weakened as it tracked across the archipelago, and on December\u00a01 the depression became quasi-stationary for a transient period of time in the Tablas Strait. The following day, Rumbia entered the South China Sea as a highly diffused system.[1] At 0600\u00a0UTC on December\u00a02, the JMA declared Rumbia to have dissipated,[2] while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center\u00a0(JTWC) continued to monitor the system as an active tropical cyclone.[3] Nonetheless, Rumbia remained highly disorganized, with multiple low-level circulation centers. Over the next few days, as the cyclone continued to track in a general westward direction, persistent inhibiting factors including the entrainment of cold air and wind shear prevented Rumbia from redeveloping. As a result, the depression was anticipated to gradually weaken until dissipation. On December\u00a05, however, the cyclone moved into a favorable position under the axis of an upper-level ridge, allowing for Rumbia to intensify and regain tropical storm intensity at 1200\u00a0UTC while located 835\u00a0km (520\u00a0mi) southeast of Da Nang, Vietnam;[1] despite the recent strengthening the JMA still considered the storm to have already dissipated.[2] This period of strengthening was only temporary, as shearing conditions once again arose, weakening the system and thus resulting in its subsequent downgrade to tropical depression status late the following day. By December\u00a07, Rumbia's main circulation center had become devoid of convection,[1] and the JTWC issued their final warning on the system while the depression was located south of Vietnam.[3]"

Power outages also occurred there, as well as in several other provinces.[9] Landslides took place in the provinces of Bohol and Leyte.[6] As a result of rising floodwaters, 4,100\u00a0people were put into temporary sheltering.[10] Overall, the effects of Rumbia accrued US$1\u00a0million in damage and killed 48\u00a0people,[11] in addition to leaving 70,000\u00a0others homeless.[12]"

The hurricane was first detected as a tropical wave off the west coast of Africa on 29\u00a0August. Moving westward, the disturbance remained relatively weak until 6\u00a0September, when it was first classified as a tropical cyclone just west of the Windward Islands. The depression gradually intensified, reaching tropical storm intensity within the first six hours following tropical cyclogenesis. The cyclone intensified further to hurricane intensity by 8\u00a0September. Strengthening and organisation remained gradual until the storm reached the Gulf of Honduras, by which time it began to rapidly intensify, reaching Category\u00a04 hurricane intensity on 10\u00a0September. The hurricane subsequently made landfall in Belize City with maximum sustained winds of 130\u00a0mph (215\u00a0km/h). Moving across the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, the tropical cyclone weakened, and continued to do so when it moved across the Bay of Campeche. This track brought it to a second landfall north of Tampico, Mexico, as a tropical storm on 13\u00a0September. Once inland, the storm quickly weakened and dissipated later that day. Possibly due to celebrations of the anniversary of the defeat of Spanish conquerors by the British in 1798, there was little warning of the storm in British Honduras. At St. George's Caye, many structures were washed away by abnormally high tides and storm surge. Belize City was devastated, with the entire city being inundated with at least 5\u00a0ft (1.5\u00a0m) of water. Property on six streets was completely swept away, while overall 70% of the city was destroyed. Among the buildings severely damaged or demolished included many buildings and resident halls at St. John's College and the U.S. Embassy building; the Consul suffered fatal injuries during the collapse of the building. Further inland, severe damage to agriculture occurred. Overall, the storm left $7.5\u00a0million (1931\u00a0USD) in damage."

In this region the system became sufficiently organised to be classified as a tropical depression at 18:00\u00a0UTC that same day near Grenada.[4][5] Some six hours after its inception the depression strengthened to a tropical storm over the eastern Caribbean Sea. Owing to a lack of ship observations, data on the storm were scarce in that region. The first ship to identify the storm clearly was the tanker Geo H. Jones, which recorded strong winds in conjunction with rapidly decreasing barometric pressures late on 7\u00a0September.[4] As the storm remained west-northwest bound across the Caribbean,[5] more ships were able to record data on the cyclone.[2] It is estimated that at 18:00\u00a0UTC on 8 September, the tropical storm attained hurricane intensity. Intensification remained gradual until the hurricane moved into the Gulf of Honduras by 10 September, when the hurricane began to rapidly intensify. At 00:00\u00a0UTC on 10 September, the cyclone intensified into a Category\u00a02 hurricane. The storm strengthened further before reaching its peak intensity as a Category\u00a04 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 130\u00a0mph (215\u00a0km/h) at 1800\u00a0UTC.[5] The strong hurricane made landfall on Belize City at the same intensity two hours later. A barometer in the city recorded a minimum pressure of 952\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.12\u00a0mbar); this was the lowest barometric pressure measured in association with the storm.[2] The hurricane substantially weakened over the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, and had weakened to tropical storm strength by the time it had entered the Bay of Campeche. Despite moving back over water, the tropical cyclone continued to weaken in the bay,[5] and made its final landfall roughly 60\u201370\u00a0mi (95\u2013110\u00a0km) north of Tampico, Mexico, with winds of 40\u00a0mph (65\u00a0km/h) at around 00:00\u00a0UTC on 13 September.[2] Over the mountainous terrain of Mexico, the storm quickly weakened, and dissipated later on 13 September.[5]"

In his column for The Belize Times on 5\u00a0September 2004, Emory King claimed that Belizean authorities withheld continuous warnings from U.S. ships in the region of a possible hurricane strike on British Honduras so the festivities would not be interrupted.[7] King cited as evidence a letter dated 24\u00a0September\u00a01931, from a local radio operator to the Colonial Secretary in which the warnings were discussed, adding that \"perhaps none of [the authorities] had ever been in a hurricane and didn't know exactly how bad it was going to be.\"[8] Additionally, there was also belief among residents of Belize City that the reefs would provide a barrier against large tidal waves.[9] Storm surge, abnormally high tides, and strong winds resulted in severe damage and many deaths in Belize City. The entire city was inundated with 5\u00a0ft (1.5\u00a0m) of water. Numerous boats were swept far inland, including a 200-ton dredge. Properties on six streets were completely swept away,[10] while 70% of the city overall was destroyed.[11] The U.S. Embassy building was severely damaged, after water reached the second floor. Giles Russell Taggart, the Consul, suffered injuries after the building collapsed that were ultimately fatal.[12] At St. John's College, several buildings and resident halls were extensively damaged or destroyed.[13] Government radio facilities in Belize City were cut out during the storm.[14] Several American priests in the city were killed during the storm.[15] Within a 25\u00a0mi (40\u00a0km) radius of Belize City and about 40\u00a0mi (64\u00a0km) upstream the Belize River, all agricultural plantations were obliterated.[16] Offshore at St. George's Caye, structures were completely destroyed, while 24\u00a0deaths occurred there.[17] Overall, damage in the country reached approximately $7.5\u00a0million.[2] The storm left approximately 2,500\u00a0deaths, making it the deadliest tropical cyclone in the history of Belize.[18] The British government requested for the United States to send vessels to assist those affected by the storm.[14] A number of residents of Belize City were left without food and water supplies.[13] The USS Swan (AM-34), stationed at nearby Trujillo, Honduras, was dispatched to send aid to British Honduras. United States President Herbert Hoover ordered the United States Navy and American Red Cross to cooperate in relief efforts. Both agencies and organisations ordered a United States Marine Corps plane from Managua, Nicaragua, to send $2,500\u00a0worth of medical supplies to affected areas of British Honduras.[14] Throughout the city, relief kitchens were set up. The Government of British Honduras eventually began burning areas with debris and bodies, to prevent spread of disease.[17] Monrad Metzgen, a lieutenant of the British Honduras Defense Force, became responsible for the rescue of persons trapped, feeding those without shelter, and the burial of the deceased. For his efforts, Metzgen received an Order of the British Empire award from King George V of the United Kingdom.[19] Authorities of Belize City considered abandoning the community and moving it to higher ground.[17] Additionally, there was a proposal to relocate the capital further south or inland to the pine ridge, with either resulting in a higher elevation of the capital.[20] However, the process of moving the capital did not begin until 1961, after Belize City was devastated by Hurricane Hattie. Belmopan became the capital city of British Honduras in 1970.[21][22] Due to the weak intensity of the storm and a rural landfall location in Mexico, there were few observations of weather related to the storm in the country. In Tampico, located south of where the storm made landfall, winds reached only 20\u00a0mph (32\u00a0km/h).[2]"

        "content": "Hurricane Gert was a large tropical cyclone that caused extensive flooding and mudslides throughout Central America and Mexico in September\u00a01993. The seventh named storm and third hurricane of the annual hurricane season, Gert originated as a tropical depression from a tropical wave over the southwestern Caribbean Sea on September\u00a014. The next day, the cyclone briefly attained tropical storm strength before moving ashore in Nicaragua and proceeding through Honduras. It reorganized into a tropical storm over the Gulf of Honduras on September\u00a017, but weakened back to a depression upon crossing the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. Once over the warm waters of the Bay of Campeche, Gert quickly strengthened into a Category\u00a02 hurricane by September\u00a020. The hurricane made a final landfall on the Gulf Coast of Mexico near Tuxpan, Veracruz, with peak winds of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h). The rugged terrain disrupted the cyclone's structure; Gert entered the Pacific Ocean as a depression near the state of Nayarit on September\u00a021, where it briefly redeveloped a few strong thunderstorms before dissipating at sea five days later. Gert's broad wind circulation produced widespread and heavy rainfall across Central America through September\u00a015\u201317. Combined with saturated soil following Tropical Storm Bret's passage a month earlier, the rain triggered widespread floods and mudslides that isolated thousands of people across numerous communities. In Costa Rica, blustery weather destroyed a national park and led to significant losses in the agricultural and tourism sectors. Much of the Mosquito Coast of Nicaragua and Honduras endured overflowing rivers, engulfing cities, villages, and crops with mud and water. Gert's winds were at their strongest upon landfall in Mexico, yet the worst effects in the country were also due to freshwater flooding after an extreme rainfall event in the Huasteca region resulted in water accumulations as high as 31.41 inches (798\u00a0mm). An increasing number of major rivers burst their banks over a period of several days, fully submerging extensive areas of land around the P\u00e1nuco basin. Tens of thousands of residents were forced to evacuate as raging floodwaters demolished scores of structures in what was described as the region's worst disaster in 40\u00a0years. In Gert's wake, the road networks across the affected countries remained severely disrupted for extended periods of time, hampering rescue missions and relief efforts in badly flooded regions. National governments and emergency workers opened shelters and distributed food for the thousands that had lost their homes and sources of income in the storm. Throughout Central America and Mexico, Gert claimed the lives of 116\u00a0people and left 16 others missing. The disaster left swaths of private property, infrastructure, and farmland in complete ruins, amounting to damage costs of more than $170\u00a0million (1993\u00a0USD). Despite the excessive damage and catastrophic loss of life caused by the storm, the name Gert was not retired following the season, and was used again in the 1999 Atlantic hurricane season."

        "content": "Hurricane Gert had a complex lifespan as a large and slow-moving tropical cyclone, repeatedly interacting with nearby landmasses and other atmospheric systems. Its genesis was traced to a tropical wave\u2014an area of low pressure oriented north to south\u2014that moved off the African coast to the south of Dakar on September\u00a05, 1993. The wave tracked westward across the tropical Atlantic at a rapid pace and relatively low latitudes, where its interaction with the Intertropical Convergence Zone fostered the formation of convection. On its approach to the Caribbean, the system developed a weak low-pressure center at sea level, which crossed Trinidad on September\u00a011. Although most of the cloud field brushed over the northern coast of South America, the system survived its contact with land and emerged over the southwestern Caribbean Sea on September\u00a013.[1] There, owing to favorable tropospheric conditions aloft, the wave showed signs of cyclonic development, as its convection thickened into curved, well-defined bands. Given these structural changes alongside a defined surface circulation, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center (NHC) classified the system as a tropical depression at 1800\u00a0UTC on September\u00a014, when it was located 105 miles (169\u00a0km) north of the Atlantic coast of Panama.[1][2] From its inception onwards, the depression exhibited a rather large wind field on satellite images and radiosonde data.[1] Its broad cloud pattern gradually coalesced, and by 0900\u00a0UTC on September\u00a015, the NHC had determined it sufficiently strong to be upgraded to Tropical Storm Gert.[3] The center of the storm proceeded west-northwestward, moving ashore near Bluefields, Nicaragua, with winds of 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h) at 1800\u00a0UTC.[1][4] Gert's interaction with land impeded additional strengthening; the storm weakened back to a tropical depression just six hours after its landfall. While the storm's center remained land-bound for nearly two days, parts of its large circulation abutted the adjacent Caribbean and Pacific waters to draw in moisture and heat. As such, Gert retained its status as a tropical cyclone on its journey northwestward across the terrains of Nicaragua and Honduras.[1] In doing so, the storm consistently defied the NHC's forecasts for its imminent dissipation.[5][6] On September\u00a017, Gert finally exited the coast, accessed the waters of the Gulf of Honduras and restrengthened to a tropical storm. Its duration over water\u2014and with that any opportunity for additional strengthening\u2014was curtailed by a mid- to upper-level trough over the eastern Gulf of Mexico; it turned the storm to the north-northwest and brought it over the coast of Belize the next day. Inland, Gert began to interact with a high-pressure ridge to its northwest, which nudged the storm slightly more to the west.[7] After crossing the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula and winding down over land,[8] Gert entered the Bay of Campeche offshore Champot\u00f3n as a tropical depression late on September\u00a018.[4][7] The open tropical waters, combined with light wind shear aloft, allowed the storm's convection to deepen and reconsolidate. At 0600\u00a0UTC the next day, Gert once more restrengthened into a tropical storm.[9] The storm veered toward the west and slowed slightly in response to a shortwave trough to its north,[10] granting it more time to mature over water.[7] On September\u00a020, data from a United States Air Force aircraft indicated that Gert had become a hurricane with maximum winds of 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h). Within hours, it attained its peak intensity as a Category\u00a02 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale, with sustained winds of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 970\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.64\u00a0inHg).[7] At about 2100\u00a0UTC on September\u00a020, Gert made its final landfall at peak intensity on the coast of Mexico, just north of Tuxpan, Veracruz. The hurricane accelerated and weakened quickly over the rugged mountains of the Sierra Madre Oriental, deteriorating into a tropical depression by September\u00a021. Despite its declining strength, the large circulation again remained intact as it crossed the country. Gert entered the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Nayarit later that day, where the NHC reclassified it as Tropical Depression Fourteen-E.[4][7] What remained of the deep convection waxed and waned in intensity; satellite estimates show the depression may have briefly regained tropical storm strength on September\u00a022. It proceeded on a west to west-northwestward track with sparse thunderstorms for two days. Once the last of this convection diminished, the shallow cyclone was swept up by low-level flow. Steered farther and farther southwest, the depression encountered increasingly cool ocean temperatures. With any chance at redevelopment thwarted, the system dissipated at sea on September\u00a026.[11][12]"

        "header": "Preparations",
        "content": "After confirming the development of a tropical depression, authorities in Costa Rica issued a green alert[nb 1] for coastal regions on September\u00a014.[14] The following day, a tropical storm warning was issued for the Atlantic coast of the country.[15] National television and radio stations broadcast warning messages to the public, and emergency crews were dispatched in case conditions were to warrant intervention. This helped with the effective and timely clearing of hospitals, as well as the evacuation of residents in high-risk zones.[14] A tropical storm warning was posted for the Atlantic coast of Nicaragua on September\u00a015, extending south from Puerto Cabezas to the adjacent islands.[15] In Honduras, early storm warnings allowed several hundred residents to evacuate well ahead of Gert's arrival.[16] Once it became evident that the storm would strike the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, coastal areas from Belize northward to Cozumel, Mexico, were placed under a tropical storm warning on September\u00a017 until Gert's landfall the next day.[4][15] While Gert was still located over the peninsula, the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm watch for the Gulf Coast from the city of Veracruz northward to Soto la Marina, Tamaulipas. By September\u00a018, it was upgraded to a tropical storm warning and extended southward to Minatitl\u00e1n, although the initial watch area was placed under a hurricane watch after Gert showed signs of strengthening. The next day, the tropical storm watch from Soto La Marina to Nautla was upgraded to a hurricane warning as it became clearer where Gert would make landfall.[4][15] Prior to impact, several ports along the Gulf Coast halted their operations, and people living in risk zones were evacuated.[17] All warnings and watches were discontinued after the hurricane moved inland.[15]"

        "content": "Gert was a large tropical cyclone for most of its lifespan; it always remained close enough to the coast to restrengthen and redevelop strong thunderstorms. In consequence, the storm produced heavy rainfall over a large area, causing extensive flooding and mudslides from Central America to Mexico. The disaster resulted in at least 116\u00a0deaths and 16\u00a0missing persons; damage to roads, property, crops and vegetation surmounted $170\u00a0million.[nb 2]"

        "header": "Costa Rica",
        "content": "Although Gert's center remained off the coast of Costa Rica, its large circulation produced brisk winds and heavy rainfall across the country. A local weather station recorded 13.1 inches (330\u00a0mm) of rain during the storm.[18] Geologically, the hardest-hit regions consisted of sedimentary layers with poor hydraulic conductivity and were therefore prone to soil saturation.[19] The initial rainfall raised the levels of many rivers, exacerbating the flood threat. The imminent overflow of the Tempisque River prompted wide-scale evacuations, though the river crested gradually without major consequences. After hours of prolonged rainfall, many Pacific regions such as Quepos, P\u00e9rez Zeled\u00f3n, and Osa experienced flooding and landslides, which inflicted moderate damage to roads and bridges.[14] The floods ruined about 500 acres (2.0\u00a0km2) of banana crop and damaged oil palm plantations. Small-scale farmers of reed, maize, beans, and rice were also affected. The storm disrupted local fishing and wrecked several small boats in Quepos.[20] High winds brought great destruction to about 65 percent of the vegetation in the Manuel Antonio National Park, vastly impacting the tourism-driven economy of Quepos.[19] Gert left moderate property damage in its wake; it destroyed 27\u00a0homes and otherwise damaged\u00a0659, mostly because of flooding. Overall costs totaled $3.1\u00a0million, of which $1.7\u00a0million was due to the impaired infrastructure.[21] Roughly 1,000\u00a0people sought shelter during the storm. Owing to the timely preparations in the country, only one cardiac arrest fatality was attributable to Gert when a landslide buried a home.[14][22]"

        "header": "Nicaragua",
        "content": "Moving ashore in Nicaragua a month after Tropical Storm Bret's passage, Gert caused excessive rainfall over already saturated regions.[23] Despite striking the Atlantic coast, the storm produced the largest amounts of precipitation over northern and Pacific coastal areas. A maximum of 17.8\u00a0in (450\u00a0mm) fell at Corinto; other significant totals include 17.6\u00a0in (450\u00a0mm) at Chinandega and 17.5\u00a0in (440\u00a0mm) at Le\u00f3n. The capital of Managua recorded 9.8\u00a0in (250\u00a0mm) of rain during the event.[24] Sustained winds from the storm reached no more than 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h) upon landfall near Bluefields,[4] though they downed trees and power lines and generated high waves of up to 12 feet (3.7\u00a0m) offshore.[25][26] After weakening to a depression inland, Gert continued to produce moderate gales along its path through the country.[25] Off the coast near Big Corn Island, rough surf and winds destroyed nine fishing boats. Two canoes with an unknown number of occupants disappeared at sea. Gert produced significant coastal flooding on moving ashore near Bluefields and Tasbapauni, prompting about 1,000\u00a0residents and hundreds of indigenous Miskito villagers to evacuate.[25] Farther inland, prolonged heavy rain caused numerous rivers to overflow, which led to disastrous freshwater flooding, especially in departments around Lake Nicaragua. Three tributaries of the Escondido River, one of which rose 32\u00a0ft (9.8\u00a0m) above normal, overflowed near the city of Rama.[27] Reaching heights of up to 40\u00a0ft (12\u00a0m), flood waters submerged 95 percent of the residential space, entering houses and vehicles and displacing 17,000 citizens. All crops in and around the city were lost in the deluge.[28][29] In the Rivas Department, the discharge from the Ochomogo River near the city of Rivas inundated several communities, while C\u00e1rdenas, a coastal community along the border with Costa Rica, endured several days of flooding rains.[27] Damage in the departments of Chontales and Boaco was considerable;[29] floods in Boaco killed five people and affected 6,000\u00a0others.[27] The affected regions endured widespread disruptions in transportation as landslides moved onto bridges and roads;[23] in Granada city, the isolation caused sanitation issues and led to the death of a pregnant woman who could not be transported to the hospital.[30] In total, Gert destroyed 252\u00a0houses and damaged another\u00a0293 across 14\u00a0of Nicaragua's departments;[23] the storm was also responsible for considerable infrastructural damage and economic losses.[27] As many as 123,000 people were affected throughout the country, and there were 37\u00a0confirmed fatalities.[31] The impact on the ecology was profound: rivers, estuaries, and mangroves in and around lakes Nicaragua and Managua, as well as the inhabiting fauna, suffered from severe erosion and siltation.[32] Since flooding from Tropical Storm Bret had occurred just one month earlier, an exclusive damage estimate for Gert is unavailable. The two storms inflicted a combined $10.7\u00a0million in damage, primarily to private property.[33]"

        "content": "Although it had weakened to a depression, Gert continued to drop significant rainfall while crossing Honduras. In Tegucigalpa, at least 6.77\u00a0in (172\u00a0mm) of rain were recorded.[34] Damaging floods swept through 13\u00a0of the country's 18 departments; however, northern Honduras and the Mosquitia Region, which had already endured the onslaught of Tropical Storm Bret in the previous month, bore the brunt of the devastation. The additional flooding from Gert affected 24,000\u00a0people in the region and made communication with surrounding areas nearly impossible.[16] Elsewhere, the rain filled several major rivers, including the Ul\u00faa;[35] many rivers across the Sula Valley had their banks destroyed, flooding much of San Pedro Sula\u2014the country's second-largest city\u2014and adjacent municipalities in the Cort\u00e9s Department. The rising water prompted many residents to evacuate, and the Ram\u00f3n Villeda Morales International Airport halted all of its operations.[16] The storm devastated Puerto Cort\u00e9s, one of the most important port cities in Central America.[36] Elsewhere in the Cort\u00e9s Department, a river in Choloma overflowed and triggered widespread flooding;[35] landslides in that area claimed the lives of six people.[37] In all, Gert wrought $10\u00a0million worth of damage to roads, bridges, and property.[34] The country's agriculture was devastated, losing about 5,700 acres (23\u00a0km2) of low-lying farmland with banana, sugar, and citrus crops.[16][38] The disaster affected 67,447\u00a0people, of which roughly 60\u00a0percent had to evacuate from their homes. In its final public statement, the government of Honduras confirmed 27\u00a0deaths, though 12 missing persons remained unaccounted for.[16]"

In one community, mudslides destroyed a major highway.[26] The R\u00edo Grande de San Miguel caused an excessive discharge of water just southwest of Usulut\u00e1n,[39] washing out about 2,500 acres (10\u00a0km2) of crops from adjacent plantations. Several other areas faced significant losses from the flooding, including San Marcos and San Vicente; some property and road damage occurred in San Miguel.[26] Although fishing operations were suspended at the height the storm, four Salvadorean fishermen disappeared at sea.[39] Overall, Gert affected nearly 8,000\u00a0residents and destroyed twelve homes in El Salvador;[26][39] officials there confirmed five drowning deaths related to the storm.[39] In Guatemala, torrential rains from Gert affected approximately 20,000\u00a0people and killed one girl. The agricultural sector in the country suffered substantial losses from the flooding, though there were no specific reports of material damage.[26] Gert moved ashore near Belize City as a minimal tropical storm, dropping rainfall in coastal areas. Just offshore, a weather station on Hunting Caye recorded 9.5\u00a0in (240\u00a0mm) during the event.[41] Despite the rain, only minor flooding occurred in Belize City.[42]"

        "header": "Mexico",
        "content": "While crossing the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, Gert dropped considerable rainfall in Quintana Roo; a 24-hour accumulation of 7.4\u00a0in (190\u00a0mm) was recorded at Chetumal, although higher localized totals of around 15\u00a0in (380\u00a0mm) fell elsewhere in the state.[12][34] Gusty winds briefly buffeted the coast during the storm's landfall, with a maximum wind speed of 44\u00a0mph (71\u00a0km/h) recorded in Chetumal.[7] The effects of the storm were limited to localized floods, however, which cut off one road to traffic and forced the inhabitants from low-lying areas in Chetumal and Felipe Carrillo Puerto to evacuate to higher ground.[43] Scattered showers also caused light flooding in parts of the state of Campeche, including Ciudad del Carmen.[44] Upon Gert's final landfall, high gales and waves battered wide stretches of coastline in the states of Tamaulipas and Veracruz, though hurricane-force winds were largely confined to areas within the cyclone's southern eyewall.[34][45] Tuxpan, just south of where the eye moved ashore,[7] recorded wind velocities of more than 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h), while 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) gusts occurred farther south in Poza Rica. To the north, winds reached 55\u00a0mph (89\u00a0km/h) in Tampico, Tamaulipas. Despite the severity of the winds, the worst of Gert was due to orographic lift when its broad circulation interacted with the eastern side of the Sierra Madre Oriental, generating extreme precipitation over much of the Huasteca region.[34] As many as 31.41\u00a0in (798\u00a0mm) of rain were recorded in Aquism\u00f3n, San Luis Potos\u00ed, while Tempoal in Veracruz observed a 24-hour total of 13.35\u00a0in (339\u00a0mm) from the storm.[12][34] The first signs of damage were from high winds on September\u00a020, which uprooted trees and tore off residential roofs in Tuxpan, Naranjos, Cerro Azul, and Poza Rica.[46] Following Gert's extreme rains, catastrophic flooding struck Mexico's Huasteca region over a period of several days, as many of its rivers rose to critical levels. In Veracruz, the imminent overflow of the Tempoal, Moctezuma, and Calabozo rivers forced thousands of residents from the municipalities of Tempoal, El Higo, and Plat\u00f3n S\u00e1nchez to leave their homes. The Calabozo River eventually topped its banks, cutting the village of Plat\u00f3n S\u00e1nchez off from the outside world. By far the most devastating, however, was the overflow of the P\u00e1nuco River on September\u00a024, which runs from the Valley of Mexico through the municipality of P\u00e1nuco and empties in the gulf. Rushing water swept through 30 of Veracruz's 212 municipalities, completely submerging more than 5,000 homes. El Higo bore the brunt of the flooding, with 90 percent of its residential area left under water.[47] After days of continued downpours in Gert's wake, the P\u00e1nuco River rose to 27.60\u00a0ft (8.41\u00a0m) above normal by September\u00a027\u2014its highest level in 40 years. Once again exceeding its banks, the river destroyed a major levee in city of P\u00e1nuco, forcing 8,000 residents to evacuate.[47][48] Disastrous flooding reached as far north as southern Tamaulipas, where 5,000 people had to seek refuge. Half of Tampico was coated in deep layers of mud, with scores of structures demolished.[49] The urban areas of Madero and Altamira were also hit by the deluge.[50] Roughly 2,000,000 acres (8,100\u00a0km2) of land around the P\u00e1nuco basin and Tampico were under water, including vast amounts of citrus, coffee, corn, maiz, bean, grain, and soy crops. Telephone, water, and electricity services throughout the region were severely disrupted, and numerous communities were isolated due to broken bridges and roads.[47][49] In San Luis Potos\u00ed, water damage to schools, bridges, and roads was particularly widespread. The agricultural sector suffered heavy losses when the flooding washed away large amounts of livestock and roughly 80\u00a0percent of its crops. Throughout the state, 55,000\u00a0residents were affected by the storm, and 25\u00a0people lost their lives.[51] Gert's trail of destruction extended as far inland as Hidalgo, where 35\u00a0rivers overtopped their banks. Floods and mudslides destroyed 38\u00a0bridges and 86\u00a0roads, as well cutting off power, telephone, and water services, disrupting communication in 361\u00a0localities. Property damage in Hidalgo was significant; 4,425\u00a0homes, 121\u00a0schools, and 49\u00a0public buildings were compromised across 35\u00a0municipalities. About 167,000 acres (680\u00a0km2) of farmland were destroyed in the storm. Fifteen deaths occurred in the state, and eight people sustained injuries.[51] Overall, Gert became the worst natural disaster to strike the region in 40 years;[47] it displaced 203,500\u00a0people\u2014many in need of shelter\u2014and left 29,075\u00a0houses damaged or destroyed across Mexico.[34][49] More than 667,000 acres (2,700\u00a0km2) of crops were in ruins.[47] Material damage totaled $156\u00a0million, and the death toll stood at\u00a045.[34][49]"

        "content": "Because of the storm's impact on the country, the government of Costa Rica declared a national emergency on September\u00a016, 1993.[19] Emergency crews were dispatched to assess the damage and distribute life supplies to the affected population, including 90,940 pounds (41,250\u00a0kg) of food, 1,422\u00a0mattresses, and 1,350\u00a0blankets.[14] With much of the road network left disrupted across the affected regions, the country's agriculture, tourism, and commerce suffered considerable losses.[20] In particular, the obstruction of the major Pan-American Highway, which connects the central region to the south of the country, had a discernible impact on the local economy. Following the expansive flooding of farmland, many independent crop producers were unable to partake in subsequent sowings.[20] Prior to Gert, a state of emergency had been in effect for Nicaragua as a result of Tropical Storm Bret. National and regional aid agencies, including the Red Cross, accordingly extended their relief efforts with the passage of Gert.[23] Following the widespread muddy floods, many rural areas along the coast where the storm made landfall necessitated purification of their water wells and reconstruction of those that had been destroyed.[28]  Although the government did not reappeal for international assistance, several cash donations were made by overseas organizations through a transfer channel at the Swiss Bank Corporation. The United Nations Development Programme provided $50,000 for the purchase of fuel, and UNICEF distributed $25,000 worth of household supplies and medicine. The World Food Programme donated 160,000\u00a0lbs (72\u00a0tonnes) of food supplies and offered disaster expert services. The federal governments of Japan, Canada, Switzerland, Norway, Germany, and Spain donated a combined $300,000 in aid.[23] On September\u00a018, the President of Honduras declared a state of emergency for several municipalities after surveying the affected regions by helicopter. The governments of Japan, Canada, Germany, and the United Kingdom provided a combined $310,300 for the purchase of relief items. Although most storm victims received aid within a few days, the deteriorated road network caused a large delay in relief efforts to the hard-hit Mosquitia region. Sewage systems and waterworks countrywide were in serious need of restoration.[16] With the destruction of its sole water reservoir, much of Puerto Cort\u00e9s endured potable water shortages for months in Gert's wake.[36] Public health concerns rose in the wake of Gert, with the cost of required medicines pinned at $208,000.[16] A contamination of the water supplies in rural areas exacerbated a cholera outbreak.[52] By September\u00a028, about 27,000\u00a0residents unable to reenter their flooded homes remained in government shelters. Seven weeks later, a temporary housing project was implemented for the 120 families most in need. Approximately 5,900\u00a0families across Honduras lost their source of income due to the storm.[16]"

After assessing the situation by helicopter, the President of Mexico declared the P\u00e1nuco river basin an emergency zone and ordered search and rescue missions.[49][50] Many homes sustained irreparable damage to their roofs, leaving tens of thousands homeless. The government appealed for international aid, seeking clothes, food, and medical supplies.[49] Five storage centers in Hidalgo provided more than 93\u00a0million\u00a0lbs (42,000\u00a0tonnes) of food supplies. Throughout San Luis Potos\u00ed, 142,000\u00a0lb (64\u00a0t) of chicken, 45,000\u00a0pantries, and 76,000\u00a0disposable plates were distributed, as well as 50,440\u00a0blankets and 6,081\u00a0airbeds.[51] Several schools served as shelters for the homeless;[51] the sheltered elderly, children, and pregnant or nursing women received $27,000 worth of milk powder donations.[49] In the wake of Gert, the amount of respiratory disease and skin infection cases rose slightly, although the overall health situation for the country remained well under control. By two weeks after the hurricane, over 65,000\u00a0people across the region had been accommodated in shelters; most stayed there until the floods receded, although many who returned home a month later continued to rely on relief provisions. A grant of $22,000 was made available for the purchase of roofing sheets for those in urgent need of home repair. The president approved $37.4\u00a0million to commence reconstruction of roads and houses and to assist farmers throughout the region.[49]"

The twenty-fourth tropical depression and eighteenth named storm, Rachel developed on September\u00a027 from a tropical wave southwest of mainland Mexico. After becoming a tropical depression, the system tracked slowly southwestward and eventually curved northwestward. The depression intensified into a tropical storm after three days and was named Rachel by the National Hurricane Center. Rachel continued to steadily strengthen, and peaked as a strong 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h) tropical storm on October\u00a02. After attaining peak intensity, Rachel re-curved to make a landfall in southern Baja California Sur and again in the Mexican Mainland on October\u00a03. The storm produced heavy rainfall across northern Mexico and the Southwestern United States. Thousands of people were left homeless and 18 fatalities were reported."

        "content": "The origins of Rachel can be traced back to a tropical wave that moved off the west coast Africa in mid-September 1990.[1] It moved westward into the Caribbean Sea without significant development.[2] Poorly organized, the wave entered the Eastern Pacific on overnight September\u00a022. The thunderstorm activity became more concentrated two days later. Dvorak classifications, a technique used to estimate a tropical cyclone's intensity, began late September\u00a025.[1] Early on September\u00a027, the twenty-fourth tropical depression of the season had developed;[1] however, operationally it was not warned upon until the system was located 540\u00a0mi (870\u00a0km) south of Baja California Sur on September\u00a030.[3] Post-analysis later confirm that Rachel was already a minimal tropical storm by that time. Although convection initially remained displaced from the center, Rachel steadily intensified.[1] Early on September\u00a030, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) operationally upgraded the depression into Tropical Storm Rachel.[4] While intensifying, an upper-level trough over California allowed Rachel to re-curve towards Mexico.[1] On October\u00a02, it reached its peak intensity of 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 994\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.35\u00a0inHg).[5] After maintaining its intensity for 24 hours, Rachel made landfall at peak intensity near the southern tip of Baja California Sur.[1][6] Strong wind shear prevented additional intensification, despite moving into the warm waters of the Gulf of California.[7] After weakening slightly,[6] Rachel made a second landfall midway between Las Mochis and Culiac\u00e1n. Upon moving inland, the system rapidly weakened[1] as the forward speed increased. Rachel dissipated several hours later on October\u00a03. By that time, the winds had decreased to 30\u00a0mph (45\u00a0km/h).[6] The remnants of Rachel entered the United States, and were last noted over Texas.[1]"

As Rachel moved closer to the area, the watch was replaced with a tropical storm warning. In the mainland, a tropical storm watch was issued for the state of Sinaloa south of Los Mmochis. Six hours later, the watches was replaced with a tropical storm warning. By the end of October\u00a02, all the watches and warnings were discontinued.[8] The two highest rainfall totals were 9.85\u00a0in (250\u00a0mm) and 6.5\u00a0in (170\u00a0mm) at Santa Anita and San Jose Del Cobe, near the southern tip of Baja California Sur. Two weather stations in Mexico reported barometric pressure of 1005 and 1006\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.68 and 29.71\u00a0inHg) during the passage of Rachel. In all, precipitation was measured at 996 different places across the country.[1][2] Throughout northern Mexico, significant flooding was reported with the worst effects felt in the states of Nuevo Leon, Coahuila and Durango. Thousands were homeless, and 18 people died. In Monterrey, rescue workers freed dozens of trapped people.[9] The moisture associated with the Rachel and a cold front produced rainfall in Arizona, New Mexico, and western Texas, while it was located southwest of Baja California Sur. After Rachel had dropped heavy rains, a flash flood watch was issued for several counties in New Mexico on October\u00a01, where rainfall had reportedly been 2\u00a0in (51\u00a0mm) since the last day of September.[10] The remnants of the storm produced additional precipitation across the state.[11] Heavy rains fell on almost all of western Texas, and a flash flood warning had been issued after some areas experienced rainfall over 1\u00a0in (25\u00a0mm).[12] With heavy rains falling in the western portion of Texas, some roads were washed out,[6] especially in Big Bend National Park and Lubbock; several car accidents were also reported on the roads. Several locations in Texas measured at least 0.5\u00a0in (13\u00a0mm) of rain, and the highest amount of rainfall was 1.5\u00a0in (38\u00a0mm) in Lubbock.[13]"

Monsoon winds, caused by differences in the heat-absorbing capacity of the continent and the ocean, dominate the climate. During the summer, the East Asian Monsoon carries warm and moist air from the south and delivers the vast majority of the annual precipitation in much of the country. Conversely, the Siberian anticyclone dominates during winter, bringing cold and comparatively dry conditions. The advance and retreat of the monsoons account, in large degree, for the timing of the rainy season throughout the country. Although most of the country lies in the temperate belt, its climatic patterns are complex. Sanbao Township in Xinjiang currently holds the highest recorded temperature in China, at 52.2\u00a0\u00b0C (126.0\u00a0\u00b0F) on 16 July 2023.[1][2] Mohe City, Heilongjiang, holds the record for the lowest temperature in China, at \u221253.0\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221263.4\u00a0\u00b0F) on 22 January 2023.[3][4]"

China's environmental watchdog, SEPA, stated in 2007 that China is losing 4,000\u00a0km2 (1,500\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) per year to desertification.[59] Water quality, erosion, and pollution control have become important issues in China's relations with other countries. Melting glaciers in the Himalayas could potentially lead to water shortages for hundreds of millions of people.[60] According to academics, in order to limit climate change in China to 1.5\u00a0\u00b0C (2.7\u00a0\u00b0F), electricity generation from coal in China without carbon capture must be phased out by 2045.[61] Official government statistics about Chinese agricultural productivity are considered unreliable, due to exaggeration of production at subsidiary government levels.[62][63] Much of China has a climate very suitable for agriculture and the country has been the world's largest producer of rice, wheat, tomatoes, eggplant, grapes, watermelon, spinach, and many other crops.[64]"

The fifth named storm of the 2009 Atlantic hurricane season, Erika originated out of a tropical wave on September\u00a01 near the Lesser Antilles. Although it was a disorganized system, it was immediately declared a tropical storm, rather than a tropical depression. Later that day, the system reached its peak intensity with winds of 50\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h) and a barometric pressure of 1004\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.65\u00a0inHg). Increased wind shear caused the storm to weaken shortly thereafter, with Erika barely maintaining tropical storm-status by September\u00a02. Later that day, the storm passed over the island of Guadeloupe and entered the Caribbean Sea. On September\u00a03, Erika weakened to a tropical depression as the low pressure center became fully displaced from convective activity. Later that day, the system degenerated into a remnant low before dissipating near Puerto Rico on September\u00a04. Due to the storm's low intensity, Erika produced little damage in the Lesser Antilles during its passage through the islands. Guadeloupe recorded up to 12.1\u00a0in (310\u00a0mm) of rain, leading to flooding and some landslides; 12,000 people on the island were left without power. Several other islands recorded moderate rainfall form the system before the tropical storm degenerated into a remnant low. In Puerto Rico, the cyclone's remnants produced heavy rainfall, peaking at 7.58\u00a0in (193\u00a0mm), that triggered flooding in several regions."

        "content": "Tropical Storm Erika originated from a tropical wave accompanied by disorganized shower and thunderstorm activity that moved off the west coast of Africa, near the Cape Verde Islands, on August\u00a025.[1][2] The following day, convection surrounding the wave began to show signs of organization as it tracked westward across the Atlantic.[3] By August\u00a028, an area of low pressure developed from the wave.[4] Environmental conditions ahead of the low were favorable for further development of the system.[5] Despite the favorable conditions, the low became increasingly disorganized on August\u00a029, with little convection remaining around the center of circulation.[6] The next day, the system quickly became organized, with shower and thunderstorms developing around the center and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) noted that the low would likely become a tropical depression within 24\u00a0hours.[7] Although convection was well-organized, the system lacked a defined low-level circulation center, leading to the NHC not issuing advisories on the system at that time.[8] On September\u00a01, a Hurricane Hunter reconnaissance mission into the low found a closed circulation center and tropical storm-force winds. Upon finding the low-level circulation center, the NHC began monitoring the system as Tropical Storm Erika, the fifth named storm of the 2009 season. Erika was slightly disorganized due to moderate wind shear, with the center partially devoid of convection. However, with warm sea surface temperatures, the storm was forecast to intensify to a strong tropical storm within a few days. A mid-level ridge to the north led to Erika maintaining a general westward track for most of its existence.[9] Several hours after being classified, the storm reached its peak intensity with winds of 50\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h) and a barometric pressure of 1004\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.65\u00a0inHg).[1] However, the peak intensity was operationally placed at 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h) based on readings from reconnaissance missions.[10] In post-storm analysis of these readings, it was determined that the NHC had overestimated the wind speeds in an area of unusually heavy rains.[1] By the morning of September\u00a02, Erika became significantly disorganized, and Hurricane Hunters reported the possibility that multiple circulation centers existed within the broader storm system.[11] Wind shear began to increase earlier than forecast models anticipated, causing the storm to weaken into a minimal tropical storm later that morning.[12] Around 1830\u00a0UTC, the center of Erika passed over the island of Guadeloupe with winds of 40\u00a0mph (65\u00a0km/h)[1] as the storm entered the eastern Caribbean Sea.[13] The circulation later became elongated and began to degenerate into a trough of low pressure. The NHC noted that due to the large size of the overall system, the center of Erika could reform elsewhere and restrengthen.[14] Following a brief increase in convective activity, the storm slightly intensified before succumbing to wind shear once more.[1] By the afternoon of September\u00a03, the center of Erika was fully devoid of convection and the NHC downgraded it to a tropical depression.[15] Shortly after, the system degenerated into a remnant low, coinciding with the issuance of the final advisory from the NHC.[16] The following day, the remnants approached the southern coast of Puerto Rico, producing heavy rainfall across the island.[17] The system was last noted later on September\u00a04 as it dissipated roughly 80\u00a0mi (140\u00a0km) south of Puerto Rico.[1][18]"

The following day, all of the watches were upgraded to tropical storm warnings as Erika neared the Lesser Antilles. When the storm entered the Caribbean Sea, a tropical storm warning was issued for Dominica and tropical storm watches were for Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the British Virgin Islands. Early on September\u00a03, the tropical storm watches were upgraded to warnings as Erika drifted through the eastern Caribbean. Later that day, the warnings for Dominica and Guadeloupe were discontinued. Shortly thereafter, all remaining warnings were canceled.[1] Exports from the Hovensa oil refinery in St. Croix, with a daily production of roughly 500,000 barrels (79,000\u00a0m3), were canceled as ports across the island were closed.[19] All businesses were shut down in Dominica on September\u00a03 due to the storm. In Antigua and Barbuda, all schools and the local airport were closed as a precautionary measure.[20] Two cruise ships, the Carnival Glory and a Royal Caribbean ship postponed their docking dates and stayed at sea for a few additional days.[21] The islands of Saint Martin and Saint Barth\u00e9lemy were placed under an orange alert, the second-lowest alert level, and Guadeloupe was placed under a yellow alert, the lowest alert level.[22] In Puerto Rico, officials closed schools and government offices on September\u00a04 and opened 433 shelters across the island. Officials in the Dominican Republic placed nine provinces under warnings as a precautionary measure. Nearby Haiti was also alerted of the possibility of heavy rains.[23]"

One rock slide occurred near Losteau, in Bouillante.[25] Several roads became impassable due to flood waters. At the height of the storm, an estimated 12,000 people were without power across the island.[27] Up to 5.5\u00a0in (140\u00a0mm) of rain fell along the foothills in Trinidad. In St. Martin, a peak of 3.7\u00a0in (94\u00a0mm) of rain fell.[27] In the United States Virgin Islands, up to 1.61\u00a0in (41\u00a0mm) of rain fell in a 24\u2011hour span,[28] resulting in minor flooding.[29] In Puerto Rico, the remnants of Erika produced significant amounts of rainfall, causing the rivers of La Plata, Lo\u00edza and Caguitas to overflow their banks and trigger widespread flooding.[30] A weather station in Naguabo recorded 7.92\u00a0in (201\u00a0mm) of precipitation.[31][32] Several other areas recorded upwards of 4\u00a0in (100\u00a0mm).[32] In the municipality of Guanica, several homes were flooded, leaving $5,000 in damage.[33] The most severe damage took place in the municipality of Las Piedras where $15,000 was reported in flood losses.[34] One river rose to a level of 29.27\u00a0ft (8.92\u00a0m), 7.27\u00a0ft (2.22\u00a0m) above flood stage.[35] Damage in Fajardo was estimated at $10,000 after homes were inundated by flood waters.[36] Additionally, flooding in Caguas resulted in $5,000 in damage.[37] In the Dominican Republic flood warnings were issued for the provinces of La Altagracia, El Seibo, Hato Mayor, Monte Plata, Samana, Duarte and Maria Trinidad Sanchez due to the threat of continued rainfall and flooding.[38]"

With favorable conditions, ample convection was able to wrap around the low level circulation center, which allowed the system to strengthen into a tropical depression, on 25 February. On 26 February, RSMC La Reunion upgraded the system to Moderate Tropical Storm Irina as it continued to intensify. However, Irina made landfall on Northern Madagascar a few hours later and weakened into an overland depression. On 27 February, Irina emerged off the northwestern coast of Madagascar. Within the next several hours, Irina was able to strengthen slightly, as the storm moved very close along the coast of Madagascar. Later on the same day, Irina made landfall a second time on Madagascar, this time at Northwest Madagascar. Late on 27 February, Irina weakened into a Zone of Disturbed Weather, while it was overland. Early on 28 February, Irina emerged off the western coast of Madagascar.Later on the same day, Irina regained tropical depression intensity, and slowly began to reorganize. However, for the next day, Irina was unable to regain Moderate Tropical Storm intensity, because of poor organization, and because the storm's low level circulation center was displaced, well to the east of the storm's convection. Early on 29 February, Irina was able to reorganize sufficiently, and regained Moderate Tropical Storm status. Just a few hours later, the JTWC designated Irina as Tropical Cyclone 12S. As Irina continued to organize, the storm gradually began to strengthen, as it turned southward, along the western coast of Madagascar. On 1 March, Irina intensified into a Severe Tropical Storm, as it moved towards Western Madagascar. Late on that same day, Irina reached its peak intensity, with a minimum low pressure of 979 mbars. Early on 5 March, Irina weakened into a Moderate Tropical Storm. The system then made a small loop off the coasts of Mozambique and South Africa before starting to head in a northwestern direction towards Madagascar yet again due to weak steering conditions.  Later on 6 March, wind shear began taking its toll on the system, and much of the storm's convection in the outer rain band were eroded away. As the storm continued to move towards Southern Madagascar, the wind shear removed more of the storm's convection, even as the storm continued to weaken. On 7 March, Irina began to stall. Early on 8 March, only a small amount of convection remained, which was wrapped around the center of circulation. Early on 9 March, Irina's eye disappeared, as the storm continued to weaken. As the storm turned back towards South Africa, it lost its organization, due to the strong wind shear. Early on 10 March, RSMC Reunion issued their last advisory on Irina, as the storm transitioned into a subtropical storm. Over the next 2 days, Irina's remnant low continued to drift northwestwards, with Irina weakening into a remnant low on 12 March. Two days later, Irina's remnants made landfall over the Gaza Province of Mozambique and dissipated."

By the time the sun had risen on July 5, industry had come to a standstill. Throughout the region factories were closed and mail service was suspended. Due to the temperature indoors many began sleeping outside either on roofs of apartments or on sidewalks with at least 5,000 people sleeping on the Boston Common alone.[9] Besides deaths caused directly by the heat, it was reported that in every major city affected by the heatwave that the temperatures had been driving people insane and causing suicides.[10] One such example reported by The New London Day, was of an elderly Boston man named Jacob Seegar who reportedly was driven so insane by the heat that he killed himself with a revolver in order to escape it.[11] Due to the excessive heat railroad rails expanded and bent.[citation needed] The death toll continued to rise until finally a sudden thunderstorm brought a wave of relief, soon after which temperatures returned to their normal levels for good.[12] The 1911 heat wave is considered the most deadly weather related disaster in the history of New England.[13] In Philadelphia alone, 158 people were reported to have died from the heatwave[7] and across the north east 200 people were reported to have drowned while swimming in an attempt to escape the heat."

Otto originated as a subtropical cyclone lingering north of Puerto Rico on October\u00a06, and transitioned into a tropical storm the next day, the fifteenth of the 2010 hurricane season. Accelerating toward the northeast, Otto strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale on October\u00a08, attaining peak winds of 85\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h). The storm began weakening due to incompatible surroundings and became extratropical west of the Azores on October\u00a010. Otto was the first Atlantic tropical cyclone to transition from a subtropical storm since Tropical Storm Laura in 2008.[1] Drifting near the northeastern Caribbean for several days, Otto and its precursor disturbance brought prolonged rainfall to the Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico, triggering widespread flooding and numerous mudslides. Damage from the storm\u2014in particular to roads, property and infrastructure\u2014exceeded $22.5 million (2010 USD), but there were no fatalities. After recurving toward the northeast, Otto proceeded across the open Atlantic without affecting any other landmasses."

        "content": "In late September, a large area of disturbed weather associated with two tropical waves formed just east of the Lesser Antilles.[2] The disturbance drifted very slowly west-northwestward,[3] inhibited by strong wind shear that eventually caused the westernmost wave to dissipate.[4] Albeit weak, an elongated remnant trough, or area of low pressure, persisted for several days, stalling over the extreme eastern Caribbean Sea as a nearby upper-level cyclonic vortex retrograded to its north.[4][5] By October\u00a05, the trough had drifted northward into a more favorable atmospheric environment over the Virgin Islands, which allowed the lowest pressures to extend to the surface. The low became well defined, interacting with the adjacent upper vortex to produce a wide convective band\u2014a concentrated region in which strong showers and thunderstorms can form\u2014over the northeastern Caribbean.[6] Over the next day, the system continued to acquire a prominent subtropical structure,[7][8] developing a markedly larger wind radius than typically seen in pure tropical cyclones. Satellite observations also revealed that although the lower wind circulation was distinct, it had become intertwined with the cyclonic vortex aloft to its southwest, confirming the hybrid nature of the system.[9] The National Hurricane Center (NHC) thus classified the system as a subtropical depression at 06:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a06, when it was 265\u00a0mi (425\u00a0km) north-northwest of San Juan, Puerto Rico.[10] The depression slid slowly northwestward between the contiguous upper vortex and a large high-pressure region over the central Atlantic. A region of lighter wind shear ahead, as well as an anticipated weakening of the upper cyclone, prompted the NHC to introduce the possibility of a tropical transition.[9] Later, satellite observations showed a rapid improvement in the depression's structure; convective banding wrapped completely around the broad inner wind field, which produced gusts to 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h).[11] Accordingly, the NHC upgraded the depression to Subtropical Storm Otto at 21:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a06, about 215\u00a0mi (345\u00a0km) northeast of Grand Turk.[12] Although satellite images continued to display a classical subtropical cyclone, with Otto's center and the vortex aloft nearly collocated, data from a Hurricane Hunters aircraft indicated a weak warm convective core was developing within the mid levels of the circulation\u2014a feature normally present at the upper levels of tropical cyclones.[13] Moreover, a contraction of the large wind field reaffirmed that Otto was entering the final stages of its tropical transition. Although convective activity briefly weakened overnight, weakening shear and considerably warmer sea surface temperatures permitted small patches of thunderstorms to refire on the morning of October\u00a07.[14] As Otto meandered northward, temperature contrasts from forecast models indicated that the warm core within the circulation had ascended to the upper levels of the cyclone. In consequence, a burst of deep, tropical convection with extreme cloud top temperatures of approximately \u2212112\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221280\u00a0\u00b0C) occurred over the center.[15] Having shed the last of its subtropical characteristics, Otto became a warm-core system and was operationally declared tropical at 1200\u00a0UTC that day.[10] Over the course of October\u00a08, Otto began to accelerate to the northeast under the increasing influence of a vertically deep trough off the US East Coast.[10][16] Conditions aloft remained conducive, and the storm's convection deepened symmetrically over the center to form a large, well-defined central dense overcast.[17][18] By 1200\u00a0UTC, Otto's winds had reached 75\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h) while a mid-level eyewall began to form, prompting the NHC to upgrade the storm to a Category 1 hurricane south of Bermuda.[18] Further strengthening ensued as the newly formed hurricane proceeded over the warm waters of the central Atlantic; microwave imagery revealed the eye, though obscured, was vertically well established, marking Otto's peak strength with estimated winds of 85\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h).[19] Upon peaking in intensity, Otto had become fully embedded within the deep-layered flow to its southwest.[19] Racing northeastward, the hurricane entered an area of progressively cooler waters and adverse upper atmospheric conditions, which eroded its cloud pattern and disrupted the circulation.[20][21] With maximum winds dropping below 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h), Otto was reduced to a tropical storm late on October\u00a09.[22] Convective activity came to a near halt due to relentless wind shear and a  lack of tropical moisture, leading specialists to conclude the storm was entering an extratropical transition.[23] The next day, the cool dry air infiltrated the weak warm core, and Otto began to develop frontal banding features.[24] With these characteristics, Otto became an extratropical cyclone on October\u00a010, and the NHC discontinued advisories on the storm.[25] The post-tropical cyclone decelerated near the Azores over the next week, where it eventually degenerated into a remnant low that recurved sharply southeastward, before completely dissipating west of Morocco on October\u00a018.[10]"

Several residences had to be evacuated, and some people were trapped in their homes.[39] Residents also suffered from the absence of drinking water, lack of electricity, and the inability to prepare meals due to the loss of kitchen equipment and other utensils.[40] In response, the area was declared a disaster zone;[26] a total of EC$500,000 ($185,185\u00a0USD) was approved to assist flood victims, as well as an additional US$44,194 allocated from the Disaster Relief Emergency Fund of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.[40] Intermittent torrents battered Saint Kitts and Nevis for at least four days; a total of up to 10.99\u00a0inches (279\u00a0mm) of precipitation was recorded during that time. Several homeowners reported significant flooding, and a number of persons had to be rescued from their homes. Gusty winds generated rough sea conditions along coastal regions, resulting in some beach erosion and the collapse of a sidewalk section. Rains and associated floods topped a number of culverts and bridges, washed out the sides of some roadways, and damage to some utility lines, followed by significant disruptions to electricity services.[41] The exact amount of damage to the territory remains unknown, however. In the U.S. Virgin Islands, heavy rainfall associated with Otto shattered numerous records for October across the US Virgin Islands, with a maximum total of 21.52\u00a0in (547\u00a0mm) reported in Red Hook, Saint Tomas.[29] The rain flooded roads and prompted officials opened shelters on all three islands on October\u00a06.[42] In Saint Croix, a roadway section leading into Enfield Green collapsed, temporarily cutting the neighborhood off to traffic until a makeshift roadway was created the next day. In La Vall\u00e9e, on the island's north shore, floods and landslides affected low-lying areas.[42] Traffic on Saint Thomas and Saint John initially remained unhindered; however, as the rain continued for several days, flooding, rockslides and asphalt erosion forced authorities to close several roads and highways.[43] Damage estimates from the storm reached $2\u00a0million across the islands.[44] In the British Virgin Islands, a flash flood warning was in effect during the presence of Otto from October\u00a06 to\u00a08.[45][46] Torrential floods across the islands overturned several cars, and caused extensive damage to utility lines and drainage pipes; dozens of people in Tortola\u2014specifically in Road Town\u2014were temporarily left without power and water.[47] In total, an estimated\u00a024.98\u00a0inches (634\u00a0mm) of rain was recorded, and the government declared a state of emergency for the entire territory.[48] Floods from the storm were regarded as the worst in the history of the British Virgin Islands.[28][49] In total, damage across the islands was estimated at US$10.5\u00a0million, considerably higher than losses ensured by major Hurricane Earl earlier in the year.[50] Widespread flooding from Otto was responsible for substantial increases in damage to the road network across Sint Maartin initially wrought by Earl, amounting to NA\u01921.5\u00a0million ($838,000\u00a0USD).[51] On the French side of the island nation, torrents and associated floods in Saint Martin were accountable for similar property infrastructural damage; monetary losses there totaled \u20ac800,000 ($1.12\u00a0million USD).[52]"

In all, damage to road infrastructure was preliminarily estimated at US$6.5\u00a0million.[55] In addition, the municipality of Ponce reported copious losses in agriculture, later estimated at US$1.5\u00a0million.[56] Following the overflow of the Arecibo River on October\u00a07, a neighborhood in Utuado was cut off from surrounding communities after gushing waters severely damaged its main road. Shortly thereafter, a landslide lugged a utility pole along the road, making it impossible for larger vehicles\u2014including ambulances\u2014to access the site. Landslides trapped fourteen families in the municipality of Ponce; a residence alongside a road suffered significant damage and had to be evacuated. In Cayey, a district was isolated from neighboring areas due to the collapse of a bridge. In the area, burst riverbanks triggered floods across local streets, which trapped dozens of families in their homes.[57] Severe flooding contaminated water supplies, leaving an estimated 45,000 people without drinking water in the wake of the storm. In response, the government declared a state of emergency for the entire island. Authorities opened 120 shelters, and several flood victims had to be rescued.[58]"

In one day alone, 250 horses died in New York City,[6] and by the end of July's first week, public streetcars had ceased to run because horses could not be fed. Most factories were closed by the beginning of the month,[7] and those which continued to operate had to permit their workers to wear light gymnastic costumes, as these were the only cooler alternative to the three-piece suits considered polite dress at the time.[6] As the heat failed to relent over the Ohio Valley and Middle Atlantic states, it spread to the established summer resort of Marquette, Michigan, during the middle of July.

        "content": " Hurricane Doria was an unusual and erratic hurricane that existed during September 1967. The fourth named storm and hurricane of the 1967 Atlantic hurricane season, Doria developed on September 8 off the east coast of Florida. It meandered until attaining tropical storm status, at which point the storm accelerated towards the northeast. On September 10, Doria intensified into a Category 2 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir\u2013Simpson Hurricane Scale. After moving out to sea, the storm turned westward towards the United States. A compact cyclone, Doria weakened to a tropical storm shortly before moving ashore in the Mid-Atlantic States. The storm ultimately dissipated on September 21. The storm, which ultimately made landfall near the Virginia\u2013North Carolina border, produced high winds along the coast from New Jersey through North Carolina. A small boat sank off the coast of New Jersey, killing three of its occupants. Overall damage was estimated around $150,000 (1967\u00a0USD), although the storm overall was considered beneficial."

        "content": "The origins of Hurricane Doria are traced back to an area of disturbed weather off the northeastern coast of Florida on September 4. For several days, the low pressure system meandered as its central barometric pressure gradually fell.[1] The storm is estimated to have organized into a tropical depression at 0000 UTC on September 8.[2] At the time, it was situated north of Grand Bahama Island. Drifting westward, the cyclone attained tropical storm intensity early the next day.[1] Doria turned northeastward and accelerated as it moved away from Florida. On September 10, the tropical storm achieved hurricane force.[2] Cold air became entrained into the hurricane's circulation by September 11, causing it to weaken to a tropical storm. However, its forward motion slowed and it once again strengthened.[1] The hurricane moved eastward, seemingly out to sea. However, an area of high pressure over New England began to steer Doria westward on September 13.[3] The hurricane continued to strengthen, and it is estimated to have peaked with maximum sustained winds of 100\u00a0mph (155\u00a0km/h) and a minimum air pressure of 973 mbar (hPa; 28.73 inHg). It maintained these winds for approximately 18 hours, before weakening slightly late on September 14.[2] In his 2007 book \"Hurricanes and the Middle Atlantic States\", Rick Schwartz compared Doria to the 1933 Chesapeake\u2013Potomac hurricane, citing similar intensities, tracks, and forward speeds.[3] On September 16, the storm weakened to a tropical storm in a colder, drier environment. As it turned southward, Doria quickly weakened.[1] Initial forecasts suggested the possibility for the storm to maintain its severity and move ashore between Maryland and New Jersey.[3] Continually deteriorating, Doria made landfall near the Virginia\u2013North Carolina border, and moved south over land. It reemerged over open waters on September 17, and at around the same time, it weakened to a tropical depression. It curved southeastward as a weak depression, and several days later it was still identifiable as a storm system south of the island of Bermuda.[1] It dissipated on September 21.[2] Doria had an unusual and capricious track, described as \"one of the most erratic storms ever observed\".[1]"

        "content": "In advance of the storm, hurricane warnings were issued for much of the East Coast of the United States. For 19 hours, about 260\u00a0mi (420\u00a0km) of shoreline was under an advisory.[4] At least 400 people were evacuated from their homes in southern New Jersey and 6,600 from Ocean City, Maryland.[5] Doria was a small storm,[3] although it brought high winds and moderate coastal flooding to some areas;[6] generally light rainfall was also observed. In North Carolina, 6.09\u00a0in (155\u00a0mm) of precipitation fell at Whiteville.[7] Flash flooding and the overflowing of storm sewers ensued in the southeastern portions of the state; there were also losses to crops, especially corn, cotton, and tobacco.[8] In Virginia, strong winds were reported along the coast, with gusts up to 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) at Wallops Island.[1] Along the east coast of the state, winds damaged trees, roofs, signs, and billboards. In Maryland, similar impact occurred in Ocean City, with damage sustained to signs and billboards and tore the roof of a prefabricated home;[9] a city boardwalk also sustained storm-related damage.[4] A station at the Indian River Inlet in Delaware recorded a tide 6.5\u00a0ft (2.0\u00a0m) above-normal; the highest sustained winds reported on land association with the storm, 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h), also occurred there.[1] Atlantic City, New Jersey, recorded a peak gust of 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h), with rainfall amounting to 0.53\u00a0in (13\u00a0mm). Damage from the storm was generally light. Off the coast of Ocean City, New Jersey, a cabin cruiser sank in 25-ft (7.6 m) seas.[1][4] Three of the vessel's occupants, a mother and her two sons, drowned.[10] In Massachusetts, some small boats sank at the harbors. At Ipswich Bay, 10\u00a0people required rescue after two boats capsized. Minor beach erosion was reported at Nantucket.[8] Overall damage was estimated at $150,000, which was considered minor. The storm's passage was considered beneficial, due to adding sand to beaches and providing favorable rains.[11]"

Three of them intensified into a hurricane, with one strengthening further into a major hurricane (Category\u00a03 or higher on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale).[1] The first tropical cyclone of the season developed in the Gulf of Mexico on June\u00a027. Becoming a hurricane on June\u00a028, the storm struck Texas, bringing strong winds to a large area. Three fatalities were reported, while damage was conservatively estimated at $675,000 (1929\u00a0USD). The second storm, nicknamed the Bahamas hurricane, developed north of the Lesser Antilles. It was the most intense tropical cyclone of the season, peaking as a Category\u00a04 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale with maximum sustained winds of 155\u00a0mph (250\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 924\u00a0mbar (27.3\u00a0inHg). The storm moved through the Bahamas at this intensity and later struck Florida while slightly weaker. Overall, this hurricane resulted in 59\u00a0deaths and at least $9.31\u00a0million in damage. The next three tropical cyclones did not impact land, with the last transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on October\u00a022. Until the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project researched the season in 2010, the final two systems were considered the same tropical cyclone.[2] The season's activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 48,[1] below the 1921\u20131930 average of 76.6.[3] ACE is a metric used to express the energy used by a tropical cyclone during its lifetime. Therefore, a storm with a longer duration will have high values of ACE. It is only calculated at six-hour increments in which specific tropical and subtropical systems are either at or above sustained wind speeds of 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h), which is the threshold for tropical storm intensity. Thus, tropical depressions are not included here.[1]"

Swain encountered a disturbance of \"probably moderate intensity\" offshore Texas on June\u00a028.[4] A tropical storm developed in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico on the previous day.[5] The storm was abnormally small, having a diameter of only about 20\u00a0mi (32\u00a0km).[4] It moderately intensified and by early on June\u00a028, the storm became a hurricane. While offshore Texas, the hurricane peaked with winds of 90\u00a0mph (150\u00a0km/h). Shortly after making landfall near Matagorda Bay, a minimum barometric pressure of 982\u00a0mbar (29.0\u00a0inHg) was reported. The storm then accelerated westward across the Southwestern United States and weakened to a tropical storm early on June\u00a029. However, it was still of \"considerable intensity\" while passing near El Paso about 24\u00a0hours later. Thus, the system was thought to have remained a tropical storm until early on June\u00a030. Several hours later, the storm dissipated over Arizona.[5] The storm brought hurricane-force winds to portions of Texas, including as far inland as Yorktown in DeWitt County. Additionally, a 60\u00a0to 80\u00a0mi (95\u00a0to 130\u00a0km) path observed gale force winds as far from the coast as Bexar, Kendall, Kerr, and Medina counties. Wind impacts were significant, with a \"conservative\" estimate of $310,000\u00a0in damage inflicted on crops, while buildings, windmills, power, telephone, and telegraph lines suffered about $365,000\u00a0in damage.

Late on September\u00a025, the system peaked with maximum sustained winds of 155\u00a0mph (250\u00a0km/h), an estimate based on pressure-wind relationship, with a minimum barometric pressure of 924\u00a0mbar (27.3\u00a0inHg).[5] While crossing through the Bahamas, the storm struck Eleuthera and Andros, on September\u00a025 and September\u00a026, respectively. Late on September\u00a027, the system weakened to a Category\u00a03 hurricane and re-curved northwestward. At 13:00\u00a0UTC the next day, the hurricane made landfall near Tavernier, Florida. The storm then entered the Gulf of Mexico and continued weakening, falling to Category\u00a02 intensity late on September\u00a028. While approaching the Gulf Coast of the United States, the hurricane weakened to a Category\u00a01 hurricane. Early on October\u00a01, it made landfall near Panama City Beach, Florida. A few hours later, the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm and then became extratropical over southwestern Georgia shortly thereafter. The remnants continued northeastward up the East Coast of the United States, until entering Canada and dissipating over Quebec early on October\u00a05.[5] In the Bahamas, the hurricane brought strong winds and large waves to the archipelago. At Nassau, a weather station observed a wind gust of 164\u00a0mph (264\u00a0km/h).[6] Within the city alone, 456\u00a0houses were destroyed, while an additional 640\u00a0houses suffered damage. On Abaco Islands, 19\u00a0homes were demolished.[2] The hurricane damaged or destroyed 63\u00a0homes and buildings on Andros. Telegraph service was disrupted.[7] There were 48\u00a0deaths in the Bahamas.[2][4][7] Throughout the Bahamas and the Florida Keys, numerous boats and vessels were ruined or damaged. At the latter, strong winds were observed, with a gust up to 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h) in Key Largo.[2] However, damage there was limited to swamped fishing boats and temporary loss of electricity and communications.[4] Farther north, heavy rains flooded low-lying areas of Miami.[2] A devastating tornado in Fort Lauderdale damaged a four story hotel, a railway office building, and several cottages. In the Florida Panhandle, storm surge destroyed several wharves and damaged most of the oyster and fishing warehouses and canning plants.[4] Overall, there was approximately $2.36\u00a0million in damage and three deaths in Florida; eight others drowned offshore.[2]"

        "content": " Hurricane Iniki (/i\u02d0\u02c8ni\u02d0ki\u02d0/ ee-NEE-kee; Hawaiian: \u02bbiniki meaning \"strong and piercing wind\") was a hurricane that struck the island of Kaua\u02bbi on September 11, 1992. It was the most powerful hurricane to strike Hawai\u02bbi in recorded history, and the only hurricane to directly affect the state during the 1992 Pacific hurricane season.[1] Forming on September 5, 1992, during the strong 1990\u20131995 El Ni\u00f1o, Iniki was one of eleven Central Pacific tropical cyclones during that season. It attained tropical storm status on September 8 and intensified into a hurricane the next day. After abruptly turning north, Iniki struck Kaua\u02bbi at peak intensity; it had winds of 145\u00a0mph and reached Category 4 status on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale. Winds gusted to 225\u00a0mph (362\u00a0km/h). It was the first hurricane to hit the state since Hurricane Iwa in the 1982 season, and the only known major hurricane to hit the state. Iniki dissipated on September 13, about halfway between Hawaii and Alaska. Iniki caused around $3.1\u00a0billion (equivalent to $7\u00a0billion in 2023) in damage and seven deaths. This made Iniki, at the time, the costliest natural disaster on record in the state, as well as the third-costliest to hit the U.S. It struck just 18 days after Hurricane Andrew, the costliest tropical cyclone ever at the time, struck Florida. The Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) failed to issue tropical cyclone warnings and watches 24\u00a0hours in advance. The hurricane destroyed more than 1,400 houses on Kaua\u02bbi and severely damaged more than 5,000. Though not directly in the path of the eye, O\u02bbahu experienced moderate damage from wind and storm surge."

        "header": "Meteorological history",
        "content": "The origin of Iniki is unclear, but it may have begun as a tropical wave that exited the west African coast on August\u00a018. It moved westward across northern South America and Central America, entering the eastern Pacific Ocean on August\u00a028. On September\u00a05, Tropical Depression Eighteen-E developed from the wave, about 1,700 miles (2,700\u00a0km) southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula, or 1,550 miles (2,490\u00a0km) east-southeast of Hilo.[1] Upon its formation, the depression had a ragged area of convection, and the National Hurricane Center anticipated minimal strengthening over the subsequent few days. This was due to the convective structure having poorly-defined outflow, or ventilation. Warm sea surface temperatures, 2\u20135\u00b0\u00a0F (1\u20133\u00b0\u00a0C) above normal, were considered a positive factor.[2][3][4] On September\u00a06, the depression crossed 140\u00b0 W, entering the area of warning responsibility of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC).[1] On that day, the CPHC anticipated that the depression would dissipate within 24\u00a0hours, and ceased issuing advisories, but the depression reorganized on the next day, and warnings were reissued.[4] Steered by a subtropical ridge to the north, the depression continued westward, or slightly south of due west. On September\u00a08, the CPHC upgraded the depression to tropical storm status, giving it the name Iniki, which is Hawaiian for a sharp and piercing wind.[1] Iniki gradually intensified as its track shifted to the north. It moved around the western edge of the subtropical ridge, which was weakening due to an upper-level trough moving eastward from the International Date Line. Typically, the subtropical ridge keeps storms away from the Hawaiian islands. On September\u00a09, Iniki strengthened into a hurricane, and the next day it passed about 300 miles (480\u00a0km) south of Ka Lae, the southernmost point of the Big Island of Hawaii. The hurricane slowed and curved toward the north while continuing to intensify. On September\u00a010, a reconnaissance aircraft flew into Iniki, observing sustained winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h), which is a major hurricane, or a Category\u00a03 on the Saffir-Simpson scale. The approaching trough caused Iniki to accelerate to the north-northeast toward the western Hawaiian islands.[1] On September\u00a011, a reconnaissance aircraft observed maximum sustained winds of 145\u00a0mph (233\u00a0km/h), with gusts to 173\u00a0mph (278\u00a0km/h), making it a Category\u00a04 hurricane. The flight also observed a minimum barometric pressure of 938\u00a0mbar (27.7\u00a0inHg), the lowest ever observed in the Central Pacific at the time. At that time, the hurricane was about 130\u00a0mi (210\u00a0km) southwest of Lihue. Iniki weakened slightly after its peak, and its eye made landfall on the southern coast of Kauai near Waimea with winds of 140\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h), making it the strongest hurricane on record to strike Hawaii. Iniki moved rapidly across the island, and about 40\u00a0minutes after landfall, it reemerged into the Pacific Ocean as it accelerated away from the state. The hurricane thereafter weakened, dropping to tropical storm status by September\u00a013. That day, Iniki transitioned into an extratropical cyclone as it integrated with an approaching cold front about halfway between Hawaii and Alaska.[1]"

        "header": "Preparations",
        "content": "While Iniki was in its development stages, various tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated a range of possibilities for the hurricane's future trajectory, ranging from a landfall on the Big Island to a path to the west, away from the state. The hurricane initially followed a trajectory similar to other storms in the region, passing south of the state. The CPHC relied on the Miami-based National Hurricane Center for the models, and lacked a detailed analysis on each model run, which caused errors in forecasting. The agency also had limited satellite imagery and direct observations to track the hurricane. As such, the CPHC failed to issue tropical cyclone warnings and watches for the hurricane well in advance, although the agency warned for the potential of high surf. For several days before the disaster, the CPHC and the news media forecast Iniki to remain well south of the island chain.[4] Two days before the storm struck, the Naval Western Oceanography Center on O\u02bbahu recommended that the United States Navy fleet at the Pearl Harbor Shipyard to start storm preparations. A few Naval facilities were evacuated, some ahead of official hurricane warnings from the CPHC.[4] Early on September\u00a011, less than 24\u00a0hours before Iniki made landfall, the CPHC issued a hurricane watch for Kaua\u02bbi, Niihau, and the northwestern Hawaiian islands to the French Frigate Shoals. A few hours later, the agency upgraded the watch to a hurricane warning for Kaua\u02bbi and Niihau. A hurricane warning was later issued for O\u02bbahu, while a tropical storm watch was issued for the islands of Maui County. Warning sirens blared on Kaua\u02bbi and O\u02bbahu to warn the public of the approaching storm. The hurricane warning for Kaua\u02bbi was downgraded to a tropical storm warning after Iniki departed the island, causing some confusion whether there was another storm approaching the area. Reports about the storm were disseminated by radio, newspapers, and news stations. After the hurricane warnings were issued, TV stations began 24-hour coverage of the storm. Residents responded well to the hurricane, in part due to the scenes of destruction from Hurricane Andrew in south Florida three weeks earlier. Iniki nearly struck the Central Pacific Hurricane Center in Honolulu. Had it hit there, Iniki, along with Hurricane Andrew and Typhoon Omar, would have struck each of the three National Weather Service offices responsible for tropical cyclone warnings within a two-month period.[4] In response to the approaching hurricane, about 38,000\u00a0people evacuated to public shelters, including 8,000\u00a0on Kaua\u02bbi and 30,000\u00a0people in O\u02bbahu. On Kaua\u02bbi, school was canceled, and the traffic was light during the evacuation, with streets clear by mid-morning. Rather than send tourists to public shelters, two major hotels kept their occupants in the buildings during Iniki's passage of Kaua\u02bbi.[5] Some residents rode out the hurricane in their homes. According to a post-storm survey, no one on the island did not hear about the impending storm.[4] On O\u02bbahu, all schools, and most businesses, closed during the storm's passage. Only critical government employees worked during the storm. Officials opened 110\u00a0public shelters on O\u02bbahu, including some schools meant for refuge only; this meant they provided no food, cots, blankets, medications, or other comfort items. Roughly one-third of O\u02bbahu's population participated in the evacuation, though many others went to the house of a family member or friend for shelter. Officials assessed that the evacuations went well, beginning with the vulnerable coastal area. For those in need, vans and buses gave emergency transportation, while police manned certain overused intersections. The two main problems during the evacuation were lack of parking at shelters and exit routes for the coastlines.[5] On the Big Island, officials ordered residents within 300\u00a0ft (91\u00a0m) of the coastline to evacuate to higher ground.[4]"

That made it the third-costliest U.S. hurricane at the time, behind Hurricane Hugo in 1989 and Hurricane Andrew in August 1992, one month earlier.[8] It was the first significant hurricane to threaten the state since Hurricane Iwa ten years earlier.[5] Iniki affected all of Hawaii with high waves and strong winds, with the worst impacts on Kaua\u02bbi.[4] Seven people died during the hurricane \u2013 three on Kaua\u02bbi, two offshore, and two on Oahu. The low death toll was likely due to well-executed warnings and preparation.[4] Of the offshore deaths, two were Japanese nationals who died when their boat capsized south of Kaua\u02bbi.[1] There were also around 100\u00a0storm-related injuries throughout the state, some of which occurred during the hurricane's aftermath.[4]"

        "header": "Kaua\u02bbi",
        "content": "Hurricane Iniki made landfall on south-central Kaua\u02bbi and moved across the island in 40\u00a0minutes.[1] Much of the island experienced sustained winds of 100 to 120\u00a0mph (160 to 190\u00a0km/h). Wind gusts were estimated at 175\u00a0mph (282\u00a0km/h) at landfall. There was an uncalibrated wind gust of 217\u00a0mph (349\u00a0km/h) at Makaha Ridge, at the top of a cliff. A station at Makahuena Point recorded a gust of 143\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h).[4] Based on the island's damage patterns, meteorologist Ted Fujita estimated there were as many as 26\u00a0microbursts, sudden downdrafts of wind capable of reaching 200\u00a0mph (320\u00a0km/h). There were also two mini-swirls, small localized swirls within the eyewall. In general, the winds descending the island's mountains were more damaging than the upslope winds.[20] In addition to its strong winds, Iniki lashed the southern Kaua\u02bbi coastline with a 4 to 6\u00a0m (13 to 20\u00a0ft) storm surge, or rise in water. On top of the surge, the hurricane produced wave heights of 17\u00a0ft (5.2\u00a0m), with a high water mark of 22.2\u00a0ft (6.8\u00a0m) at Waikomo Stream near Koloa.[4] The high waves left a debris line more than 800 feet (240\u00a0m) inland. Because it moved quickly through the island, there were no reports of significant rainfall.[5] Iniki's passage left extensive damage throughout Kaua\u02bbi, with 14,350\u00a0homes damaged to some degree. Only the western part of the island escaped severe damage. Three people died on the island \u2013 one due to flying debris, one to a collapsed house, and one of a heart attack. Across Kaua\u02bbi, Iniki destroyed 1,421\u00a0houses,[4] including 63 that were lost from the high waves and water. It also severely damaged 5,152\u00a0homes, while 7,178 received minor damage,[1] which left more than 7,000\u00a0people homeless.[21] High waters damaged several hotels and condominiums along the island's southern shore.[4] A few were restored quickly, but some took several years to be rebuilt. One hotel\u2014the Coco Palms Resort famous for Elvis Presley's Blue Hawaii\u2014never reopened.[22] Hurricane Iniki's making landfall during daylight hours, combined with the popularity of camcorders, led many Kaua\u02bbi residents to record much of the damage as it occurred. The footage was later used to create an hour-long video documentary.[23] Commercial air service was suspended.[24] Iniki's high winds also downed 26.5% of the island's transmission poles, 37% of its distribution poles, and 35% of its 800-mile (1,300\u00a0km) distribution wire system. The entire island lacked electricity and television service for an extended period.[21] Electric companies restored only 20% of the island's power service within four weeks of Iniki, while other areas had no power for three to four months. Also affected by the storm was the agricultural sector.[1] Much of the sugar cane was already harvested,[21] but what was left was severely damaged. The winds destroyed tender tropical plants like bananas and papayas and uprooted or damaged fruit and nut trees.[1] The high winds stripped much of Kauai of its vegetation, wrecking sugar cane fields as well as fruit and nut trees.[4] Among those on Kaua\u02bbi was filmmaker Steven Spielberg, who was preparing for the final day of on-location shooting of the film Jurassic Park. He and the 130 of his cast and crew remained safely in a hotel during Iniki's passage.[25][26] According to Spielberg, \"every single structure was in shambles; roofs and walls were torn away; telephone poles and trees were down as far as the eye could see.\" Spielberg included footage of Iniki battering the Kaua'i coastal walls as part of the completed film, where a tropical storm is a pivotal part of the plot. Members of the film's crew helped to clear some of the debris off of nearby roads.[25]"

        "content": "East of the hurricane's landfall, O\u02bbahu received tropical storm-force winds during Iniki's passage along its southwestern coast, with an island-wide peak gust of 82\u00a0mph (132\u00a0km/h) in Waianae. The outer rainbands of the hurricane spawned an F1 tornado in N\u0101n\u0101kuli, also on O\u02bbahu. Along western Oahu, Iniki produced a 2 to 4\u00a0ft (0.61 to 1.22\u00a0m) surge, with 17\u00a0ft (5.2\u00a0m) waves recorded near M\u0101kaha.[4] Prolonged periods of high waves severely eroded and damaged the southwestern coast of O\u02bbahu, with the areas most affected being Barbers Point through Ka\u02bbena.[1] The Wai\u02bbanae coastline experienced the most damage, with waves and storm surge flooding the second floor of beachside apartments.[27] In all, Hurricane Iniki caused several million dollars in property damage,[5] and two deaths on O\u02bbahu.[1] High swells affected the southwestern coasts of Maui and the Big Island, which damaged boats, harbors, and coastal structures.[4] On the Big Island, seas of 10\u00a0ft (3.0\u00a0m) were reported, along with 40\u00a0mph (65\u00a0km/h) winds.[28] The high waves damaged 12\u00a0homes on the Big Island.[20] In Honok\u014dhau Harbor, three or four sailboats were tossed onto the rocks and one trimaran at another harbor was sunk. A beach near Napo\u02bbopo\u02bbo on Kealakekua Bay lost some sand and to this day has never been the same.[29]"

        "header": "Aftermath",
        "content": "Immediately after the storm, many were relieved to have survived the worst of the hurricane; their complacency turned to apprehensiveness due to lack of information, as every radio station was out and no news was available for several days. Because Iniki knocked out electrical power for most of the island, communities held parties to consume perishable food from unpowered refrigerators and freezers, and many hotels prepared and hosted free meals to use up their perishables. Though some food markets allowed those affected to take what they needed, many Kaua\u02bbi citizens insisted on paying. In addition, entertainers from all of Hawai\u02bbi, including Graham Nash (who owns a home on the north shore of Kaua\u02bbi) and the Honolulu Symphony, gave free concerts for the victims.[22] Three days after Iniki struck Hawaii, the NOAA Assistant Administrator for Weather Services directed that a disaster survey team investigate the warnings and responsiveness to the hurricane.[4] The passages of Iwa and Iniki within a ten-year period increased public awareness of hurricanes in Hawaii.[20] Jurassic Park was being filmed at the time; the sets used for the deleted scene where Mr. Arnold goes to the shed to turn the power on were destroyed, and the cast and crew took shelter in a hotel. Shots of Iniki made it into the film. Looting occurred in Iniki's aftermath, but it was very minor. A group from the Army Corps of Engineers, who experienced the looting during Hurricane Andrew just weeks before, were surprised at the overall calmness and lack of violence on the island. Electrical power was restored to most of the island about six weeks after the hurricane, but students returned to Kaua\u02bbi public schools two weeks after the disaster. Kaua\u02bbi citizens remained hopeful for monetary aid from the government or insurance companies, but after six months they felt annoyed by the lack of help.[22] But the military effectively provided aid for their immediate needs, including MREs (meals ready to eat), and help arrived before local officials requested aid.[37] By four weeks after the hurricane, only 20% of power was restored on Kaua\u02bbi, following the island-wide blackout.[1] Amateur radio proved extremely helpful during the three weeks after the storm, with volunteers coming from neighboring islands as well as from around the Pacific to assist in the recovery. There was support of local government communications in Lihue in the first week of recovery[27] as well as a hastily organized effort by local operators to assist with the American Red Cross and their efforts to provide shelters and disaster relief centers across Kaua\u02bbi.[38] In the months after the storm, many insurance companies left Hawai\u02bbi. To combat this, Governor John D. Waihee III enacted the Hurricane Relief Fund in 1993 to help unprotected Hawai\u02bbi residents. The fund was never needed for another Hawai\u02bbi hurricane, and it was eliminated in 2000, when insurance companies returned to the island.[39] Iniki ravaged multiple islands' native forest bird population, and doubtless hastened the extinction of the Kaua\u02bbi \u02bb\u014d\u02bb\u014d.[40] It is also thought that the storm blew apart many chicken coops, some possibly used to house fighting chickens; this caused a dramatic increase in feral chickens roaming Kaua\u02bbi.[41] Due to the storm's impact, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Iniki after the 1992 season; it will never again be used for a Central Pacific tropical cyclone. It was replaced in the basin's naming rotation with Iolana.[42][43]"

The 31st named storm of the 2013 Pacific typhoon season, Podul developed as a tropical depression on November\u00a011 between Palau and the Philippine island of Mindanao. The system moved west-northwestward and struck Davao Oriental in Mindanao on November\u00a012, bringing heavy rainfall that killed two people and disrupted relief efforts following Haiyan. After crossing the Philippines, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Podul on November\u00a014. Shortly thereafter, the storm struck southeastern Vietnam, and its circulation dissipated on November\u00a015. In Vietnam, Podul produced heavy rainfall that resulted in severe flooding. The storm damaged or destroyed 427,258\u00a0houses, and overall damage was estimated at 4.1\u00a0trillion\u20ab (2013 Vietnamese \u0111\u1ed3ng, $194.1\u00a0million 2013\u00a0USD).

The system consisted of a broad circulation, affected to its detriment by moderate wind shear.[2] Moving west-northwestward, the convection persisted and organized into the circulation, indicative of an increased potential for tropical cyclogenesis.[3] Late on November\u00a010, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)[nb 1] issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA), meaning the agency anticipated a tropical depression would develop within 24\u00a0hours.[5] Shortly thereafter, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) initiated advisories on Tropical Depression Zoraida after the system entered its area of responsibility of the agency.[6] At 1200\u00a0UTC on November\u00a011, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA)[nb 2] estimated that a tropical depression formed about halfway between Palau and the Philippine island of Mindanao,[8] although operationally the agency had classified the system two days prior.[9] After passing south of Palau, the system's circulation became more broad and its convection became less organized, despite decreased wind shear.[10] Early on November\u00a012, the depression made landfall on Mindanao in Davao Oriental province.[11] Shortly thereafter, PAGASA discontinued advisories on Zoraida, declaring that the depression degenerated into a low pressure area.[12] By contrast, the JMA continued monitoring the depression as it moved through the Philippines and into the Sulu Sea. On November\u00a013, the center crossed over Palawan island into the South China Sea. At 1200\u00a0UTC the next day, the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Podul about 275\u00a0km (171\u00a0mi) east of the Vietnam coast.[8] Around the same time, the JTWC began issuing warnings on the system as a tropical depression 32W, noting that convection had rapidly increased over the circulation. The agency also mentioned the continued presence of wind shear, although warm water temperatures and moderate outflow were expected to allow intensification.[13] Although the JMA estimated peak 10\u2013minute winds of 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph),[8] the JTWC only estimated tropical depression-force 1\u2013minute winds of 45\u00a0km/h (28\u00a0mph).[14] Late on November\u00a014, Podul made landfall in southeastern Vietnam near Phan Rang\u2013Th\u00e1p Ch\u00e0m and quickly weakened into a tropical depression.[8] The JTWC assessed the circulation was dissipating near the coast,[15] and the JMA declared Podul dissipated at 1200\u00a0UTC on November\u00a015.[8] Operationally, the agency tracked the system into the Gulf of Thailand,[16] and the Thai Meteorological Department tracked Podul to near the Malay Peninsula on November\u00a016, before ceasing advisories on the storm.[17] The remnants later redeveloped into Severe Cyclonic Storm Helen in the Bay of Bengal, which later struck southeastern India on November\u00a022 before dissipating.[18]"

        "content": " Hurricane Iwa, taken from the Hawaiian language name for the frigatebird (\u02bbiwa, lit. \"Thief\"), was at the time the costliest hurricane to affect the state of Hawai\u02bbi. Iwa was the twenty-third tropical storm and the twelfth and final hurricane of the 1982 Pacific hurricane season. It developed from an active trough of low pressure near the equator on November 19. The storm moved erratically northward until becoming a hurricane on November 23 when it began accelerating to the northeast in response to strong upper-level flow from the north. Iwa passed within 25\u00a0miles of the island of Kaua\u02bbi with peak winds of 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) on November 23 (November\u00a024 Coordinated Universal Time), and the next day it became extratropical to the northeast of the state. The hurricane devastated the islands of Ni\u02bbihau, Kaua\u02bbi, and O\u02bbahu with wind gusts exceeding 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) and rough seas exceeding 30 feet (9.1\u00a0m) in height. The first significant hurricane to hit the Hawaiian Islands since statehood in 1959, Iwa severely damaged or destroyed 2,345\u00a0buildings, including 1,927\u00a0houses, leaving 500\u00a0people homeless. Damage throughout the state totaled $312\u00a0million (1982\u00a0USD$, 985\u00a0million 2024\u00a0USD). One person (Seaman Joseph Cantu of the U.S. Navy aboard the destroyer ship U.S.S. Goldsborough) was killed from the high seas, and three deaths were indirectly related to the hurricane's aftermath."

        "content": "A very active trough of low pressure persisted along the equator in the middle of November, with westerly surface winds and windspread convection located along the trough from 140\u00b0 W to 140\u00b0 E. An organized circulation developed near Palmyra Atoll on November 18, and steadily developed as it drifted westward.[1]\nThough very late in the season, warm temperatures to the south of the Hawaiian Islands due to the strongest El Ni\u00f1o in many years allowed the disturbance to develop into Tropical Storm Iwa on November 19 while located about 970 miles (1,560\u00a0km) southwest of the southernmost point in Hawaii. The storm tracked slowly northward after forming and initially remained a weak tropical storm. After turning to the northeast, Iwa began slowly intensifying, and on November 23 after turning to the north-northwest Iwa strengthened into a hurricane while located 580 miles (930\u00a0km) southwest of the southern tip of Hawaii.[1][2] Shortly after becoming a hurricane, Iwa turned and accelerated to the northeast in response to strong upper level flow to its north. The hurricane possessed sufficient moisture, instability, and upper divergence for continued intensification, and Iwa reached peak winds of 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) late on November 23 while located 245 miles (394\u00a0km) southwest of Waimea on the island of Kaua\u02bbi. Its forward speed increased to 30 to 40\u00a0mph, and Iwa passed just north of the island of Kauai on November\u00a023 (November\u00a024 in UTC). The right semicircle of the storm extended across Kaua\u02bbi and O\u02bbahu, with gusts from 100 to 120\u00a0mph (160 to 190\u00a0km/h). After passing Hawaii, the convection of Iwa rapidly deteriorated as it gradually lost tropical characteristics. Late on November 24, the hurricane degenerated into a tropical storm, and on November 25 Iwa became an extratropical cyclone while located about 600 miles (970\u00a0km) northeast of Hawaii.[2]"

        "content": "Hurricane Iwa produced estimated gusts reaching 120\u00a0mph (190\u00a0km/h) across Kaua\u02bbi and O\u02bbahu. The acceleration of the hurricane concentrated the energy of its swells, resulting in high waves and storm surge across the Hawaiian Islands, though primarily near the path of the center. It is estimated the storm surge reached eight feet (two meters) on the south coast of Kaua\u02bbi.[2] There, the surge reached 900 feet (270\u00a0m) inland, exceeding a 100-year flood event for the area.[12] The heaviest rainfall reported from the island chain was from the Intake Wainiha 1086 site, where 20.33 inches (516\u00a0mm) was measured.[9] Possible tornadoes were reported in association with a rain squall in O\u02bbahu.[2] Waves on the coast of O\u02bbahu reached 16.4\u00a0feet in height (3\u00a0m),[13] and waves on southern Kaua\u02bbi surpassed 30 feet (9.1\u00a0m) in height.[14] During the worst of the storm, 5,800\u00a0people were evacuated from shoreline areas of Kaua\u02bbi to temporary shelters. Strong waves sank or grounded several small vessels on the southwestern coast of Kaua\u02bbi,[2] with 44 of the 45 boats at Port Allen being sunk.[14] The worst of the damage from the hurricane occurred in Poipu, where the rough surf destroyed or severely damaged several exposed luxury hotels and condominiums. Elsewhere on the island, damage was greatest in areas where there was no protective barrier reef offshore. Several small aircraft were damaged at Lihue airport from the winds, including many overturned small planes.[2] The winds destroyed several buildings across the island, including one of Kaua\u02bbi's oldest churches and a warehouse. Additionally, the winds destroyed the roof of a bank.[15] Strong winds initially left the entire island of Kaua\u02bbi without power.[16] Highway 56 on the east side of the island was obstructed by fallen telephone poles, forcing residents to drive on the unpaved, red dirt cane roads usually reserved for hauling sugar cane from the fields. Rising waters washed out multiple roads near the coastline. The strong winds destroyed nearly all papaya and banyan trees on the island.[17] The hurricane destroyed or greatly damaged 1,907 homes on the island and caused minor damage to 2,983 others, leaving one-eighth of the island's homes unlivable.[18] Rough seas killed a person on a Navy Destroyer the USS Goldsborough DDG-20 in Pearl Harbor when the seaman hit a stanchion,[1] with four others injured on the ship. One of the four injured was swept overboard two miles (three kilometers) from the harbor. Before the arrival of the hurricane, around 1,000 evacuated the low-lying coastline to shelters.[15]\nRough waves destroyed four and damaged two deep-water communication cables between O\u02bbahu and Kaua\u02bbi.[13] In O\u02bbahu, damage from wind and surf was heaviest on the southwest coast between N\u0101n\u0101kuli and M\u0101kaha. The storm surge washed sand into streets in Waik\u012bk\u012b and flooded cars in areas of basement parking. Wind damage was greatest in areas where winds blew from southerly directions off of mountains. The winds damaged several small aircraft and a Douglas DC-3 plane in Honolulu. Gusty winds shattered glass windows in the Honolulu International Airport, injuring several passengers.[2] Some flights in and out of the Honolulu airport were delayed, while other domestic airports were temporarily closed.[15] The passage of the hurricane damaged at least 6,391 homes, 21 hotels, and two condominium buildings on the island.[19] Additionally, 418\u00a0buildings, including 30 businesses, were destroyed on O\u02bbahu.[18] Surf damage was reported throughout the Hawaiian islands.[2] 120\u00a0people were treated for injuries,[15] though most were minor.[2] An estimated 500\u00a0people throughout Hawaii were left homeless due to the hurricane.[15] Damage on the private island of Ni\u02bbihau was severe. An aerial survey indicated 20 homes were destroyed and 160 were damaged, indicating that the hurricane affected nearly all of the island's 226 residents. Reportedly no one was injured on Ni\u02bbihau.[18] At the time, Hurricane Iwa was the costliest storm to hit the state of Hawai\u02bbi,[12] with damage totaling $312\u00a0million (1982\u00a0USD$, 985\u00a0million 2024\u00a0USD).[20] The last female Kaua\u02bbi \u02bb\u014d\u02bb\u014d (Moho braccatus) was lost in the storm. Her mate was recorded singing in solitary until he went silent and presumably died in 1987, marking the extinction of their species.[21]"

The declaration allocated federal funds to aid the affected citizens.[19] The state Department of Education decided to close all schools on Kaua\u02bbi indefinitely.[18] The thousands of residents without power celebrated Thanksgiving by cooking turkeys on outdoor grills or smokers. Army and Air Force planes delivered 20,000 Thanksgiving rations to the thousands left in temporary shelters. The United States military also airlifted generators to Kaua\u02bbi due to several days of power outages.[22] By three weeks after the hurricane, utility crews restored power to nearly all major areas in O\u02bbahu, while 5,000 remained without power in Kaua\u02bbi.[18] By around a month after the hurricane passed the island, utilities were restored to most of the entire island. All roads and highways were cleared, as well.[17] One 25th Infantry Division soldier at Schofield Barracks died while cleaning up after the hurricane.[1] Two people died in a traffic accident due to malfunctioning traffic lights.[23]"

        "content": " Hurricane Iselle was the strongest tropical cyclone to make landfall on the island of Hawaii in recorded history. The tenth named storm, fifth hurricane, and fourth major hurricane of the 2014 hurricane season, Iselle developed from an area of disturbed weather southwest of Mexico on July\u00a031, 2014. Assuming a west-northwest course that it would maintain throughout its existence, generally favorable atmospheric conditions allowed for gradual strengthening, with the cyclone attaining hurricane status a day after formation. Continued strengthening progressed for several days up until August\u00a04, when Iselle reached peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 140\u00a0mph (220\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 947\u00a0mbar (hPa; 27.96\u00a0inHg), making it a Category\u00a04\u00a0hurricane. Thereafter, Iselle encountered hostile environmental conditions and quickly weakened before making landfall on the Big Island on August\u00a08 as a moderate tropical storm. Its passage over the island disrupted the cyclone, and Iselle later dissipated on August\u00a09. Widespread precautionary measures took place across Hawaii as forecasts indicated the potential for a Hawaiian landfall as early as August\u00a02. Then-governor Neil Abercrombie signed an emergency proclamation into effect, and numerous government facilities were closed. Several airlines cancelled flights servicing the archipelago. Upon making landfall, Iselle brought torrential rainfall and caused strong winds which resulted in widespread power outages and downed trees. The storm caused heavy crop damage, estimated at $79.2\u00a0million (2014\u00a0USD), including 60% of the state's papaya that was lost. This was enough to be classified as an agriculture disaster, and was eventually declared a disaster by Federal Emergency Management Agency after initially being denied. The storm also killed one person on Kauai as a result of flooding."

        "content": "In late July\u00a02014, computer models began to indicate the possible formation of a low-pressure area off the coast of southwestern Mexico, prompting the National Hurricane Center\u00a0(NHC) to assess the region with a low probability of tropical cyclogenesis on July\u00a024.[1] These forecasts began to come to fruition on July\u00a028 when an area of thunderstorms associated with a tropical wave developed off the Mexican coast.[2] Tracking westward in favorable conditions, the system organized over the following days.[3] A tropical depression formed by 12:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a031.[4] Six hours later, the NHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Iselle due to the system's organization and the detection of tropical storm-force winds by the MetOp-B scatterometer.[5][4] At the time, Iselle was located roughly 1,075\u00a0mi (1,730\u00a0km) southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula.[6] Steady intensification continued after formation, with the NHC indicating the possibility of rapid intensification.[7] On August\u00a01, Iselle began to develop an eye,[8] and this progressive pattern of organization prompted the NHC to upgrade the storm to hurricane status at 00:00\u00a0UTC the following day.[4] Although favorable conditions allowed for the uninhibited growth of Iselle early in its development,[9] moderate wind shear briefly impacted the hurricane on August\u00a02, preventing thunderstorms from intensifying and causing the storm to become slightly malformed vertically.[4][10] However, these conditions abated shortly afterwards, allowing Iselle to resume strengthening and reach Category\u00a02\u00a0hurricane status late that same day.[4][11] With wind shear no longer impinging on the organization of Iselle, the tropical cyclone gradually became more symmetric,[4][12] allowing for the hurricane's once ragged eye to clear itself of cloud cover and the storm to intensify to major hurricane status on August\u00a03.[13] Attaining some annular tropical cyclone characteristics, Iselle reaching Category\u00a04 strength at 12:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a04.[4] Consequently, Iselle reached peak intensity at 18:00\u00a0UTC with maximum sustained winds of 140\u00a0mph (220\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 947\u00a0mbar (hPa; 27.96\u00a0inHg).[4] At the same time, the hurricane exhibited an eye 30\u00a0mi (45\u00a0km) across.[14] Following peak intensity, the combination of increasing wind shear and lowering sea surface temperatures began to slowly weaken Iselle, bringing it below Category\u00a04\u00a0intensity early on August\u00a05.[4][15] Continued wind shear caused the storm to further degrade and its eye to become ragged in appearance. The NHC downgraded Iselle below major hurricane intensity at 18:00\u00a0UTC that day.[4] At 00:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a06, forecasting responsibility transferred from the NHC to the Central Pacific Hurricane Center\u00a0(CPHC).[4] Although wind shear began to decrease thereafter, abundant dry air caused Iselle to rapidly weaken, dropping to Category\u00a01 intensity on August\u00a06.[16] However, the suppressed wind shear allowed for the hurricane to reorganize and maintain a large eye as it tracked towards Hawaii,[17] and Iselle reached its secondary peak intensity with winds of 100\u00a0mph (155\u00a0km/h) at 00:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a07.[4] On August\u00a07, the upper-level trough to the north caused an increase in wind shear, the storm's eye had faded and the CPHC estimated that Iselle had weakened to a minimal hurricane.[4][18] Strong wind shear disrupted the system, and Iselle weakened to a tropical storm the next day before making landfall at 12:30\u00a0UTC along the Kau coast of the Big island with winds of 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h).[4][19] The mountainous terrain of the island largely disrupted the main cyclonic circulation of Iselle, which manifested as a collection of small vortices south of the Hawaiian islands.[20] Due to the loss of any sustained thunderstorm activity at the storm's center, the CPHC decided to downgrade Iselle to a remnant area of low pressure on August\u00a09;[21] at the time, the disturbance was centered roughly 200\u00a0mi (320\u00a0km) west-southwest of Honolulu.[22] Iselle's remnant low dissipated two days later.[4]"

        "content": "Tropical storm-force winds affected much of the state as Iselle moved through, except Niihau, the rest of the Hawaiian Islands all reporting gusts over 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h). Hurricane-force winds were confined to Mauna Kea on the Big Island, where a peak gust of 91\u00a0mph (146\u00a0km/h) was observed.[53] Heavy rains affected most of the southern islands, with some areas of the Big Island seeing more than 12\u00a0in (300\u00a0mm) due to orographic lift from the southerly flow on the backside of Iselle. The greatest total was at the Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge, where 15.25\u00a0in (387\u00a0mm) was observed. Areas on the leeward side of the island saw substantially less rain; Kona International Airport received only 0.04\u00a0in (1.0\u00a0mm) during the storm's passage. Kauai saw rains in excess of 6\u00a0in (150\u00a0mm) in several areas and a maximum of 9.58\u00a0in (243\u00a0mm) at a United States Geological Survey station along the Kilohana Ridge. Totals peaked at 4.22\u00a0in (107\u00a0mm) to the north on Oahu, while Molokai and Lanai received generally negligible totals.[54] Swells from hurricanes Iselle and Julio also produced 6 to 10\u00a0ft (1.8 to 3.0\u00a0m) waves along the eastern shores of the Hawaiian islands.[55] Iselle brought damaging surf along the east coast of the island. Strong winds unroofed homes near Hilo and downed trees.[56] These winds also felled power lines, causing widespread outages impacting roughly 23,000\u00a0electricity customers.[57] A geothermal plant in Puna released toxic hydrogen sulfide gases upon losing its power sources, prompting officials to urge an exodus of the immediate area,[58] although a number of nearby residents reported health impacts.[59] A water treatment plant in Kula on Maui also shut down due to power failure, prompting the conservation of water supplies in that area.[60] Iselle's winds also damaged about 1,000 coffee trees and over 2,000 macadamia trees. Damage was heaviest to the papaya crop,[61] with about 60% of the statewide crop destroyed,[62] accounting for $55\u00a0million in losses (2014\u00a0USD).[55] Other crops, including coffee, macadamia nuts, and flowers, were also damaged,[55] and overall crop losses in the state were estimated at $66\u00a0million.[63] Only one known death took place as a direct result of the storm \u2013 a 19-year-old woman who was swept away by flood waters while hiking in a closed state park.[64] Over 250\u00a0property owners reported damage, with at least 11\u00a0houses destroyed, and 28 with major damage.[65] Public damage and the cost to remove debris was estimated at $13.2\u00a0million.[66] Total monetary losses in the State of Hawaii range between $148\u00a0million and $325\u00a0million.[4] Due to the threat from Iselle, lieutenant governor candidate Warner Sutton requested that Governor Neil Abercrombie postpone the August\u00a09 primary. The governor declined the request,[67] and the primary election occurred as scheduled. However, the storm damaged roads leading to two polling stations on the Big Island, prompting officials to decide the election by absentee ballot in those areas.[68] After a close campaign between incumbent Senator Brian Schatz and Congresswoman Colleen Hanabusa, the senate primary, held on the same day as the gubernatorial primary, was too close to call after Schatz led by only 1,635\u00a0votes. As a result, the election hinged on the two closed polling stations, where more than 8,000\u00a0people had the option to vote by mail.[69] This was later changed to an in-person vote for August\u00a015, despite a challenge from the Hanabusa campaign with regards to storm damage, and Schatz ultimately won.[70] The Hawaii American Civil Liberties Union later sued the state over how they handled the election.[71]"

By August\u00a020, 99% of customers had their power restored, leaving 1,100\u00a0residents by 12\u00a0days after the storm.[72] However, it took until September\u00a011, or about five weeks after the storm, for all power to be restored.[73] Post-storm surveys indicated that the damage from Iselle was mostly related to trees that were not native to the island, which weakened and snapped under the high winds.[74] Residents across Hawaii donated over $80,000 after the storm to assist victims, organized through the Hawaii Island United Way. Local charities distributed 5,000\u00a0lb (2,300\u00a0kg) of food to over 3,000\u00a0families.[75] The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) completed a disaster survey of houses on August\u00a019, a first step toward a federal disaster declaration. Due to the damage, Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard remarked, \"I'm urging FEMA, Hawaii County, the governor and President Obama to expedite the process of declaring Iselle's devastation a natural disaster so that the people of Puna can receive immediate help.\"[76] On August\u00a025, Governor Abercrombie formally requested for federal assistance, after the state depleted its disaster fund,[66] but that was rejected by FEMA due to insufficient damage.[65] However, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack declared an agriculture disaster, prompting the Small Business Administration to allow federal disaster loans to small businesses.[77] The FEMA decision was reversed on September\u00a012, when the federal government approved aid for rebuilding public buildings, as well as future disaster mitigation.[78] When Iselle made landfall on the Big Island with winds of 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h), it became the strongest tropical cyclone on record to hit the island, and one of only three storms to hit the island at tropical storm intensity or higher, along with Tropical Storm Seven in 1958, and Tropical Storm Darby in 2016. If Iselle had made landfall as a hurricane, it would have been the first hurricane to ever hit the Big Island.[79] With estimated damage cost of $148 to 325\u00a0million (2014\u00a0USD), Iselle became the third-costliest tropical cyclone to ever hit the U.S. state of Hawaii, even after accounting for inflation. The only tropical cyclones to cause more damage to the islands were Iwa in 1982, and Iniki in 1992.[80][81] In addition, Iselle was the third-strongest tropical cyclone to ever make landfall on the main Hawaiian islands after hurricanes Dot and Iniki.[notes 1][82]"

It is the first tropical cyclone of the annual cyclone season. Roanu originated from a low-pressure area that formed south of Sri Lanka, which gradually drifted north and intensified into a cyclonic storm on 19\u00a0May. However, wind shear and land interaction caused it to weaken slightly, before reintensifying as it accelerated towards the coast of Bangladesh. The storm was responsible for 105 deaths in Sri Lanka and another 30 deaths in Bangladesh; another 99 in Sri Lanka were reported missing. Damage throughout Sri Lanka reached US$2\u00a0billion. Roanu also brought torrential rainfall to the Indian states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Odisha as it drifted in a generally northeastward direction, close to the coast."

        "content": "Under the influence of a trough, a low-pressure area formed over the Bay of Bengal on 14 May.[2][3] It slowly consolidated as it paralleled the east coast of Sri Lanka, prompting the India Meteorological Department (IMD) to classify it as a depression on 17 May.[4] Late the same day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA), soon after which the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical storm.[5][6] Simultaneously, the IMD upgraded the storm to a Deep Depression, prompting the issuance of cyclone warnings for the states of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha.[7] On 19 May, the IMD reported that the storm had reached cyclonic storm intensity, and assigned it the name Roanu.[8] At the time, Roanu was tracking slowly northward along the northern periphery of a subtropical ridge located over the Malay Peninsula. Despite favorable outflow and warm sea surface temperatures (SSTs) reaching 31\u00a0\u00b0C (88\u00a0\u00b0F), its proximity to land and moderate vertical wind shear kept the storm from intensifying rapidly.[9] The diurnal temperature variation over land and the persistent wind shear began to affect the deep convection obscuring the low-level circulation center (LLCC). In the late hours of that day, Roanu showed a weakening trend after most of the convection covering the LLCC was sheared off. During that time, Roanu was located approximately 150 kilometres (93\u00a0mi) from Visakhapatnam. However, the wind shear soon decreased,[10] and the storm reestablished deep convection over and around the LLCC, forming a central dense overcast in a period of 6 hours. SSMIS imagery revealed tightly curved rainbands wrapped into the LLCC.[11] As a result, Roanu re-intensified as it accelerated east-northeastwards towards the coast of Bangladesh,[12] and reached its peak intensity with winds of 85\u00a0km/h (55\u00a0mph) and a minimum central pressure of 983\u00a0hPa (mbar; 29.03\u00a0inHg).[13] On 21 May, Roanu made landfall just northwest of Chittagong, Bangladesh.[14] Continuing to accelerate inland, Roanu steadily weakened and degenerated into a remnant low on the next day.[citation needed]"

The third named storm and hurricane of the 1932 Atlantic hurricane season, it developed from a tropical disturbance north of Hispaniola on August\u00a026. Slowly moving towards the west-northwest, the system intensified to tropical storm strength before making landfall on South Florida early on August\u00a030. After crossing the Florida peninsula and entering the Gulf of Mexico, the system reached peak intensity as a Category 1 hurricane, before subsequently making its final landfall near the Mississippi\u2013Alabama border on September\u00a01. Over land, the hurricane weakened, and after becoming an extratropical cyclone on September\u00a02, merged with another extratropical system over Quebec on September\u00a04. At the storm's initial landfall in southern Florida, heavy rains and strong winds caused extensive damage to crops, particularly to avocado and citrus. As the strengthening hurricane moved to the northwest through the Gulf of Mexico, it generated strong surf that caused severe damage to coastal areas across western Florida. At its second landfall, hurricane force winds were produced across a wide swath of the coast. Agricultural lands in coastal regions of Mississippi and Alabama were damaged by strong winds and heavy rain. The hurricane caused one indirect death and $228,500 in total damages across its path.[nb 1]"

Steadily intensifying, the depression intensified to tropical storm strength at 1800\u00a0UTC on August\u00a027.[2] The strengthening tropical storm passed to the south of Andros Island during the evening of August\u00a029,[3] before making its first landfall 35\u00a0mi (55\u00a0km) south of Miami, Florida on Key Largo at 0400\u00a0UTC the next day as a strong, compact tropical storm with winds of 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h).[1][3] A weather station located at the Fowey Rocks Light recorded a peak wind gust of 89\u00a0mph (143\u00a0km/h). In the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project, it was evidenced that the storm may have been a hurricane upon landfall on Florida.[3] After slightly weakening over land,[2] the tropical storm entered the Gulf of Mexico in the early morning hours of August\u00a030, while located 30\u00a0mi (48\u00a0km) south of Fort Myers.[1] After entering the gulf, the tropical storm proceeded to organize, strengthening into hurricane intensity early on August\u00a031. As it curved more towards the north, the hurricane eventually made landfall near the Mississippi\u2013Alabama border, west of Fort Morgan, Alabama, with maximum sustained winds of 85\u00a0mph (137\u00a0km/h), a Category\u00a01 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale.[2] A ship located offshore of Mobile, Alabama recorded a minimum barometric pressure of 979\u00a0mbar (28.9\u00a0inHg).[3] After making landfall, the hurricane gradually weakened over land as it curved towards the northeast, weakening to tropical storm strength at 1200\u00a0UTC on September\u00a01. The weakening system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over northern Mississippi the following day, after subsequently developing frontal boundaries.[2] The extratropical system strengthened slightly as it accelerated towards the northeast, but was later absorbed by a larger extratropical system over Quebec by 1800\u00a0UTC on September\u00a04.[3]"

A Miami weather station reported 10.24\u00a0in (260\u00a0mm) of rain in a 24-hour period ending on August\u00a030, setting a record for that station.[3] A portion of the MacArthur Causeway, which connects Miami to Miami Beach, was washed out due to the winds, but did not affect traffic.[4] Rainfall in St. Petersburg measured 3.79\u00a0in (96\u00a0mm), while Fort Myers measured 6.52\u00a0in (166\u00a0mm) of rain.[5] The heavy rains also flooded streets in parts of Sarasota, Florida, and strong winds caused minor power outages.[6] Communication lines between Fort Myers and Everglades, Florida also went down during the storm.[7] Strong winds were responsible for destroying 2\u201325% of avocado and citrus trees along the path of the tropical storm.[3] Grapefruit crops also suffered loses due to strong winds.[4] Firefighters in Hollywood were forced to stop extinguishing a fire after winds damaged their equipment. The fire would eventually cause $20,000\u00a0in damages.[7] Offshore, a 60\u00a0ft (18\u00a0m) long boat that was towed out of Biscayne Bay for dredging operations partially sank due to the rough seas.[4] Before the hurricane's second landfall, another hurricane warning was issued for portions of the state, for areas of the coast from Panama City westward. Boats from Naval Air Station Pensacola were taken to nearby bayous ahead of the storm. Other ships were also sheltered as a precautionary measure.[5] As the hurricane moved towards the Gulf Coast region, the hurricane caused strong storm surge and generated rough seas, disrupting coastal and marine activities. In Madeira Beach, the passing hurricane caused above-average tides that moved 15\u201320\u00a0ft (4.6\u20136.1\u00a0m) further inland than normal.[5] Offshore, two fishing boats attempting to cross Tampa Bay had to be rescued after they became stranded in the rough seas generated by the tropical storm.[6] In Dog Island, nine people were rescued from the Cuban schooner Asturias after it washed up on the island shore.[8] Off of Apalachicola, nine fishing boats sunk due to the waves.[9] The tide height offshore Apalachicola at the time was 4.5\u00a0ft (1.4\u00a0m) above average, causing damage to small craft moored at the wharves. The strong surf alone was responsible for about $1,000\u00a0in damages.[3]  Strong storm surge off of Pensacola caused water levels that were the highest in the area in several years.[10] Sections of a pier at Pensacola Beach were washed away by the strong waves.[11] Five fishermen were initially reported drowned after their fishing boat struck a reef and was swamped by the storm surge in Pensacola Bay.[12] However, the men were later reported safe at a coast guard life saving station. The misreport was likely due a lack of communication with the station.[13] Another three men went missing after they departed in a small boat in aid of another boat offshore Pensacola.[12] Inland effects of the hurricane's second landfall in Florida were mostly confined to areas of the Florida Panhandle west of Apalachicola. Cotton crops in Okaloosa and Escambia counties were damaged due to the wind and rain effects of the hurricane. Numerous pears were also blown off of trees by the strong winds.[3] The highest rainfall totals in the panhandle region were concentrated around the Panama City area, where rain totals were estimated to be in excess of 5\u00a0in (130\u00a0mm).[14] Property damage in Pensacola was relatively minor, and was limited to awnings, windows, and signboards. In Pensacola Beach, communications were disrupted due to the storm.[13]\nA 12\u2013year old boy in Pensacola died after touching an active electric wire that had fallen during the storm.[10][11] Total damages in the Pensacola area were estimated to amount to around $100,000.[3]"

Winds also extensively damaged cotton and corn crops. Heavy rains also helped to damage crops.[3] Rainfall peaked at 9.1\u00a0in (230\u00a0mm) in Mobile, Alabama. Other reports of at least 3\u00a0in (76\u00a0mm) of rain were common along the Mississippi\u2013Alabama border.[14] Sections of the Mobile waterfront were submerged by the hurricane's storm surge. The high surf also flooded Bayou LaBatre and Bayou Coden in Mobile.[15] Total property damage in the city amounted to $105,000 in damages.[16] In Gulfport, Mississippi, damage was confined primarily to trees, communication lines, and small craft.[15] Further inland, the hurricane spawned an F2 tornado 3\u00a0mi (4.8\u00a0km) southwest of Troy, Alabama on September\u00a01. The tornado destroyed two homes and several barns and injured four people in its 6\u00a0mi (9.7\u00a0km) path,[17] causing $2,500 in damages.[16]"

Kalmaegi was the first storm to make landfall over the Philippines since Typhoon Rammasun, two months prior. The storm caused flooding in Southeast Asia during mid-September. Kalmaegi started as a disturbance near Palau that could become a tropical cyclone in the next few days. JTWC would designate it to Tropical Depression 15W. PAGASA also named the system Luis as the 11th named storm inside PAR. Environmental conditions became more conducive for intensification, which allowed 15W to intensify into a tropical storm and attained the name Kalmaegi. On September 13, the storm intensified into a Category-1 typhoon as it moved through open warm waters. Around 17:00 PHT (09:00 UTC) on September 14, the eye of Kalmaegi made landfall in the coastal town of Divilacan, Isabela, bringing gusty winds and heavy rains in the area. Shortly after landfall, Kalmaegi was downgraded to a severe tropical storm while JTWC maintained a Category-1 typhoon. On September 15, Kalmaegi left the responsibility as it headed for Southern China where it intensified back to a typhoon. Kalmaegi made landfall in Hainan Island as a high-end Category-1 typhoon. Kalmaegi rapidly weakened to a large tropical storm as it continued to move in a westward direction. Both agencies classified Kalmaegi as a tropical depression and dissipated on September 18."

        "content": " Tropical Storm Ileana was a small tropical cyclone that affected western Mexico in early August 2018,[1] causing deadly flooding. The eleventh tropical cyclone and ninth named storm of the 2018 Pacific hurricane season, Ileana originated from a tropical wave that the National Hurricane Center began monitoring on July\u00a026 as the wave left the west coast of Africa. The wave traveled across the Atlantic Ocean with no thunderstorm activity, before crossing into the Eastern Pacific Ocean early on August\u00a04. Rapidly developing, the disturbance organized into a tropical depression on the evening of the same day. Initially, the depression was well-defined, but it soon degraded due to northerly wind shear. Despite the unfavorable conditions, the system began to strengthen on August 5, becoming Tropical Storm Ileana. A day later, on August\u00a06, Ileana began to develop an eyewall structure as it reached its peak intensity with winds of 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h) and a pressure of 998\u00a0mbar (29.47\u00a0inHg). The storm gradually became intertwined with the nearby Hurricane John; over the next day, the circulation of John disrupted Ileana before ultimately absorbing it on August\u00a07. Ileana prompted the issuance of multiple watches and warnings along the coast of Baja California Sur and the Pacific coast of Mexico. The system paralleled the Pacific coast for much of its existence. Ileana caused a total of eight deaths in Mexico; four people were killed in Guerrero and another four died in Chiapas. Flooding also ensued in the states of Oaxaca, Guerrero, and Mexico."

        "content": "The origins of Ileana can be traced back to a tropical wave that departed from the west coast of Africa on July\u00a026. The wave had virtually no convection as it crossed over the Atlantic. Once the wave entered the Eastern Pacific Ocean early on August\u00a04, thunderstorm and convective activity rapidly increased.[1] The National Hurricane Center (NHC) first noted the potential for development on August 3.[2] After satellite imagery indicated that an area of low pressure had formed a few hundred miles south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec and was showing signs of organization, the NHC raised the system's two-day development chances to 50% around 17:00\u00a0UTC on August 4.[3] Only an hour later, at 18:00\u00a0UTC, the system was designated as a tropical depression while located about 230\u00a0mi (370\u00a0km) south-southeast of Puerto Angel, Mexico.[1] Around that time, the depression had a well-defined low-pressure center and a pronounced, arced band of deep convection.[4] Six hours later, the structure of the depression had degraded due to northerly wind shear caused by the stronger disturbance that would later become Hurricane John. The low-level center of the depression had become exposed in the northwest as it moved out from under the edge of the convection; simultaneously, convection decreased in the east and south. The depression was traveling west-northwest under the influence of the aforementioned disturbance, which was located to the west, and a mid-level ridge located to the east.[1][5] Despite the disruptive wind shear, the depression then began to strengthen, becoming Tropical Storm Ileana on August\u00a05 at 12:00\u00a0UTC.[1][6] At that time, Ileana had a fairly symmetrical structure and a central dense overcast-like feature.[7] Ileana continued to strengthen over the next day after entering an area with warm sea surface temperatures of 86 to 88\u00a0\u00b0F (30 to 31\u00a0\u00b0C).[8] Ileana reached peak intensity on August\u00a06 at 12:00\u00a0UTC with maximum sustained winds of 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 998\u00a0mbar (29.47\u00a0inHg), while located approximately 115\u00a0mi (185\u00a0km) southwest of Acapulco.[1] Around the same time, Ileana had strong deep convection with cloud temperatures of \u2212121 to \u2212130\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221285 to \u221290\u00a0\u00b0C).[9] Soon after, microwave imagery and Acapulco radar showed the emergence of an eyewall structure at the mid-levels of the system.[10] By 21:00\u00a0UTC on August 6, Ileana had become increasingly intertwined in the outer bands of Hurricane John to the west as the two systems began to experience the Fujiwhara effect.[11][12] The nearby Sierra Madre Mountains further disrupted Ileana's circulation center. The storm was completely absorbed by John at 12:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a07, just west of Cabo Corrientes.[1]"

The watch was upgraded to a tropical storm warning at 03:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a06. Six hours later, the Government of Mexico issued a hurricane watch for Punta San Telmo, Michoac\u00e1n, to Playa Perula, Jalisco, and a tropical storm watch for the southern tip of Baja California Sur from Los Barrilles to Todos Santos. All watches and warnings were gradually discontinued after Ileana's strongest winds were forecast to remain offshore.[1][10] Overall, a green alert was issued for Mexico, signifying a low level of danger.[13] Heavy rainfall in association with Ileana prompted the issuance of orange alerts in \u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n and Magdalena Contreras as well as yellow alerts for the rest of Mexico City.[14][15] In the state of Guerrero, Ileana caused a total of four deaths. On August\u00a05, the body of 35-year-old man was discovered in the Huacapa River in Chilpancingo. The man had reportedly been pushing a car out of a ravine when a strong current pulled him down to the river where he drowned. A fishing boat capsized in Acapulco, causing an 8-year-old and a 15-year-old to fall into the Laguna and drown.[16][17] The storm caused power outages in multiple Acapulcan neighborhoods and left flooding there. A rainfall total of 3.54\u00a0in (90\u00a0mm) was recorded at the Acapulco International Airport.[18] Rip currents along the coast at Acapulco resulted in the death of a tourist at La Condesa beach. He was rescued by lifeguards, but later died despite receiving medical treatment.[16] In the nearby municipality of Coyuca de Ben\u00edtez, at least 20 homes were inundated and numerous streets were flooded.[19] In the municipality of Santiago Choapam in Oaxaca, heavy rains from Ileana caused a landslide that left a house in ruins. All inhabitants of the structure were unharmed.[20] A peak rainfall total of 7.71\u00a0in (196\u00a0mm) was observed in Jacatepec, Oaxaca.[15] In Jiquipilas, Chiapas, Ileana caused another four deaths on August\u00a06. A vehicle containing 18 individuals was swept away by water currents while attempting to cross a flooded bridge; three children and one adult were later found dead.[21] The state of Michoac\u00e1n required MX$13.6\u00a0million (US$737,000) to repair damage to roads and houses in 15 neighborhoods.[22] In the state of Mexico, heavy rains from Ileana caused severe flooding; in the municipality of Huixquilucan, two homes were flooded and a sewage canal overflowed.[14] The Anillo Perif\u00e9rico, Mexico City \u2013 Toluca highway, and several other roads in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area experienced flooding. The Mexico City Metro (STC) also implemented safety measures for several of its lines,[23][24] such as the manual operation of trains and decrease in travel speed.[25] The San Jer\u00f3nimo Canal overflowed in the El Rosal neighborhood in Magdalena Contreras. A tree measuring 15\u00a0m (49\u00a0ft) in height completely blocked a road and a total of 33 structures were inundated throughout Mexico City.[14]"

        "content": "Derechos of similar intensity to the August\u00a02020 storm impact the Midwestern U.S. roughly once per decade, with similar derechos having occurred in 1998 and 2011.[2] As with derechos in general, the continuous downwelling of high winds associated with the nearby jet stream and the expansion of dense rain-cooled air in the storm's wake induced the destructive winds and the storm's motion.[19] However, the August\u00a02020 derecho was unusual for the longevity of the damaging winds it produced; some areas were subjected to these winds for up to an hour compared to the 10\u201320\u00a0minutes of sustained damaging winds in a typical derecho, resulting in conditions similar to the passage of a hurricane's eyewall.[2][3] Media outlets described the storm as an \"inland hurricane\".[12][20][21][22][23] On average, the storm front traveled west-to-east at an average speed of 55\u00a0mph (88.5\u00a0km/h; 24.6\u00a0m/s).[8] A combination of strong ambient winds and extreme convective instability facilitated the strength and unusual characteristics of the derecho. The latter factor resulted from the conducive overlapping of moist air drawn northward across the Mississippi Valley and warm and dry air aloft originating from the Southwestern U.S., resulting in an elevated mixed layer that allowed instability to escalate.[19] These convectively unstable conditions permeated across Iowa and were characterized by steep lapse rates in the mid-levels of the troposphere as sampled via weather balloon launches from Omaha, Nebraska, on the morning of August\u00a010, and from Davenport, Iowa, at noon that day;[24][25] the atmospheric sounding retrieved from the Davenport balloon launch observed lapse rates of 8.5\u00b0C/km.[25] The warm front demarcating the northward push of the unstable air also focused the development of storms across the region.[19] Prior to August\u00a010, the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) and the local offices of the National Weather Service (NWS) did not anticipate a storm of exceptional magnitude.[19] Predictive weather models also yielded inaccurate projections of the storm and continued to do so even on the day of the event.[26] On August\u00a03, the SPC noted in a Convective Outlook that a series of shortwave troughs was forecast to move through northern portions of the U.S. in the coming days, becoming possible impetuses for thunderstorm development leading up to and on August\u00a010.[27][III] Three days before the event, the SPC assessed a Marginal Risk of severe weather for a swath of the central U.S. extending from northern Kansas to southern Michigan, including parts of southern Iowa, northern Missouri, and northern Illinois.[29] The risk level was elevated to a Slight Risk at midnight on August\u00a010 prior to the onset of the damaging storms.[19] Temperatures and dew points were between 70\u201380\u00a0\u00b0F (21\u201327\u00a0\u00b0C) across the Midwestern U.S. around dawn on the morning of August\u00a010. Winds blowing from the west were juxtaposed atop near-surface winds blowing from the southwest and south, resulting in strong wind shear over the region. The derecho began as a cluster of scattered thunderstorms that had formed during the previous night over south-central South Dakota. These storms tracked east along the South Dakota\u2013Nebraska border and became better organized and coalesced, producing hail with diameters between 1\u20132\u00a0in (25\u201351\u00a0mm) and wind gusts between 60\u201370\u00a0mph (97\u2013113\u00a0km/h) over a narrow swath. In response to these developments, the SPC issued a special Convective Outlook at 8:00\u00a0a.m., highlighting a now Enhanced Risk  of severe weather for areas in the storms' path including Cedar Rapids, Iowa, the Quad Cities metropolitan area, and Peoria, Illinois.[30] According to the SPC, there was a 30\u00a0percent likelihood of areas within the Enhanced Risk zone experiencing thunderstorm winds or wind gusts in excess of 50\u00a0kn (60\u00a0mph; 95\u00a0km/h).[31] After 8:00\u00a0a.m., the storm moved through Sioux City, Iowa, crossing the Big Sioux River and entering western Iowa. Heating associated with the daytime hours made for warmer conditions near the ground, allowing strong winds produced by the storms to descend to and reach the surface. The storm's winds began to increase considerably after the storm reached west central Iowa at around 10:\u00a0a.m. During this time, some of the derecho's winds spread outward from the storm beneath an atmospheric inversion aloft, spreading to the south and southeast and causing damage over 50\u00a0mi (80\u00a0km) away from the storm in areas with minimal rainfall. Over the next two hours, the storm traversed central Iowa with a rapid forward speed of up to 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h), impacting communities including Ames, Des Moines, and Marshalltown.[30][32] Wind gusts approaching 120\u00a0mph (190\u00a0km/h) were produced by the storm during this period.[30] Aloft, the storm was being supported by a rear-inflow jet sporting winds of 80\u2013100\u00a0kn (90\u2013115\u00a0mph; 150\u2013185\u00a0km/h) with the downwind airmass exhibiting convective available potential energy (CAPE) values between 2000\u20132500\u00a0J/kg.[33] At 11:25\u00a0a.m., a severe thunderstorm watch tagged as denoting a particularly dangerous situation was issued by the SPC for areas ahead of the storm including central Iowa, southern Wisconsin, northern Illinois, and northwestern Indiana.[34] Shortly after, the SPC introduced a Moderate Risk for severe weather in its categorical outlooks for similar areas.[30] Around the same time, a counterclockwise vortex developed on the northern end of the storm, resulting in the storm attaining a bow-like structure with its strongest winds at the apex of this shape.[19] University of Oklahoma meteorologist and tornado expert Stephen Corfidi remarked that the vortex was \"one of the most distinctive ones of that size\" he had ever seen.[3] The core of stronger winds tracked east at speeds of 65\u201370\u00a0mph (110\u2013130\u00a0km/h) and bore faster wind speeds.[35] The derecho was at its strongest when it moved across the Cedar Rapids area of eastern Iowa. Based on the severity of damage observed, the NWS estimated that wind gusts of 130\u2013140\u00a0mph (210\u2013230\u00a0km/h) impacted parts of Benton and Linn counties in Iowa, including downtown Cedar Rapids and Marion. These winds diminished slightly as the derecho approached the Mississippi River, though gusts of 80\u2013100\u00a0mph (130\u2013160\u00a0km/h) remained widespread. The more extreme corridor of wind gusts transitioned into a broader swath of 60\u201370\u00a0mph (97\u2013113\u00a0km/h) winds as the storm moved across northern Illinois and northwestern Indiana between 2\u20135\u00a0p.m. Despite the weakening of straight-line winds, the atmospheric environment became more conducive for tornadogenesis during this time. This resulted in several brief EF0 and EF1 tornadoes developing over northern Illinois and Indiana. The derecho's winds continued to lessen as the storm tracked farther east, weakening below damaging levels shortly after 7\u00a0p.m. as the storm was moving into Ohio and Michigan.[30][7]"

Chris Larimer of the University of Northern Iowa concurred, adding that practical help is more likely to earn voter support. At Cornell College, Megan Goldberg said \"an elected official wants to claim credit for disaster relief that is effective, while avoiding blame for any mismanagement of disaster relief\", concluding that \"even a candidate or official who genuinely wants to visit a site \u2014 either to help or to gather information \u2014 has to think about how the visit can be spun to his or her political advantage, and how to reply to criticisms of such visits. But that's the way it often is these days.\"[142]"

The NWS said it was atypical for such a severe storm to not appear in the previous day's weather models. Additionally, NWS research into derechos indicates weather patterns in the region to be shifting towards the poles, which might be a result of climate change.[144][145] The high damage estimate aligns with analysis showing increases in the costs of natural disasters as a result of climate change-driven storm intensity.[3][146]"

By that time, the system had taken on a well-defined bow echo shape, the classic indicator of a derecho.[4] A severe thunderstorm watch, with high wind probabilities (although not a PDS watch) was issued for the majority of Ohio, much of West Virginia, and parts of Indiana and Kentucky at 3:05\u00a0p.m. EDT (1905 UTC) as the storm traversed north-central Indiana.[5] Moving southeastward to east-southeastward at about 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h)\u2014a speed and trajectory that the derecho maintained for its entire lifespan\u2014it followed the stationary front and increased in size as it entered Ohio in the mid-afternoon hours, affecting a large portion of the state. Since the derecho was clearly underway and expected to last a long time, the SPC increased the threat level to a moderate risk of severe weather at 3:37\u00a0p.m. EDT (1937 UTC) across Ohio, West Virginia and small portions of neighboring states, warning of the extreme wind threat.[6] It crossed over the Columbus area at approximately 5:00\u00a0p.m. EDT, with winds reported to 82\u00a0mph (132\u00a0km/h) there, and caused severe damage to the power grid in Franklin, Delaware, and Licking Counties. Winds were in excess of 80\u00a0mph (128\u00a0km/h) as well reported at many other locations across the state.[7] It maintained its intensity as it reached the Ohio River early in the evening, and the only reported (but unconfirmed) tornado associated with the system occurred in association with the derecho's bookend vortex, and did minimal damage in comparison near Newcomerstown, Ohio, at 6:20\u00a0p.m. EDT.[7] As the derecho reached the Ohio-West Virginia border, the SPC issued another severe thunderstorm watch at 6:35\u00a0p.m. EDT (2235 UTC), also with high wind probabilities, for the remainder of West Virginia, much of Virginia and Maryland, parts of North Carolina, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and the District of Columbia.[8] The derecho crossed the mountains of West Virginia, leaving destruction in its wake, as well as parts of southwestern Pennsylvania and eastern Kentucky through the early evening hours.[citation needed]"

Its formation prompted the SPC to issue another severe thunderstorm watch, the second of the day for much of the region, for the areas in its path including parts of Iowa and Illinois.[14] However, the storm reached the cold pool left behind by the derecho, and dissipated in the cool, weakly unstable air. Along with its much shorter track, the second storm produced a maximum wind gust of 90\u00a0mph (145\u00a0km/h) in Marengo, Iowa.

In all the mentioned areas, many trees uprooted or snapped, roofs became damaged, tents deployed to sell fireworks leading up to the 4th of July Holiday collapsed, and power outages were extensive, with over 4.2 million customers losing power as a result.[16]\n[17] An Appalachian Power representative described the  power outage as the worst the company had ever seen.[15] In total, 22 people were killed across seven states and the District of Columbia.[18] At least ten of those deaths were in Virginia, all of them due to fallen trees.[15] Two of the deaths were in New Jersey, after two children were killed by falling trees at a campground at Parvin State Park, three deaths were reported in Maryland and one death was reported in Ohio after the storm.[19]  As it occurred in the midst of the record Summer 2012 North American heat wave, conditions on following days were problematic, particularly for seniors and vulnerable people.  Scattered structural damage also occurred along the path of the derecho, from both falling trees and the winds themselves. Some of the damage included siding was torn off houses, roofs removed from houses, businesses and apartment buildings, mobile homes heavily damaged, barns and garages destroyed and airplanes flipped.[7] "

Wind gusts with this derecho were closer to 85\u00a0mph (137\u00a0km/h), and, though of a significantly shorter duration, caused more damage to trees and power lines than Ike.[22] In Bellefontaine, the storm's strength was sufficient to cause severe damage to the tower of the county courthouse,[23] a reinforced sandstone structure.[24]  In fact, this derecho was so destructive that Accuweather compared its destruction to that of Hurricane Irene, and The Weather Channel compared it to hurricane damage in general.[25] Many lost power for 5 days, some much longer."

Around 70 high voltage power lines were downed.[27] The derecho's aftermath was arguably more difficult in West Virginia than anywhere else. Power restoration was very slow and outages extremely long, as a result of the sparse and scattered population, mountainous terrain, difficult conditions in extreme heat and need for crews over a large area; in many cases the outages lasted longer than two weeks.

A Washington, D.C., man was electrocuted and his wife critically injured when they went outside to check the damage to their house from a fallen tree.[36] The AT&T National golf tournament at Congressional Country Club was also slowed due to severe tree damage on the course.[20] Governor Martin O'Malley of Maryland declared a state of emergency after the storm. As of July 6, over 4800 tons of storm debris had been collected in Montgomery County, Maryland, with collection ongoing.[37] In Baltimore (city) and Baltimore County, the widespread damage left large trees uprooted and traffic patterns disrupted.

        "content": "Tropical Storm Barbara was the first tropical cyclone to make landfall during the 2007 Pacific hurricane season. The second storm of the season, Barbara developed from a small low-pressure area on May 29 about 235\u00a0miles (380\u00a0km) southeast of Acapulco, Mexico. The system drifted southward before turning to a steadily eastward motion, and quickly intensified into a tropical storm. Increased wind shear weakened Barbara, though it re-organized to attain peak winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) before moving ashore just west of the border of Mexico and Guatemala. It rapidly weakened over land, and on June 2 the National Hurricane Center discontinued advisories on the storm. Despite expectations that the storm would attain hurricane status, Barbara moved ashore as a small, weak tropical storm. It produced locally heavy rainfall and gusty winds, and in most locations damage was minor. However, in southern Mexico, the rainfall destroyed large areas of cropland, with crop damage totaling 200\u00a0million pesos (2007\u00a0MXN, $55\u00a0million 2007\u00a0USD). In El Salvador, four people were killed by storm-induced floods."

        "content": "A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on May 14, which is believed to have been the impetus to Barbara. The wave axis crossed Central America on May 25 and emerged into the eastern North Pacific Ocean the next day. Interacting with the Intertropical Convergence Zone, a broad surface low-pressure area developed within the area on May 27, and as it drifted northward the system maintained limited and disorganized convection. On May 29, convection increased and became concentrated near the low pressure center,[1] and banding features developed in its eastern semicircle as the circulation became better defined.[2] It is estimated the system formed into Tropical Depression Two-E at 1800\u00a0UTC on May 29 about 115\u00a0miles (185\u00a0km) southeast of Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca.[1] Upon becoming a tropical cyclone, the depression was stationary in an area with warm sea surface temperatures, very light wind shear, and favorable upper-level conditions.[2] In the hours after becoming a tropical cyclone, the deep convection associated with the depression decreased,[3] though it again increased later in the day. A ragged rainband developed in the southeastern quadrant of the circulation, and based on increased Dvorak numbers and improved presentation on satellite imagery, the National Hurricane Center upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Barbara on May 30 while it was located about 115\u00a0miles (185\u00a0km) south of Puerto Escondido. This marked only the third time on record that two storms formed in May in the basin, after 1956 and 1984. Initially, Barbara was forecast to intensify to attain hurricane status and reach winds of 85\u00a0mph (135\u00a0km/h).[4] The storm drifted southward and later eastward due to northerly flow behind a mid- to upper-level trough in the Gulf of Mexico. With well-defined outflow and warm sea surface temperatures, Barbara became better organized as tightly curved bands of convection developed near the center.[5] However, by May 31, increased wind shear and less inflow deteriorated the definition of the circulation, causing the storm to weaken.[6] By later that day, the system contained a very small circulation within a large-scale trough,[7] and early on June 1 it was downgraded to tropical depression status.[8] Later in the day, convective banding features re-developed, and after a QuikSCAT overpass indicated a well-defined circulation in the system, Barbara was again upgraded to tropical storm status.[9] The storm reached peak winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) and turned to the northeast as it tracked through a break in a ridge extending from the southwest Gulf of Mexico.[10] Banding features continued to organize, and shortly before moving ashore a low-level eye feature developed.[11] At about 1300\u00a0UTC on June 2, Barbara made landfall just west of the border between Mexico and Guatemala. The center quickly deteriorated to tropical depression status over the mountainous terrain of extreme southeastern Chiapas, and Barbara dissipated within twelve hours of moving ashore.[1]"

        "content": "Early in the duration of the cyclone, the National Hurricane Center recommended for interests along the coast of southwestern Mexico to monitor the progress of the storm.[12] Upon regaining tropical storm status on June 1, the governments of Guatemala and Mexico issued a tropical storm watch from Sipacate, Guatemala to Barra de Tonala, Mexico.[13] Later, as the track became more apparent, the watch was replaced by a tropical storm warning,[14] and a tropical storm watch was extended westward to Salina Cruz, Mexico.[15] Officials in Mexico allocated emergency funds for southern regions of Chiapas and Oaxaca in preparation for a potential flooding disaster.[16] At least 1,400\u00a0people were evacuated in Chiapas to emergency shelters.[17] The outer rainbands of the storm first began affecting Guatemala and southeastern Mexico late on June 1.[14] In Mexico, the peak 24-hour rainfall total was 4.96\u00a0inches (126\u00a0mm) in Huixtla,[18] and across southeastern Mexico, the rainfall led to above normal levels in many rivers.[19] An automatic surface station in Puerto Madero, Mexico recorded sustained winds of 36\u00a0mph (58\u00a0km/h) with gusts of 53\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h) shortly after landfall.[20] In most locations, damage from the storm was minor, limited to downed light posts, some damaged roofs, and a brief power outage.[21] However, winds and rains from the storm caused moderate to severe crop damage in the mountain range of southern Chiapas. About 35\u00a0sq.\u00a0miles (90\u00a0km2) of banana crops were destroyed, with about 4\u00a0sq.\u00a0miles (10\u00a0km2) of coffee damaged. The passage of the storm also resulted in damage to cocoa beans, mango, coconut, and other vegetables, with crop damage totaling about 200\u00a0million pesos (2007\u00a0MXN, $55\u00a0million 2007\u00a0USD). As a result of the crop damage, the government of Mexico provided 108\u00a0million pesos (2007\u00a0MXN, $10\u00a0million 2007\u00a0USD) in financial aid to the affected farmers.[22] In Ocos, Guatemala near the border, winds from the storm destroyed the roofs of about a dozen palm huts,[19] forcing over 100 residents to evacuate.[17] The winds also downed hundreds of trees near the coastline. Heavy rainfall from the storm led to river flooding; the island of Ocos was separated from the mainland after the bridge was washed away.[19] Heavy rains along the periphery of the storm triggered significant flooding in El Salvador which killed at least four people.[23]"

A tropical disturbance developed into a tropical depression on July 11 and into Hurricane Dalilia on July 13. Dalilia crossed 140\u00b0W shortly after reaching its maximum intensity and entered the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility. The storm accelerated, and headed directly towards the Hawaiian Islands. Hurricane Dalilia passed just south of the Hawaiian Islands as a tropical storm before dissipating July 21 as it interacted with a trough. It then interacted with the remains of Tropical Storm Erick and reformed into a depression on July 24. A trough then accelerated the remnants towards the Aleutian Islands on July 28. The cyclone's effects were minimal. There was high surf, and some gusty winds. Damage was minor, and mainly limited to downed power lines. However, many areas throughout the island chain received more than 5\u00a0in (130\u00a0mm) of precipitation."

        "content": "Hurricane Dalilia originated out of a tropical disturbance embedded in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) during early July 1989 off the west coast of Africa. As the system became increasingly organized, the disturbance's outflow suppressed the ITCZ. By July\u00a09, the disturbance had entered the eastern Pacific Ocean and sufficient convective development to prompt Dvorak Technique intensity estimates. Continued development took place in the following days; on July\u00a011, the National Hurricane Center determined that the disturbance spawned a tropical depression 792\u00a0mi (1,275\u00a0km) southwest of Cabo San Lucas.[1] Upon being designated a depression, it was still partially embedded within the ITCZ, inhibiting rapid development. In fact, the National Hurricane Center did not operationally begin advisories on the depression until almost 24 hours later.[2] After the National Hurricane Center began issuing advisories, the depression quickly became more well-defined, as it began separating from the ITCZ on July 12. In addition, significant further intensification was expected, as sea surface temperatures (SST's) were greater than 78.8\u00a0\u00b0F (26\u00a0\u00b0C).[3] Only a few hours later, satellite imagery showed a significant increase in convection.[4] Tracking in a general west-northwest direction, the depression intensified into a tropical storm late on July\u00a012, at which time it was given the name Dalilia by the NHC.[1] Dalilia rapidly intensified after becoming a tropical storm, and several computer models predicted it to reach winds of 100\u00a0mph (155\u00a0km/h) by July 15.[5] Six hours later, the National Hurricane Center upgraded Dalilia to a hurricane, after winds were estimated at 75\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h), and satellite imagery suggested that the hurricane was continuing to organize.[6] However, post-storm analysis show this upgrade as several hours premature.[7] While Dalilia developed well-defined spiral convective bands, it had remained a minimal hurricane, since no eye had formed.[8] Despite earlier forecasts for low wind shear values, upper-level winds appeared less favorable for further intensification, after water vapor imagery showed several upper-level low pressure areas to the north and northeast of Dalilia.[9] Although the National Hurricane Center operationally held the intensity of Dalilia at minimal hurricane status for a while; post-analysis data show that Dalilia was slowly intensifying.[7]  By July\u00a016, the storm developed a central dense overcast, leading to further intensification.[10] Although the storm tracked near cool waters, a well-developed outflow allowed it to maintain hurricane-intensity.[11] Shortly before crossing into the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility, the storm reached its peak intensity with winds of 90\u00a0mph (150\u00a0km/h) and a central pressure of 977\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.85\u00a0inHg).[1] After crossing 140\u00b0W, Dalilia weakened to a minimal hurricane. The storm maintained this intensity until July\u00a019, at which time the system slowed and turned northwest. The following day, the weakening tropical storm brushed the Hawaiian Islands to the south, eventually curving away from the island chain on July\u00a021. Later that day, Dalilia further weakened to a tropical depression, with the Central Pacific Hurricane Center issuing their final advisory at that time. The remnants of the former hurricane continued to track northwest. On July\u00a024, the system interacted with the remnants of Tropical Storm Erick and may have briefly re-attained tropical storm intensity; however, by July\u00a028, the storm was rapidly tracking north through the Aleutian Islands. The remnants of Dalilia dissipated shortly thereafter.[12]"

Officials urged residents to stock up on supplies and they closed beaches.[13] Even though the Central Pacific Hurricane Center remarked that that watch will likely be upgraded into a hurricane warning,[14] this failed to occur; instead, the watch was discontinued on July 20 because meteorologists were now expecting the storm to pass south of the island chain.[15] While tracking near the Hawaiian Islands, Dalilia produced waves up to 20\u00a0ft (6.1\u00a0m) along south-facing coastlines. Along the coasts of Ka'u and South Kona, winds gusted up to 45\u00a0mph (75\u00a0km/h); the winds caused minor damage, mainly downed power lines. Most areas on Oahu received up to 3\u00a0in (76\u00a0mm) of rain with localized areas reporting up to 8\u00a0in (200\u00a0mm).[12] Hurricane Dalilia contributed to a record rainfall total for the month of July in Honolulu with 2.33\u00a0in (59\u00a0mm) falling during the storm's passage. The heaviest rainfall was recorded on the north side of Kauai, with localized areas receiving rainfall in excess of 10\u00a0in (250\u00a0mm). Along the southeast slopes of Mauna Loa, upwards of 9\u00a0in (230\u00a0mm) of rain fell. The remnants of the storm continued to produce unseasonable rains in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands through July\u00a028.[12] Heavy rains caused minor flooding which forced transit officials to shut down several roads. Many power lines were down, which produced minor wind damage.[12] Despite causing power outages, there were no reports of injuries or major property damage. Overall, impact from Tropical Storm Dalilia was less than anticipated.[16]"

        "content": "On December\u00a026, a cold front exited Mozambique in southeastern Africa into the Mozambique Channel. Upon reaching open waters, the front developed an area of convection and later a circulation just inland from the coast on December\u00a027. The front dissipated but the circulation remained as a distinct low pressure area. Although there was high wind shear in the area, good divergence allowed for convection to continue developing.[1] On December\u00a030, M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France (MFR), the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center, designated the system as a tropical disturbance. Over the next two days, convection became increasingly organized, with banding features developing by December\u00a031.[2] That day, MFR upgraded the disturbance to a tropical depression,[1] and around 0900\u00a0UTC, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. Decreasing wind shear and moderate outflow would allow the system to intensify into a tropical storm.[3] On January\u00a01, 2002, the JTWC classified the depression as a tropical storm, designating it as Tropical Cyclone 08S.[4] The system rapidly organized shortly after and was further upgraded to a moderate tropical storm by M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France at 0600\u00a0UTC,[2] at which time the Meteorological Service of Madagascar gave it the name Cyprien.[1] In response to a mid to upper-level subtropical high pressure area, the storm tracked in a general eastward direction at 16\u00a0km/h (10\u00a0mph).[2] Several hours after being named, the JTWC assessed Cyprien to have reached its peak winds of 95\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph 1-minute winds).[4] QuickSCAT satellite passes indicated areas of 100\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph) winds early on January\u00a02, prompting M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France to upgrade Cyprien to a severe tropical storm, with winds peaking at 100\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph 10-minute winds). By this time, the central barometric pressure fell to 980\u00a0hPa (mbar).[2] Later on January\u00a02, the combination of the subtropical ridge to the north, an approaching mid-latitude trough and moderate to strong westerlies caused Severe Tropical Storm Cyprien to turn towards the southwest. Slight weakening took place shortly before the storm made landfall in Morombe; maximum winds decreased to 50\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h 10-minute winds). Increased wind shear and interaction with land caused the deep convection to become substantially displaced to the east from the center of circulation. Early on January\u00a03, Cyprien was downgraded to a tropical depression by both agencies; however, some areas were still reporting gale-force winds.[2] It turned to the northeast over land, dissipating late on January\u00a03.[1]"

Following an assessment of the storm's impact, 180 homes and 16 administrative buildings were found to have been destroyed by Cyprien. Damages in the area amounted to 1.1\u00a0billion Malagasy franc (2002 MGF; US$172,507). North of Morombe, the city of Morondava also sustained significant damage; roughly 1,000 people were affected and 661 homes were destroyed.[5] Numerous homes were inundated by floodwaters.[7] Officials reported that floodwaters persisted until January\u00a09.[8] Damages in the city amounted to 60\u00a0million MGF (2002 MGF; US$9,287).[5] In all, damages from the storm amounted to 1.16\u00a0billion MGF (2002 MGF; ~US$181,000).[2] Following Cyprien, the Government of Madagascar did not request international assistance in post-storm recovery. By January\u00a010, a cargo plane carrying 65\u00a0million MGF (2002 MGF; US$10,062) worth of relief supplies was deployed to the affected regions. The supplies, consisting of medical supplies, tents, and one tonne of rice, were given to local authorities to be distributed to the affected population. Sanitary items were also distributed by the government to avoid an outbreak of water-borne diseases such as diarrhea and cholera.[5]"

It began to enter the Bashi Channel, where environmental conditions were favorable to intensify the depression. On May 17, 08W further intensified into a tropical storm, prompting the JMA to name the storm Cimaron. Cimaron turned northwest and entered the South China Sea.

A strike of lightning spawned and struck the province of Ilocos Sur, killing 2 people and leaving an extra 2 more injured.[3] After its landfall in the Philippines, the cyclone entered the Bashi Channel. As it did, it also entered conducive conditions. Due to the favorable ocean conditions, the cyclone's intensity was upgraded to tropical storm status. Simultaneously, it was named Cimaron (1308) by the JMA on early July \u00a017.[4] Cimaron continued to move northwest and entered the northeastern South China Sea, where it affected areas of Taiwan, but no fatalities, injuries, or any missing people were reported around that area. It afterwards began to turn towards the north and approached the south coast of Fujian. It finally made its last landfall as a weak tropical storm of the Zhangpu County on the date of July \u00a018, with the maximum wind speed at its center reaching at least 45\u00a0mph at its landfall.[citation needed] After landfall, Cimaron continued to move in a northwestern direction, with its intensity decreasing very rapidly, and it weakened into a tropical depression within Fujian on July 18. The Japan Meteorological Agency stopped monitoring the storm at 21:00 UTC on July 18, as it was declared it had dissipated by then.[citation needed]"

There was an even sharper drop in 1966\u20131967 to 4.3 million tonnes.

The rise in prices of food grains caused migration and starvation, but the public distribution system, relief measures by the government, and voluntary organizations limited the impact.[5] On a number of occasions, the Indian-government sought food and grain from the United States to provide replacement for damaged crops, however US food aid was limited by Lyndon B. Johnson in retaliation for Indian criticism on the US's role in the Vietnam War.[6][7]"

        "content": "Hurricane Olga was the fifteenth named storm and ninth hurricane of the 2001 Atlantic hurricane season. It was notable as it was the largest tropical cyclone by diameter of gale-force winds on record in the Atlantic at the time. Hurricane Olga formed as a subtropical cyclone on November 24. After acquiring tropical characteristics later that day, Olga meandered westward, and eventually reached hurricane status on November 26. Olga peaked as a 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) Category\u00a01 hurricane before the storm turned southwestward and weakening back into a tropical storm. On November\u00a030 it deteriorated further to a tropical depression, although it re-intensified two days later to tropical storm intensity. Olga then dissipated as a tropical cyclone on December 4 east of the Bahamas. Its damaging effects were limited to ships at sea. The cyclone's remnants produced heavy rainfall across the Bahamas and Florida. It was a relatively rare storm to exist in December, which is outside of the normal Atlantic hurricane season."

        "content": "The origins of Hurricane Olga were from the interaction of a cold front and a small weather disturbance in the north Atlantic Ocean, producing an extratropical low east of Bermuda on November\u00a022. The low gradually intensified and acquired subtropical characteristics, developing an area of convection east of the center and accompanied by a large area of gale-force winds. By 00:00\u00a0UTC on November\u00a024, the system organized enough to be classified as Subtropical Storm Two, while located about 900\u00a0mi (1,400\u00a0km) east-southeast of Bermuda. Subsequently, the convection markedly increased and became more concentrated, with hints of an eye feature. Within 12\u00a0hours of becoming a subtropical, it is estimated the cyclone transitioned into Tropical Storm Olga; however, it was not purely tropical, due to being positioned beneath an upper-level low.[1] Operationally, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) did not initiate advisories until nine hours later,[2] referring to it as Subtropical Storm Two for two more days.[1] When advisories first began on Olga, forecasters were uncertain how long the storm would persist, due to the storm's presence within a much larger storm; one hurricane model anticipated an increase in wind shear within 24\u00a0hours, which would likely cause quick dissipation. However, the NHC accurately forecasted the storm to remain a cyclone for several days.[2] Olga initially tracked northeastward, followed by a turn to the west due to a building ridge to its north.[1] On November\u00a025, the storm began acquiring more characteristics of a tropical storm, such as detaching from the larger storm and developing more distinct convective rainbands. This was due to decreasing wind shear and continued atmospheric instability, although only marginally warm sea surface temperatures.[3] After turning to the southwest, Olga resumed a northwest motion, and at 1200\u00a0UTC on November\u00a026, Olga intensified into a hurricane.[1] By that time, an eye had developed in the center, and the previously large wind field had contracted.[4] Upon attaining hurricane status, Olga was tracking northwestward due to an approaching trough.[5] The eye steadily became better defined as outflow increased,[6] and on November\u00a027, Olga attained peak winds of 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h), along with a minimum pressure of 973\u00a0mbar (28.73\u00a0inHg). While at peak intensity, the hurricane executed a double loop about 455\u00a0mi (732\u00a0km) east of Bermuda, due to interaction with a larger cyclonic circulation that was isolated from the westerlies.[1] On November\u00a028, after finishing the second loop, Olga turned to the southwest due to a building ridge to its northwest. Around the same time, it began a steady weakening trend, due to strong wind shear displacing the convection.[1] The eye became poorly defined as the center became exposed,[7] and on November\u00a029 Olga weakened to tropical storm status.[1] With the thunderstorms rapidly diminishing, the storm weakened quickly,[8] and Olga deteriorated further to a tropical depression on November\u00a030.[1] Forecasters anticipated continued weakening until dissipation, although the cyclone was expected to move over an area of more favorable conditions, including warmer waters and lighter shear.[8] Still existing as a tropical cyclone on December\u00a01, Olga extended the hurricane season beyond its typical boundaries.[1][9] It continued producing a small area of deep convection, prompting one forecaster to note that \"Olga is stubbornly holding on to tropical cyclone status... for now.\"[10] After reaching a position about 240\u00a0mi (390\u00a0km) northeast of the Turks and Caicos Islands, the depression turned toward the north after a trough created a weakness in the ridge.[11] After a decrease in wind shear, deep convection redeveloped over the center, and Olga re-intensified into a tropical storm on December\u00a02.[1] After becoming a tropical storm again, the thunderstorms organized into a rainband about 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km) away from the center, characteristics more typical of a subtropical cyclone.[12] By late on December\u00a02, the structure resembled that of a hurricane with an eye in the center, and although convection was weak, Olga was able to intensify further to winds of 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h). At the time, there was uncertainty whether the storm would strengthen further, possibly to near hurricane status, or rapidly weaken.[13] Ultimately, an approaching trough caused weakening by increasing wind shear, while also forcing the storm eastward.[14] On December\u00a04, Olga again weakened to a tropical depression as it lost most of its convection. Later that day, the circulation turned to the southeast as a ridge built to its north, and Olga degenerated into a remnant low pressure area, about 690\u00a0mi (1,110\u00a0km) east of Nassau, Bahamas. The remnant circulation turned to the south and west, completing a loop and later moving through the Bahamas before dissipating along the north coast of Cuba on December\u00a07.[1]"

The approach of Olga also forced cancellation of the World Yacht regatta, but there was little damage on the island.[17] Olga brought winds of 35\u201345\u00a0mph (56\u201372\u00a0km/h) and waves 15\u201322\u00a0ft (4.6\u20136.7\u00a0m) to the island for several days, but there were no reports of any damage.[17] The hurricane also brought rough seas to the East Coast of the United States, the Bahamas, and as far south and east as the Lesser Antilles. A buoy near Guadeloupe reported 12\u00a0ft (3.7\u00a0m) waves.[1] High waves in Florida eroded beaches, threatening the foundations of two homes in Flagler County.[18] The remnants of Olga later produced heavy rainfall across the Bahamas, Cuba and south Florida.[1]"

It formed in July in the Bay of Campeche, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. As a tropical wave, Gert crossed Honduras and the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula before organizing into Tropical Depression Seven on the afternoon of July 23 in the Bay of Campeche. It was upgraded to Tropical Storm Gert early the next day, gaining the record for the earliest formation of a seventh named storm in an Atlantic hurricane season. That record would later be broken by Tropical Storm Gonzalo in 2020. Gert strengthened little before making landfall south of Tampico, Tamaulipas, late on July 24, with maximum sustained winds of 45\u00a0mph (70\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 1005\u00a0mbar (29.68\u00a0inHg).

        "content": "A tropical wave entered the Atlantic Ocean from Africa on July 10, and the wave developed into an area of low pressure while passing over Cape Verde. Despite the organization, the low failed to develop into a tropical cyclone due to cool waters on the sea surface and wind shear. However, those unfavorable conditions did not completely destroy the wave, as it continued traveling westward through the Lesser Antilles until July 18. That day, while south of Puerto Rico, the wave split in two; the northern half moved northwest and developed into Tropical Storm Franklin over the Bahamas, and the southern half continued westward, with its associated thunderstorm activity increasing.[1] On July 22, a new low pressure area developed while the tropical wave was located over the Gulf of Honduras. However, this area of disturbed weather was unable to develop further, because the storm quickly moved over the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. After its one-day passage through the peninsula, the system entered the Bay of Campeche, but lacked any deep convection. This time, though, the wave quickly developed the deep convection it needed to become a tropical cyclone. In part, this was due to the Sierra Madre Oriental enhancing large-scale rotation of the disturbance by forcing air to flow parallel to the mountain range, instead of through it.[2] As a result, the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida designated it as Tropical Depression Seven, just 255\u00a0miles east-southeast of Tuxpan, Mexico.[3] Early on the July 24, the cyclone was upgraded to a tropical storm with winds of 40\u00a0mph (65\u00a0km/h) and received the name Gert.[1] Gert continued to move northwest after becoming a tropical storm, and reached a peak intensity of 45\u00a0mph (70\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 1005\u00a0mbar (29.68\u00a0inHg). Gert made landfall just 6\u00a0miles (10\u00a0km) to the southeast of P\u00e1nuco,[4] still at peak intensity, at 10:00\u00a0p.m. CDT (00:00 July 25, UTC).[5] However, due to its interaction with land, the storm quickly weakened back to a tropical depression strength early on July 25, and became a remnant low twelve hours after that. Six hours later, just a day after it made landfall, it dissipated over the mountains of central Mexico.[1]"

As a result, the NHC predicted that Gert could intensify further, but this did not occur. The primary emphasis of the forecasts was on the impact the rainfall from Gert could cause, particularly on this area of Mexico, which had been hit previously in the season by other hurricanes.[1] On July 23, the Mexican Servicio Meteorol\u00f3gico Nacional (National Weather Service) issued a tropical storm warning for the eastern Mexican Gulf coast between Palma Sola and Cabo Rojo, as soon as Tropical Depression Seven formed. At that time, a tropical storm watch was issued from Cabo Rojo northward, until reaching La Cruz.[3] That same day, the government of Veracruz declared a state of emergency in 24\u00a0municipalities of the state, making money from the National Disaster Fund available to those affected by the storm.[6] As Gert came closer to the coast, the tropical storm warning was extended northwards to La Cruz,[7] and then to La Pesca,[8] but it was canceled shortly after landfall.[1][9] Tropical Storm Gert struck just south of where Category 3 Hurricane Emily had struck, and where Tropical Storm Bret hit in late June. As a result, there were concerns that serious flooding and mudslides would result due to saturated ground.[1] As a precaution, about 1,000\u00a0people were evacuated from low-lying residences and businesses near the towns of Naranjos Amatl\u00e1n and Tamiahua in Veracruz,[10] and about 6,000 throughout Tamaulipas.[11]"

These dates fall within the period with the most tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic. The first storm moved slowly north-northwestward, bringing heavy rains and extensive flooding to Cuba, which caused at least three fatalities and at least $1\u00a0million (1890\u00a0USD) in damage. It dissipated in the Gulf of Mexico on May\u00a029. Tropical cyclogenesis went dormant for nearly two and a half months, until another system was observed near the Windward Islands on August\u00a018. It traversed the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico, grazing the Yucatan Peninsula and making landfall in Louisiana before dissipating on August\u00a028. Impact from the storm was minimal. Of the season's four tropical cyclones, two reached hurricane status. One of these two strengthened into a major hurricane, which are Category\u00a03 or higher on the modern-day Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale. The strongest cyclone of the season, the third hurricane, peaked at Category\u00a03 strength, with maximum sustained winds of 120\u00a0mph (195\u00a0km/h). Rough seas produced by this storm sunk a ship in the vicinity of the Lesser Antilles, drowning 10\u00a0people. The final tropical cyclone was first observed in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on October\u00a031. Peaking as a strong Category\u00a01 hurricane, it headed westward and made landfall in Nicaragua, before being last noted over Central America on November\u00a01. The storm produced only minor damage in Nicaragua. Collectively, the tropical cyclones of this season resulted in at least $1\u00a0million in damage and 14\u00a0confirmed fatalities."

On May 25, a weak warm-core surface circulation developed east of Nicaragua. It moved around the upper-level low, bringing it to the northwest and later looping to the south through Honduras and Central America. The system weakened over land, but it re-intensified over the western Caribbean Sea, moving over western Cuba as a 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) tropical storm on May 31.[1] Advisories for Alice did not begin until June 1, when the storm entered the Gulf of Mexico.[2] Around the time of the cyclone's naming, reconnaissance aircraft reported winds of around 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h), and subsequently Alice executed another loop off the northwest coast of Cuba.[1] Alice weakened quickly to minimal tropical storm status, due to interaction with a cold front off Florida.[3] It deteriorated so much that advisories were discontinued, with Miami Weather Bureau meteorologist James George remarking that \"no danger [existed there] whatsoever.\"[4] After again passing near the Cuban coast, Alice turned to the northwest and began re-strengthening. On June 5, reconnaissance aircraft estimated 70 to 75\u00a0mph (113 to 121\u00a0km/h) winds in brief squalls northeast of the center, along with a pressure of 997 hectopascals (29.4\u00a0inHg); this would be its peak intensity.

No evacuations were ordered, and the primary impact was in the form of light rain.[6] There were no reports of damage in the state.[1] From 1950 to 1952, Atlantic hurricanes were named using the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet. Before the 1953 season, officials changed the system to using female names; hence, Alice was the first in the new format.[7] Male names would not be used until 1979.[8] The name \"Alice\" was later reused twice in 1954 for a hurricane in June and December, as well as for a hurricane in 1973.[8]"

        "content": "Adelaide's first tramway was opened in 1878; a succession of horse-drawn services followed until in 1907 the South Australian Government established the Municipal Tramways Trust (MTT), which bought out their private-sector owners. A year later the MTT operated its first electric tram and before long the entire network was powered by electricity. The early use of trams was for recreation as well as daily travel, by entire families and tourists. Until the 1950s, trams were used for family outings to the extent that the MTT constructed gardens in the suburb of Kensington Gardens, extending the Kensington line to attract customers. By 1945 the MTT was collecting fares for 95\u00a0million trips annually \u2013 295 trips per head of population. After the Great Depression, the maintenance of the tramway system and the purchase of new trams suffered. Competition from private buses, the MTT's own bus fleet and the growth of private car ownership all took patrons from the tram network. By the 1950s, the tram network was losing money and being replaced by an electric and petrol-driven bus fleet. Adelaide's tram history is preserved by the volunteer-run Tramway Museum, St Kilda[2] and the continuing use of 1929 H type trams on the remaining Glenelg tram line. The Glenelg line was extended to Adelaide railway station in 2007 and to Adelaide Entertainment Centre in 2010. The upgrade included the first new tram purchases in more than 50 years. Flexity Classic and Citadis 302 trams now run on the line."

        "content": "In early 1855, less than twenty years after the colony was founded, South Australia's first horse tram began operating between Goolwa and Port Elliot on the Fleurieu Peninsula.[3] Just over twenty years later Adelaide became the first city in Australia to introduce horse trams, and eventually the last to discard them for more modern public transport.[4] Although two trials of street level trains were run, the state of Adelaide's streets, with mud in winter and dust in summer, led to the decision that they would not be reliable.[5] Sir Edwin Smith and William Buik, both prominent in Kensington and Norwood Corporation then Adelaide City Council (and both later mayors of Adelaide), spent some time inspecting European tramways during the 1870s. They were impressed with horse tram systems and, on returning to Adelaide, they promoted the concept leading to a prospectus being issued for the Adelaide and Suburban Tramway Co (A&ST). Private commercial interests lobbied government for legislative support, over Adelaide council's objections related to licensing and control. As a result, the Government of South Australia passed an 1876 private act, authorising construction of Adelaide's first horse tram network.[6]:\u200a23\u200a It was scheduled for completion within two years, with 10.8 miles (17.4\u00a0km) of lines from Adelaide's city-centre to the suburbs of Kensington and North Adelaide.[7] Completed in May 1878,[8] services began in June from Adelaide to Kensington Park with trams imported from John Stephenson Co of New York, United States.[9] Until 1907, all horse tram operations were by private companies, with the government passing legislation authorising line construction. Growth of the network and rolling stock was driven largely by commercial considerations. On the opening day, the newly founded A&ST began with six trams, expanding to 90 trams and 650 horses by 1907 with its own tram manufacturing facility at Kensington.[10] A Private act, passed in September 1881, allowed the construction of more private horse tramways and additional acts were passed authorising more line construction and services by more companies.[4] Most of the companies operated double-decker tram, although some were single level cabs with many built by John Stephenson Co, Duncan & Fraser of Adelaide, and from 1897 by the A&ST at Kensington.[10] The trams ran at an average speed of 5 miles per hour (8\u00a0km/h), usually two horses pulling each tram from a pool of four to ten.[11] Various companies expanded the network from its initial line to Kensington, with eleven companies operating within six years, three more having already failed before constructing tracks.[12] The Adelaide to North Adelaide line opened in December 1878, a separate one from Port Adelaide to Albert Park in 1879, Adelaide to Mitcham and Hindmarsh in 1881, Walkerville 1882, Burnside, Prospect, Nailsworth and Enfield in 1883, and Maylands in 1892.[13] Various streets were widened especially for the tram lines including Brougham Place, North Adelaide by 10 feet (3\u00a0m) and Prospect Road to a total width of 60 feet (18\u00a0m).[14][15] All but one line was built in 4\u00a0ft\u00a08+1\u20442\u00a0in (1,435\u00a0mm) standard gauge with the exception from Port Adelaide to Albert Park. This line was built in 5\u00a0ft\u00a03\u00a0in (1,600\u00a0mm) to accommodate steam engines, also requiring some of the line to be raised on embankments to avoid swampy ground and flooding.[16] There were 74 miles (119\u00a0km) of tramlines with 1062 horses and 162 cars by 1901[17] and isolated lines from Port Adelaide to Albert Park and Glenelg to Brighton, as well as a network joining many suburbs to Adelaide's CBD by 1907. The network had termini in Henley Beach, Hindmarsh, Prospect, Nailsworth, Paradise, Magill, Burnside, Glen Osmond, Mitcham, Clarence Park, Hyde Park and Walkerville.[18] To accommodate the specific needs of horses, most streets were left unsealed. The horses' urine needed an unsealed surface for absorption and their hooves a soft surface for good traction.[11]"

        "header": "Electrification",
        "content": "Adelaide's first experiment with electric powered trams was a demonstration run on the Adelaide and Hindmarsh Tramway company's line. A battery powered tram fitted with Julien's Patent Electric Traction[19][20] ran in 1889 to Henley Beach. The trial was unsuccessful due to the batteries poor capacity, and the promoters' deaths in a level crossing accident shortly after precluded further experiments.[21] As with horse trams, commercial interests pursued government support for the introduction of electric tramways. The most influential was the \"Snow scheme\", promoted by Francis H. Snow largely on behalf of two London companies, British Westinghouse and Callender's Cable Construction. The scheme involved the purchase of major horse tramways, merging into an electric tramway company with twenty-one years of exclusive running rights. Legislation was passed in 1901, a referendum held in 1902, but the required funds had been spent and the scheme collapsed. Adelaide's council proposed their own scheme backed by different companies, but failed to raise the required capital, and J. H. Packard promoted various plans of his own devising that also never eventuated.[6]:\u200a31\u201333\u200a[22] By 1901, Adelaide's horse trams were seen by the public as a blot on the city's image. With a population of 162,000 the slow speed of the trams, and the lines subsequent low traffic capacity, made them inadequate for public transport needs. The unsealed roads the horses required became quagmires in winter and sources of dust in summer. The 10\u00a0pounds of manure each horse left behind daily, was also not well regarded.[11] Under these various pressures the government negotiated to purchase the horse tramway companies. A 28 March 1906 newspaper notice announced that the government had purchased all of the city tramways for \u00a3280,000.[17] Bill No.913, passed 22 December 1906, created the Municipal Tramways Trust (MTT) with the authority to build new and purchase existing tramways.[23] Not all tramway companies were purchased, as the Glenelg to Marino company continued operating separately until its failure in 1914.[24] The government purchased the properties, plant and equipment of existing tramways but did not purchase the companies themselves.[23] The equipment included 162 trams, 22 other vehicles and 1,056 horses. By 1909 at the launch of Adelaide's electric tram services there remained 163 horse trams and 650 horses under the control of the MTT.[25] Due to the time required to electrify the network, the MTT continued to run horse trams until 1914. The cost of purchasing the tramways was funded by treasury bills[23] and the act capped total construction costs at \u00a312,000 per mile of track.[26] \u00a3457,000 was let in contracts to March 1908 for construction of the tramways, trams, strengthening the Adelaide bridge over the River Torrens and associated works.[27] The official ceremony starting track construction was in May 1908, with tracks originally laid on Jarrah sleepers.[28] On 30 November 1908, there were two trial runs from the MTT's depot on Hackney Road to the nearby Adelaide Botanic Garden and back, the evening trial carrying the Premier and Governor.[28] At the official opening ceremony on 9 March 1909, Electric Tram 1 was driven by Anne Price, wife of Premier Thomas Price, from the Hackney depot to Kensington and back, assisted by the MTT's chief engineer.[29] At the 1909 opening, 35 miles (56 kilometres) of track had been completed with electricity supplied by the Electric Lighting and Supply Co.[30] The electric tram system ran on 600\u00a0Volts DC supplied at first from two converter stations,[31] No.1 converter station on East Terrace with 2,500\u00a0kW of AC to DC capacity and No.2 station at Thebarton with a capacity of 900\u00a0kW.[32] To cope with variable loads on the system, very large storage lead\u2013acid batteries were installed, the initial one at East Terrace comprising 293 cells and a 50\u00a0ton tank of sulphuric acid.[33] The Glenelg line was, from 1873, a 5\u00a0ft\u00a03\u00a0in (1,600\u00a0mm) steam railway that ran at street level into Victoria Square.[34] Originally privately owned it was taken over by the South Australian Railways then transferred to the MTT in 1927. The line was closed to be rebuilt to 4\u00a0ft\u00a08+1\u20442\u00a0in (1,435\u00a0mm) standard gauge, electrified at 600\u00a0Volts DC and converted to tramway operation, reopening in late 1929. The Port Adelaide line, which until that time had still used horse trams, began to be converted to electric operation in 1914 and opened on 3 April 1917.[25] A line from Magill to Morialta opened in 1915 for weekend tourist traffic, with only a single return service on weekdays. The line ran in the valley of 4th creek, a tributary of the River Torrens, across farmland and along unmade and ungazetted roads.[35] On 18 September 1918, a tram line opened from Sturt Street, via West Terrace and then Anzac Highway (then Bay Road[36]) to Keswick. It was used to transport soldiers returned from World War I to the military hospital there.[37]  Known as the West City Line, ran down West Terrace and Goodwood Road turned west into Park Terrace (now Greenhill Road) before turning in to Bay Road, and terminating at the entry to the Keswick Barracks. In 1925, a small loop branch line was added, to service the Wayville Showgrounds. After redevelopment of Anzac Highway in the 1930s, the tram line was eventually truncated at the new Keswick Road Bridge in March 1939, at a stop known as  Wayville West. This line was closed in December 1957.[38]"

        "header": "Mid-century decline and closure",
        "content": "From 1915 onwards the MTT had to compete against unregulated private buses, often preceding the trams on the same route to steal fares, which the MTT countered by opening their own motor bus routes from 1925.[48] The South Australian government began regulating buses within the state in 1927, although some private operators argued that Section 92 of the Constitution of Australia, which deals with interstate matters, exempted them from following the regulation. By notionally marking each ticket as a fare from the pickup point to Murrayville, Victoria (but allowing passengers to board or alight sooner) companies avoided having to abide by the regulation for some time.[49] The case was considered by the High Court, during the course of which Justice Isaac Isaacs offered a temporary compromise agreed to by both parties, but it appears that a final judgment was never delivered.[50] Eventually, most of the affected bus operators sold their buses to the MTT or other operators who followed the routes described.[49] Up until the end of World War I, most Adelaideans were dependent on public transport for daily journeys. The introduction of private automobiles decreased passenger numbers until petrol rationing during World War II led to a resurgence in patronage; patronage remained higher than before the war, until rationing was discontinued in 1951.[51] From the start of the Great Depression until the closure of the network only one lot of trams was purchased by the MTT. Due to shortages there was minimal maintenance of the network during World War II and post-war shortages prevented the purchase of new trams.[52] In 1951\u20131952 the MTT lost \u00a3313,320 and made the decision to convert the Erindale, Burnside and Linden Park lines to electric trolleybuses. The last trams on these lines ran on 24 May 1952 with the lines lifted from 18 April 1953. A 1953 royal commission was held to inquire into the financial affairs of the MTT resulting in a completely reconstituted board.[53] Late the same year, with driver safety concerns about the conflict with increasing traffic on the road, the Glen Osmond line was temporarily converted to motor buses. The line was never converted back to trams and much comment was made about the continuing maintenance of unused overhead lines.[54] Trolley buses gradually made way for motor buses until the last electric tram or bus service ran on 12 July 1963 leaving only the Glenelg line as a remnant of a once extensive light rail network.[55] Except for the Glenelg Type H, the trams were sold or scrapped. Some were used as shacks, playrooms or preserved by museums.[44]"

        "content": "A 1.2-kilometre (0.75\u00a0mi) extension of the line from the Victoria Square terminus was announced in April 2005, which would see trams continue along King William Street and west along North Terrace through Adelaide railway station and the western city campus of the University of South Australia. An additional two Flexity Classic trams were ordered to cater for the expanded services. Construction commenced in 2007 and a new Victoria Square stop, relocated from the centre of the square to the west, was opened in August 2007. Testing of the extension began in September 2007 before it was officially opened on 14 October 2007 with shuttle services along the new extension until the release of the new timetable on 15 October when normal through services commenced.[56] A free City Shuttle service between South Terrace and City West also began on 15 October to complement the main Glenelg to City West service.[57] Further extensions at that time were the subject of public debate; Tourism Minister Jane Lomax-Smith expressed support for the line to be extended to North Adelaide and Prospect although the Transport Minister stated that this was not a practical option,[58] with his preferred option the creation of a fare free city loop.[59] In the 2008 state budget, the government announced that it would extend the tram line further. The first extension, completed in early 2010, was from the existing North Terrace terminus to the Adelaide Entertainment Centre in the inner north-west suburb of Hindmarsh, with a park and ride service set up on Port Road.[60] Following the expected electrification of the Outer Harbour and Grange rail lines, new tram-trains were proposed to run to West Lakes, Port Adelaide and Semaphore by 2018.[61] However, these plans were later scrapped in the 2012 state budget.[62] In 2017, another stage of expansion was announced, adding a four-way tram junction at the intersection of North Terrace, King William Street and King William Road. One further stop would be provided north of that junction, adjacent to the Adelaide Festival Centre, and three to the east of it near the South Australian Museum, University of Adelaide and East End at the new eastern terminus in front of the old Royal Adelaide Hospital. The project was expected to cost $80 million with the contract awarded to a joint venture of Downer Rail and York Civil. Preliminary works began in July 2017 with major works commencing in October. York Civil went broke the next year.[63][64][65] The extensions opened on 13 October 2018, seven months behind schedule,[66] with the stop at the end of the eastward line known as Botanic Gardens owing to its proximity to Adelaide Botanic Garden.[67] In July 2019, the government announced the provision of tram services would be contracted out, along with other transport services in Adelaide.[68] In July 2020, Torrens Connect commenced operating Adelaide's trams under an eight-year contract.[69][70][71] A tram extension to North Adelaide was resurrected for 2036.

In 2016, the Weatherill Government released a report detailing a proposal under the name \"AdeLINK\" that listed five routes that would radiate from a new CityLINK city centre loop: an eastern EastLINK route to Magill; a collection of north western PortLINK routes; a northern ProspectLINK route to Kilburn; a southern UnleyLINK route to either Mitcham or Daw Park; and a western WestLINK route to Adelaide Airport.[73] The PortLINK proposal, that would replace the Outer Harbor railway line with light rail, is reminiscent of a previous extension proposal to West Lakes, Port Adelaide and Semaphore that was announced in the 2008 South Australian Budget but later abandoned in the 2012 budget.[74][62] Following the 2018 state election, the incoming Marshall Government abandoned the previous AdeLINK proposal, announcing that they would instead develop the network within the city centre only, announcing a vision of four routes: Glenelg to North Adelaide via the existing Glenelg line; Entertainment Centre to Central Market through the eastern half of the city; a loop service operating from Glenelg along the existing Glenelg line and through the eastern half of the city; and the existing South Terrace to Royal Adelaide Hospital \"City Shuttle\" service.[75][76] The proposed city loop service from Glenelg would require the King William Street-North Terrace intersection to be reconstructed with a right-hand turn from King William Street to the eastern side of North Terrace, which the Liberals had announced during its campaign. This would have required the junction relaid in December 2017 to be dug up and replaced.[77] The right-hand turn project was cancelled in November 2018 due to rising costs and engineering challenges.[78]"

Tram 361 was on display at Wigley Reserve, Glenelg, for many years, then moved to \"Mist on Bridgewater\", a business in the Adelaide Hills, in April 2023, joining Tram 376, which they acquired from Glossop High School in late 2022.[103]"

The route extensions that opened from 2007, although only 5.4\u00a0km (3.4\u00a0mi) long, mainly served parts of Adelaide city with high vehicular and pedestrian traffic, and thus reduced inner-city traffic congestion. Free tram travel introduced in this area and in the Glenelg shopping precinct during financial year 2014\u201315 almost quadrupled patronage, from 2.29\u00a0million to 8.88\u00a0million.[104][105] (Increased reliability of the new trams, with more than 96\u00a0per cent on-time running, was also cited in 2017 as a factor in increased patronage.)[106] Increases during the next four years totalled 570,000 until the COVID-19 pandemic severely affected patronage from mid-March 2020.[107]"

        "content": " The 2018\u201319 North American winter was unusually cold within the Northern United States, with frigid temperatures being recorded within the middle of the season. Several notable events occurred, such as a rare snow in the Southeast in December, a strong cold wave and several major winter storms in the Midwest, and upper Northeast and much of Canada in late January and early February, record snowstorms in the Southwest in late February, deadly tornado outbreaks in the Southeast and a historic mid-April blizzard in the Midwest, but the most notable event of the winter was a record-breaking bomb cyclone that affected much of the Central United States and Canada in mid-March. Unlike previous winters, a developing weak El Ni\u00f1o was expected to influence weather patterns across North America. Overall, however, winter of 2018\u201319 had many La Ni\u00f1a like conditions, being mild along the mid- and lower parts of the East Coast, the West Coast, and most of the southern Plains. Overall, the meteorological winter of 2018-19 became the wettest on record for the United States.[1] While there is no well-agreed-upon date used to indicate the start of winter in the Northern Hemisphere, there are two definitions of winter which may be used. Based on the astronomical definition, winter begins at the winter solstice, which in 2018 occurred on December 21, and ends at the March equinox, which in 2019 occurred on March 20.[2] Based on the meteorological definition, the first day of winter is December 1 and the last day February 28.[3] Both definitions involve a period of approximately three months, with some variability. Winter is often defined by meteorologists to be the three calendar months with the lowest average temperatures. Since both definitions span the calendar year, it is possible to have a winter storm in two different years."

The outlook noted a 70 to 75% chance of El Ni\u00f1o developing. CPC Deputy Director Mike Halpert specified that development was expected to occur by late fall to early winter. He added that while the El Ni\u00f1o was expected to be weak, it still had the potential to bring drier conditions to the northern United States and wetter conditions to the southern U.S. The outlook also noted the potential for the Arctic oscillation to bring colder-than-average conditions to the eastern U.S. and the possibility of the Madden\u2013Julian oscillation contributing to heavy-precipitation events along the West Coast. The temperature outlook favored warmer-than-normal conditions across the northern and western U.S. with the highest probabilities from the Pacific Northwest to the northern Plains and in Alaska. Such conditions were also favored in Hawaii. The outlook also noted that the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys, the Mid-Atlantic region, and the U.S. Southeast had equal chances of either above-, below-, or near-average temperatures. The outlook did not delineate any areas likely to experience below-average conditions. The precipitation outlook noted an elevated probability of wetter-than-average conditions across the southern tier of the United States and along the eastern U.S. up to the Mid-Atlantic. Drier conditions were favored in parts of the northern Rockies and northern Plains, northern Ohio Valley, and Great Lakes regions. The drought outlook mentioned a high likelihood for drought conditions to persist across parts of the southwestern U.S., southern California, the central Great Basin, the central Rockies, the northern Plains, and parts of the interior Pacific Northwest. Drought conditions were favored to improve in the central Plains, the coastal Pacific Northwest, southern portions of Colorado and Utah, and in various areas in both Arizona and New Mexico.[4]"

In Monroe, Louisiana 0.4 inches (1.0\u00a0cm) of snow accumulated on the morning of November 14, breaking the record for the earliest snowfall by 10 days. In Mississippi light snow was reported in Greenville, sleet in Tupelo and Memphis, Tennessee picked up 0.6 inches (1.5\u00a0cm) of snow. Meanwhile, in Ohio, ice accumulations of one-quarter to one-third of an inch were reported in Cincinnati and Dayton metros as well as parts of Northern and Central Kentucky. A general 2 to 5 inches (5 to 13 centimetres) of snow fell in the St. Louis metro with isolated reports of 9 inches (23\u00a0cm).[5] On November 15, as the storm headed northeastward, an unexpected 6.4 inches (~16.2\u00a0cm) of snow fell in Central Park, which became their earliest six inch snowfall on record,[6] as well as their second largest November winter storm on record,[7] which caught many off guard and resulting in several hour-long commutes that night.[5] This was considered by some as one of New York City's worst commutes, as some were over ten hours, and New Jersey reported 555 car crashes.[8][9] Further north, the Toronto area received 10\u201315\u00a0cm (4\u20136\u00a0in) of snow, leading to significant delays. In New Jersey, a person died due to the storm in a traffic related incident.[10] Two others died, and 44 were injured, when a bus was overturned in Mississippi.[11] Eight others died, including three in Arkansas, two in Michigan, and one each in Maryland, Ohio and Indiana.[12] In addition, around 190,000 customers lost power as the storm moved through,[6] with 1,615 flights being cancelled as well.[13] The melted snow from this storm made 2018 the wettest year on record in Baltimore.[14] The colder air that helped make the snow more intense then originally forecasted also led to daily record lows in Massena, New York, Montpelier, Vermont, Caribou, Maine and Bangor, Maine.[15]"

A combination of severe weather and strong winds cut power to 140,000 in Texas, mostly near Dallas. The storms also produced baseball-sized hail in many parts of the Southwest.[52] As the storm tracked further north, in Ontario, because of the thick snowpack, forecasters were concerned about flooding.[53] Meanwhile, the storm brought extreme blizzard conditions to the plains, poor visibility closing many interstates from North Dakota to Colorado and just to the south, severe flooding caused billions of dollars in damage.

The years before the drought had generally had satisfactory rainfall with impressive crop yields throughout most of the continent with the exception of the Gippsland region, the coastal districts of New South Wales and southeastern Queensland. In these areas, the rainfall deficiencies of the Federation Drought had never disappeared at any point during the decade of the 1900s."

        "content": "At the beginning of the year, a strong La Ni\u00f1a event was producing heavy rain over eastern Australia. January was the wettest on record in Sydney, and February was a phenomenally wet month in Victoria and southwestern New South Wales, with places like Pooncarie on the lower Darling River recording 190 millimetres (7.5\u00a0in) for the month. Averaged over Victoria, February 1911 stands as the third-wettest month since 1885 after October 1975 and February 1973. Heavy monsoonal rain drenched Queensland throughout the summer. These months, however, were virtually rainless in the southwestern quarter of the continent and quite dry in the Kimberley and Top End. Early March saw exceptionally heavy rains in southern Victoria and eastern Tasmania: Melbourne's rainfall of 191 millimetres (7.5\u00a0in) remains a March record. However, in the Top End and Kimberley, drought was already established as Darwin had its driest March in 138 years of record with only 21 millimetres (0.83\u00a0in) as against an average of 290 millimetres (11\u00a0in). April saw some good late wet season rains in the north due to a severe tropical cyclone drenching Port Douglas with a daily fall of 801 millimetres (31.5\u00a0in) and promising rains in southwestern Australia.[1] However, despite the \"big wet\" continuing in southern Victoria through May and June, southwestern Australia and to lesser extent the settled parts of South Australia and southeast Queensland began to have major rainfall deficiencies in those months. By August dry conditions were, as is usual for El Ni\u00f1o years, general except in coastal districts of New South Wales and the southeast of Western Australia. Southwestern Australia was particularly hard-hit: wheat crops failed completely in many places and led to a revolution in water supply and farming techniques to cope with rainfalls lower than previously known.[2] In the humid forest belt, 1911 was the driest year of the twentieth century at Margaret River and Cape Leeuwin and even the Warren River, the most nearly perennial river in all of WA, ceased to flow during the ensuing summer. Apart from one big September fall in Victoria, dry and often hot conditions did not ease until one of the heaviest downpours ever known in Western Queensland fell in late November. This was followed by heavy general falls in December except in Queensland and northeastern New South Wales. November was the driest on record in many parts of western Victoria and eastern Queensland."

Major tropical cyclones provided respite to the Kimberley in February and the Eucla in March, whilst a small coastal belt of the Wet Tropics had exceptionally heavy rainfall in April and May, with Innisfail recording 2,600 millimetres (100\u00a0in) for those two months.[3] However, elsewhere exceptionally dry conditions continued until a series of low pressure systems in June and July provided record-breaking rainfalls for that time of year in inland Queensland and New South Wales. Indeed, the winter averaged over those two states was nearly as wet as those of 1950 and 1998.[4][5] The wheat areas of Western Australia, South Australia and Victoria missed the heavy June falls completely but were very wet in July and the Western District of Victoria was relieved of anxiety by exceptionally heavy rainfall in the first eighteen days of September. Despite a dry October outside of southeastern Queensland rainfall for the rest of the year was generally satisfactory throughout southern Australia, though the wet season did not start well in the north."

February was dry west of a line from Derby to Eucla and east from one between Melbourne and Bundaberg, but elsewhere some exceptionally heavy thunderstorm rains meant the month was a wet one. Adelaide received a particularly intense fall of 56.9 millimetres (2.24\u00a0in) on the 17th, with the worst flash flooding in the city's history. Apart from the North Coast of New South Wales, March was particularly wet, so much so that major flooding occurred in most rivers between Melbourne and Sydney. In Melbourne, the total of 23 rainy days is a record for any month between November and April[6] and the low sunshine hours of only four per day also unparalleled. The period around 12 April saw an extremely heavy if localised rainfall in the Albany district with totals of up to 175 millimetres (6.9\u00a0in) in a day near the Stirling Range and 114 millimetres (4.5\u00a0in) near Katanning. April was also very wet in the southern coastal districts of New South Wales, but May and June saw an unseasonal continuation of easterly winds. Thus, Tasmania, southwestern WA and the settled areas of South Australia were very dry, whilst most of New South Wales, Queensland and East Gippsland were wet. Apart from scattered coastal areas and the extreme southwest, July was exceptionally dry: Ouyen did not receive any rain in June or July[7] and Adelaide's rainfall for the period of only 32 millimetres (1.3\u00a0in) was less than in the disastrous year of 1982. Frosts were exceptionally severe and led to fears of crop losses. The following three months saw an abrupt reversal, with dry conditions in Queensland and most of New South Wales contrasting with good rains in the Mallee, South Australia and southwestern WA. August was particularly noteworthy as the most completely rainless month known in Queensland and New South Wales. The rain turned an unpromising wheat season into one of the best on record despite a violent cold outbreak in the east early in November when Melbourne recorded its lowest-ever maximum for that month on Melbourne Cup Day of just 11.4\u00a0\u00b0C (52.5\u00a0\u00b0F). December saw very wet conditions in Queensland, with record flows in some Cape York Peninsula streams; but, apart from one rain event mid-month with another record daily total in Adelaide, dry weather prevailed elsewhere."

Torrential rains around Eden and Bega in March and wet conditions in southeastern Australia (especially Tasmania) in April were followed by a second heavy fall in a belt from Broome to the Darling Downs in May. The area around Uluru saw some of the heaviest rainfalls known until the 1970s that month. However, in the southern wheat belt May 1914 began a trend of powerful anticyclones and dry, easterly winds that was at the time quite unprecedented and not rivalled until 1982. In southwestern Australia the rainy season was extraordinarily poor from beginning to end, with only one significant fall all through from May to October and severe frosts prevalent throughout. June, August, September and October were all record dry months in Victoria[8][9][10][11] and Tasmania, and even unusually heavy July rainfall in Gippsland could do nothing to alleviate the drought. The result was, that with the northerly areas around the Darling Downs not well developed yet, Australia's wheat crop was almost completely lost after an exceptionally hot October in which temperatures reached over 36\u00a0\u00b0C (97\u00a0\u00b0F) even in Hobart. Wheat yields in Victoria were only around 0.10 tonne per hectare and in WA even lower. In coastal districts of New South Wales, however, the extraordinarily powerful anticyclones that desiccated the interior produced powerful onshore winds and extremely heavy rain: in Port Macquarie, the spring was the wettest on record. November and December were notably hot and humid, with rainfall near or above normal except in Tasmania and coastal Queensland during November. The southeast of Western Australia was particularly wet during these months, but in the desiccated agricultural regions the rain was much too late to save crops or pastures."

        "content": "The heavy rainfall of November and December in Western Australia continued throughout the first two months of 1915, culminating in quite unseasonable downpours over the southwest at the end of February and beginning of March. During this period Perth had a spell of ten successive rainy days \u2013 more than it normally has in February and March combined. El Ni\u00f1o, however, remained powerful and eastern Australia was almost uniformly dry throughout the first three months of 1915 except for East Gippsland in January and Tasmania in March. Brisbane's March 1915 rainfall of 2.8 millimetres (0.11\u00a0in) is its lowest ever and only 2 percent of its long-term March mean, whilst even normally-soaked Cairns received only 120 millimetres (4.7\u00a0in). April was equally dry in Queensland and the Northern Territory and only Tasmania and an area near Onslow was even remotely above average across the whole continent. In May, however, a trend of wet weather established itself across western Victoria, South Australia and southern Western Australia and continued right through to September. This wetness was backed up by the mildest winter across the southeast until global warming began in 1980. Crops that barely grew in 1914 grew with extraordinary vigour, and flooding even occurred in the Wimmera,[12] around Adelaide and more severely in the Blackwood River of Western Australia. Although September saw unseasonable rain as far north as Mount Isa, the drought did not ease in Queensland, coastal New South Wales or Gippsland. Strong westerly winds and tinder-dry forests in August led to major bushfires breaking out in the North Coast of New South Wales and southeastern Queensland. Although occasional rain put many fires out in August and September, the dryness in these regions intensified greatly still in October and November due to extremely powerful westerly weather that saw New South Wales record its driest month of the twentieth century (statewide average rainfall 3.2 millimetres (0.13\u00a0in)). Despite patchy rain in December 1915 was still the driest calendar year on record in most of the North Coast of New South Wales and the Atherton Tableland of Queensland. Notable low falls include: The year was, however, very wet in almost all of Western Australia, and also in western Tasmania and an area around Darwin, where December saw an extremely active monsoon with flooding."

May, however was very dry except in a few coastal parts of New South Wales. This time, however, a powerful La Ni\u00f1a developed and produced starting in June exceptionally heavy rain across almost all inland areas of the continent. Adelaide set a record monthly rainfall of 218 millimetres (8.6\u00a0in) in June and there was major flooding of the whole city, whilst in July record rainfalls occurred throughout southwestern Queensland. Still, it was not until nearly continent-wide heavy rains and flooding from late September to mid-December that the drought disappeared fully from the eastern coastal areas, especially Gippsland."

On a few occasions the temperature has even nudged into the mid 40s. These high temperatures usually occur when hot northerly winds blow hot air down south from central Australia, causing the mercury to spike. However, the weather, like Melbourne, Victoria, can be rather changeable as it is not uncommon to have days where the temperature peaks in the low 20s when there is a cool southerly wind blowing cooler air from the Southern Ocean. Occasionally, the mercury may fail to get to 20 degrees, even in the peak of summer. Rainfall is unreliable, light and infrequent throughout summer.

        "content": " Queensland (locally /\u02c8kwi\u02d0nzl\u00e6nd/ KWEENZ-land, commonly abbreviated as Qld)[note 1] is a state in northeastern Australia, and is the second-largest and third-most populous of the Australian states. It is bordered by the Northern Territory, South Australia and New South Wales to the west, south-west and south, respectively. To the east, Queensland is bordered by the Coral Sea and the Pacific Ocean; to the state\u2019s north is the Torres Strait, separating the Australian mainland from Papua New Guinea, and the Gulf of Carpentaria to the north-west. With an area of 1,723,030 square kilometres (665,270\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), Queensland is the world's sixth-largest subnational entity; it is larger than all but 16 countries. Due to its size, Queensland's geographical features and climates are diverse, and include tropical rainforests, rivers, coral reefs, mountain ranges and white sandy beaches in its tropical and sub-tropical coastal regions, as well as deserts and savanna in the semi-arid and desert climatic regions of its interior. Queensland has a population of over 5.5 million,[6] concentrated along the east coast, particularly in South East Queensland. The capital and largest city in the state is Brisbane, Australia's third-largest city. Ten of Australia's thirty largest cities are located in Queensland, the largest outside Brisbane being the Gold Coast, the Sunshine Coast, Townsville, Cairns, Ipswich, and Toowoomba. 28.9% of the state's population are immigrants.[7][8] Queensland was first inhabited by Aboriginal Australians, with the Torres Strait Islands inhabited by Torres Strait Islanders.[9][10] Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon, the first European to land in Australia, explored the west coast of the Cape York Peninsula in 1606. In 1770, James Cook claimed the east coast of Australia for the Kingdom of Great Britain. In 1788, Arthur Phillip founded the colony of New South Wales, which included all of what is now Queensland. Queensland was explored in subsequent decades, and the Moreton Bay Penal Settlement was established at Brisbane in 1824 by John Oxley. During the Australian frontier wars of the 19th century, tens of thousands of Aboriginal people were killed in Queensland as colonists consolidated control over the territory. On 6 June 1859 (now commemorated as Queensland Day), Queen Victoria signed the letters patent to establish the colony of Queensland, separating it from New South Wales and thereby establishing Queensland as a self-governing Crown colony with responsible government. A large part of colonial Queensland's economy relied on blackbirded South Sea Islander slavery.[citation needed] Queensland was among the six colonies which became the founding states of Australia with Federation on 1 January 1901. Since the Bjelke-Petersen era of the late 20th century, Queensland has received a high level of internal migration from the other states and territories of Australia and remains a popular destination for interstate migration. Queensland has the third-largest economy among Australian states, with strengths in mining, agriculture, transportation, international education, insurance, and banking. Nicknamed the Sunshine State for its tropical and sub-tropical climates, Great Barrier Reef, and numerous beaches, tourism is also important to the state's economy."

During the last ice age, Queensland's landscape became more arid and largely desolate, making food and other supplies scarce, which led to the world's first seed-grinding technology.[12] The end of the glacial period brought about a warming climate, again making the land hospitable, as it brought high rainfall along the eastern coast, stimulating the growth of the state's tropical rainforests.[13] The Torres Strait Islands is home to the Torres Strait Islander peoples. Torres Strait Islanders are ethnically and culturally distinct from mainland Aboriginal peoples, and have a long history of interaction with both Aboriginal peoples and the peoples of New Guinea."

        "content": "In February 1606, Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon landed near the site of what is now Weipa, on the western shore of Cape York. This was the first recorded landing of a European in Australia, and it also marked the first reported contact between Europeans and the Aboriginal people of Australia.[13] The region was also explored by French and Spanish explorers (commanded by Louis Antoine de Bougainville and Lu\u00eds Vaez de Torres, respectively) before the arrival of Lieutenant James Cook in 1770. Cook claimed the east coast under instruction from King George III of the Kingdom of Great Britain on 22 August 1770 at Possession Island, naming eastern Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales.[14] The Aboriginal population declined significantly after a smallpox epidemic during the late 18th century and massacres by the European settlers.[15][page\u00a0needed] In 1823, John Oxley, a British explorer, sailed north from what is now Sydney to scout possible penal colony sites in Gladstone (then Port Curtis) and Moreton Bay. At Moreton Bay, he found the Brisbane River. He returned in 1824 and established a penal settlement at what is now Redcliffe. The settlement, initially known as Edenglassie, was then transferred to the current location of the Brisbane city centre. Edmund Lockyer discovered outcrops of coal along the banks of the upper Brisbane River in 1825.[16] In 1839 transportation of convicts was ceased, culminating in the closure of the Brisbane penal settlement. In 1842 free settlement, which had already commenced, was officially permitted. In 1847, the Port of Maryborough was opened as a wool port. While most early immigrants came from New South Wales, the first free immigrant ship to arrive in Moreton Bay from Europe was the Artemisia, in 1848. Earlier than this immigrant ship was the arrival of the Irish famine orphan girls to Queensland. Devised by the then British Secretary of State for the Colonies, The Earl Grey Scheme established a special emigration scheme which was designed to resettle destitute girls from the workhouses of Ireland during the Great Famine. The first ship, the \"Earl Grey\", departed Ireland for a 124-day sail to Sydney. After controversy developed upon their arrival in Australia, a small group of 37 young orphans, sometimes referred to as The Belfast Girls or the Feisty Colleens, never set foot on Sydney soil, and instead sailed up to Brisbane (then Moreton Bay) on 21 October 1848 on board the Ann Mary. This scheme continued until 1852.[17] In 1857, Queensland's first lighthouse was built at Cape Moreton.[18]"

        "content": "The frontier wars fought between European settlers and Aboriginal tribes in Queensland were the bloodiest and most brutal in colonial Australia.[19] Many of these conflicts are now seen as acts of genocide.[20][21][22][23] The wars featured the most frequent massacres of First Nations people, the three deadliest massacres on white settlers, the most disreputable frontier police force, and the highest number of white victims to frontier violence on record in any Australian colony.[24] Across at least 644 collisions at least 66,680 were killed \u2014 with Aboriginal fatalities alone comprising no less than 65,180.[25] Of these deaths, around 24,000 Aboriginal men, women and children were killed by the Native Police between 1859 and 1897.[26] The military force of the Queensland Government in this war was the Native Police, who operated from 1849 to the 1920s. The Native Police was a body of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander troopers that operated under the command of white officers. The Native Police were often recruited forcefully from far-away communities.[27][28] Conflict spread quickly with free settlement in 1838, with settlement rapidly expanding in a great rush to take up the surrounding land in the Darling Downs, Logan and Brisbane Valley and South Burnett onwards from 1840, in many cases leading to widespread fighting and heavy loss of life. The conflict later spread north to the Wide Bay and Burnett River and Hervey Bay region, and at one stage the settlement of Maryborough was virtually under siege.[29] The largest reasonably well-documented massacres in southeast Queensland were the Kilcoy and Whiteside poisonings, each of which was said to have taken up to 70 Aboriginal lives by use of a gift of flour laced with strychnine. At the Battle of One Tree Hill in September 1843, Multuggerah and his group of warriors ambushed one group of settlers, routing them and subsequently others in the skirmishes which followed, starting in retaliation for the Kilcoy poisoning.[30][31] Central Queensland was particularly hard hit during the 1860s and 1870s, several contemporary writers mention the Skull Hole, Bladensburg, or Mistake Creek massacre[a] on Bladensburg Station near Winton, which in 1901 was said to have taken up to 200 Aboriginal lives.[32] First Nations warriors killed 19 settlers during the Cullin-La-Ringo massacre on 17 October 1861.[33] In the weeks afterwards, police, native police and civilians killed up to 370 members of the Gayiri Aboriginal people in response.[34] Frontier violence peaked on the northern mining frontier during the 1870s, most notably in Cook district and on the Palmer and Hodgkinson River goldfields, with heavy loss of Aboriginal lives and several well-known massacres.[35] Raids conducted by the Kalkadoon held settlers out of Western Queensland for ten years until September 1884 when they attacked a force of settlers and native police at Battle Mountain near modern Cloncurry. The subsequent battle of Battle Mountain ended in disaster for the Kalkadoon, who suffered heavy losses.[36] Fighting continued in North Queensland, however, with First Nations raiders attacking sheep and cattle while Native Police mounted heavy retaliatory massacres.[37][38]"

        "content": "Tens of thousands of South Sea Islanders were kidnapped from islands nearby to Australia and sold as slaves to work on the colony's agricultural plantations through a process known as blackbirding. This trade in what were then known as Kanakas was in operation from 1863 to 1908, a period of 45 years. Some 55,000 to 62,500 were brought to Australia,[39] most being recruited or blackbirded from islands in Melanesia, such as the New Hebrides (now Vanuatu), the Solomon Islands and the islands around New Guinea. The majority of those taken were male and around one quarter were under the age of sixteen.[40] In total, approximately 15,000 South Sea Islander slaves died while working in Queensland, a figure which does not include those who died in transit or who were killed in the recruitment process. This represents a mortality rate of at least 30%, which is high considering most were only on three year contracts.[41] It is also similar to the estimated 33% death rate of enslaved Africans in the first three years of being taken to America.[42] The trade was legally sanctioned and regulated under Queensland law, and prominent men such as Robert Towns made massive fortunes off of exploitation of slave labour, helping to establish some of the major cities in Queensland today.[43] Towns' agent claimed that blackbirded labourers were \"savages who did not know the use of money\" and therefore did not deserve cash wages.[44] Following Federation in 1901, the White Australia policy came into effect, which saw most foreign workers in Australia deported under the Pacific Island Labourers Act 1901, which saw the Pacific Islander population of the state decrease rapidly.[45]"

        "content": "A public meeting was held in 1851 to consider the proposed separation of Queensland from New South Wales. On 6 June 1859, Queen Victoria signed letters patent[46] to form the separate colony of Queensland as a self-governing Crown colony with responsible government. Brisbane was selected as the capital city. On 10 December 1859, a proclamation was read by George Bowen, the first Governor of Queensland, formally establishing Queensland as a separate colony from New South Wales.[47] On 22 May 1860 the first Queensland election was held and Robert Herbert, Bowen's private secretary, was appointed as the first Premier of Queensland. In 1865, the first rail line in the state opened between Ipswich and Grandchester. Queensland's economy expanded rapidly in 1867 after James Nash discovered gold on the Mary River near the town of Gympie, sparking a gold rush and saving the State of Queensland from near economic collapse. While still significant, they were on a much smaller scale than the gold rushes of Victoria and New South Wales. Immigration to Australia and Queensland, in particular, began in the 1850s to support the state economy. During the period from the 1860s until the early 20th century, many labourers, known at the time as Kanakas, were brought to Queensland from neighbouring Pacific Island nations to work in the state's sugar cane fields. Some of these people had been kidnapped under a process known as blackbirding or press-ganging, and their employment conditions constituted an allegedly exploitative form of indentured labour. Italian immigrants entered the sugar cane industry from the 1890s.[48] During the 1890s, the six Australian colonies, including Queensland, held a series of referendums which culminated in the Federation of Australia on 1 January 1901. During this time, Queensland had a population of half a million people. Since then, Queensland has remained a federated state within Australia, and its population has significantly grown."

In 1911, the first alternative treatments for polio were pioneered in Queensland and remain in use across the world today.[49] World War I had a major impact on Queensland. Over 58,000 Queenslanders fought in World War I and over 10,000 of them died.[50] Australia's first major airline, Qantas (originally standing for \"Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services\"), was founded in Winton in 1920 to serve outback Queensland. In 1922 Queensland abolished the Queensland Legislative Council, becoming the only Australian state with a unicameral parliament. In 1935 cane toads were deliberately introduced to Queensland from Hawaii in an unsuccessful attempt to reduce the number of French's cane and greyback cane beetles that were destroying the roots of sugar cane plants, which are integral to Queensland's economy. The toads have remained an environmental pest since that time. In 1962, the first commercial production of oil in Queensland and Australia began at Moonie. During World War II Brisbane became central to the Allied campaign when the AMP Building (now called MacArthur Central) was used as the South West Pacific headquarters for General Douglas MacArthur, chief of the Allied Pacific forces, until his headquarters were moved to Hollandia in August 1944.[51] In 1942, during the war, Brisbane was the site of a violent clash between visiting US military personnel and Australian servicemen and civilians, which resulted in one death and hundreds of injuries. This incident became known colloquially as the Battle of Brisbane.[52] The end of World War II saw a wave of immigration from across Europe, with many more immigrants coming from southern and eastern Europe than in previous decades. In the later decades of the 20th century, the humid subtropical climate\u2014regulated by the availability of air conditioning\u2014saw Queensland become a popular destination for migrants from interstate.[53] Since that time, Queensland has continuously seen high levels of migration from the other states and territories of Australia. In 1966, Lyndon B. Johnson became the first U.S. president to visit Queensland. During his visit, he met with Australia prime minister Harold Holt.[citation needed] The end of the White Australia policy in 1973 saw the beginning of a wave of immigration from around the world, and most prominently from Asia, which continues to the present. In 1981 the Great Barrier Reef off Queensland's northeast coast, one of the world's largest coral reef systems, was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site."

If Queensland were an independent nation, it would be the world's 16th largest. Queensland's eastern coastline borders the Coral Sea, an arm of the Pacific Ocean. The state is bordered by the Torres Strait to the north, with Boigu Island off the coast of New Guinea representing the northern extreme of its territory. The triangular Cape York Peninsula, which points toward New Guinea, is the northernmost part of the state's mainland. West of the peninsula's tip, northern Queensland is bordered by the Gulf of Carpentaria. To the west, Queensland is bordered by the Northern Territory, at the 138th meridian east, and to the southwest by northeastern South Australia. The state's southern border with New South Wales is constituted in the east by the watershed from Point Danger to the Dumaresq River, and the Dumaresq, Macintyre and Barwon rivers. The west of the southern border is defined by the 29th parallel south (including some minor historical encroachments) until it reaches South Australia. Like much of eastern Australia, the Great Dividing Range runs roughly parallel with, and inland from, the coast, and areas west of the range are more arid than the humid coastal regions. The Great Barrier Reef, which is the world's largest coral reef system, runs parallel to the state's Coral Sea coast between the Torres Strait and K'gari (Fraser Island). Queensland's coastline includes the world's three largest sand islands: K'gari (Fraser Island), Moreton, and North Stradbroke. The state contains six World Heritage-listed preservation areas: the Great Barrier Reef along the Coral Sea coast, K'gari (Fraser Island) on the Wide Bay\u2013Burnett region's coastline, the wet tropics in Far North Queensland including the Daintree Rainforest, Lamington National Park in South East Queensland, the Riversleigh fossil sites in North West Queensland, and the Gondwana Rainforests in South East Queensland.

        "content": "Because of its size, there is significant variation in climate across the state. There is ample rainfall along the coastline, with a monsoonal wet season in the tropical north, and humid sub-tropical conditions along the southern coastline. Low rainfall and hot humid summers are typical for the inland and west. Elevated areas in the south-eastern inland can experience temperatures well below freezing in mid-winter providing frost and, rarely, snowfall. The climate of the coastal regions is influenced by warm ocean waters, keeping the region free from extremes of temperature and providing moisture for rainfall.[57] There are six predominant climatic zones in Queensland,[58] based on temperature and humidity: The annual average climatic statistics[59] for selected Queensland cities are shown below: The coastal far north of the state is the wettest region in Australia, with Mount Bellenden Ker, south of Cairns, holding many Australian rainfall records with its annual average rainfall of over 8 metres (26\u00a0ft).[64] Snow is rare in Queensland, although it does fall with some regularity along the far southern border with New South Wales, predominantly in the Stanthorpe district although on rare occasions further north and west. The most northerly snow ever recorded in Australia occurred near Mackay; however, this was exceptional.[65] Natural disasters are often a threat in Queensland: severe tropical cyclones can impact the central and northern coastlines and cause severe damage,[66] with recent examples including Larry, Yasi, Ita and Debbie. Flooding from rain-bearing systems can also be severe and can occur anywhere in Queensland. One of the deadliest and most damaging floods in the history of the state occurred in early 2011.[67] Severe springtime thunderstorms generally affect the south-east and inland of the state and can bring damaging winds, torrential rain, large hail and even tornadoes.[68] The strongest tornado ever recorded in Australia occurred in Queensland near Bundaberg in November 1992.[69] Droughts and bushfires can also occur; however, the latter are generally less severe than those that occur in southern states. The highest official maximum temperature recorded in the state was 49.5\u00a0\u00b0C (121.1\u00a0\u00b0F) at Birdsville Police Station on 24 December 1972.[70] The lowest recorded minimum temperature is \u221210.6\u00a0\u00b0C (12.9\u00a0\u00b0F) at Stanthorpe on 23 June 1961 and at The Hermitage (near Warwick) on 12 July 1965.[71]"

Since the 1980s, a sizeable influx of interstate and overseas migrants, large amounts of federal government investment, increased mining of vast mineral deposits and an expanding aerospace sector have contributed to the state's economic growth.[91] Primary industries include bananas, pineapples, peanuts, a wide variety of other tropical and temperate fruit and vegetables, grain crops, wineries, cattle raising, cotton, sugarcane, and wool. The mining industry includes bauxite, coal, silver, lead, zinc, gold and copper.[92][93] Secondary industries are mostly further processing of the above-mentioned primary produce. For example, bauxite is shipped by sea from Weipa and converted to alumina at Gladstone.[94] There is also copper refining and the refining of sugar cane to sugar at a number of mills along the eastern coastline. Major tertiary industries are retail, tourism, and international education. In 2018, there were 134,312 international students enrolled in the state, largely focused on Brisbane. Most of the state's international students are from Asia.[88] Brisbane is categorised as a global city, and is among Asia-Pacific cities with largest GDPs. It has strengths in mining, banking, insurance, transportation, information technology, real estate and food.[95] Some of the largest companies headquartered in Brisbane, all among Australia's largest, include Suncorp Group, Virgin Australia, Aurizon, Bank of Queensland, Flight Centre, CUA, Sunsuper, QSuper, Domino's Pizza Enterprises, Star Entertainment Group, ALS, TechnologyOne, NEXTDC, Super Retail Group, New Hope Coal, Jumbo Interactive, National Storage, Collins Foods and Boeing Australia.[96]"

        "header": "Politics and government",
        "content": "One of the six founding states of Australia, Queensland has been a federated state subject to the Australian Constitution since 1 January 1901. It may legislate on all matters not ceded in the Australian Constitution to the federal government. It is a parliamentary constitutional monarchy. The Constitution of Queensland sets out the operation of the state's government. The state's constitution contains several entrenched provisions which cannot be changed in the absence of a referendum. There is also a statutory bill of rights, the Queensland Human Rights Act 2019. Queensland's system of government is influenced by the Westminster system and Australia's federal system of government. The government is separated into three branches: Executive authority is nominally vested in the Governor of Queensland (currently Jeannette Young) who represents and is appointed by the Monarch (currently Charles III) on the advice of the Premier of Queensland. The Premier, who is the state's Head of government, along with the Cabinet of Queensland (whose decisions are formalised by the Executive Council), exercise executive authority in practice. The Premier is appointed by the Governor and must have support of the Legislative Assembly of Queensland. The Premier is in practice a leading member of the Legislative Assembly and parliamentary leader of his or her political party, or coalition of parties, and members of the Cabinet will be drawn from the same party or coalition. The current Premier and Deputy Premier are Steven Miles and Cameron Dick of the Labor Party respectively. Government House at Paddington in Brisbane is the seat of the Governor, having replaced Old Government House at Gardens Point in Brisbane's CBD in the early 20th century. The executive branch is simply referred to as the Queensland Government. Legislative authority is exercised by the Queensland Parliament which uniquely for Australian states is unicameral, containing only one house, the Legislative Assembly. The Parliament was bicameral until 1922 when the Legislative Council was abolished by the Labor \"suicide squad\", so called because they were appointed for the purpose of voting to abolish their own offices.[108] Bills receive royal assent from the Governor before being passed into law. The Parliament's seat is at Parliament House at Gardens Point in Brisbane's CBD. Members of the Legislative Assembly represent 93 electoral districts. Elections in Queensland are held at the end of each fixed four-year parliamentary term and are determined by instant-runoff voting. The state's judiciary consists of the Supreme Court of Queensland and the District Court of Queensland, established by the Queensland Constitution, as well as the Magistrates Court of Queensland and other courts and tribunals established by legislation. Cases may be appealed to the High Court of Australia. As with all Australian states and territories, Queensland has a common law legal system. The Supreme and District courts are headquartered at the Queen Elizabeth II Courts of Law in Brisbane's CBD. The state's politics are traditionally regarded as being conservative relative to other states.[109][110][111][112][113] Historically, the lack of an upper house, the \"Bjelkemander\" (a malapportion favouring rural electoral districts) as well as the former system of optional preferential voting has meant that Queensland had a long tradition of domination by strong-willed, populist premiers, often accused of authoritarian tendencies, holding office for long periods. This tendency was exemplified by the government of the state's longest-serving Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen."

Two stalks of sugar cane which surround the state badge at the top, and below is Queensland's state motto, Audax at Fidelis, which means \"Bold but Faithful\". In 1977, Queen Elizabeth II granted the supporting animals, the brolga and the red deer.[118][119] In November 2003 maroon was officially named Queensland's state colour, after many years of association with Queensland sporting teams. The koala was officially named the animal or faunal, emblem of Queensland in 1971 after a newspaper poll showed strong public support. The Queensland Government introduced the poll due to a proposal by state tourism ministers for all states to adopt a faunal emblem.[118] In January 1986, the brolga was announced as the official bird emblem of Queensland, after many years on the Coat of Arms.[119] The Cooktown orchid became known as Queensland's floral emblem in 1959, during celebrations to mark the state's centenary,[120][121] and the Barrier Reef Anemone Fish was officially named as Queensland's aquatic emblem in March 2005.[122] The sapphire was named the official state gem for Queensland in August 1985.[123][124]"

        "content": " Hurricane Carrie was the strongest tropical cyclone of the 1957 Atlantic hurricane season. The third named storm and second hurricane of the year, Carrie formed from an easterly tropical wave off the western coast of Africa on September\u00a02, a type of tropical cyclogenesis typical of Cape Verde-type hurricanes. Moving to the west, the storm gradually intensified, reaching hurricane strength on September\u00a05. Carrie intensified further, before reaching peak intensity on September\u00a08 as a Category 4\u00a0hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 140\u00a0mph (220\u00a0km/h) in the open Atlantic Ocean. The hurricane curved northwards and fluctuated in intensity as it neared Bermuda on September\u00a014. However, Carrie passed well north of the island and turned to the northeast towards Europe. Weakening as it reached higher latitudes, the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September\u00a023, prior to affecting areas of the British Isles, and subsequently dissipated on September\u00a028. Due to its distance away from any major land masses, Carrie caused minimal damage along its path. On September\u00a016, the hurricane passed well north of Bermuda, causing minimal damage despite its intensity at the time, though hurricane reconnaissance flights in the area were postponed due to damage sustained by one of the aircraft. As it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone southwest of the Azores, the German ship Pamir encountered the storm and capsized on September\u00a021, resulting in the deaths of 80\u00a0crew members on board. As an extratropical storm, Carrie brought strong storm surge and heavy rain to the British Isles, claiming three lives. The hurricane's long duration and path in open water helped it attain several Atlantic hurricane records."

        "header": "Meteorological history",
        "content": "In early September, a trough was identified along the western coast of Africa. Moving towards the west as a result of a strong Azores High, the disturbance passed over Cape Verde on September\u00a02. Observations from weather stations evidenced cyclonic rotation in the region. An airplane belonging to Panair do Brasil passed within the vicinity of the vorticity and as a result reported the formation of a tropical storm.[1] In HURDAT\u2014the official database listing all known Atlantic tropical cyclones since 1851\u2014the system was listed to have reached tropical depression intensity at 0600\u00a0UTC that day.[2] The depression continued to steadily intensify as it moved westwards, later reaching the equivalent of a modern-day Category\u00a01 hurricane by 0600\u00a0UTC on September\u00a05.[2] On September\u00a06, the ship African Star encountered the hurricane 700\u00a0mi (1,100\u00a0km) west of Cape Verde. Reported winds of 92\u00a0mph (148\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 1001\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.56\u00a0inHg) confirmed the existence of the tropical cyclone.[1] A Weather Bureau forecaster remarked that the hurricane was in a \"blind spot\" at the time due to its location outside of shipping lanes and Hurricane Hunter reconnaissance missions.[3] Throughout the day, the hurricane intensified, reaching major hurricane intensity by 0000\u00a0UTC on September\u00a07.[2] Shortly after, a United States Air Force reconnaissance flight headed for Bermuda was diverted to observe the hurricane. The flight reported a well-defined eye measuring 20\u00a0mi (32\u00a0km) across and a minimum pressure of 945\u00a0mbar (hPa; 27.91\u00a0inHg), the lowest measured in relation to the hurricane.[1] At the time, Carrie had maximum sustained winds of 135\u00a0mph (217\u00a0km/h), equivalent to a modern-day Category\u00a04 hurricane. Further strengthening ensued, and the hurricane peaked in intensity on September\u00a08 with winds of 140\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h).[2] After reaching peak intensity on September\u00a08, Carrie began to gradually weaken due to a decreasing pressure gradient caused by a trough that had cut through the Azores High.[1] By September\u00a011, the hurricane had degenerated into a Category\u00a01 hurricane.[2] A reconnaissance flight reported a minimum pressure of 984\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.06\u00a0inHg). At the same time, Carrie began to slowly curve towards the north in response to the trough.[1] The storm later began to slowly reintensify, reattaining major hurricane strength by 1200\u00a0UTC on September\u00a013. The restrengthening of the subtropical ridge on September\u00a014 caused the hurricane to quickly curve towards the northwest.[1] National Hurricane Research Project (NHRP) observers described the hurricane as \"one of the most perfectly formed hurricanes they had seen.\"[1] Carrie began to steadily weaken again beginning on September\u00a015.[2] As it passed north of Bermuda the following day, weather radar imagery from the island indicated that the hurricane had an ill-defined structure, with its eye having expanded to 40\u201370\u00a0mi (64\u2013113\u00a0km) in diameter.[1] However, as it curved and accelerated eastward in response to a second trough of low pressure,[1] Carrie maintained hurricane intensity up until September\u00a023, when it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. The remnant system continued eastwards until it dissipated over Ireland by 1800\u00a0UTC on September\u00a028.[2]"

Four other undamaged aircraft were called back to West Palm Beach, including a crippled ship, while two other B-50s were held at Bermuda.[11] Passing well north of the island on September\u00a016,[1] effects of Carrie on Bermuda were minimal, with peak gusts reaching only 35\u00a0mph (56\u00a0km/h).[12] The German barque Pamir, en route from Buenos Aires to Hamburg, Germany, encountered the hurricane southwest of the Azores on September\u00a021 while carrying barley cargo.[13] The ship sank due to the effects of Carrie, and 80\u00a0people out of the 86\u00a0crew members on board the ship perished.[1] The final message received from the Pamir was a distress call and indicated that the ship had lost all of its sails and had been listing at a 45\u00b0\u00a0angle.[14] A search and rescue operation ensued after the loss of the ship was reported, involving the U.S. Air Force and Navy, as well as the British Air Force and Navy. Other ships from Canada and Portugal were also involved in the search.[15] All associated groups were inconclusive in their findings, with no sign of debris left from the ship.[13] However, two lifeboats and a raft were found, but they were empty.[15] As an extratropical storm, Carrie impacted the Azores, though damages, if any, remain unknown. The extratropical remnants of Carrie later struck the British Isles on September\u00a024 and 25, causing strong winds, waves, and severe flooding.[1] Winds from the system were estimated at 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h). The strong waves caused extensive property damage and killed three.[16]"

        "content": "The development of aerial firefighting and forestry in southern Australia ran in parallel with the rapid improvements in aircraft technology over the last century. As more advanced and capable aircraft became available firefighters and foresters quickly sought opportunities to utilise and adapt them.[1] Aircraft have three main advantages over ground resources: speed, access, and observation. Aircraft have been used for a wide range of tasks including reconnaissance, firebombing, crew transport, aerial ignition, back burning, gathering infrared imagery as well as operational forestry tasks like aerial photography, surveys, spraying, fertilising and seeding.[1] Much of the early pioneering work in Australia was led by the Forests Commission Victoria in collaboration with other State forestry and fire authorities including the Western Australia Forests Department, Forestry Commission of NSW, Woods and Forest Department of South Australia and Forestry Tasmania. Federal agencies including the CSIRO also contributed significantly.[1] Overseas forest and fire agencies, particularly the US Forest Service, the US Bureau of Land Management and State agencies such as the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire) as well as the Canadian Forest Service faced similar challenges and proved strong and willing partners in sharing knowledge, equipment and expertise over many decades.[2]"

        "content": "Internationally, southern Australia and particularly the State of Victoria combined with the adjacent States of New South Wales (NSW), South Australia together with the island State of Tasmania, is commonly regarded one of the three landscapes on Earth most prone to damaging bushfires. The other two are southern California and the Mediterranean coast.[3] Moreover, much of eastern Victoria and alpine parts of NSW are remote, mountainous and inaccessible and bushfires are often caused by multiple lightning strikes which can grow quickly in size. Even with the aid of modern firebombing aircraft to slow the spread of a bushfire, the control of these fires usually remains reliant on ground crews getting to the fire edge to extinguish it completely.[4] Although, heavy rain is sometimes sufficient."

        "content": "Major Victorian bushfires occurred on Black Thursday in 1851, where an estimated 5 million hectares were burnt, followed by another blaze on Red Tuesday in February 1891 in South Gippsland when about 260,000 hectares were burnt, 12 people died, and more than 2,000 buildings were destroyed. This deadly pattern continued with more major fires on Black Sunday on 14 February 1926 which saw the tally rise to sixty lives being lost and widespread damage to farms, homes and forests. On 7 February 1967, the Black Tuesday bushfires in Tasmania were the worst the State had ever experienced, leaving 62 people dead, 900 injured and over seven thousand homeless. However, when considered in terms of both loss of property and loss of life, the Black Friday bushfires on 13 January 1939 were one of the worst natural disasters to have occurred in Australia and certainly the worst bushfire up to that time. The 1939 Black Friday fires in Victoria burnt 2 million hectares, 69 mills were destroyed, 71 people died, and several towns were entirely obliterated. Only the Ash Wednesday bushfires in Victoria and South Australia in the summer of 1983 and the Black Saturday bushfires in 2009 have resulted in more fatalities.[5] Bushfires have undoubtedly always been a feature of Australian summers.[5] In an average year, more than 600 bushfires occur in Victoria's National Parks and State Forests which burn about 110,000 hectares and retardant is used on about 10% of these.[6] However, the impacts of bushfires are expected to rise as a result of population pressures and housing growth along the interface between forests and rural communities.[7] Also, while the impacts of global warming are not fully known, Victoria is very likely to experience an increased number of days with extreme fire danger.[8]"

        "header": "Bushfire reconnaissance",
        "content": "Experience has consistently shown that early detection and aggressive first attack is the key to keeping bushfires small and gives the best chance for control.[9]  In the early part of last century, there was limited road access to the extensive mountain forests, particularly in the remote and uninhabited eastern ranges of Victoria so there was a strong level of enthusiasm for aerial bushfire reconnaissance.[10] While there are differing accounts, it's generally acknowledged that the world's first aerial forest patrol was flown as a demonstration for the US Forest Service on 29 June 1915 at Trout Lake, Wisconsin in a Curtiss Flying Boat by aviation pioneer and wealthy Chicago sportsman Logan \u201cJack\u201d Vilas.[11] The idea took hold and US Forest Service later joined with the Army Air Service in 1919 to operate regular aerial fire patrols over national forests. However, lack of wireless radios for communication between the pilot and the ground was a major problem and the program paused in 1925.[11] Discussion took place between the Forests Commission Victoria (FCV) and the Air Board as early as 1926, and then over a period of years prior to 1929-30, with the view to commencing regular fire patrols using RAAF aircraft but a lack of safe landing areas proved the main obstacle. Eventually, the first fire spotting aircraft in Victoria was deployed on 18 February 1930[12] when a RAAF Westland Wapiti from No.1 Squadron operating out of Point Cook near Melbourne flew over the nearby Dandenong Ranges. This is also believed to be an Australian first.[1] Communications from the aircraft radio were sent in Morse code to the Air Board at RAAF Laverton who then passed the information on to Forests Commission fire controllers. It was claimed that the delay was only a matter of minutes.[12] Over the years effort was focused on more accurately locating fire outbreaks but it was not until the summer of 1939-40 that an aircraft was able to directly communicate by radio with the FCV District Office at Powelltown.[1] The Royal Commission into the 1939 bushfires conducted by Judge Leonard Edward Bishop Stretton has been described as one of the most significant inquiries in the history of Victorian public administration. Its recommendations led to sweeping changes including stringent regulation of burning and fire safety measures for sawmills, grazing licensees and the general public, the compulsory construction of dugouts at forest sawmills, increasing the forest roads network and firebreaks, construction of forest dams, fire towers and supported further RAAF aerial patrols linked by the Commissions radio network VL3AA to ground observers.[13] The Forests Commission's communication systems were regarded at the time to be more technicality advanced than the police and the military.[10] These pioneering efforts were directed by Geoff Weste[10] and by 1943-44 direct communication was possible between firefighting crews on the ground using portable, but heavy, RC-16 Radiophones and RAAF aircraft.[1] Although the technology of the portable radios remained primitive and the reception poor unless the user was on a high point somewhere. The HF radio signal was \u201cline-of-sight\u201d and bounced between fire towers and relay transmitters across the mountains back to the district offices.[14] In flat mallee desert country of north western Victoria balloons were used in the 1970s to increase radio coverage. Later the introduction of VHF radios, aeronautical radios operating within the airband and then digital mobile phones revolutionised bushfire communications. By the summer of 1945-46, 114 flights were made with up to eight RAAF aircraft in the air on bad fire days. They operated from RAAF bases at Point Cook, Ballarat, East Sale and Bairnsdale and reported 438 outbreaks. The following year, RAAF Consolidated B-24 Liberators and Avro Lincoln Bombers were made available, supplemented by Avro Anson's and DC3 Dakotas.[1] However, by 1959-60 the use of chartered cheaper flights from private operators in light aircraft became more common and the last RAAF patrol took place in 1963-64. Aerial patrols became common throughout the summer by all forest and fire agencies to supplement the fixed fire tower network.[15] The Western Australian Forests Department went as far as purchasing four Piper PA18 light aircraft in 1978-79 and employed their own pilots to operate reconnaissance flights in conjunction with private planes.[1] A major risk to all air fire operations is reduced visibility due to dust, smoke, fog and even low cloud. It was reported as early as 22 March 1945 that visibility was reduced to zero and all RAAF reconnaissance aircraft were grounded with the result that a fire near Toolangi reached a considerable size before being detected.[1]"

        "header": "Aerial photography",
        "content": "Aerial photography can be traced back to 1858 but matured during WW1 with the discovery that vertical photos taken with 60% overlap could be used to create a three-dimensional effect when viewed in a stereoscope. Aerial photography was used extensively to map the trenches of the Western Front and in January 1918, General Allenby deployed five Australian pilots from No.1 Squadron AFC on a dangerous mission to photograph 624 square miles in Palestine to update maps of the Turkish positions after the success of the Australian Light Horse at Beersheba and the retaking of the city of Jerusalem. This pioneering use of aerial reconnaissance proved a major aid for the rapidly advancing science of cartography and photogrammetry. Owen Jones,[16] the young Welsh Chairman of the newly formed Forests Commission Victoria had enlisted as one of Britain's original \"Warbirds\" in the Royal Flying Corps during WW1 and had long championed the idea of forest surveying, mapping and assessment from aerial photographs so in 1928 the Commission undertook its first major aerial photography project over 15,000 acres of forest.[15] Later, the Tasmanian Forestry Commission undertook Australia's first large scale aerial forest survey in April 1930 when an area of nearly 900 square km (222,000 acres) was photographed in the north-western region by the Air Board.[17][18] As a result of this initial work, the Commonwealth Government offered in 1933 to conduct an aerial survey of forests in Tasmania at a rate of \u00a310 per square mile or 8 cents/ha including the production of topographic and forest maps. But it wasn't taken up. Needless to say the challenges were formidable for both fledgling forestry organisations including responsibility for vast areas of the rugged, remote country about which little was known.[15] The composite aerial photomosaics were used to produce topographic maps and forest stand mapping. During the war years, large areas of Victoria were photographed by RAAF aircrews and later used by various state government authorities to produce orthophoto maps. During the war there were a number of military aircraft crashes on State forests.[1]  By 1945 aerial photography of 13,000 square miles (3.4 M ha) of the forest was completed, including much of the inaccessible forest in the eastern ranges. The photographs proved invaluable for the design of new road alignments and to map new stands of timber.[15][19] Accordingly, aircraft were managed within the Forests Commission by the Chief Draftsman, Mervyn Bill.[10] An interactive map using the 1945 RAAF photography reveals the extent of Melbourne's suburban post-war growth. As aerial photographic cameras developed and got cheaper in the 1960s and \u201870s all forest services began purchasing their own 70\u00a0mm medium format camera equipment and modifying small civilian aircraft to undertake regular surveys collecting information on things like vegetation, logging areas, new road works and bushfire history.[10] Photos were interpreted using stereoplotting equipment such as a Zeiss Aero Sketchmaster.[20] Large sheets of A0 parchment, transparent overlay film, a light table, a set of Derwent coloured pencils, Rotering ink pens and a steady hand were needed for mapmaking."

        "content": "Monitoring fire activity through thick smoke has always been a problem for firefighters. Research over many years had been directed at Infra-Red imagery which can see through smoke (but not cloud or water vapour). Early IR Systems produced images on film in both the 3-5 micron band and 8-14 micron band.[1] Several approaches were developed in the 1960s by the CSIRO and the Weapons Research Laboratory in conjunction with notable bushfire researcher Alan McArthur[21] from the Commonwealth Forestry and Timber Bureau. In May 1971 the Forests Commission Victoria tested a Bendix mapper in Gippsland to delineate between burnt and unburnt forest after fuel reduction burning. The Mapper was suspended under a Cessna 182 with all the clumsy electronic equipment mounted in the back seat of the aircraft, but the results were disappointing because overnight rain had deadened the temperature difference.[1] The Forests Commission also trialled an infra-red Pyro-vidicon tube system in a Bell Jetranger and Piper Seneca in early 1981 and then borrowed an Inframetrics Forward Looking Infra-Red (FLIR) from the US Forest Service in late 1981 for operations from a light helicopter.[15] In 1982-83, there was an opportunity to test a FLIR unit owned by the National Safety Council of Australia (NSCA) during the Cann River fires. The unit was mounted on a Bell Longranger helicopter which proved very useful at identifying smouldering hot spots through thick smoke and to direct ground crews during the mop-up phase. The camera was mounted on a gimbal under the front of the helicopter flying at 6000\u20138000 feet (but as low as 300 feet) and operated from the front seat by a navigator. FLIR operates in the 8-14 micron band with a narrow field of view and these trials were a success which prompted the Forests Commission to purchase their own Inframetrics FLIR unit in 1983 which was first used during a bushfire near Lorne shortly after.[1] The use of infra-red linescan[22] technology was first trialled after the Ash Wednesday fires when the Forests Commission used the CSIRO F27 research aircraft to conduct an IR scan of the Warburton/Powelltown fire. The output was essentially IR photography and delays were experienced as the product output was developed.[15] Further use of IR linescan technology occurred during the Cann River fire in 1983 with the NSCA Queenair aircraft conducting IR linescan operations. However, the operational \u201ccoming of age\u201d of this technology occurred a year later during the 1984-85 bushfire season when an infrared linescanner was mounted in a NSCA Kingair 200C and a GAF Nomad aircraft were used to monitor the spread of major fires and the progress of back burning across North Eastern Victoria. Scanning was predominantly conducted during the night and the imagery made available to the fire controller by 5 am. This enabled firefighting tactics to be developed well before the day shift crews were due to leave base camps. Black and white photographs were produced of the line scan imagery by the local chemist in Bright and were provided to ground crews departing to the fireline. Victorian forest firefighters have rarely ever had such accurate and detailed information available to them at that time of the day.[2] A number of remotely controlled Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), also known as drones, were hired by Emergency Management Victoria and the Department of Environment Land, Water and Planning (DELWP) in 2016 to test their effectiveness as a low cost means to gather intelligence at bushfires, planned burns and floods.[23] Melbourne and Metropolitan Fire Brigade drones fitted with infrared cameras were used successfully at a burning peat fire at Cobden \u2013 Camperdown in April 2018 and again at a bushfire at Rosedale in January 2019 to detect hot spots during the mopping-up operation."

        "header": "Firebombing",
        "content": "Firebombing in a military sense was developed during WW2 and designed to damage a target using incendiary devices, rather than from the blast effect of large bombs. However, the term \u201cfirebombing\u201d, although commonly used, is not an accurate description when applied to aerial firefighting although some of the early experiments included dropping \u201cbomb like\u201d containers from military aircraft.[2] The effectiveness of aerial firebombing is complex and depends on many factors including: aircraft turn-around time, distance from fire, aircraft type (fixed wing vs rotary), aircraft performance, load size, terrain, drop characteristics, drop door system, ambient weather conditions, wind, availability of ground support, fire intensity, fire size, fuel type, pilot skill and suppressant used.[30] Firebombing improves the chances of a first attack on a bushfire being successful by up to 50 per cent when the Fire Danger FFDI ranges from moderate to high (<24).[31] However, the chances of success fall rapidly as the fire danger index rises, fuel loads increase and delays in reaching the fire extend. For example, the probability of success drops to less than 20% if the FFDI is severe (>50) and the delay is more 30 minutes.[31] These figures are significantly affected by the presence or absence of ground crews. Limitations of firebombing are often determined by:[2] Firebombing is not generally effective against high intensity, fast moving bushfires. The upper limit of fire intensity is estimated to be about 2,000\u00a0kW/m in eucalypt forest fuel which roughly equates to the limits which can be handled by either ground crews alone or ground crews supported by fire tankers, graders, bulldozers, etc.[2] Severe bushfires, such as on Black Saturday,  generated intensities in excess of 100,000\u00a0kW/m, whereas prescribed burns are usually less than 500\u00a0kW/m. For comparison, a large household radiator emits about 1\u00a0kW. Firebombing fails on its own as a containment strategy if the fire behaviour includes medium or long distant spotting.[4] Aircraft can be very effective at slowing a fires rate of spread burning in remote locations giving more time for the arrival of ground crews.[4] In a few cases firebombing has been sufficient to extinguish small fires such as a single trees or very small spots. Firebombing aircraft play an important role but there is no substitute for \"boots-on-the-ground\".[4] However, firebombing with foam can very effective at extinguishing grass fires in open farmland, protecting houses by knocking down flames or working in conjunction with ground crews. In March 2010, an evaluation trial for the operational use of Night Vision Goggle (NVG) for aerial incendiary operations was conducted in Victoria, the first known operation of this type in the world.[15] The use of NVGs was extended to night firebombing using a Sikorsky S-61 in 2018 and implemented operationally for the first time at a large uncontrolled bushfire near Rosedale on 5 January 2019.[32]  Fire bombing when weather conditions are milder has significant advantages.  One unique aspect of this operation was hover-filling helicopters at night rather landing them to refill which greatly reduced the turn-around times.[28]"

        "header": "Early trials",
        "content": "The first trials of using aircraft to attack fires in Australia were conducted in Victoria in 1937-38 when the Forests Commission carried out tests in conjunction with Australian Paper Manufactures (APM) dropping brine solution (bitterns) in cartons. The chemical which is a by-product of salt manufacture was found to have a greater deadening effect on fire than water alone but was difficult to use.[15] Further trials were conducted by the Forests Commission just after the end of WW2 at Anglesea in Victoria beginning in November 1946 to compare the performance of RAAF  P51 Mustangs, Consolidated B-24 Liberators and Avro Lincoln Bombers dropping ammonium sulphate compounds in 500\u00a0lb bombs from about 100 feet which were designed to burst on impact. Several containers were tested on small fires for their accuracy, falling and bursting characteristics. The results were encouraging but inconclusive.[2] Almost a year later in 1947 American firefighters also began experimenting with water-filled bombs dropped from B-29 Superfortess and P-47 Thunderbolts. The US Forest Service had experimented before the War by kicking 5-gallon cans of water out the doors of aircraft.[33] In 1958, NSW fire authorities trialled a Tiger Moth crop duster to drop water on grass fires as well as sodium calcium borate on grass fires burning beneath low open scrub. The aircraft was fitted with a fiberglass hopper with a 255-litre capacity. The results were not encouraging although the NSW Fire Control Officer at the time, Harry R. Luke, commented that the technique could not be completely discounted.[1] After a lull, the Forests Commission Victoria resumed testing of retardants in 1963 and experimented with dropping water thickened with bentonite clay from a  Ceres CA-28 aircraft. Also, on 6 April 1962 the Country Fire Authority (CFA) conducted an exercise at Wonga Park near Melbourne to test the efficiency of fire retardants from the air compared to application from a ground fire tanker. The bentonite clay was shown to hold water together into larger droplets and reduce drift improving fire retardant effects compared to water.[1] This trial was followed in 1965 using a Piper Pawnee to drop the new chemical retardant Phoschek provided by Monsanto. The work included lighting experimental fires and established that chemical retardant concentrations of 0.25 to 1.5 litres per square metre could be applied to ground fuel through a forest canopy and that it stopped a fire burning with an intensity of approximately 600 KW/m. Concurrent testing of Phoschek continued over the next few years using a Snow Commander, Cessna Ag Wagon and de Havilland Beaver at Keotong in north east Victoria.[2] The results were encouraging enough for the FCV to report in 1965-66 that \u201con the basis of the trials held over the last three years, a technique has been developed for firebombing with chemicals.\u201d[34]"

An earlier attempt had been made in March 1962 to build a 4000 foot long airstrip at Howitt Plains, which is a further 12 miles by road north of Snowy Plains. After some initial clearing works this site was abandoned because not only it was also above the snowline, but mainly because of the additional travel distance from the main FCV base at Heyfield. The completed Snowy Plains strip at 5300 feet is the highest airfield in Australia and provided unique access to the eastern ranges as a firebombing base.  Later, in 1967-68, the Victoria Valley airstrip in the centre of Grampians was also established.[15]"

        "content": "On 6 February 1967 two Piper Pawnees from Benambra near Omeo, flown by Ben Buckley and Bob Lansbury, made Australia's first operational drop of fire retardant slurry on a small lightning-strike. The 15 drops were able to contain the remote fire to less than one hectare long enough to enable ground crews to walk many hours across rugged terrain to reach it and make it safe.[35] Up to that time, there had been a remarkable range of experiments with different aircraft such as heavy military four engine bombers, single seat fighters and small agricultural aircraft with differing drop materials, techniques and equipment. But this was the first real firebombing job, and the beginning of modern aerial firefighting operations in Australia.[35] The \"proof of concept\"  that resulted from the firebombing at Benambra combined with new and more powerful aircraft into the late 1960s led to improved techniques for handling, mixing, storing and loading equipment for Phoschek. By the early 1970s, the NSW Forestry Commission experimented with a new product Firetrol 931 dropped from Beaver aircraft with the principal advantage that it could be mixed virtually \"in situ\" inside the aircraft. The Forest Department in WA undertook trails in 1976 which among other things compared the canopy penetration and coverage of both Phoschek and Firetrol 931.[1] Innovations continued and on 3 March 1970, a Canadian de Havilland Twin Otter was trialled at Snowy Plains fitted with two 1100 litre membrane tanks which were slashed by a guillotine to discharged the load and control the drop pattern. Later more efficient and reliable mechanical \u201cdump doors\u201d were developed.[1]"

        "header": "Fixed wing / Helicopters",
        "content": "Modern firebombing operations generally conducted with a mixture of both fixed and rotary wing helicopters.[9] The tactics and systems evolved rapidly and largely ran in parallel with improvement in aircraft.[30] All forest and fire services were early adopters of new developments.[9] Fixed-wing aircraft must make a pass over the fire to make a drop of retardant like a bomber. Small agricultural aircraft like the Air Tractor has many advantages when the terrain and distances to the fire became critical. They can usually carry larger loads but are sometimes limited by landing grounds and mountainous terrain.[9] The advent of high performance turboprop engines over radial piston engines increased performance and load-carrying capacity particularly when operating in mountainous terrain in hot and high conditions when the air density begins to thin. Helicopters have a major advantage of being able to hover over the fire and accurately drop water, foam or retardant. They can also pick up water from shallow dams or rivers using snorkels to fill their belly tanks or dipping a collapsible bucket suspended on a line.[36] The first water bucket was probably developed in Nelson, British Columbia in the mid-1950s and became operational in about 1962. The bucket design was a converted 200 litre drum with a trap door in the bottom that was actuated by the pilot.[37] Helicopters have proved effective firebombers using water, foam, and retardants. The operating cost of medium helicopters proved higher than fixed-wing aircraft carrying similar loads but their accuracy and ability to pick up retardant close to the fire can make them more cost effective.[2] Medium helicopters such as the Bell 205 and Bell 212 were fitted with Canadian built belly tanks in about 1983-84 which, although had a limited water bombing capacity of about 1,400 litres, were still very effective in tight mountainous terrain providing close support for ground crews working near the fire edge. These NSCA machines were used extensively at the Mt Buffalo fires in January 1985 along with a smaller A\u00e9rospatiale SA 315B Lama with a bucket. The Helitack machines, as they were known, proved their ability to pick up from small dams, tanks or streams, and make accurate drops, particularly with short turn-around-times.[2]"

        "header": "Water/ Foam/ Retardant",
        "content": "Class A Foam and Retardant are some of the various chemicals mixed with water to improve their fire suppression efficacy.[1] Water is efficient at extinguishing fire, and usually has the advantage of being available at little cost, but when dropped from an aircraft has big disadvantages because it breaks up in the air-stream and a significant proportion erodes into mist and either evaporates before it hits the target or falls in concentrations too light to be effective against a fire, so its extinguishing properties do not last very long.[4] Water is only effective if dropped directly on flames. Trials showed that only about one-third of a 420-litre load of water dropped from a Piper Pawnee reached the target in concentrations high enough to be effective. The percentage lost from bigger loads appeared to be less, probably because erosion occurs at the surface of the load and the surface area/volume ratio of the mass dropped is less for bigger loads. Early trials also demonstrated that the poor drop characteristics of water could be improved significantly by additives which increase the viscosity and hold it together as it falls from the aircraft.[4] Most firefighting aircraft can drop either salt or fresh water. However, for helicopters equipped with bellytanks and use hover-fill pumps, or those with buckets on \u2018short\u2019 lines, pilots prefer to use fresh water to avoid ingesting salt into the turbine engines which are susceptible to corrosion.[35] Class A Foam is akin to detergent. It is added or injected into the load of water in a helicopter or fixed-wing aircraft and when its dropped the shearing action as it falls through the air causes bubbles to form which improves the smothering or \u201cknock down\u201d effect on the flames, allowing it to be more effective and to remain on the ground for a longer period. Class A Foam is often applied directly to the fire in close support of ground crews.[35] Retardants are generally a slurry that contains a mixture of water and ammonium phosphate or ammonium sulphate. Sodium calcium borate was one of the earlier chemicals used in North America and then trialled in Australia. Since the mid 1950s most of the chemical retardants used for firebombing throughout the world rely on either of these chemicals to provide the fire-retardant ingredient. They also contain a thickening agent to increase viscosity and other agents to inhibit corrosion and provide colour. Unlike foam or water, retardant is laid ahead of the fire and coats the fuel and as the fire burns into the line of retardant a chemical reaction occurs that effectively slows the fire. The main advantage of retardant is that it remains effective for some time after it has been dropped.[4] Firebreaks can be constructed using lines of retardant."

        "content": "By the early 1980s, a dedicated core of aviation staff had accumulated considerable expertise at using and managing Victoria's expanding fleet of firefighting aircraft and once again led the innovation of new aerial firefighting techniques in Australia.[4] During the summer of 1981-82 equipment was borrowed from the United States Forest Service for evaluation under operational conditions in Victoria. The equipment known as Modular Airborne Firefighting System (MAFFS) was trialled bombing bushfires with a slurry of an Australian made chemical fire retardant (Amgard-A11) in quantities up to 11,000 litres per drop.[38][39] A C-130 Hercules was obtained from the Royal Australian Air Force for the trials. The roll on/roll off system was installed and operated by 36 Squadron from RAAF Richmond in NSW but operated from Hamilton, Mangalore and RAAF East Sale for the trial.[38] MAFFS could deliver a much greater volume than was possible with the smaller agricultural aircraft contracted to the Forests Commission at the time and was used effectively in the suppression of bushfires at Broadford, Bright and Orbost.[38] Due to its low usage in 1981-82 MAFFS was again trialled in 1982-83 where it made 175 drops.[1] Some of the conclusion from the MAFFS trial was that while it was generally successful at integrating into FCV fire suppression organisation it did not significantly expand its aerial attack capability. Larger loads were offset by the lengthy turnaround times, canopy penetration and sometimes difficult terrain. The system was also judged expensive to operate.[38] For many years there had been both strong advocates and critics of using large firebombing aircraft in Australia so to settle the controversy the Prime Minister of Australia, Malcolm Fraser, in September 1980, offered to fund and sponsor further evaluation under controlled conditions in \u201cProject Aquarius\u201d under the direction of the CSIRO's Division of Forest Research. This time a DC6 hired from the Canadian company Conair, two medium helicopters (Bell 212, Bell 206B) and a small agricultural aircraft (Thrush Commander) were tested on deliberately lit experimental fires at Nowa Nowa in 1983-84.[1] Aircraft performance was pitted against ground crews.[40]"

Conair deployed a Fokker friendship F27 which could carry 6,000 litres of retardant and cruise at 230 knots. The drop pattern could be adjusted by controlling the dump doors and varied from 100 to 900 m in length.[1] However, it wasn't until 1996 that the Australasian Fire Authorities Council (AFAC) funded trials of the Bombardier CL-415 water scooping aircraft in Victorian Otway Ranges. Although effective, the limited number of suitable water bodies in Australia somewhat restricts their operational use.[15] But the technology of firebombing continued to improve and by 1997-98 Victoria contracted the largest contingent of aircraft for aerial firefighting to date in anticipation of a severe summer. It included 6 light helicopters, 4 medium helicopters, 10 fixed wing firebombers, 1 infra-red line scanning fixed wing aircraft and 1 light reconnaissance twin engine fixed wing aircraft.[15] The introduction of heavy firebombing helicopters like the Erickson S-64 Air Crane (Elvis) that could lift and carry 9500 litres of water and had a 45-second hover fill time didn't occur until 1997-98. And later in 2003-04, the National Aerial Firefighting Centre supported funding of two large firebombing helicopters, a Mil 8 and Bell 214B to support Victoria's firebombing operations.[15] By 2010-11, Victoria contracted two Convair 580 Multi Engine Air Tankers (MEATs) for operational trials in Victoria with each aircraft capable of carrying a load of 8,000 litres.[15] The greater use of Large Air Tankers and heavy-lift helicopters forced major changes to fuel and retardant handling logistics. Medium helicopters like the Bell 214 require about 600 litres of fuel per hour, or three standard 200 litre drums, whereas heavy-lift helicopters like the Erickson Air Crane were fitted with massive 4,900 litre fuel tanks and consumed about 2,000 litres per hour. This led to the development of purpose-built 30,000 litre pressurised refuelling tankers and mobile hot refueling crews rather than manually handling heavy 200 litre drums.[41] Similarly, Large Air Tankers such as the DC-10 required about 9,000 litres of fuel per hour but landed at commercial airfields with bulk refuelling facilities, but the DC-10 could carry up to 45,000 litres of retardant which led to changes in Phoschek transport, mixing, handling and storage.[15] Evaluations continue as the next generation of Very Large Air Tankers (VLATS) and heavy-lift helicopters become available. The largest is the 747 Supertanker with a carrying capacity of 74,000 litres."

        "header": "Aerial ignition",
        "content": "Experience and research have shown that reducing available fuel influences the rate of spread and intensity of bushfires. Other factors such as the weather, wind speed, relative humidity and temperature cannot be controlled.[9] From the early 1960s pioneering work by foresters in Western Australia in conjunction with Bob Vines and David Packham from the CSIRO Division of Physical Chemistry developed aerial ignition techniques to reduce fuels under mild conditions over vast areas of the relatively flat terrain of Western Australia's state forest.[1] A machine was designed to drop small plastic capsules of potassium permanganate crystals which were injected with ethylene glycol just before being ejected from the aircraft. A delayed chemical reaction resulting in a small fire on the ground lasted for some 30 seconds. The first trial was at Manjimup in December 1965 and later improvements followed. The spacing of the ignitions was about 200 m and could be controlled by the adjusting the speed of the aircraft to about 100 knots and adjusting the dwell between drops to one every four seconds. Great emphasis was placed on maintaining an even grid pattern but this proved a demanding task flying 400 feet above the ground and various techniques were tried.[1] While the development of an aerial incendiary machine by the CSIRO was progressing the Forests Commission Victoria was developing a system for use with helicopters.  The DIAD (Delayed Action Incendiary Devices) was a large double-ended match with a length of safety fuse between. Forestry Tasmania started using DIADs around the same time.[18] They were stored in a metal box outside the helicopter along with a disposable striker patch attached to a special half-door. A navigator sat in the middle beside the pilot and the bombardier's role was to strike and then drop the lighted DIADs. After about 17 seconds the large section of the DIAD would ignite and burn for a further 40 seconds, enough to start a small spot fire on the ground. The first test was with a Bell 47G on 4 October 1967. Helicopters gave several advantages over fixed wing aircraft including flexibility and greater accuracy of placing incendiaries from a slow-moving aircraft.[15]\nFor larger operations in the remote mountains or desert, a helicopter would fly along ridgetops and ignite hundreds of hectares by dropping DAIDs. The fire would be allowed to trickle slowly down the north facing slopes in the evening until it went out overnight with the dew the following morning or ran into a wet gully. But the 1970s were a relatively wet decade so the gullies were damp and full of soggy tree ferns which would stop most burns. Also, there weren't many people in the bush other than loggers and cattlemen, so it was possible to do this with minimal risk. The first use, anywhere in the world, of DAIDs to backburn a large 49 800 acre fire in north eastern Victoria was undertaken by the Commission in February 1968.[42] In April 1969 the Forests Commission used a CSIRO incendiary machine in a Cessna 337 to carry out fuel reduction burning at Orbost which prompted the purchase their own machine. Later in 1977, the Commission purchased a Canadian designed Premo aerial incendiary machine which dropped incendiaries in small polystyrene \u201cping pong\u201d balls. The machine was certified for use by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) in April 1978.[15] However, the crash of a helicopter conducting aerial ignition on 19 April 1978 with the death of two forest officers and the pilot[43]  profoundly shook the small \"Fraternity of Foresters\".  But it led to better accident insurance for staff involved in air operations, the end of DAIDs and the wider adoption of the safer ping-pong ball aerial incendiary machine.[44] High intensity slash burning is usually needed to achieve satisfactory regeneration after logging and the ping-pong ball machine was not suitable for aerial ignition because a large amount of fire needs to be introduced onto the logging coupe quickly. These areas are also often in steep terrain making ground ignition by crews difficult and dangerous. An idea was conceived in Canada in the 1970s by John Muraro[45] and the New Zealand Forest Service developed an Aerial Drip Torch (ADT) that could be slung under a helicopter in 1982. Forestry Tasmania acquired one of the machines and modified it in February 1987.[1] Also known as a helitorch or \u201cdragon\u201d it consisted of a large 135 litre tank containing jellied petrol, a displacement pump, ignition system of a propane torch and burner nozzle and a fire extinguisher system. It was trialled at Swifts Creek in 1991.[1] Earlier in 1975, Forestry Tasmania and the Physics Department at the University of Tasmania began experiments using a weapons grade laser mounted on a Royal Australian Navy Bofors gun to ignite logging slash but had varied success at igniting canvas targets at distances between 200 m and 500 m.[18]"

On many occasions Incident Management Teams (IMT) have been deployed to Australia from America, Canada and New Zealand.[15]"

There were obvious limitations on size, weight and \u201cbreakability\u201d of the items to be dropped. The packaging needed to be designed to sufficiently cushion the fall to minimise damage to its contents but not too bulky or awkward to handle inside the aircraft.[1] The first recorded aerial drops of food supplies to an isolated firefighting crew in Victoria were in 1949 from the RAAF Sikorsky S-51 Dragonfly helicopter. This technique was considerably improved by the development of specially designed free fall containers which provide aerodynamic drag to cushion impact with the ground.[15] Demonstrations by the Air Dispatch Wing of the Royal Australian Army Service Corps at Puckapunyal in 1960 using small parachutes was influential and Forests Commission trials later followed in August at Tallangatta dropping foodstuffs and stores to fire crews from the air.[1] Risks to crews on the ground was a paramount consideration and the tests were suspended but the idea was not altogether forgotten and trials resumed in 1961 and 1963.  The result was a large heavy-duty cardboard container being developed in 1964 which employed fold-out wings and was called the \u201chelibox\u201d. It was suitable for supplies weighing less than 9\u00a0kg and best dropped from about 300 feet and became a standard technique.[1]  The Search and Rescue Department of the Civil Aviation Authority sought the assistance of the Forests Commission in February 1972 to carry out tests at Managalore airport north of Melbourne with a Fokker Friendship F27 which led to NSW Emergency Services dropping over 3,000 heliboxes during the 1974 floods.  However, greater availability of powerful and manoeuvrable helicopters in the late 1970s to transport crews and equipment soon made the cardboard helibox redundant.[1] Special containers and weighted canvas envelopes were developed by the Forests Commission to drop maps and line scanning imagery from fixed wing aircraft before live streaming of data became available.[5] Sling loads lifting small bulldozers with an NSCA Bell 205 was also trialled in about 1982."

Rappelling or lowering of firefighters from a hovering helicopter was first trialled by the Forests Commission Victoria at Erica not long after WW2 in 1949 using a RAAF Sikorsky S-51 Dragonfly which was normally based at East Sale. The Sikorsky was later used to test reconnaissance and mapping techniques and deploying of men and equipment to remote locations.[1] The Forests Commission Victoria then contracted its own Bell 47G in 1964 and after some initial trials at Snowy Plains and Tallangatta established rappel operations based at Heyfield with a two-man crew.[46] This proved an Australian first and remained in place for the following two fire seasons but lapsed after safety concerns from the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) about the use of the small and under powered machine.[15] In 1982, after nearly 18 years absence, rappelling operations recommenced in Victoria using specially equipped and trained crews, usually in multiples of 4 or 6 rappelling lowered from larger and more powerful NSCA Bell 212 and Bell 412 helicopters to attack small fires in remote locations. Rappel crews were also used to construct helipads at larger fires where there were no vehicle tracks access so other additional fire crews and supplies could be ferried in and out by helicopter.[15] In 1985, the newly formed Department of Conservation Forests and Lands (a sequel to the Forests Commission Victoria) commenced its own autonomous rappel program which continues today. Since 1993 an exchange program of rappellers from British Columbia has been conducted and in 2007, nine rappellers from the BC \"Rapattack\" program came to Victoria on deployment to assist with the Great Divide fires.[15][46]"

In 1952, the Australian Army began training an airborne platoon of about 20 soldiers from the Royal Australian Regiment for deployment to bushfires and flood relief, but the idea never took hold like it did in overseas.[47] The main reason was because of the unique shape of eucalypt trees, with their predominantly upward-facing branches and dry spikes, which are very different to softer pines, made it too dangerous.[5] The technique was superseded by the use of helicopters."

It was revisited again in 1991 to enable specialist crews to deploy from a maximum height of 1.3 m and is ideally suited where vegetation or terrain prevented a helicopter from conducting a full skid landing such as rocky areas in the Grampians and the desert scrub country in Western Victoria.[15] Keeping the helicopter level with sudden changes in the centre of gravity was a major challenge for pilots and crews."

Seedbeds were prepared either by mechanical disturbance or a hot slash burn in autumn.[1] This method, although satisfactory, lacked reliability and an alternative was to collect and sow seeds by hand, but in steep mountain areas, this was often slow, difficult and expensive. In 1964 the first aerial seeding was carried out in logged areas of Alpine Ash using a small Cessna 180 fitted with two wing pods which each carried about 100\u00a0kg of seed. Because the seed was so fine it needed to be bulked up into a small seed ball about 2\u00a0mm across by coating with kaolin clay and using mucilage as adhesive.  Sometimes small amounts of insecticide and fungicide were added to improve seed survival. This larger size pellet aided the even spreading at a rate of about 1\u00a0kg of seed per hectare. The same aircraft was used a year later in 1965 to sow river redgum.[1] Also, in 1965 a larger Piper Pawnee with a larger capacity of 456\u00a0kg was used to sow logging coupes on mountainous areas.[1] Based on earlier success an area near Bruthen was sown with the contract Bell 47G helicopter in 1967. The helicopter was considered useful for small areas in awkward locations that the cheaper fixed-wing aircraft could not easily or safely access.[1] Experiments with different aircraft, seed bulking and spreading equipment continued over the next decade and aerial seeding of harvested eucalypts has now become the normal operational practice.[9]"

        "header": "Aerial application of fertiliser, herbicides, and insecticides",
        "content": "As with agricultural crops many forests respond to the application of fertiliser. Australian soils are noted for their lack of phosphorus although many trees also respond to the application of nitrogen and trace elements. Most research was focused on the establishment of exotic plantations forest rather than native forest.[47] As Victoria's Plantation Establishment program (PX) ramped up in the early 1960s it made sound economic sense to maximise productivity by the aerial application of fertiliser.[1] The techniques for the aerial application of fertilizer for other agricultural crops were well established so needed little modification for softwood plantations.[1] Most of the work was pioneered by South Australian Woods and Forest Department in the late 1950s using aircraft of the era such as tiger moths.[1] While in Victoria, following the spreading of superphosphate in forests near Mt Gambier in 1964 it was apparent that the distribution had been uneven.  The problem was taken up by the CSIRO and the Aeronautical Research Laboratories in Melbourne with a view to developing improved spreading equipment for agricultural aircraft. Trials began in 1965 at Moorabbin airport and the results were encouraging.[1] The Forests Commission remained concerned about the uneven spread of fertiliser and its research branch continued studies in 1970-71 to examine granulated superphosphate fertiliser. The first was at Melton and the second at the Scarsdale plantations near Ballarat using a Pawnee aircraft spreading at a rate of 627\u00a0kg/ha and a speed of 90 knots over young stands pinus radiata. Based on the success of this work, spreading of fertiliser in softwood across Victoria became routine.[9] Other States such as Queensland, New South Wales, Tasmania and Western Australia also experimented with aerial applications of fertiliser. The main use of aerial applied herbicides has been for removal of woody weeds such as eucalypts and wattles or grasses in newly established plantations or reforestation areas. The growth of seedlings can be severely restricted by competition from weeds for moisture and nutrients. Prior to the use of herbicides, weeds were controlled by hand and often required several costly repeat operations. Aerial spraying was used to control vegetation along new firebreaks in 1946.[1] Experiments with the use of the herbicide 2-4-5-T began in 1966 by the Forests Commission in Britannia range near Powelltown to control wattle in eucalypt reforestation areas. The Queensland Forest service had begun earlier trials in 1957 using a Tiger moth.[1] Trials of a spray boom were undertaken slung under a Hughes 500 helicopter in 1975 at Myrtleford in North East Victoria. However, because of growing fears about the use of 2,4,5-T herbicide all uses was suspended in June 1978 and alternatives chemicals were examined.[1] Many forests and plantations are subject to attack by insect pests which can sometimes reach plague proportions and may require control measures insecticide. In rough or mountainous areas aerial application was seen as the most effective technique. In August 1930 brown foliage began to appear in pinus radiata stands in the Yarrowee plantation south of Ballarat caused by leaf-eating case moth larvae. Calcium arsenate dust was applied using a RAAF Tiger Moth from No. 1 Squadron.[1] In 1962 aircraft dropped baits to control of vermin damage in pine plantations.[15] The phasmatid Didymuria violescens or stick insect is commonly found in the forests of south east Australia but when it reaches high numbers it can be very destructive of mountain ash and alpine ash. The insect reached plague proportions during 1952 in stands of alpine ash in the Bago State Forest in NSW and became a serious threat to valuable timber stands.[48] A Dakota DC3 aircraft was used to spray the insect pest but was found to be unsuitable because of the long runway required and difficulty flying cumbersome aircraft in mountainous terrain. The Forestry Commission of NSW undertook more research into insecticide applications and the de Havilland corporation provided a DHC2 Beaver aircraft for more trials in 1957. The CSIRO and the NSW Forestry Commission then evaluated the effectiveness of the application and later in 1960 began using a Bristol 171 Sycamore helicopter borrowed from Ansett-ANA.[1] In Victoria, the State Electricity Commission also became concerned in about 1960 about phasmatid populations in the Kiewa Hydro-electric catchments in north east Victoria and began a major spraying program of maldison insecticide mixed with diesel based on the experience gained in NSW, while the Forests Commission Victoria carried out fixed-wing applications in Pinnabar.  Major infestations of 1939 regrowth mountain ash were also observed in 1960 near Powelltown and an annual spraying program commenced that continued for more than a decade.[1]"

It rained for about 3 hours producing over 12\u00a0mm uniformly distributed over an area of about 80 square km while surrounding clouds produced no rain. This is believed to be the first documented case anywhere in the world of appreciable man-made rainfall reaching the ground and the first time that dynamic cloud growth had followed seeding.[49] Over the next 18 years, the RAAF and CSIRO Division of Cloud Physics collaborated with state forest, fire and agricultural agencies testing different aircraft, chemicals, techniques, and delivery systems. Overall the results were mixed and most cloud seeding programs were wound up by the late 1970s.

The summer of 1977-78 was characterised by a build-up of extreme fire danger in most areas of southern Australia. There were 606 outbreaks of fire in Victoria, of which 77 occurred over a period of three days from 15 to 17 January. Lightning caused most of these in the alpine areas of the State. Many were controlled quickly but eight developed into major fires and stage 2 of the State Disaster Plan was enacted. Then the Army and Airforce were called to assist 850 Forests Commission staff and employees. A notable feature was the very important part played by military helicopters such as the Bell 204 Huey in moving crews and supplies.[34] This was probably the first time large military helicopters had been used to support Australian firefighters on such a scale.[15] Five small firebombers also dropped over 100,000 litres of retardant, 8 smaller helicopters and a number of light fixed wing aircraft were deployed. The cost of fire suppression for the year 1977-78 was an unprecedented $3.3 million.[34] The Ash Wednesday bushfires occurred in south-eastern Australia on 16 February 1983. Over its twelve-hour rampage, more than 180 fires fanned by winds of up to 110\u00a0km/h caused widespread destruction across Victoria and South Australia. Years of severe drought and extreme weather combined to create one of Australia's worst fire days since Black Friday in 1939. In Victoria, 47 people died, while in South Australia there were a further 28 deaths. Over 16,000 firefighters combatted the blazes and a variety of equipment was used, including 400 vehicles (fire-trucks, water tankers and dozers) and 40 aircraft including 11 RAAF Iroquois and commercial helicopters.[15] The Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser then directed the RAAF to supply a CH47 Chinook to support remote firefighting operations on Mount Buffalo transporting large quantities of personnel and cargo onto the plateau.[34] Forests Commission annual expenditure on fire suppression for 1982-83 rose to $16.8 million. The pattern was repeated in the summer of 1984-85 with the largest single aerial firefighting operation in Australia up to that time. Lightning strikes started fires in north eastern Victoria which were in remote, inaccessible mountain country where firefighting was difficult, hazardous and slow. One hundred and eleven fires started on the afternoon on 14 January 1985 and burnt more than 150,000 ha with a perimeter in excess of 1,000\u00a0km before they were brought under control after about two weeks. About one-third of the perimeter had to be established and held in steep mountain country where there was no conventional vehicle access.[51] At the peak of the campaign more than 3,000 people were directly deployed on fire fronts or in close support, including 2,000 from the Department of Conservation Forests and Lands (CFL), 500 CFA volunteers, 449 Armed Services personnel, 120 sawmill employees and 50 State Electricity Commission employees. Major equipment used included 75 bulldozers, 400 tankers, 20 helicopters and 16 fixed-wing aircraft. Navy Wessex and Bell UH-1 Iroquois helicopters were used to lift crews and equipment while smaller Bell Kiowa reconnaissance helicopters were also effectively deployed.[51] NSCA helicopter bellytanks more than proved their worth. Expenditure for the year was $10.5 million.\nThe tempo, size and severity of bushfire incidents in southern Australia intensified throughout the 1990s and into 2002-03, 2006-07, Black Saturday in 2009 and 2013-14, each which involved ever-larger numbers of aircraft.  For example, the 2006-07 Great Divide Complex Fires in Victoria was referred to by some commentators as a \"mega fire\"[2] with the campaign lasting for nearly 3 months burning over one million hectares.[52] A total of 8200 hours were flown with between 55-65 aircraft engaged at any one time and an additional 200 were on call. The highest ever number of individual aircraft sorties were recorded.[15] All States of Australia now rely heavily on expensive firefighting aircraft.[35] After Black Saturday in 2009 it was reported to the Royal Commission that the Sikorsky S-64 (Elvis) air crane cost A$20,000 a day to keep on standby plus an additional $11,000 a day to operate. Fuel was a further significant cost with the aircraft consuming about 2,000 litres per hour. Whereas, smaller reconnaissance helicopters such as Eurocopter AS350 \u00c9cureuil proved cheaper, costing about $1,500 per day on standby and $1,000 more to operate. The overall cost of having a fleet on stand-by for the 2008-09 financial year in Victoria was $18 million, plus an additional $16 million in operating charges.[53]  In NSW, an additional A$38 million was set aside in 2017 by the Rural Fire Service for two new Large Air Tankers (LAT), DC-10 and Lockheed L100, to supplement their existing aircraft fleet including two ex-Army Blackhawks.[54] A similar situation existed in America in 2003 where the US Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management reported to a senate committee that together they own, lease, or contract over 1,000 aircraft each fire season and spend in excess of US$250 million.[55] This prompted the US Forest Service to review its aging large firebombing fleet.[56]  However, with increasing use of LATs and heavy-lift helicopters such as the Sikorsky Air Crane fire authorities expected to see these figures rise. For example, in 2012, the US Forest Service contracted a DC-10 with daily standing charge of about US$50,000 plus an hourly flight rate of about US$22,000.[57] Costs for retardant (about US$1/litre), fuel, ground support staff are generally additional. There is ample evidence and general consensus amongst firefighters about the effectiveness of deploying aircraft for aggressive initial attack to keep fires small or to provide tactical air support for fire crews on the ground.[2] In California, the US Forest Service has an annual expenditure of about US$200 million to suppress 98% of wildfires and up to US$1 billion to suppress the other 2% of fires where initial attack fails and they become large.[58] However, rising costs of large firebombing aircraft have led some critics to question the strategy of relying on them for prolonged attack operations on relatively stationary fire fronts or for building lengthy retardant control lines.[59] Whereas, in response to global warming and the threat of increased bushfires, the Australian Greens have outlined a policy for the Australian Defence Force to establish a \"wilderness firefighting unit\" by purchasing three Bombardier 415 water bombers for about A$150 million to be flown and serviced by Air Force and Army personnel.[61] Some are even calling for military aircraft to drop sonic bombs to \"snuff out\" bushfires in the way you blow out birthday candles.[62]"

Thankfully, serious accidents and incidents reported to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority have been few.[1] Valuable lessons about using aircraft, particularly after the 1985 alpine bushfires at Mt Buffalo, led to new training programs and safety manuals for air observers, incendiary operators, hot refueling crews, rappellers, retardant mixers as well as specialist Air Attack Supervisors (AAS) to more efficiently manage and utilise aircraft resources.[34] The AAS has responsibility for directing complex aerial firebombing, setting priorities and communicating with all aircraft and with fire crews on the ground. It requires judgement to ensure the firebombing remains safe and effective.[9] They operate in separate aircraft and orbit the fire at a higher altitude. High wing aircraft such as the Cessna 182 or light helicopters such as the Eurocopter AS350 \u00c9cureuil are common AAS platforms."

The national fleet comprises approximately 130 contracted fixed-wing, helicopters and Large Air Tankers (LAT) which supplements many state-owned, and state-contracted aircraft to meet peak demand across Australia making up more than 500 aircraft, provided by over 150 operators. In 2015-16, aircraft from the national fleet were activated 5,000 times and made nearly 30,000 firebombing drops.[35] Reciprocal arrangements are in place between all Australian States and many overseas countries to share aircraft and specialist expertise like Air Attack Supervisors so some common international aviation guidelines[63] with standard terminology are being developed to facilitate global deployments.[35] Many large aircraft and aircrews rotate between the northern and southern hemispheres."

Much of the south and east of England saw little rain; for instance, Bury St Edmunds saw no rain at all in the whole month. However, on 18 July, Martinstown, Dorset saw unusually heavy rain, with 11 inches (280\u00a0mm) recorded in the village over a nine-hour period.[3]"

        "content": " Tropical Storm Sanba, known in the Philippines as Tropical Storm Basyang, was a weak tropical cyclone that affected southern and central parts of the Philippines in mid-February 2018. Sanba developed as a tropical depression in the open Pacific Ocean on February\u00a08. The system moved generally westward while slowly developing, finally attaining tropical storm status on February\u00a011. Soon after, wind shear caused the system to lose organization and remain as a minimal tropical storm through February\u00a011 and 12. During this time, Sanba moved westwards then west-northwestwards, making landfall over northeastern Mindanao on February\u00a013. The system weakened into a tropical depression before making another landfall in southeastern Negros later that day. After traversing the Philippine Islands, Sanba failed to reorganize significantly in the Sulu Sea and dissipated two days later west of Palawan. As a developing system, Sanba brought minor flooding to Palau. From February\u00a012 to 16, Sanba caused heavy rains, floods, and landslides across the southern and central Philippines, affecting over 250,000 people. About 40,000 people sought shelter in evacuation centers. More than 1,600 houses were damaged or destroyed. Power outages occurred in five places. Ports were closed and flights cancelled because of adverse weather conditions, which also caused damage to roads and bridges. Schools and workplaces were shut as Sanba passed over the Philippines. A total of 15 people were killed, mostly by flooded rivers and landslides, and 16 others were injured. Crop damage reached \u20b1168\u00a0million (US$3.19\u00a0million).[nb 1]"

        "content": "Sanba originated from a tropical disturbance that developed about 1,050\u00a0mi (1,690\u00a0km) southeast of Guam on February\u00a06. The system was initially disorganized and broad, with little thunderstorm activity.[2] Amid generally favorable environmental conditions consisting of warm sea surface temperatures around 28\u201329\u00a0\u00b0C (82\u201384\u00a0\u00b0F) and moderate wind shear, the disturbance began to develop rainbands and a more well-defined circulation.[3] At 00:00\u00a0UTC on February\u00a08, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) deemed the system to have consolidated into a tropical depression.[4][nb 2] At this time, the system was tracking northwest around a subtropical ridge to the northeast,[6] but soon turned west then southwest as another subtropical ridge to the northwest of the depression strengthened.[7] Over the next day, moderate wind shear kept the depression relatively disorganized, with the circulation remaining elongated.[8] A burst of convection developed over the system on February\u00a010 as it turned to the west,[9] leading the United States-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to also declare that the system had become a tropical depression at 12:00\u00a0UTC.[10] The system quickly increased in organization over the next few hours, with extensive rainbands wrapping into the circulation from the north.[11] As a result, the JTWC and JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm on February\u00a011 at 00:00\u00a0UTC and 06:00\u00a0UTC respectively, with the latter naming the system Sanba. At 06:00\u00a0UTC, the JMA assessed Sanba to have winds of 40\u00a0mph (65\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 1000\u00a0hPa (mbar; 29.53\u00a0inHg), while the JTWC estimated winds of 45\u00a0mph (75\u00a0km/h).[4][10][nb 3] The convective organization of Sanba quickly unraveled over the remainder of February\u00a011, as wind shear caused the storm's low-level circulation center to become exposed.[13] The system entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility before 14:00\u00a0UTC, upon which the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) gave it the local name Basyang.[14] Despite the warm ocean waters of the Philippine Sea and strong outflow channels facilitating thunderstorm development, wind shear kept convection displaced to the northwest of Sanba's center.[15] This meant Sanba stayed as a minimal tropical storm as it headed west-northwest towards Mindanao.[4][10] On February\u00a013, at around 01:15\u00a0UTC, Sanba made landfall in Cortes, Surigao del Sur as a tropical storm.[16] The terrain of the Philippines weakened the system to a tropical depression shortly after.[17][4][10] Sanba made a second landfall in Dumaguete at 13:00\u00a0UTC,[18] before exiting into the Sulu Sea.[19] Despite conducive sea surface temperatures near 27\u00a0\u00b0C (81\u00a0\u00b0F), Sanba's circulation was significantly disrupted by the mountains of the Philippines;[20] the JTWC determined that the system's circulation was no longer closed by 18:00\u00a0UTC on February\u00a013.[10] A strong outflow channel briefly assisted convection to develop near Sanba's center on February\u00a014 as the low-level circulation reorganized,[21] and the JTWC assessed that Sanba briefly restrengthened into a tropical depression at around 15:00\u00a0UTC.[10] Soon after, strong southeasterly wind shear removed thunderstorm activity from the center once again,[22] leading the JTWC to declare Sanba to have degenerated into a tropical disturbance for the final time.[10] The JMA continued to track the system as a tropical depression until February\u00a016, when they declared that Sanba dissipated as a tropical cyclone at 12:00\u00a0UTC over the South China Sea.[4]"

Siargao Island, Silay City, Carmen municipality in Bohol, and the municipalities of Culaba and Kawayan in Biliran were affected by power outages from February\u00a012 to 13. Twenty-two roads and eight bridges were damaged by floods and landslides.[39] Five people were killed by landslides in Carrascal, Surigao del Sur. In Surigao del Norte, four people drowned in swollen rivers and one was killed by a landslide. A rockslide killed a toddler in Albuera, Leyte.[43] Three fishermen drowned in rough seas near Borongan in Eastern Samar.[40] In total, 15 fatalities resulted from Sanba's passage through the country, and 16 people were injured.[44] Two boats carrying people capsized: a fishing boat near Silago, Southern Leyte, and a passenger vessel en route to Homonhon. All four on board the two boats survived. Agricultural damage in the Eastern Visayas and Caraga totaled \u20b1168\u00a0million (US$3.19\u00a0million), mostly coming from flooded rice fields.[39] Following the storm, a state of calamity was declared in Carrascal and Lanuza municipalities in Surigao del Sur. The 402nd Infantry Brigade of the Philippine Army deployed four battalions in Caraga to conduct disaster response operations. The Department of Social Welfare and Development, in combination with local government units, provided \u20b111.6\u00a0million (US$220,000) worth of assistance to affected residents in Caraga, Mimaropa, and the Central and Eastern Visayas.[39]"

The JMA followed suit, assigning the name Merbok as it strengthened to a tropical storm; however, the PAGASA held the system as a tropical depression. The storm soon made landfall on the night of the same day, while gradually weakening over the high terrains of Luzon. The weakened system emerged off the northwest coast of the country before the last advisory was issued by the two agencies. The remnants moved to the northwest, before dissipating, southwest of Taiwan.

Nearly 90% of the state was classified as \"Abnormally Dry\" or \"Moderate Drought\". For reference, none of the state has ever been placed in D-4 (Exceptional Drought) since the year 2000.[2] Furthermore, The Buffalo News reported on July 22 that it had become the worst drought in the Buffalo area since their main weather station opened in 1943.[3] There was a longer term dry period through the 1960s in New York with greater duration but less intensity. By July the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) had placed the entire state in a \"drought watch\". While the drought is not nearly as severe as other droughts that take place in the west and midwestern United States in terms of duration and crop loss, droughts of this magnitude are rare in the humid temperate climate of Upstate New York.

Anecdotally, rainfall was less than a quarter of normal with the drought being the worst in at least a half century.[10] On August 3 the DEC, under direction of governor Andrew Cuomo, moved the entire Western portion of the state to drought warning, while the rest of the state remained under a drought watch.[17] Statistically, it was the fifth driest spring-summer (March\u2013July) period in Buffalo (9.07 inches (23.0\u00a0cm)) since record keeping began in 1871, with 1941 (9.00 inches (22.9\u00a0cm)), 1915 (8.92 inches (22.7\u00a0cm)), 1898 (8.34 inches (21.2\u00a0cm)), and 1934 (7.75 inches (19.7\u00a0cm)) eclipsing it.

The August 16 drought monitor report showed that while the severe drought area declined slightly, six percent of the state was upgraded to D3 (Extreme Drought), a first for the state during the summer[20] (about 3% of state around New York City saw D3 drought in spring 2002)[21] The area was a long narrow strip from Lake Erie to the northern half of Seneca County, roughly along the I-90 corridor, as well as a spot in the southern Finger Lakes.[20] The Extreme Drought area remained the same for the next two weeks, other than the removal of the western fringe in Erie County. Keuka Lake neared it record low summer level of 713.25 ft (217.4 meters).[22] The September 6 report saw the D3 Extreme Drought area double to nearly 10% of the state,[23] with the main area and spot to the southeast being connected. Also during this time (August 29),[24] the United States Department of Agriculture designated 15 New York counties as drought disaster areas, qualifying some local farmers for low interest loans. The counties are Cayuga, Chemung, Erie, Genesee, Livingston, Monroe, Niagara, Ontario, Schuyler, Seneca, Steuben, Tioga, Tompkins, Wyoming and Yates. Some surrounding counties were also eligible for the loans, available for eight months after August 29.[24] In all about 18,000 farms covering 3.7 million acres are eligible for the funding when four related drought counties in Pennsylvania are included.[25] New York State and agricultural representatives toured drought-stricken areas in early September. They included Senator Tom O'Mara, Senator Patty Ritchie New York State Department of Agriculture Commissioner Richard Ball.[8][26] In combination with also being one of the warmest summers in the area,[27] including a sunny June and July and the hottest August on record for Rochester, the drought was worse than rainfall data would suggest, making it possibly the worst drought on modern record when the two factors were considered together.[28]"

However, a several day pattern of rainy weather later that week dropped up to 6 inches (150\u00a0mm) of rain in some areas, and several inches over much of the affected central New York area.[29][30] The record rainfall effectively quelled the severe drought at least at surface level; however, the vast majority of the state remained \"abnormally dry\" or \"moderate drought\", with the Finger Lakes region and Western New York, as well as downstate, still in a substantial drought. The drought at this point was expected to last through January.[31][32] After the first week of November, about 80% of the state was considered to be in a moderate drought, and about 23% in a D-2 Severe Drought, mainly in the southeastern Finger Lakes and downstate and central Long Island areas. By the mid November report, parts of the Hudson Valley were back into D-3 Extreme Drought category, as part of an ongoing drought in the tri-state (New York-New Jersey-Connecticut) New York metropolitan area that was also expected to last through winter.[33]"

The Cheektowaga office of the National Weather Service reported an above average 6.17 inches of rain from December first to mid January, but snowfall was about ten inches short at 33 inches for the same period.[34] The winter went on to be one of the warmest on record, with below average snowfall, but plenty of rainfall, effectively ending the drought in western New York. The drought was officially announced to be over in March 2017.[35] The next spring went on to be one of the wettest on record in the northeast, causing Lake Ontario to hit record high levels.[citation needed] Buffalo, New York hit record high rainfall totals in April.[36]"

        "content": " The 1896 Atlantic hurricane season was fairly inactive but produced one of the costliest hurricanes ever to strike the United States until that point, along with several other destructive tropical cyclones. The season began in early July with a hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico and ended in late November with a slow-moving tropical storm over the Lesser Antilles. Of the season's seven documented systems, six are believed to have become hurricanes, and two intensified into major hurricanes\u2014the equivalence of Category 3 or greater on the modern-day Saffir\u2013Simpson scale. All but one of the systems directly affected land to some degree; Hurricane \"Six\" remained over open water and only posed a threat to shipping lanes. In addition, a possible storm was identified off the coast of North Carolina on August 28\u201329, but modern reanalysis efforts have found insufficient evidence to classify it as a tropical cyclone.[1] Tropical systems in the 1896 season killed at least 286 people and inflicted more than $10 million (1896 USD) in damage. The first hurricane made landfall in the Florida Panhandle on July 7, causing wind damage and coastal flooding in Pensacola, and destroying boats at port. No activity was observed until late August when a hurricane triggered widespread river flooding in Puerto Rico. After moving north, this storm struck eastern New England. Hurricane \"Three\" avoided land, but its outer periphery generated gusty winds in the Outer Banks of North Carolina. On September 29, fast-moving Hurricane \"Four\" became one of the costliest United States hurricanes on record at the time after swamping Florida's Cedar Keys with a large storm surge and subsequently causing extensive devastation in the eastern United States. The hurricane caused 202 deaths and more than $9 million in damage across eight states, plus Washington, D.C., and the Great Lakes. About two weeks later, Hurricane \"Five\" roughly paralleled the U.S. East Coast, causing substantial coastal flooding and destruction of beachfront property. Little is known about the season's sixth hurricane which never affected land. Torrential rainfall associated with the final tropical storm of the season triggered deadly flooding on Montserrat, where nearly 50 people drowned and many more lost their homes."

        "content": "The first documented tropical cyclone of the 1896 season has unclear origins. Although its official track in the National Hurricane Center's Atlantic hurricane database shows a northwestward path over Cuba,[2] contemporary United States Weather Bureau maps indicated formation in the western Gulf of Mexico,[3] and news reports discussed an eastward motion of the storm. Additionally, no severe weather was observed in Cuba during the month of July.[1] In any event, the storm likely intensified into a hurricane on July 5, and around midday on July 7, it made landfall on the Florida Panhandle east of Pensacola, at Category 2 intensity.[2] Upon moving ashore, the hurricane produced powerful winds as high as 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h).[1] The storm rapidly weakened as it moved inland, and after tracking north for five days, its remnants dissipated near Baffin Bay on July 12.[2] Widespread damage was reported in Pensacola and along the coast, with watercraft suffering the greatest losses. In the city's harbor, the storm sank nine fishing boats, damaged two barques and a brig, and wrecked numerous smaller vessels. The winds damaged chimneys, signs, awnings, overhead wires, and some buildings throughout the city. About 35 house were unroofed,[4] along with several stores, a hotel, and a church. Fallen trees rendered streets impassable,[5] and railroads near the shore were washed out.[6] Total damage in the city was estimated at $100,000.[4] As the storm moved inland, gusty winds and heavy rainfall extended into parts of Alabama, Georgia, the Carolinas, and southern Virginia.[1] Precipitation peaked at 12.0 inches (300\u00a0mm) in Greenwood, South Carolina.[7] On the morning of July 8, rainbands on the storm's eastern side spawned a tornado in Halifax County, North Carolina, that killed one person and destroyed several houses. Several more tornadoes developed in Virginia later in the day, causing five injuries and scattered damage.[4][8]"

        "content": "Hurricane San Ram\u00f3n of 1896 On August 30, a tropical storm materialized east of the Lesser Antilles, on a northwestward course.[9] The next night, it made landfall on the southern coast of Puerto Rico as a Category 2 hurricane, accompanied by severe rain and wind.[1][10] The storm passed just north of Hispaniola and Cuba over the next several days,[1] delivering tropical storm-force winds to the islands.[10] On the evening of September 6, while near the Bahamas, a steamship crossed the center of the hurricane and recorded a barometric pressure of 28.24\u00a0inHg (956\u00a0mbar).[11] This corresponds to maximum sustained winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h), or a Category 3 major hurricane, which represents storm's peak intensity.[10] The ship suffered extensive damage and lost one crew member when he fell overboard.[1] Tracking generally northward, the storm weakened to minimal hurricane intensity before making landfall over eastern Massachusetts on September 10, with 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) maximum sustained winds extending to a radius of 35\u00a0mi (55\u00a0km) from the center.[2][10] Sustained hurricane-force winds were observed in both Rhode Island and Massachusetts as the storm moved ashore.[12] The system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone shortly thereafter.[2] Several rivers in Puerto Rico overflowed, leading to extensive flooding. Five homes were destroyed along the coast of Juana D\u00edaz, and strong winds caused isolated Fujita-scale F1 damage.[1][10] Later, the storm generated damaging winds along the Northeastern United States coast from New Jersey to eastern New England, wreaking havoc on beachfront property and small craft.[13] High storm tides inundated streets, wharves, and cellars along the coast, while farther inland, high winds damaged crops and stripped orchards of their fruit.[14] Wind gusts reached 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) at Point Judith, Rhode Island, where five vessels were destroyed, and 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h) on Block Island.[1] In Providence, the storm brought down communications wires and lodged numerous yachts against the coast.[15] To the north, four sloops sank in Dorchester Bay.[1] In Boston, the storm caused minor wind damage, mostly limited to chimneys, fences, and signs.[16] On September 14, a stricken Italian barque called the Monte Tabor grounded out on a sandbar off Cape Cod after encountering the hurricane several days earlier. Seven of the ship's crew members made it safely to shore, but inexplicably, three others\u2014including the captain\u2014committed suicide upon running aground.[17]"

Several ships encountered the hurricane in the Gulf Stream on September 23, with one of them suffering damage to her sails. The hurricane recurved to the northeast far from the East Coast of the United States, but still produced northeasterly wind gusts as high as 58\u00a0mph (93\u00a0km/h) at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, and 51\u00a0mph (82\u00a0km/h) at Cape Hatteras, roughly 300\u00a0mi (480\u00a0km) northwest of the hurricane.

Intensifying into a Category 3 major hurricane, the storm moved through the Yucat\u00e1n Channel on September 28, then accelerated toward the north-northeast.[2] In the early morning on September 29,[8] the hurricane struck Florida's Cedar Keys and moved inland across Levy County. The small but intense hurricane sped northward through northern Florida and southern Georgia; its rapid movement allowed it to maintain much of its severity over land.[19] Extremely high winds accompanied the hurricane to the east of its track through the Mid-Atlantic states, and a band of heavy rain fell to its west from northern North Carolina to southern Pennsylvania.[13] While becoming extratropical, the storm struck Washington, D.C., late on September 29, and after crossing central Pennsylvania, it dissipated near the Southern Tier of New York.[2] Its remnants merged with another low pressure area over the Great Lakes.[20] The Cedar Keys were struck by a devastating 10.5\u00a0ft (3.2\u00a0m) storm surge that undermined buildings, washed out the connecting railroad to the mainland, and fully submerged the smaller, outlying islands where 31 people were killed.[21][22] Strong winds destroyed many of the red cedar trees that played an important role in the economy of the region,[23] and several cedar mills were severely damaged or destroyed.[24] In interior Florida, the hurricane devastated many communities, leaving thousands of people homeless.[25][26] Few homes or businesses were left standing in the hardest-hit areas.[27] In northern Florida and southern Georgia, the hurricane razed millions of acres of pine forests, which crippled the local turpentine industry.[28] In Savannah, Georgia, a 45-minute onslaught of fierce winds unroofed thousands of structures and left parks in a state of disarray.[29][30] Damage to shipping and shoreline settlements in the Sea Islands was extensive.[31] As the hurricane continued northward, cities and agricultural districts alike suffered extensive damage in Virginia.[32] Flash flooding in the Shenandoah Valley culminated in the failure of an earthen dam upstream from Staunton, unleashing a torrent of water that swept homes from their foundations and ravaged the town's business district.[33] In Washington, D.C., thousands of trees were uprooted or snapped, communications were severed, and localized streaks of violent gusts damaged many public and private buildings.[34] Many trees, some of historical significance, were blown down on the White House grounds.[31] In Pennsylvania, flooding rains and powerful wind gusts produced widespread destruction, washing out railroads in western areas while demolishing hundreds of barns in and around Lancaster County.[35][36] The storm demolished a 5,390\u00a0ft (1,640\u00a0m) bridge over the Susquehanna River,[36] while the Gettysburg Battlefield lost hundreds of trees, a few of which landed on historical monuments.[37] Damaging winds brought down trees and powerlines throughout the Northeastern United States, and the hurricane's extratropical remnants wrought havoc on shipping in the Great Lakes.[38] Along the storm's path, it caused at least 202 deaths,[39] and wrought more than $9.6 million in damage.[40]"

It tracked toward the east-northeast and made landfall in a sparsely populated region of Southwest Florida around 00:02 UTC on October 9. After crossing the Florida Peninsula, it turned more northeastward and gradually intensified.[2] The unusually slow-moving hurricane attained its peak intensity early on October 11, with estimated maximum sustained winds of 100\u00a0mph (155\u00a0km/h). Shortly thereafter, it made its closest approach to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, passing roughly 115\u00a0mi (185\u00a0km) to the southeast.[2] For several days, the hurricane brushed the coast from Virginia to southern New England with hurricane-force wind gusts.[1] The storm became extratropical by 00:00 UTC on October 14, and struck the coast of central Nova Scotia before dissipating on October 16.[2] The storm had generally minor effects in Florida, mostly limited to coastal flooding in northeastern portions of the state.[41] The Mid-Atlantic coastline experienced flooding storm tides that inundated and greatly eroded Cobb's Island, part of the Virginia Barrier Islands. Hotels and cottages there were extensively damaged.[32] The storm claimed about 50 acres (20\u00a0ha) of Cobb's Island, reducing its size by two-thirds; subsequently, the inhabitants abandoned the island and its use as a resort ended.[42] Along the Jersey Shore, low-lying railroads were flooded, boardwalks were destroyed, and many beach houses sustained damage.[41][43] The hurricane did $200,000 in damage to coastal installations on New York's Coney Island.[44] To the north, wind gusts as high as 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) affected eastern New England, where shipping interests were heavily impacted by the storm.[1] Three sailors died when a schooner went aground along the coast of Delaware,[45] and another was tossed overboard while battling rough seas offshore.[44] Overall damage amounted to $500,000.[43]"

Cotton, coffee, and sugar plantations sustained significant damage.[1] On Montserrat, one plantation recorded at least 21.15\u00a0in (537\u00a0mm) of rain in 21 hours, though the rain gauge overflowed between each of the three observations, preventing an accurate total from being obtained. It was speculated that several feet of rain may have locally fallen on certain hillsides, as evidenced by landslides that swept away trees, boulders, and large volumes of earth.[47] Thirty-one people drowned in Plymouth after their homes were swept into the sea.[46] Roadways were washed out in many places and the torrents reportedly washed out all but one bridge on the island.[1] In total, 46 people drowned in the floods, while many others were left homeless. Secretary of State for the Colonies Joseph Chamberlain estimated monetary damage at \u00a310,000 ($49,000).[46] The destruction was compounded by a series of earthquakes that began during the storm's passage.[1] A ship called the ship Grecian, bound from Trinidad to London, England, grounded out on a rocky section of Montserrat's coastline. Twenty-nine out of the 30 crew members died in the wreck; the sole survivor was the first mate, who reached solid ground by clutching to a piece of floating debris, and walking inland several miles.[47]"

The first of four consecutive tropical cyclones to strike the Philippines, a tropical disturbance became Tropical Depression 29W on November 14 and strengthened into Tropical Storm Muifa in the early of the 15th when centered east-southeast of Manila, the Philippines. Muifa turned back onto a west-northwest heading and intensified. It reached typhoon intensity on the 17th just prior to beginning a two-day clockwise loop. Late on the 18th, Muifa's intensity peaked at 130\u00a0mph (115\u00a0knots), still to the east of the Philippines. Unding, as PAGASA named it, made landfall very late on the 19th near Naga City with maximum winds of 80\u00a0mph (70\u00a0kn). The storm briefly lost typhoon strength for a day until it regained typhoon intensity in the South China Sea on the 21st. Muifa held onto typhoon status until late on the 23rd when its weakened to a tropical storm once more. By early on the 26th, a weakening Tropical Depression Muifa was located 250\u00a0nm south of Bangkok, Thailand. Later that day Muifa turned northward into an environment of increased wind shear and dissipated 120 nautical miles (220\u00a0km) south-southwest of Bangkok. The highest 24-hour rainfall amount from the Philippines was 246.4\u00a0mm at Catanduanes between midday the 15th and 16th. The death toll reported from the Philippines was 68 dead, 160 injured, and 69 unaccounted for. A total of 26,238 houses were destroyed and 76,062 damaged; total damage reached $1.01\u00a0billion pesos ($17.96\u00a0million 2004 USD).

PAGASA assigned the name Unding to the cyclone on the 14th as it passed the 135th meridian.[1] The storm's forward speed suddenly decreased from 28\u00a0km/h to 13\u00a0km/h when it entered an area of weak steering flow in between a high-pressure ridge in development centered over China and a high-pressure ridge weakening south of Japan.[2] On the 16th, the tropical cyclone started drifting north-northeast. Muifa turned back onto a west-northwest heading and intensified. It reached typhoon intensity on the 17th just prior to beginning a two-day clockwise loop. Late on the 18th, Muifa's intensity peaked at 130\u00a0mph (115\u00a0knots) with a minimum central pressure of 955\u00a0mbar (hPa), still to the east of the Philippines.[1] Muifa made landfall very late on the 19th near Naga City with maximum winds of 80\u00a0mph (70\u00a0kn). The system ambled across the Philippine Archipelago, dropping down to tropical storm intensity on the afternoon of the 20th.[1] Shortly after Unding left the country, on the 22nd,[3] Tropical Depression Merbok[4] (Violeta)[5] passed over Luzon. Only five days after that,[3] Tropical Depression[4] Winnie hit Luzon. Luzon was hit a third time by Typhoon Nanmadol on December 2. The Philippines being struck by four tropical systems so close together is a very rare event, and also very damaging.[3] On the 21st, Muifa regained typhoon intensity in the South China Sea. Now moving west-southwest, early on the 22nd Muifa re-strengthened into a 105\u00a0mph (91\u00a0kn) typhoon 440 miles (710\u00a0km) east of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Muifa held onto typhoon status until late on the 23rd when its weakened to a tropical storm once more.[1] At this point, it was forecast by the JTWC that Muifa would strike the southern tip of Vietnam with 65\u00a0mph (56\u00a0kn) sustained winds. From there, it would restrengthen to typhoon strength and pass over Thailand and enter the Indian Ocean, slowly weakening as it heads into the Bay of Bengal.[6] This did not happen, though. On the 25th, Tropical Storm Muifa accelerated westward at a 23\u00a0mph (20\u00a0kn) clip. By early on the 26th, a weakening Tropical Depression Muifa was located 250\u00a0nm south of Bangkok, Thailand.[1] It was still forecast by the JTWC that the depression would enter the Andaman Sea, though much weaker than it was previously forecast, and later strike India as a 40\u00a0mph (35\u00a0kn) tropical cyclone.[7] Once again, this did not occur. Later that day, Muifa turned northward instead and entered an environment of increased wind shear and dissipated 120\u00a0nm south-southwest of Bangkok. But according to the Thailand Meteorological Department (TMD) advisories, Tropical Depression Muifa made landfall near Amphoe Ko Pha Ngan, Surat Thani Province at around 1500 UTC on the 25th with winds of 35\u00a0mph (30\u00a0kn).[1]"

In the city, low-lying areas were inundated with water, causing in excess of $1\u00a0million in damage (1961 USD).[24] In nearby Tecpan de Galeana, the hurricane killed 116\u00a0people, and dozens more were killed in other close villages.[23] Elsewhere in Guerrero, the coastal highway between Acapulco and Zihuatanejo received heavy damage, which later hampered relief efforts;[24] the highway was a priority for storm repairs, with crews working continuously for several days to restore the vital link.[3] Many deaths were reported in coastal towns of Guerrero, although exact death tolls were initially unknown,[24] with many of the towns covered in mud.[23] People received little warning of the hurricane, and many people died while sleeping.[25] In addition, thousands were left homeless by the storm.[26] According to radio reports, a hurricane-related waterspout wrecked the city of Nuxco,[24] although the damage was later described as flooding from a lagoon;[27] 225\u00a0deaths were reported in Nuxco.[23] Food supplies were depleted in some coastal communities, forcing residents to rely on coconuts that were downed during the hurricane.[23] Overall crop damage in Mexico was unofficially estimated at $16\u00a0million (1961\u00a0USD, $115\u00a0million 2009\u00a0USD).[25] By two days after the storm, the government of Mexico sent two airplanes to Acapulco,[28] where the food, clothing, and medicine were distributed by truck or helicopter to the affected areas.[24] The Mexican government arranged plans to drop food and medical aid into isolated villages,[3] although food supplies were initially insufficient for the great number of people affected by the storm.[25] Five army units and three helicopters were sent to the region to assist in the aftermath,[27] although planes encountered difficulties in landing due to flooded runways.[24] Army soldiers were responsible for rescue operations, while paratroopers were sent to the most affected areas to distribute aid.[23] Despite fears of the spread of disease in the aftermath, prompt work by medical officials prevented any epidemics due to the storm.[29] The exact death toll was unknown, but believed to be several hundred. About two days after the storm, the official death toll was more than 80.[30] By three days after the storm, the toll rose to 190,[27] and by four days after it made landfall, the official total was 290\u00a0deaths; officials estimated the toll could have exceeded 500.[23] Due to downed communications, reports of storm fatalities were slow to spread, though news became more rapid as links were repaired. On November\u00a019, a week after the storm struck, the Mexican Army set the final death toll at 436\u00a0deaths, with 300\u00a0missing;[3] the death toll was later reported by the United States Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance in 1993.[31] Overall, Hurricane Tara was the deadliest disaster in 1961,[29] as well as the fourth deadliest Mexico Pacific hurricane on record, after a hurricane in 1959, Hurricane Liza in 1976 and Hurricane Paul in 1982.[32]"

The drought of 2002 had a negative impact in many states.[3][4] As usually happens during dry spells in the eastern United States, the 2002 drought was caused by a westward extension of the semi-permanent Bermuda High, which resulted in a continuous flow of hot south-southwesterly air north and caused the storm track to be pushed well off to the west. The density of the Bermuda High also kept hot air at ground level and prevented the formation of convective clouds. The Midwestern states and Mississippi Valley for contrast had a quite wet summer as most rainfall from frontal systems fell in that region. This was much the same weather pattern as the earlier 1999 North American drought, but in 2002 a secondary and unusual event happened when a high pressure system formed over the Gulf of Mexico, a rare occurrence during the summer months. This further blocked the flow of Gulf moisture northward. Precipitation deficits were greatest from New Jersey southward to Georgia and less so in New York and New England with the Great Lakes states and the Mississippi watershed being unusually wet. A shift to an El Nino pattern in fall 2002 brought about wetter, cooler conditions for much of 2003-04 which erased the precipitation deficits from the 1998-02 drought events.[5]"

This decreased production led to an increase in food prices across India and a decrease of India's GDP by 0.5% (US$9 billion) in 2012.[6] Of 223 farming households surveyed, over 60% reported crop losses and over 20% reported loss of livestock because of the drought.[7] Multiple farmers moved to urban areas in search in work.[4] Others effectively used reserves of food, water and money to survive.[8]"

        "content": "Hurricane Diana was a deadly tropical cyclone which made landfall in Mexico in August 1990. The fourth named storm and second hurricane of the season, Diana developed from a tropical wave in the southwestern Caribbean on August\u00a04. Forming as a tropical depression, the system brushed Honduras before intensifying into a tropical storm the following day. Continuing to gradually strengthen, Diana made its first landfall in Mexico's Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula as a strong tropical storm late on August\u00a05. The cyclone weakened slightly due to land interaction, before emerging into the Bay of Campeche on August\u00a06. Once over water, warm sea surface temperatures allowed Diana to quickly become a hurricane and later peak as a Category\u00a02 on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale on August\u00a07. Shortly thereafter, the storm made landfall near Tampico, Tamaulipas, with winds of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h). Rapid weakening ensued once the storm moved over the high terrain of Mexico, with Diana diminishing to a tropical depression roughly 24\u00a0hours after moving onshore. The cyclone later emerged into the Gulf of California on August\u00a09 shortly before dissipating. The remnant disturbance was monitored until losing its identity over Arizona on August\u00a014. Diana left relatively minor impacts in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. Some locations observed tropical storm-force sustained winds and gusts, while heavy rains left street flooding in the Chetumal area. Along the Gulf Coast of Mexico, the hurricane produced torrential rains exceeding 20\u00a0in (510\u00a0mm) in some places. The ensuing floods left about 3,500\u00a0people homeless and destroyed roughly 155\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (400\u00a0km2) of farmland. Numerous roads and railways were either washed out or blocked by debris, cutting communication with several communities. In all, Diana killed 139\u00a0people in Mexico and resulted in approximately $90.7\u00a0million (1990\u00a0USD) in damage. The remnant disturbance caused street flooding in Arizona."

        "content": "Hurricane Diana originated from a tropical wave which emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa on July\u00a027. Unfavorable conditions initially prohibited tropical cyclogenesis, with the wave remaining disorganized until reaching the eastern Caribbean Sea. The system entered the Caribbean Sea through the southern Windward Islands, where barometric pressures fell slightly, decreasing by 3.5\u00a0mbar (hPa; 0.1\u00a0inHg) in 24\u00a0hours. Upper-level air data from the Lesser Antilles indicated that the tropical wave was associated with an upper-level anticyclone. The first reconnaissance aircraft flight into the wave indicated no low-level circulation, but a relatively large and increasing amount of thunderstorm activity. The system continued to have a large amount of associated convection while passing over the Netherlands Antilles, as indicated by satellite images and surface observations. After satellite imagery observed a cyclonic rotation in the low-level convection, the fifth tropical depression of the season developed over the Caribbean around 00:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a04, while located about 125\u00a0mi (200\u00a0km) east of Isla de Providencia. However, this was based on surface observations, and the formation of a tropical cyclone operationally remained unconfirmed until another reconnaissance aircraft flight later that day.[1] The depression initially moved to the northwest under the influence of a mid-level trough. Around 00:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a05, about 24\u00a0hours after developing, the cyclone intensified into a tropical storm while offshore northeastern Honduras; the National Hurricane Center assigned the name Diana to the system. Diana would subsequently strengthen further, with winds reaching 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) before the storm made landfall near Felipe Carrillo Puerto, Quintana Roo, around 20:00\u00a0UTC later that day. The storm weakened while crossing the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, and emerged into the Bay of Campeche early on August\u00a06 with winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h). Upon entering the Bay of Campeche, Diana began moving nearly due west as a result of a weakening trough of low pressure. With conditions being more favorable in the Bay of Campeche, Diana quickly intensified, becoming a hurricane around 06:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a07. Twelve hours later, the cyclone intensified into a Category\u00a02 hurricane and attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 980 mbar (hPa; 28.94\u00a0inHg). At 19:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a07, just one hour after attaining peak intensity, Diana made landfall in Tamiahua, Tamaulipas, at the same intensity.[1] Moving inland, Diana rapidly weakened over the high terrain of Mexico, quickly deteriorating from a low-end Category\u00a02 hurricane to a strong tropical storm by 00:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a08. The system continued westward and weakened to a tropical depression roughly 12\u00a0hours later while centered near Mexico City. The weakening tropical depression turned west-northwestward over central Mexico and emerged into the Pacific Ocean on August\u00a09, before dissipating as a tropical cyclone over the Gulf of California.[1] The remnants of Diana curved northward around the eastern periphery of an upper-cyclone and tracked through the Gulf of California. Convection flared up before the remnant disturbance moved ashore in northwestern Sonora. The remnants of Diana entered Arizona and dissipated by early on August\u00a014.[2]"

Eleven hours later, the tropical storm warning was extended as far as Carmen, but was discontinued for the entire east coast of Belize.[3] Civil defense officials in Quintana Roo recommended that residents in coastal areas and in homes with weak construction to evacuate. The civil defense also set up emergency shelters in Punta Allen, Punta Herrero, and Xcalak. The Mexican Coast Guard was placed on alert and shipping activity around Quintana Roo ceased during the evening of August\u00a05,[4] as tides were expected to range from 3 to 5\u00a0ft (0.91 to 1.52\u00a0m) above normal.[5] Additionally, officials expressed concerns about flash flooding due to the possibility of 5 to 8\u00a0in (130 to 200\u00a0mm) of rainfall in areas near the storm's path.[5] After Diana made landfall on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula on August 6, all of the tropical storm warnings in place were discontinued.[3] Diana then threatened the mainland east coast of Mexico. A hurricane watch was issued for Tuxpan to Boca de Jesus Maria at 21:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a06; a hurricane watch notes the possibility of hurricane conditions within 48 hours, such as winds of at least 74\u00a0mph (119\u00a0km/h). Early on August 7, the National Hurricane Center anticipated hurricane conditions within 24 hours, and as a result, a hurricane warning was issued for Nautla to Le Pesca. Simultaneously, a tropical storm warning was issued for La Pesca to Boca de Jesus Maria. Later that day, a hurricane warning had been issued for a similar area, stretching from Nautla to Lerdo de Tejada.[3] The National Hurricane Center also predicted precipitation totals of 8\u00a0in (200\u00a0mm) and emphasized that flash floods and mudslides would likely occurred in the vicinity of where Diana was projected to make landfall.[6] According to Miguelangel Rebolledo, the captain of the port of Tuxpan, about 300\u00a0people fled low-lying areas.[7] State and federal officials prepared 10,000\u00a0packages of emergency supplies, food, and medicine and moved them to several locations along the coast. Police and Armed Forces were placed on alert.[8] By 00:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a08, all of the watches and warnings in place were officially discontinued.[3]"

In addition, wind gusts of 37 and 45\u00a0mph (60 and 72\u00a0km/h) were reported in the towns of Felipe Carrillo Puerto and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos, respectively.[10] Diana also caused heavy rain across the area, though damage is unknown.[11] Due to heavy rainfall, minor street flooding occurred in Chetumal, Quintana Roo.[12] Along the Gulf of Mexico, the storm produced storm surge and abnormally high tides, with waves up to 12\u00a0ft (3.7\u00a0m) in height.[13] Rough seas resulted in the closures of the ports at  Coatzacoalcos and Tampico.[14] Diana produced torrential rainfall while crossing the country, which peaked at 21.92\u00a0in (557\u00a0mm) in Aquism\u00f3n, San Luis Potos\u00ed.[2] Heavy rainfall triggered mudslides and flooding, mostly in the east-central portion of Mexico. The Comisi\u00f3n Nacional del Agua noted that at least seven rivers in the lower P\u00e1nuco River basin threatened to overflow their banks in the states of Guanajuato, Jalisco, San Luis Potos\u00ed, and Tamaulipas.[15] The rainfall caused extensive property damage, destroying numerous houses and leaving 3,500\u00a0homeless.[16] Flooding inundated highways and railways across six states and destroyed about 155\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (400\u00a0km2) of farmland.[14] The states of Veracruz, Hidalgo, and Puebla were hardest hit, with over 75,000\u00a0people affected by the hurricane.[14] In Poza Rica, high winds toppled trees and electricity poles, which cut off telephone services and electricity supply to the city. Fallen trees and telephone wires also blocked some streets in the area, but the major roads remained open.[7] Farther south, flooding left Federal Highway 185 impassable near Coatzacoalcos for a few days. Approximately 80% of apple, coffee, peach, and pear crops were lost in the municipality of Huayacocotla.[17] In P\u00e1nuco, flooding forced more than 2,000\u00a0families to flee their homes. Diana caused at least 20\u00a0deaths and left 18\u00a0people missing in the city. Local crops experienced significant damage, especially cotton, rice, and soybeans.[18] Throughout the state of Veracruz, the storm destroyed about 99,000 acres (40,000\u00a0ha) of banana, citrus, corn, and cotton crops.[17] In Hidalgo, several miners died after their truck plunged into a ravine.[19] The San Juan River overflowed in the town of Huejutla de Reyes, sweeping away hundreds of homes and some people in one neighborhood.[20] Diana also damaged at least 110\u00a0schools and 25\u00a0public buildings throughout in Hidalgo. Flooding washed out or damaged four federal highways and six state highways. The agricultural industry in Hidalgo, which had not fully recovered from a severe frost in December 1988, experienced significant effects. About 220,000 acres (90,000\u00a0ha) of croplands suffered damage, mainly impacting coffee, rice, and bean crops.[21] Excluding the 56\u00a0people still missing by the end of 1990, Diana caused at least 139\u00a0deaths and $90.7\u00a0million in damage.[14]  However, some sources claim that there were as much as 391\u00a0fatalities and losses incurred by the storm totaled to $94.5\u00a0million.[22] In addition, it is estimated that Diana injured 25,000\u00a0people.[14]"

A police dispatch of Imperial County also noted local flooding, which resulted in traffic disruptions.[24] The remnants of Diana also dropped light rainfall in San Diego County, California, with the city of San Diego receiving only a trace of rain, Vista reporting 0.09 inches (2.3\u00a0mm), Del Mar had 0.08 inches (2.0\u00a0mm), and Oceanside measuring 0.3 inches (7.6\u00a0mm).[25] In Arizona, the remnants of Diana contributed to record cold temperatures for August in Phoenix. On August\u00a014, the city had a high temperature of 78\u00a0\u00b0F (26\u00a0\u00b0C), which was 24\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22124\u00a0\u00b0C) below normal for that date. In Maricopa County, 3.5\u00a0in (89\u00a0mm) of rain was observed. Heavy precipitation, with 3.42\u00a0in (87\u00a0mm) in Desert Hills, which fell in less than two hours. Several weather-related car accidents occurred, but none were serious. In Apache Junction, police and city officials rushed to close flooded streets, including portions of state highways and underpasses of Interstate 17. Crews were pumping 32,000\u00a0US\u00a0gal (120,000\u00a0L) of water from the underpasses of Interstate 17, but their efforts were futile. A 19\u00a0mi (31\u00a0km) portion of State Route 87 between Gila River Indian Community and the intersection with State Route 187 was shut down due to flooding. In Sacaton, about two-thirds of the city was inundated with at least 3\u00a0ft (0.91\u00a0m) of water.[26]"

Dean developed from a tropical wave on August 22 over the Lesser Antilles, and was initially predicted to intensify further to reach hurricane status. However, strong wind shear quickly weakened Dean to cause it to dissipate on August 23. The remnants turned northward, and redeveloped on August 26 to the north of Bermuda. Located over warm waters and in an area of favorable conditions, Dean steadily strengthened while moving to the northeast, and peaked just below hurricane status on August 27 about 465 miles (748\u00a0km) southwest of Newfoundland. The storm subsequently weakened over cooler waters, and became extratropical on August 28. The precursor tropical wave dropped heavy rainfall and produced moderate winds throughout the Lesser Antilles, though no serious damage was reported. In Puerto Rico, rainfall of up to 12.7 inches (320\u00a0mm) produced widespread flooding across the island. Thousands were left without power or water, and two houses lost their roofs from the storm. The passage of Dean resulted in $7.7\u00a0million (2001\u00a0USD, $9.4\u00a0million 2008\u00a0\u00a0USD) in damage in Puerto Rico. The storm produced light to moderate rainfall in Bermuda and later in Newfoundland, though no damage was reported."

        "content": "A large tropical wave with minimal convection moved off the coast of Africa near Dakar between August 14 and August 15. It moved westward, and gradually developed thunderstorms across the wave axis.[1] On August 21, while located about 450 miles (720\u00a0km) east of the Lesser Antilles, convection increased further within the system, though unfavorable upper-level wind shear prevented rapid development.[2] It continued to become better organized, and though a Reconnaissance flight into the system reported strong winds, it lacked a surface circulation. Late on August 21 the wave passed through the northern Lesser Antilles,[1] and subsequent to a decrease in wind shear the system became much better organized on August 22.[3] A surface circulation formed, and the system developed into Tropical Storm Dean on August 22 near Saint Croix. Dean was upgraded directly to a tropical storm due to the presence of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) winds in the storm.[1] Reconnaissance Aircraft and surface reports confirmed the existence of a circulation. Dean moved northwestward at 22\u00a0mph (35\u00a0km/h), under the influence of the Bermuda High to its northeast. The storm strengthened slightly to reach winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) later on August 22, though the circulation was exposed on the western edge of the convection due to the storm's quick forward motion and persistent wind shear. Initial forecasts predicted the shear to decrease, allowing Dean to attain hurricane status with winds of over 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h).[4] However, an upper-level trough produced an increase of shear over the storm, and by August 23 Dean weakened to a tropical depression. Hours later, the circulation dissipated, and Dean degenerated into a tropical wave to the east of the Bahamas.[1] Regeneration was considered unlikely at the time.[5] The remnants of Dean turned to the north, and became embedded within a large mid-level trough off the East Coast of the United States.[1] Convection increased around the system early on August 24.[6] The system became better organized, with indications of a broad surface circulation forming about 400 miles (640\u00a0km) west-southwest of Bermuda.[7] However, a reconnaissance flight into the remnants of Dean reported a broad low pressure area with the strongest winds and convection located far from the area of minimum pressure, indicating it had some non-tropical characteristics.[1] The weak disturbance passed to the west of Bermuda early on August 25, and subsequently began to drift to the northeast. The remnants of Dean produced convection near its developing circulation, and on August 26, while located 220 miles (350\u00a0km) north of Bermuda the system organized sufficiently enough to be re-classified a tropical depression.[1] Operationally, the National Hurricane Center did not re-initiate advisories until fifteen hours later.[8] The depression continued to the northeast, and re-strengthened into Tropical Storm Dean early on August 27 while located 580 miles (930\u00a0km) south of Halifax, Nova Scotia.[1] The convection became better organized, and Dean steadily strengthened as it tracked northeastward. A ship near the center of Dean confirmed the storm re-developed.[8] The convection near the center greatly organized, and an eye feature began to develop.[9] Remaining over warm waters, Dean continued to strengthen and reached peak winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) late on August 27 while located about 465 miles (748\u00a0km) southwest of Cape Race, Newfoundland.[10] The eye feature failed to develop further, and after maintaining its peak intensity for 12\u00a0hours Dean weakened over progressively cooler waters.[1] The convection quickly diminished,[11] and on August 28 Dean became extratropical while located 145 miles (233\u00a0km) east-southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland. The extratropical storm continued northeastward until being absorbed by a frontal low on August 29.[1]"

However, because Dean formed after it passed the islands, no tropical cyclone warnings or watches were issued.[1] The precursor disturbance dropped heavy rainfall on Saint Martin of around 5 inches (130\u00a0mm).[12] The precursor disturbance to Tropical Storm Dean produced 1.07 inches (27\u00a0mm) of rain in Saint Thomas, where winds reached 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h) with gusts to 48\u00a0mph (77\u00a0km/h).[1] On Saint Croix, the system produced 0.49 inches (12\u00a0mm) of rain and peak wind gusts of 47\u00a0mph (76\u00a0km/h). There, minor flooding was reported. Moderate wind gusts downed small trees and branches in Saint Croix and Saint John, and some roads were damaged in Saint John, as well. Heavy rains and gusty winds caused power outages throughout the U.S. Virgin Islands. The passage of Tropical Storm Dean resulted in minor damage totaling to $20,000 (2001\u00a0USD, $24,400 2008\u00a0USD).[13] Tropical Storm Dean dropped heavy rainfall across Puerto Rico, peaking at 12.7 inches (320\u00a0mm) in Salinas. Winds were generally light across the island. The passage of Dean resulted in widespread flooding in eastern and southern Puerto Rico, collapsing two bridges and one road. Several highways were under water, and one car was swept away by the floodwaters. The four inside the vehicle were later rescued and unharmed. Throughout the island, about 1,320\u00a0houses were flooded, and two houses experienced collapsed roofs. The rains left various towns without power or water.[14] By the night after the storm passed the island, more than 16,000 were without power, while almost 70,000 lacked potable water. Over 130\u00a0people were evacuated from low-lying areas to hurricane shelters.[15]\nTwo people were injured in Pe\u00f1uelas,[14] and three were injured in Nag\u00fcabo when the ceiling of a day care center collapsed,[15] though no deaths occurred on the island.[14] One airline canceled seventeen flights in and out of the island, and one cruise line was required to alter its path to both Dean and earlier due to Tropical Storm Chantal.[15] Damage in Puerto Rico totaled to $7.7\u00a0million (2001\u00a0USD, $9.4\u00a0million 2008\u00a0USD), of which $2.1\u00a0million (2001\u00a0USD, $2.6\u00a0million 2008\u00a0USD) was from agricultural damage.[14]"

The season accumulated the second-fewest ACE units on record, as many of the tropical cyclones were weak and short-lived. Altogether, only three of the season's eight named storms strengthened into hurricanes. Of those, two became major hurricanes, with one, Celia, reaching Category 5 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson scale. Despite the inactivity, however, it was the costliest Pacific hurricane season on record at the time, mostly due to Tropical Storm Agatha. The season officially began on May\u00a015 in the eastern North Pacific (east 140\u00b0W) and on June\u00a01 in the central North Pacific (from 140\u00b0W to the International Date Line). It ended in both regions on November\u00a030. These dates, adopted by convention, historically describe the period in each year when most tropical cyclogenesis occurs in these regions of the Pacific. However, the formation of tropical cyclones is possible at any time of the year, as evidenced by the formation of Tropical Storm Omeka on December 19. This was below normal hurricane season was since 1996, had 9 named storms. Only 2010 had 8 named storms. The first system of the season, Agatha, developed on May 29 near the coast of Guatemala. In the second week of June, a sudden spree of tropical cyclones developed, and between June 16 and 22, four cyclones formed, including the two major hurricanes of the season, Celia and Darby, the first of which reached Category 5 intensity. This near-record activity was a reversal from the previous season, when no storm formed until June\u00a018. Following this activity, July saw zero named storms. In August and September only 2 tropical storms and one hurricane formed. Tropical Depression Eleven-E caused a great deal of flooding in southern Mexico, causing millions of dollars in damage, as well as causing over 50 deaths and $500 million in damage in areas of Oaxaca and Guatemala. Tropical Storm Omeka was a rare off-season storm."

        "content": "On May 19, 2010, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) released their forecast for the 2010 Central Pacific hurricane season, which would start on June 1. They expected two or three cyclones to form in or enter the region throughout the season, below the average of four or five storms. The below-average activity forecast was based on two factors: the first was the continuance of a period of decreased activity in the central Pacific; and second, the effects of a Neutral El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO) or La Ni\u00f1a, both of which reduce cyclone activity in the region. However, in light of the near-miss of Hurricane Felicia the previous year, forecasters at the Central Pacific Hurricane Center gave the public a basic message for the 2010 season, \"Prepare! Watch! Act!\".[5] On May 27, 12 days after the official start of the 2010 eastern Pacific hurricane season, NOAA released their forecast for the basin. Similar to the forecast for the central Pacific, below-average activity was expected, with nine to fifteen named storms forming, four to eight of which would become hurricanes and a further one to three would become major hurricanes. This lessened activity was based on the same two factors as the central Pacific, decreased activity since 1995 and the ENSO event. Overall, NOAA stated there was a 75% chance of below-average activity, 20% of near-normal and only a 5% chance of above-average due to a strong La Ni\u00f1a.[6]"

        "content": "The Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) index for the 2010 Pacific hurricane season (Eastern Pacific and Central Pacific combined) as calculated by Colorado State University using data from the National Hurricane Center was 51.2\u00a0units.[nb 4][15] This ranked as the second-quietest since 1966. The vast majority of the ACE stemmed from Hurricanes Celia and Darby, which collectively accounted for roughly 70\u00a0percent of the seasonal total.[7] Continuing a trend of below-average activity that began in 1995, the 2010\u00a0season was quiet as expected. The Eastern Pacific proper saw record-low numbers of named storms and hurricanes, with only seven and three respectively forming.[7] Inclusive of the Central Pacific, the basin tied its record low activity of eight named storms set in 1977.[3][16] Inactivity was largely attributed to a moderately strong La Ni\u00f1a event which resulted in below-average sea surface temperatures across the basin. Another major factor limiting storm formation was the eastward displacement of 200\u00a0mb divergence. The displacement of this feature brought conditions that favor tropical development closer to the rugged terrain of Mexico and Central America, a factor known to disrupt low-level circulations. Accordingly, six of the seven named storms in the Eastern Pacific proper formed east of 106\u00b0W, four of which originated over the Gulf of Tehuantepec where the greatest depth of warm waters were restricted to. A final limiting factor was above-average wind shear across much of the basin east of 130\u00b0W and north of 10\u00b0N.[7] The record inactivity experienced in the Northeastern Pacific also took place in the Northwestern Pacific. Since reliable records began in the 1970s, there has been no precedent for both basins experiencing exceptionally low tropical cyclone formation. Moreover, this general lack of storm formation was reflected in all cyclone basins except the Atlantic. On average, the Northeastern Pacific accounts for 16\u00a0percent of the world's storms; however, during 2010, it accounted for roughly 10\u00a0percent (7 out of 67 cyclones).[17]"

Attaining peak winds of 45\u00a0mph (70\u00a0km/h), Agatha soon made landfall late on May 29 near Champerico, Guatemala, just south of the border with Mexico. Once onshore, the mountainous terrain of Guatemala caused the storm to quickly dissipate early on May 30.[24] Although a weak tropical cyclone, Agatha brought torrential rainfall to much of Central America.[25] Daily accumulations peaked at 16.78\u00a0in (426\u00a0mm) in Montufar, Guatemala and 19.0\u00a0in (483\u00a0mm) in Ilopango, El Salvador.[24][26] According to Guatemala's president, \u00c1lvaro Colom, some areas received more than 3.3\u00a0ft (1\u00a0m) of rain.[27] The ensuing flash floods and landslides proved catastrophic, especially in Guatemala where at least 174\u00a0people died.[28] In El Salvador, 11\u00a0people were killed and damage from the storm reached $112.1\u00a0million.[26] Honduras also suffered significant losses from the storm with 18\u00a0fatalities and at least $18.5\u00a0million in damage.[29] One person was also killed in Nicaragua.[30]\nThe storm also associated with a very large sinkhole."

A scatterometer pass over the storm revealed it to have attained peak winds of 35\u00a0mph (55\u00a0km/h) later that day. Thereafter, wind shear took its toll on the system and its low-level circulation ultimately dissipated early on June 17 while still off the coast of Mexico.[31] Due to its proximity to land, tropical storm watches and warnings were issued in advance of the storm when the system was first classified. This was discontinued when the system dissipated.[31] Rainfall associated with the depression extended as far north as Oaxaca. In San Juan Bautista Tuxtepec, 82\u00a0homes were damaged by flood waters and 40\u00a0others were affected in the town of Zimatl\u00e1n de Alvarez.[32] Some homes lost their roofs and a few trees were downed as a result of high winds.[33]"

Little convective development took place as it traversed the region; however, as it crossed Central America between June 9 and 10, it began to show signs of strengthening. By June 13, an area of low pressure developed within the wave and slowly developed a surface circulation over the following 48\u00a0hours as it remained nearly stationary over open waters. Early on June 17, deep convection was able to maintain itself over the system, prompting the NHC to classify the low as Tropical Depression Three-E; at this time, the depression was situated 305\u00a0mi (490\u00a0km) south-southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico. Within hours of becoming a tropical depression, a ship in the region reported sustained winds of 45\u00a0mph (70\u00a0km/h), indicating that the system had developed into a tropical storm. The newly upgraded storm, now named Blas by the NHC, began to track slowly to the northwest, and later nearly due west, in response to a strengthening ridge over Mexico.[34] Strong wind shear prevented Blas from strengthening further over the following day; however, by June 19, the system entered a region of weaker shear. This allowed convection to develop over the center of circulation and that afternoon, the storm attained its peak intensity with winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) and a pressure of 992 mbar (hPa; 29.29\u00a0inHg). Shortly thereafter, cooler sea surface temperatures took their toll on Blas, causing the storm to gradually weaken. By June 21, the system weakened to a tropical depression as convection diminished. Hours later, it degenerated into a non-convective remnant low while situated about 715\u00a0mi (1,150\u00a0km) west-southwest of the southern tip of Baja California Sur.

Over the following 42\u00a0hours, sustained winds decreased to tropical storm force and the system began to stall over the open ocean by June 27. Despite highly unfavorable conditions, the storm managed to retain tropical storm status through June 28 and degenerated into a non-convective remnant low that evening.

Initially well-organized, the wave rapidly deteriorated within 24\u00a0hours; it continued westward without redevelopment and entered the Eastern Pacific on June 19. The following day, an area of low pressure developed within the system as it slowed and turned towards the west-northwest. Gradually organizing, the low strengthened into a tropical depression on June 23 while situated roughly 380\u00a0mi (610\u00a0km) south-southeast of Salina Cruz, Mexico. Over the following two days, Darby underwent two periods of rapid intensification. At the end of the second phase on June 25, the storm attained its peak intensity as a Category\u00a03 hurricane with winds of 120\u00a0mph (195\u00a0km/h) and a pressure of 959 mbar (hPa; 28.32\u00a0inHg). Though a strong storm, Darby was unusually small with tropical storm force winds extending only 70\u00a0mi (115\u00a0km) from its center.[36] Not long after peaking, a large area of westerly winds, produced by Hurricane Alex over the Gulf of Mexico, caused Darby to stall offshore before turning to the east, being drawn into the circulation of the larger storm. Increased wind shear produced by the \"massive outflow of Alex\" caused the small storm to rapidly weaken.[36] By June 28, Darby had diminished to a tropical depression and later to a remnant low off the coast of Mexico. The low persisted for another day before fully dissipating offshore.[36] While offshore, authorities in Mexico advised residents to be cautious of heavy rains from Darby. Alerts were issued for several areas; however, the storm dissipated before reaching land.[37][38] The combined effects of Hurricanes Alex and Darby resulted in heavy rains over much of Chiapas, amounting to 12 to 16\u00a0in (300 to 400\u00a0mm) in some areas.

Classified a tropical depression the following day,[56] the National Hurricane Center initially expected it to attain tropical storm status before moving over land.[57] A ship in the region measured gale-force winds, supporting this forecast but later analysis revealed that these winds were associated with a broad monsoon trough which the depression was embedded within. Failing to intensify, the system made landfall near Salina Cruz, Mexico and rapidly weakened. Maintaining its circulation, the depression survived its crossing of Mexico and regenerated into Atlantic Tropical Storm Hermine. The crossover of this storm is regarded as an uncommon occurrence,[56] taking place only a handful of times since reliable records in the Atlantic began in 1851.[58] Due to the depression's proximity to land, tropical storm warnings were issued for southern Mexico.[56] The depression produced a swath of heavy rain along its immediate track, with localized peaks over 10\u00a0in (250\u00a0mm) and a storm maximum of 13.6\u00a0in (350\u00a0mm) in Alvarado, Veracruz.[59] Flooding affected more than 25,000\u00a0people in Oaxaca and 6,000\u00a0people in Guerrero.[60][61] The monsoon trough in which the depression was embedded was responsible for tremendous damage across Central America,[56] including at least 54\u00a0fatalities and $500\u00a0million in damage across Guatemala.[62][63] At least three others perished in Costa Rica.[64]"

        "content": " Tropical Storm Agatha was a weak but deadly tropical cyclone that brought widespread floods to much of Central America, and was the deadliest storm in the eastern Pacific tropical cyclone basin since Hurricane Pauline in 1997. The first named storm of the 2010 Pacific hurricane season, Agatha originated from the Intertropical Convergence Zone, a region of thunderstorms across the tropics. It developed into a tropical depression on May 29 and tropical storm later, it was dissipated on May 30, reaching top winds of 45\u00a0mph (75 km/h) and a lowest pressure of 1000 mbar (hPa; 29.53 inHg). It made landfall near the Guatemala\u2013Mexico border on the evening of May 29. Agatha produced torrential rain all across Central America, which resulted in the death of one person in Nicaragua. In Guatemala, 152 people were killed and 100 left missing by landslides. Thirteen deaths also occurred in El Salvador. Agatha soon dissipated over Guatemala. As of June 15, officials in Guatemala have stated that 165 people were killed and 113 others are missing. In all, Agatha caused at least 204\u00a0fatalities, and roughly $1.1\u00a0billion in damage throughout Central America.[1][2][3] Despite the catastrophic damage in Mexico, along with a high fatality rate, Agatha was not retired, and therefore was used again in the 2016 season."

        "content": "Tropical Storm Agatha originated from an area of convection, or thunderstorms, that developed on May 24, off the west coast of Costa Rica.[4] At the time, there was a trough in the region that extended into the southwestern Caribbean Sea, associated with the Intertropical Convergence Zone.[5] The system drifted northwestward, and conditions favored further development.[6] On May 25, the convection became more concentrated, and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) noted the potential for a tropical depression to develop.[7] The next day, it briefly became disorganized,[8] as its circulation was broad and elongated; however, the disturbance was in a very moist environment, and multiple low level centers gradually organized into one.[9] The low continued to get better organized;[10] however, there was a lack of a well-defined circulation.[11] On May 29, after further organization of the circulation and convection, the NHC initiated advisories on Tropical Depression One-E while the system was located about 295\u00a0miles (475\u00a0km) west of San Salvador, El Salvador.[12] Upon becoming a tropical cyclone, the system was located in an environment with little wind shear and waters of 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F). As such, it was expected to strengthen, although the mountainous terrain of the Central American coastline limited significant intensification. The depression moved slowly northeastward around the western periphery of a ridge located over northern South America.[12] Several hours later, satellites monitoring the system discovered tropical storm-force winds, prompting the NHC to upgrade the depression to Tropical Storm Agatha. Around this time, it was noted that there was a 40% chance of the system undergoing rapid intensification within the following 24\u00a0hours as the only limiting factor was its proximity to land.[13] However, the storm failed to intensify much, peaking in intensity with winds of 45\u00a0mph (75\u00a0km/h) and a barometric pressure of 1001\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.56\u00a0inHg).[1] Within two hours of reaching this strength, Agatha abruptly relocated northward and made landfall at 22:30 UTC near Champerico, Guatemala.[1] After landfall, Agatha continued to cause floods and landslides, however it did not bring a lot of tropical storm force winds on shore.[14] The system weakened quickly after coming on shore, dropping its winds to 25 mph (20 knots, 40 km/h) and its pressure to 1007 mbar (hPa; 29.74 inHg) before dissipating.[15] A burst of convection re-emerged east of Belize, in the Atlantic basin, on May 31. On June 1, the National Hurricane Center stated that the remnants of Tropical Storm Agatha had only a low chance of regeneration in the western Caribbean Sea.[16]"

        "content": "Upon the formation of Tropical Depression One-E on May 29, the Government of Guatemala declared a tropical storm warning for the entire Pacific coastline. Due to the system's proximity to land, tropical storm force winds were expected to reach the coast by the evening hours, making outdoor preparations difficult. Additionally, the depression's slow movement was expected to lead to enormous rainfall totals, exceeding 30\u00a0in (760\u00a0mm) in some areas. This rain was expected to produce large-scale, life-threatening flash flooding and landslides across Guatemala, El Salvador and southeastern Mexico.[17] Once the system intensified into Tropical Storm Agatha, the National Hurricane Center expected areas to the south and east of the landfall location to experience storm surge along with destructive waves.[18] By the late morning of May 29, Guatemalan officials placed all hospitals on high alert and declared a state of calamity. President \u00c1lvaro Colom also began to use some of the $85\u00a0million allocated as emergency funds by the World Bank.[19] After the storm moved over land and weakened to a tropical depression, the tropical storm warnings along the coast were discontinued.[20] Throughout El Salvador and Nicaragua, emergency officials evacuated about 2,000 residents due to the threat of flash flooding.[21] In response to the approaching storm, a yellow alert was declared for all of El Salvador and it was estimated that roughly 89% of the country was at risk from flooding. Roughly 52,000 police, emergency rescue personnel and soldiers were placed on standby by the Direcci\u00f3n General de Protecci\u00f3n Civil.[22]"

Excessive rainfall from Agatha in the region could exacerbate the situation and trigger lahars. However, people working in coffee fields considered the rain brought by the storm to be helpful, removing ash from their trees.[25] According to meteorologists in Guatemala, at least 14\u00a0in (360\u00a0mm) of rain had fallen by the evening of May 29.[26] Several landslides blocked roadways across southern areas of the country, hindering traffic.[27] Following the storm, a three-story building was swallowed by a 30-meter (100-ft) diameter sinkhole caused by Agatha's rainfall.[28][29] A mudslide coming down the Agua volcano left 9 deaths and 12 disappeared in the town of San Miguel Escobar.[30] \nIn the town of Almolonga, department of Quetzaltenango, a mudslide triggered by the storm killed four people after destroying their home, and in total twelve people were killed in Guatemala, while another landslide left 11 people missing.[31] Officials in the country declared a state of emergency during the afternoon of May 29 as conditions worsened. Many rivers in the country were already swollen and close to over-topping their banks.[32] Many other homes were destroyed in widespread floods and dozens of emergency rescues had to be made.[33] By the afternoon of May 30, reports from the region stated that 15 people had been killed and 22 others were missing throughout Guatemala.[34] Preliminary damage assessments showed that at least 3,500 homes were damaged.[35] A total of 112,000 people were evacuated.[36] Additionally, at least 20,000 people have been left homeless as a result of the storm.[37] Some areas recorded the heaviest rainfall in over 60\u00a0years, measuring more than 36\u00a0in (910\u00a0mm). This also ranks Agatha as the wettest known tropical cyclone to ever strike the country, surpassing Hurricane Mitch.[38] By the next day, the death toll had risen to 92, with another 95 people injured.[39] In Guatemala City, a sinkhole 30 stories deep collapsed, killing 15 people and placing a further 300 residents in danger. A three-story house and telephone poles were also swallowed, along with a security guard. The sinkhole was formed due to sewage pipes leaking, and flooding from Agatha only exacerbated the problem.[40][41]"

By May 30, President Mauricio Funes declared a country-wide state of emergency due to the widespread damage caused by Agatha.[37] According to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, a total of 12 people were killed by Agatha throughout El Salvador and roughly 120,000 individuals were affected across 116 municipalities. At one point, more than 15,000 people were housed in emergency shelters; however, by June 9, this number decreased to just 712. A total of 3,162 acres (12.80\u00a0km2) of farmland was flooded by the storm, leaving $6\u00a0million in losses.

According to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), schools in Guatemala were to be closed until at least June 4.[67] However, due to the large number of severely damaged or destroyed schools, few buildings can actually allow for classes to take place and 144 of the schools that are intact are being used as shelters.[68] By June 1, the Government of Guatemala sent an appeal to the United Nations for roughly $100\u00a0million in international assistance to deal with damage wrought by Agatha.[69] On June 14, President Colom stated that it would take at least five years to recover from Tropical Storm Agatha due to the widespread nature of the catastrophe.[68] To obtain the necessary resources to recover from the storm, Colom implemented a substantial tax increase. His goal was to increase the revenue from taxes in the country to 9.8% of the gross domestic product.[70] Throughout the country, roughly 392,600 people were left in need of humanitarian assistance in the wake of Agatha. Most of these people live in rural areas which became isolated from surrounding areas after flood waters washed out roads and destroyed bridges.[69]"

However, due to the eruption of Pacaya, the country's international airport was closed and would remain so for at least another week. In an agreement with the president of El Salvador, it was decided that aid would be flown into El Salvador and transported by ground to Guatemala.[72] However, later reports revealed that two of the four land crossings between the countries were closed off due to flooding and landslides.[73] On May 31, Colombia and the United States offered their assistance by sending aid or helping evacuate residents. By the late morning, six United States military aircraft were en route to Honduras.[74] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Taiwan also stated that they would provide aid to Guatemala if necessary.[75] The Government of France also passed on their condolences to the countries suffering from the disaster and pledged to send emergency humanitarian aid to the region.[76] This was eventually followed up by June 14 when the French embassy in Guatemala provided $50,000 in relief supplies.[77] The initial response from the World Food Programme was to allocate $500,000 to feed 10,000 over a period of 15 days. Other United Nations departments provided much assistance to Guatemala within two days of Agatha's landfall. UNICEF donated roughly $50,000 to support water and sanitation; UNDP allocated $50,000 for assessments and early recovery; the Spanish Agency for International Cooperation for Development provided roughly $185,000 in general humanitarian aid; and the IFRC and UNFPA planned donate $50,000 each.[67] The United States provided immediate funds of GTQ 900,000 (US$112,000); USAID also planned to deploy relief teams with food and emergency supplies to bring to those affected by the storm. Additionally, several helicopters from the United States Southern Command were to be deployed in the region.[78] By June 1, the European Union had sent $3.7\u00a0million in aid to Guatemala as well as Honduras and El Salvador.[79] The Save the Children organization began distributing hygiene kits and other relief supplies on June 4. Over the following weeks, they planned to provide 46\u00a0metric tons of supplies.[80] Extensive losses of the country's food supply left tens of thousands of residents without sustenance, leading to fears of widespread hunger in the nation. In attempts to lessen the severity of the hunger outbreak, the WFP set up over 200 shelters across the country and was estimated to be serving 50,000 people a day by June 9.[81] On June 11, the United Nations made an appeal to supply Guatemala with $14.5\u00a0million to aid survivors of the storm. This appeal followed a $34\u00a0million request for the country prior to the storm for malnutrition incidents.[82] By June 14, the Government of Japan had provided roughly $220,000 worth of equipment and building materials.[21] Around the same time, ACT Development announced that it planned to assist roughly 2,000 families with all basic life necessities for a month. To start this operation, a preliminary appeal was made to the United Nations for $881,000; a second, full appeal was planned to be published on June 20.[83]"

During the afternoon of 4\u00a0October, convection redeveloped around the center of the low[7] and was classified as a tropical storm near S\u00e3o Miguel Island.[1] Although the storm was tropical at this time, the NHC did not issue advisories for several hours.[2] The first advisory from the NHC was issued at 11:00\u00a0AST on 4\u00a0October; at this time, the system was officially named Grace, the seventh named storm of the 2009 Atlantic hurricane season. The storm featured relatively deep convection around an eye-like feature. Although Grace was over waters normally not warm enough for tropical cyclogenesis, low wind shear allowed the convection to persist. A steady northeastward track was taken by the storm in response to a southerly flow over the northwestern Atlantic.[2] The storm intensified slightly as it moved over decreasing sea surface temperatures,[8] with winds estimated at 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h) early on 5\u00a0October; operationally it was held at 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h), but was downgraded due to uncertainties in the storm's intensity as it was progressing over cold waters.[1] A large extratropical cyclone near Grace caused the storm to deteriorate in organization, with convection weakening and becoming asymmetric. By this time, the storm was over 18\u00a0\u00b0C (64\u00a0\u00b0F) waters, likely inhibiting convective development.[9] Shower and thunderstorm activity continued to diminish throughout the day on 5\u00a0October; however, Grace maintained tropical characteristics, namely a deep, warm core.[10] Early on 6\u00a0October, the NHC issued their final advisory on Grace as it merged with a frontal system over the northeastern Atlantic. Just prior to merging, the lowest pressure in relation to the storm was recorded at 986\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.12\u00a0inHg).[11] The extratropical remnants of Grace persisted for roughly 18\u00a0hours before dissipating over the Celtic Sea early on 7\u00a0October.[1] However, the United States Naval Research Laboratory continued to monitor the system for several more hours until it moved over the North Sea.[12] Although officially designated a tropical cyclone by the NHC, M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France, the French meteorological service, stated in their annual report to the World Meteorological Organization that Grace should not have been classified a tropical system. In their report, they argued that although the storm presented deep convection, an eye-like feature, and winds above 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h), the overall development of Grace was more similar to that of a mid-latitude non-tropical cyclone.[13] However, operationally, M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France considered Grace to be a subtropical cyclone.[14] They also criticized the NHC for warning on this system based on recent trends of the link between global warming and increased hurricane activity.[13]"

Gusts up to 44\u00a0mph (71\u00a0km/h) were recorded on Ponta Delgada.[25] While merging  with the frontal system on 6\u00a0October, the storm's outer bands produced heavy rains and strong winds over parts of Portugal, resulting in some street flooding. In higher elevations, wind gusts were estimated to have exceeded 80\u00a0km/h (50\u00a0mph).[26] Due to the storm's relatively rapid forward movement by the time it reached the United Kingdom, rainfall was limited. In Ireland, 1.18\u00a0in (30\u00a0mm) of precipitation fell in the city of Cork. Sustained winds in the city were recorded up to 23\u00a0mph (37\u00a0km/h).[27] Rainfall in the country peaked at 48\u00a0mm (1.9\u00a0in) in Wexford.[28] Near the coastline of Wales, a buoy recorded sustained winds up to 41\u00a0mph (66\u00a0km/h), equivalent to a minimal tropical storm.[29] Late on 6\u00a0October, the remnants of Grace moved inland over Wales, bringing heavy rains and high winds to the region.[30] Maximum rainfall in the United Kingdom reached 1.92\u00a0in (49\u00a0mm) in Capel Curig.[31] One ship, the Cap Castillo (call sign A8PI5), recorded sustained winds of 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h) on 5 October, while located about 110\u00a0mi (180\u00a0km) south of the storm's center.[1] Moisture from the storm's remnants fueled another, more powerful cyclone that caused flooding in parts of Belgium after producing upwards of 2.4\u00a0in (61\u00a0mm) of rain.[32] Operationally, Grace was not classified as a tropical storm until it reached latitude 41.2\u00b0N.[3][33] However, a post-storm analysis concluded that Grace had actually become a tropical storm 12 hours earlier than initially estimated, placing its location of development further south, at 38.5\u00b0N.[1] This marked the farthest northeast a tropical cyclone formed in the Atlantic basin, breaking the record set by Hurricane Vince in 2005.[3][33] In its Tropical Cyclone Report on Grace, the National Hurricane Center reported that the formation of Grace was poorly forecast. The first mention of the precursor low on 1\u00a0October predicted that it would not develop into a tropical or subtropical cyclone. Over the following three days, the system was not mentioned in the NHC's tropical weather outlooks until just prior to Grace's classification. The lack of preceding outlooks was attributed to the storm's unusual location and the sparsity of data for storms in the region.[1]"

This cyclone caused some locally severe flooding in Alabama after striking the Gulf Coast of the United States. No further activity is known to have occurred until August\u00a020, around the time a storm formed near the Cabo Verde Islands. Of the two known cyclones originating in the month of September, one impacted several islands of the Lesser Antilles, including reportedly \"many lives lost\" on Dominica.

Four storms attained hurricane status, with maximum sustained winds of 75\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h) or greater. None of these systems intensified into a major hurricane, which is Category\u00a03 or higher on the modern-day Saffir\u2013Simpson scale.[1] However, neither the seasonal statistics nor the intensity of individual storms should be regarded as complete. Due to a lack modern satellite and other remote-sensing technologies, only storms that affected populated land areas or encountered ships at sea were recorded. Therefore, an undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 has been estimated.[2] Neither the reanalysis by Jos\u00e9 Fern\u00e1ndez-Partag\u00e1s and Henry F. Diaz in 1995 nor the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project in 2003 added or removed any storms for the 1872\u00a0season.[3] However, of the known 1872 cyclones, significant changes were made to the tracks of second and fourth cyclones by Fern\u00e1ndez-Partag\u00e1s and Diaz, who also proposed smaller changes to the known track of third system.[4] Further analysis by the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project led to a significant revision of the track for the fifth storm.[3] Additionally, a 2014 reanalysis study by climate researcher Michael Chenoweth indicated that three new tropical cyclones formed, although these proposals have yet to be included in the official hurricane database (HURDAT).[5] On July\u00a09, the first known storm of the season was initially observed over the south-central Gulf of Mexico. After striking the Gulf Coast of the United States,[6] the cyclone caused locally severe flooding in Clarke County, Alabama, but little damage elsewhere.[7] More than a month later, the track begins for the next system on August\u00a020. It began the strongest storm of the season, peaking as a Category\u00a02 hurricane with winds of 105\u00a0mph (165\u00a0km/h). Two cyclones developed in September,[6] the first of which impacted several islands of the Lesser Antilles, with \"many lives lost\" on Dominica, according to a telegram to the New York Herald.[8] The final storm of the season began as a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico on October\u00a022. It crossed struck Florida and North Carolina, both at tropical storm intensity.[6] Some areas of North Carolina and Virginia reported heavy rainfall and abnormally high tides.[9][10][11] The season's activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 65, less than the previous two seasons but not unusually low for the time. ACE is a metric used to express the energy used by a tropical cyclone during its lifetime. Therefore, a storm with a longer duration will have higher values of ACE. It is only calculated at six-hour increments in which specific tropical and subtropical systems are either at or above sustained wind speeds of 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h), which is the threshold for tropical storm intensity. Thus, tropical depressions are not included here.[1]"

The cyclone then curved northward and made two landfalls along the Gulf Coast of the United States on July\u00a011, first in Louisiana near the mouth of the Mississippi River and a few hours later near Mississippi City. The system drifted over land and weakened to a tropical depression over central Mississippi, several hours before dissipating over the northeastern portions of the state.[6] Climate researcher Michael Chenoweth proposed little change to this storm's intensity, track, and duration as part of a study.[5] In Alabama, Clarke County experienced heavy rainfall, leading to severe local crop losses, the destruction of many milldams, and the inundation of the Grand Trunk Railroad. The Clarke County Democrat newspaper reported that overall, \"The damage, taken altogether, surpasses anything in the history of our county.\" The newspaper also noted that no reports from Mobile mentioned a storm.[7]"

Intensifying slightly as it moved northeastward across the Gulf of Mexico, the storm reached winds of 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h) prior to making landfall near Clearwater, Florida, around 08:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a023. About 10\u00a0hours later, the cyclone emerged into the Atlantic just north of Cape Canaveral and then curved north-northeastward. After briefly reaching hurricane intensity on October\u00a024, the system made landfall near Topsail Beach, North Carolina, early on October\u00a025 with winds of 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h). The storm then moved generally northeastward across the Northeastern United States before emerging into the Gulf of Maine on October\u00a027 and becoming extratropical. The system then dissipated just offshore Nova Scotia on the following day.[6] A track for the storm's movement over the East Coast of the United States was included in the October\u00a01872 edition of the Monthly Weather Review, making it one of the earliest cyclone paths to be published by the United States Army Signal Service, a predecessor of the National Weather Service.[4] Little impact occurred in northeastern Florida, aside from 5.94\u00a0in (151\u00a0mm) of rainfall in Jacksonville.[13] The Signal Service issued storm warnings along the East Coast of the United States from Wilmington, North Carolina, to New York City.[14] The storm produced 4\u20138\u00a0in (100\u2013200\u00a0mm) of rain in Weldon and Tarboro in North Carolina and the Norfolk area in Virginia.[9] In Norfolk, Virginia, 6.29\u00a0in (160\u00a0mm) of precipitation occurred on October\u00a024, setting a daily record.[10] One two-story brick home collapsed in Richmond, but its occupants were not present.[15] Abnormally high tides impacted many inland waterways in eastern Virginia, including Cameron Run, which reached \"almost as high as ever before known\", according to the Alexandria Gazette and Virginia Advertiser.[11] Around 2\u00a0in (51\u00a0mm) of precipitation also fell in many coastal areas of the Mid-Atlantic and New England.[16] Chenoweth's study begins the track for this storm on August\u00a023 as a tropical depression offshore the Southeastern United States. He argued that the system either did not traverse the Florida peninsula, or was not a cyclone at the time. The study proposed that the cyclone remained well-below hurricane intensity and maintained tropical storm status for only about 18\u00a0hours from October\u00a024 to early the next day.

Late on August\u00a030, the system became extratropical well east of Newfoundland. On September\u00a05, a tropical depression formed south of the Cabo Verde Islands. The depression moved slowly northwestward and attained tropical storm intensity on the next day. The cyclone turned north-northeastward by September\u00a012 and intensified into a hurricane. However, the system weakened to a tropical storm prior to passing just west of the Azores on September\u00a014 and dissipated by the following day. A third and final unofficial storm developed on October\u00a05 to the south of Hispaniola. Initially moving northwestward, the system soon struck near Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, and later across the Turks and Caicos Islands later that day. Thereafter, the cyclone moved northeastward or north-northeastward throughout much of the rest of its duration.

With banding features becoming more prominent, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) classified the system as Tropical Depression Eleven-E about 345\u00a0miles (555\u00a0km) south-southeast of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula.[6] The tropical depression initially moved northwestward around the southwestern periphery of a ridge over Mexico.[6] Convection continued to develop to the west of the center,[7] and late on August 23, a ship report confirmed the depression intensified Tropical Storm Julio.[8] Initially, the persistent shear left the center partially exposed from the thunderstorm activity, though upper level conditions gradually became more favorable for strengthening.[9] On August 24, Tropical Storm Julio attained peak winds of 50\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h) as intense convection developed near the center.[10] Shortly thereafter, the center became difficult to locate,[11] and late on August 24 the storm moved ashore along the southwestern coast of the Baja California Peninsula.[12] Tropical Storm Julio quickly weakened over land, although it initially maintained strong convection near its center.[13] By early on August 26, however, the low-level and upper-level circulations separated, with the upper-circulation continuing quickly northeastward into mainland Mexico; the low-level circulation slowed as it entered the Gulf of California, after having been separated from its deep convection.[14] Later in the day, the NHC discontinued advisories after the storm failed to maintain enough organized convection to be considered a tropical cyclone.[15] The remnants of Julio were absorbed by a thermal low over the Mojave Desert on August 27."

Officials opened several shelters in the area where the storm struck.[18] As Julio made landfall, it produced lightning and locally heavy rainfall,[18] which left more than a dozen communities isolated due to flooding. The flooding damaged several houses and killed two people.[19][20] Winds were generally light,[18] although strong enough to damage a few electrical poles and small buildings.[21] In nearby Sinaloa, rainfall from the storm led to an emergency evacuation of 500 residents.[20] Moisture from Julio developed thunderstorms across Arizona, including one near Chandler which produced winds of 75\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h); the storm damaged ten small planes at Chandler Municipal Airport, as well as a hangar.[22] The damages at the airport were estimated at $1\u00a0million (USD).[23] The storms also dropped heavy rainfall, reaching over 1\u00a0inch (25\u00a0mm) in Gilbert, which caused flooding on Interstate 17.[22] On August 25, 2008, moisture from the remnants of Julio caused minor flooding in parts of the south-western region of the United States."

It was one of the hottest and longest heat waves in the subcontinent since the two countries began recording weather reports. The highest temperatures occurred in Churu, Rajasthan, reaching up to 50.8\u00a0\u00b0C (123.4\u00a0\u00b0F),[5] a near record high in India, missing the record of 51.0\u00a0\u00b0C (123.8\u00a0\u00b0F) set in 2016 by a fraction of a degree.[6] As of 12\u00a0June\u00a02019,[update] 32 days are classified as parts of the heatwave, making it the second longest ever recorded.[7] As a result of hot temperatures and inadequate preparation, more than 184 people died in the state of Bihar,[8] with many more deaths reported in other parts of the country.[9][10] In Pakistan, five infants died after extreme heat exposure.[11] The heat wave coincided with extreme droughts and water shortages across India and Pakistan. In mid-June, reservoirs that previously supplied Chennai ran dry, depriving millions. The water crisis was exacerbated by high temperatures and lack of preparation, causing protests and fights that sometimes led to killing and stabbing.[12][13][14]"

The Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology has identified several contributing factors, including \"El Ni\u00f1o Modoki\", an irregular El Ni\u00f1o in which the central Pacific Ocean is warmer than the eastern part, and the loss of tree cover, which reduces shade, increasing temperatures, and reduces moisture in soil, which results in less evapotranspiration and more heat transfer into the atmosphere.[19][20] In response to the growing number of deaths from heat waves, the Indian government, although not addressing the root causes, began implementing measures intended to save lives in 2013. In Ahmedabad, for example, \"school days were reduced, government work programs ceased, and free water was distributed in busy areas.\" Public gardens were opened during the daytime so that people could seek shade. Professor of public health Parthasarathi Ganguly estimated that 800 fewer people died in 2014 as a result of these policies.[21] In India, the rainy monsoon season typically begins on 1 June. However, in 2019, the season was delayed by seven days and began on 8 June. When it did occur, the monsoon made slow progress and only brought rains to 10\u201315% of the country by 19 June. Normally, two-thirds of the country would have received monsoon rains by this time. The lack of rainfall has intensified heat wave conditions and increased water scarcity.[22]"

As of 31 May 2019, 8 deaths and 456 cases of illness due to heat were reported in Maharashtra, at least 17 deaths in Telangana, and 3 deaths and 433 cases of heat stroke in Andhra Pradesh.[19] On 10 June 2019, three passengers were found dead on a train as it arrived in Jhansi, apparently due to the extreme heat. A fourth passenger was found in critical condition and brought to a hospital where they died of overheating.[23] In the state of Bihar, heat-related deaths reached 184 on 18 June according to Al Jazeera,[8] while according to Zee News the death toll was 139 on 19 June 2019.[24] High temperatures have broken or nearly broken records in various cities across India and Pakistan. At one point, 11 of the 15 warmest places in the world were all located in the country.[18] On 2 June 2019, the city of Churu recorded a temperature of 50.8\u00a0\u00b0C (123.4\u00a0\u00b0F), only one-fifth of a degree Celsius short of the country's highest-ever temperature, 51\u00a0\u00b0C (124\u00a0\u00b0F) during the 2016 heat wave.[6] On 9 June 2019, Allahabad reached 48.9\u00a0\u00b0C (120.0\u00a0\u00b0F), breaking its previous all-time record.[18] On 3 and 4 June 2019, the temperature in Jacobabad reached 49\u00a0\u00b0C (120\u00a0\u00b0F) making Pakistan's highest-ever temperature.[25] On 10 June 2019, the temperature in Delhi reached 48\u00a0\u00b0C (118\u00a0\u00b0F), a new record high for the city in the month of June.[26][27][28] On the same day, peak power usage in Delhi reached 6,686 MW, breaking all previous records.[7] On 29 June 2019, the temperature in Islamabad and Rawalpindi reached 42\u00a0\u00b0C (108\u00a0\u00b0F).[2] The total number of deaths is unknown. For comparison, the 2003 European heat wave killed an estimated 35,000\u201370,000 people,[29] with temperatures slightly less than in India and Pakistan. In human temperature physiology, core temperatures of 40.0 or 41.5\u00a0\u00b0C (104.0 or 106.7\u00a0\u00b0F) are said to be a fever of type hyperpyrexia, and considered a medical emergency as temperature may lead to problems including permanent brain damage, or death.[30]"

In Chennai, millions of people are without consistent access to water. A lack of rainwater and groundwater has left four of the reservoirs that supply the city completely dry. The inability to meet demand for water has forced businesses like hotels and restaurants to close. Water tankers from areas of Tamil Nadu unaffected by drought have been bringing water into some areas of the city. However, government tankers can take up to a month to appear after requested, so some wealthy residents and business owners have opted to pay for costly private water tankers. The poor who live in slums do not have this option; a family in Chennai's slums may receive as little as 30 litres (7.9 US gallons) of water every day compared to an average American household which uses 1,100 litres (290 US gallons) of water a day.[12] In Coimbatore, at least 550 people were arrested for protesting the city's government for mismanaging the water crisis.[13] Conflicts over access to water have also occurred throughout India. On 7 June, six people were stabbed in Jharkhand during a fight near a water tanker, and one man was killed in a similar fight in Tamil Nadu. In Madhya Pradesh on 5 June, a fight over water led to two men being \"seriously injured\", while in a separate fight a day earlier, a water tanker driver was \"beaten up\".[14] In early June, fifteen monkeys were found dead in a forest in Madhya Pradesh, possibly as a result of the heat wave. Veterinarian Arun Mishra says this may have happened due to a conflict over water with a larger group of 30\u201335 monkeys. Mishra said this was \"rare and strange\" because herbivores do not usually engage in such conflicts.[32]"

However in 2019, the national general election took place and workers who normally issued heat wave warnings were instead performing election duties.[35] In early June, the Indian Meteorological Department issued a severe heat wave warning in Rajasthan and nearby areas such as Delhi.[6] The Ministry of Health advised avoiding the sun between noon and 3 p.m. and not drinking alcohol, tea, or coffee. Meanwhile the NDMA recommended covering the head, cross-ventilating rooms, and sleeping under a slightly wet sheet.[36] Asphalt used for roads expectantly begins to melt at 50\u00a0\u00b0C (122\u00a0\u00b0F); therefore, on 3 June, the government of Churu poured water onto roads in order to cool them and prevent them from melting.[37] In response to fights over water in Madhya Pradesh, the police were deployed to guard water tankers and other sources of water from rioters, beginning 8 June.[14] On 17 June, the government of Gaya, a city in Bihar, imposed Section 144 to be active, which empowers an executive magistrate to prohibit an assembly of more than four persons in an area, and banned construction work and assemblies between 11 a.m. and 4\u00a0p.m.[24] The Pakistan Medical Association urged people to learn about the measures to avoid heat-related deaths.[38]"

It is the only Category\u00a05 Atlantic hurricane ever recorded in November. The cyclone had a path through the Caribbean Sea atypical to most hurricanes developing late in the Atlantic hurricane season. The storm's strong winds, storm surge, and rain devastated an extensive portion of central and eastern Cuba, where the storm was considered the worst natural disaster of the 20th century. Though the effects from the hurricane were concentrated primarily on Cuba, significant effects were also felt in the Cayman Islands and the Bahamas, with lesser effects felt elsewhere. The tropical depression that would later develop into the destructive hurricane was first located east of the Lesser Antilles on October\u00a030, and tracked westward into the Caribbean Sea, reaching tropical storm strength the next day. Moving southwestward towards the southern portion of the Caribbean, the storm reached hurricane strength on November\u00a02 before a period of rapid intensification ensued. On November\u00a06, the tropical cyclone reached its peak intensity as a Category\u00a05 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 175\u00a0mph (280\u00a0km/h). The storm weakened to Category\u00a04 intensity while recurving northeast, moving ashore Cuba's Camag\u00fcey Province on November\u00a09 with winds of 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h). After traversing the island, the storm gradually weakened as it crossed the central Bahamas Islands and near Bermuda. On November\u00a013, the system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and dissipated the next day. As an intensifying hurricane in the southern Caribbean Sea, the storm moved near the Netherlands Antilles and Colombia, causing widespread effects. A prolonged passage of Curacao resulted in the damaging of the harbor fortification. The storm lashed the coast of Colombia with strong winds and torrential rainfall, severely hampering the banana crop in the region and disrupting telecommunications. Several towns, particularly those near the coast, sustained significant infrastructural damage. Marked, albeit localized, damage to banana crops was also reported in Jamaica, where strong winds toppled numerous trees. In open waters, the storm's track brought it across numerous shipping lanes, largely disrupting shipping primarily in the central Caribbean and damaging several ships."

        "content": "The 1932\u00a0Cuba hurricane can be traced back to a tropical depression, first identified at 06:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a030 by ship observations roughly 200\u00a0mi (320\u00a0km) east of Guadeloupe.[3][4] Tracking generally westward, the depression crossed the Lesser Antilles the next day between Dominica and Martinique.[3] Barometric pressures decrease to as much as 1008\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.77\u00a0inHg) in St. Lucia confirmed the presence of a developing tropical cyclone.[1] Shortly after traversing the islands, the disturbance strengthened to tropical storm intensity at 18:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a031.[3] Concurrently as the storm was gradually intensifying, the tropical cyclone began to take an unusual course towards the southwest.[4] On November\u00a02, the storm intensified to hurricane status while north of the Netherlands Antilles.[3] Steadily strengthening, the hurricane reached Category\u00a02 status on November\u00a03.[3] During the day, the storm passed approximately 50\u00a0mi (80\u00a0km) north of Punta Gallinas in Colombia, the northernmost extent of South America.[4] However, at the same time the hurricane curved towards the west, causing the storm to move away from Colombia and Venezuela.[3] During the next few days, the hurricane rapidly intensified, reaching major hurricane status late on November\u00a04. The next day, the hurricane's intensity was analyzed to have been the equivalent of a modern-day Category\u00a05 hurricane while curving northward.[3] Although the storm was analyzed operationally to have peaked as a minimal Category\u00a04 hurricane, reanalysis of the hurricane indicated that the tropical cyclone was much more intense than initially suggested based on observations by the S.S. Phemius, the crew of which visually estimated winds of around 200\u00a0mph (320\u00a0km/h) at the maximum of the storm and measured unusually low pressures.[1] Early on November\u00a06, the hurricane peaked with maximum sustained winds estimated at 175\u00a0mph (280\u00a0km/h).[3] During that time, the S.S. Phemius recorded a minimum barometric pressure of 915\u00a0mbar (hPa; 27.02\u00a0inHg); this measurement was the lowest documented throughout the storm's existence. As this report did not occur within the hurricane's eye, the storm's true minimum pressure may have been much lower.[1] Pacing northward, the hurricane gradually weakened after maximum intensity on November\u00a06 but held its Category\u00a05 strength for 78\u00a0consecutive hours before finally dropping to Category\u00a04 status.[3] Due to a gradual curve towards the northeast, the hurricane tracked near Cayman Brac on November\u00a09;[1] a minimum barometric pressure of 939\u00a0mbar (hPa; 27.73\u00a0inHg) was documented on the island. Only slight weakening occurred before the hurricane made landfall on the Caribbean coast of Cuba's Camag\u00fcey Province at 14:00\u00a0UTC that day. At the time of landfall, the tropical cyclone was estimated to have had a minimum pressure of 918\u00a0mbar (hPa; 27.11\u00a0inHg) and maximum sustained winds of 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h), with these winds extending as far as 40\u00a0mi (65\u00a0km) from the center of the hurricane. The storm traversed Cuba in six hours before emerging into the Atlantic Ocean late on November\u00a09, after which it began to cross the central Bahamian archipelago. At 07:00\u00a0UTC on November\u00a010, the hurricane made a second landfall on Long Island, Bahamas with an intensity equivalent to that of a modern-day Category\u00a03. Continuing to track northeast, the storm moved east of Bermuda two days later.[1] On November\u00a013, the hurricane began to interact with an extratropical cyclone centered over the Canadian Maritimes,[1][4] and later weakened to tropical storm strength.[3] The tropical cyclone later became extratropical itself before it was last noted at 18:00\u00a0UTC on November\u00a014.[3]"

Phemius would later return safely to port in Cuba,[1] reports that the ship had lost its smokestack and the relaying of an SOS message prompted the United Fruit Company liner Tela to search for the initially missing ship, which failed due to poor visibility conditions.[5][7] This was followed by a search operation undertaken by the USS Overton (DD-239) and USS Swan (AM-34).[8] On November\u00a08, the S.S. Phemius was found damaged and later towed to shore by a salvage tug. However, during the same period of time both the steamer Tacira and the freighter San Simeon were disabled after encountering the storm, requiring towing to safety.[9] Several other ships in the immediate area were also hampered by the storm.[10] A novel based on the ordeal of the Phemius and her crew, In Hazard, was later written by Richard Hughes and published in 1938. Some damage was reported in northern South America as the hurricane swept near the coast. In Colombia, rail telecommunications were interrupted near Santa Marta, and banana plantations in the area were believed to have suffered to some extent due to the storm's winds and rain.[5] In Santa Marta itself, several homes were inundated and automotive traffic was hampered by the storm's effects. Docks on Santa Marta's port were also damaged.[11] Heavy rains also washed out some railways and bridges, further disrupting the distribution of banana shipments.[12][13] Elsewhere along the coast, many of Colombia's seaports were damaged by the storm's effects, while inland farms suffered extensive flood damage.[14] Due to sparse reports from the remainder of Colombia,[15] the extent of damage in Barranquilla remains unspecified,[5] with other nearby towns reporting \"heavy\" damage.[15] The village of Sevilla in the municipality of Zona Bananera, Magdalena was almost entirely destroyed.[16] Providencia Island just off of Colombia sustained significant agricultural damage and the loss of 36\u00a0homes.[4] To the northeast in Curacao, the passing hurricane destroyed the island harbor's fortifications.[14] A seawall near the entrance to Sint Anna harbor suffered partial collapse, while a pontoon bridge linking both sides of the harbor was completely destroyed. In nearby Bonaire, a pier succumbed to the driving rain and rough seas.[17] With the hurricane threatening Jamaica, Pan American World Airways cancelled its flights servicing Kingston, Jamaica.[18] In Jamaica, the storm's passage to the west caused intense winds as strong as 71\u00a0mph (114\u00a0km/h) to sweep across the island,[19] destroying over 2\u00a0million trees.[20] Although effects overall were generally minimal, some localized areas on the island experienced as much as a 50%\u00a0loss of banana trees due to the storm.[4] The cost of damage on Jamaica was US$4\u00a0million.[21]"

It was caused by an early end to the 2004 rains, desert locust damage to some pasture lands, high food prices, and chronic poverty. In the affected area, 2.4 million of 3.6 million people are considered highly vulnerable to food insecurity.

Access to food staples became increasingly difficult and severe cases of child malnutrition were reported. The scarcity of water and fodder also adversely affected the health of the cattle, camels, sheep and goats that comprise virtually the only source of food and income for nomadic communities. Competition for limited resources also resulted in some local conflicts. Acute malnutrition rates rose to 13.4 per cent in the southern Niger Maradi and Zinder departments, with 2.5 per cent of this group identified as severely malnourished children under age five, according to UNICEF. The food shortage impacted 3.3 million people \u2014including 800,000 children under age five\u2014 in 3,815 villages.

The visit was seen as an attempt to draw attention to the crisis, and also address accusations that the UN had responded slowly. Donors had given less than half of the US$81 million appealed for by the UN. On January 16, 2006, the UN directed an appeal for US$240 million of food aid for West Africa to feed at least 10 million people affected by the food crisis, with Niger being the worst-affected country.[14]"

They argued that, while chronic malnutrition has been issue for populations of Niger, the media erroneously and deliberately portrayed common local dietary habits as signs of widespread famine to appeal to donors' sympathy. On March 3, 2008 TV2 Norway aired the documentary \"Sultbl\u00f8ffen\" (The Famine Scam) which voiced the view that there was no famine in Niger in 2005\u2013 06, but rather chronic malnutrition no different from the previous years. BBC's Hilary Andersson, UN Emergency Relief Coordinator Jan Egeland as well as international media and aid organizations in general were accused of severely overstating and lying about the food situation in the country by misrepresenting the situation. \nThe sources, among them a Norwegian-Swedish foundation of agricultural development and their local assistants, gave a version picturing western media and relief agencies as ignorant towards local agriculture and flora and common dietary habits. They cited so-called \"food-racism\": the perception that local, traditional food and food plants are useless and poisonous, even though locals have eaten them for millennia. They also denounced the perception that the people of Niger are incapable of living without support from the west, and argued that large food donations overwhelmed the local supply, making it harder for local agriculture to compete.[15]\nThe film was awarded 3rd prize in the Monte Carlo TV festival of 2008, and won Den Store Journalistprisen in Norway in 2009. The BBC claimed to have refuted TV2's allegations unequivocally,[16] and attempted to block the international release of the documentary by withdrawing TV2's license to news footage from the summer of 2005.[17]"

It developed on October\u00a020 from an area of low pressure that had stalled in the Caribbean Sea. The system moved to the southeast before turning to the west. The storm slowly organized, and the system intensified into a tropical storm. Initially, Richard only intensified slowly in an area of weak steering currents. However, by October\u00a023, wind shear diminished, and the storm intensified faster as it headed toward Belize. The next day, Richard intensified into hurricane status, and further into its peak intensity as a Category\u00a02 hurricane, reaching maximum winds of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h). The hurricane made its only landfall on Belize at peak intensity. Over land, Richard quickly weakened, and later degenerated into a remnant low on October\u00a025. Richard caused an estimated $80\u00a0million (2010 USD) in damages in its path. In Honduras, damage was mostly limited to power outages and landslides. In Belize, most of the damage was attributed to damage to crops. Power outages were also widespread across the country; two fatalities occurred there as well."

        "header": "Meteorological history",
        "content": "The origins of Hurricane Richard can be traced back to a tropical wave that moved off the African coast on October\u00a04 and moved westward, stalling over Venezuela on October\u00a013.[1] Over the next 3 days, it drifted into the extreme southwestern Caribbean Sea, and soon developed an area of low pressure, until it stalled just north of Panama. On October\u00a016, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began to monitor that area of disturbed weather in association with a weak trough of low pressure over the southwestern Caribbean Sea, which persisted across the region as Hurricane Paula dissipated over Cuba on the same day.[2] By October\u00a017, the easterly and northerly trade winds flowed into the low, producing a disorganized area of convection, or thunderstorms across the region.[3] For several days the system moved generally west-northwestward toward Central America. Convection increased over the low on October\u00a018, and the National Hurricane Center noted the possibility of further organization due to favorable environmental conditions.[4] Later that day, it passed near the eastern coast of Nicaragua.[5] The storm became more organized as it turned to a north-northwest drift in the northwestern Caribbean Sea.[6] The Hurricane Hunters investigated the system on October\u00a019 and indicated the development of a low-level circulation. As such, the NHC noted that the storm was very close to tropical depression strength.[7] The next day, after the system turned to the east, strong upper-level wind shear impeded its further development, but such conditions were expected to abate.[8] Early on October\u00a021, the convection had organized and increased near the center of circulation despite still being in an area of moderate wind shear. Due to the organization, the NHC classified it as Tropical Depression Nineteen about 125 miles (201\u00a0km) south of Grand Cayman. At the time, the depression was drifting eastward, located near the base of a mid-level trough and toward the west of a subtropical ridge.[9] In the hours after its formation, the center remained located along the western portion of a cyclonically curved rainband as the convection increased.[10] The wind shear decreased, and despite the presence of dry air to its northwest, the depression intensified to Tropical Storm Richard by 1500\u00a0UTC on October\u00a021, based on confirmation from the Hurricane Hunters.[11] However post\u2013operational analysis revealed that the depression became a tropical storm slightly earlier, at 1200\u00a0UTC.[12] Upon intensifying to tropical storm status, Richard was moving southeastward, still in an area of weak steering currents and in the midst of undergoing a loop in its track. Two hurricane models predicted for the storm to intensify to major hurricane status over the western Caribbean. The official forecast was for the storm to make landfall on Belize with winds of 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h).[11] As Richard continued generally southward early on October\u00a022, its convection became ragged and linear, preventing any initial strengthening.[13] Additionally, the circulation became elongated as the thunderstorms deteriorated,[14] due to the continued presence of dry air and wind shear.[15] After turning westward, Richard moved parallel just offshore the Honduras coast, and its circulation became difficult to locate on satellite imagery.[16] On October\u00a023, Tropical Storm Richard began strengthening again, after the shear diminished and the storm took advantage of the warm waters of the western Caribbean.[17] Later that day, a mid-level eye feature became evident on satellite imagery.[18] Additionally, the outflow gradually improved and became more symmetrical throughout the circulation.[19] On October\u00a024, Hurricane Hunters indicated that Richard attained hurricane status, based on surface winds of 85\u00a0mph (137\u00a0km/h). In addition, radar from Belize at the time indicated a nearly-closed eyewall.[20] The hurricane continued intensifying to peak winds of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h), and the minimum central pressure dropped to 977 millibars (28.9\u00a0inHg), making it a Category 2\u00a0hurricane, despite the fact that it was operationally classified as a Category\u00a01\u00a0hurricane with winds of 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) and a pressure of 981 millibars (29.0\u00a0inHg).[21] At around 0045\u00a0UTC on October\u00a025, Hurricane Richard made landfall about 20 miles (32\u00a0km)/h) south-southeast of Belize City, Belize at peak intensity,[22] and just after moving ashore, the eye briefly became better defined.[23] Within a few hours however, the inner core lost definition as the eye dissipated.[24] The winds rapidly diminished, and Richard weakened to tropical depression status after crossing into northern Guatemala. By then, there was little deep convection remaining,[25] and after emerging into the Bay of Campeche Richard degenerated into a remnant low on October\u00a026, but then turned back east as the system was forced to because of the strong wind shear. After the storm reached the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, the system began turning north until it reached the Gulf of Mexico. The remnants of Hurricane Richard continued to move north over the Gulf of Mexico as it weakened, until the system dissipated completely, late on October\u00a027.[26]"

Some power outages occurring in areas resulted from the fallen power lines. In addition, mudslides triggered by rainfall cut off an estimated 15,000\u00a0people in 40\u00a0small towns.[32][33] Four coastal Honduran provinces were declared areas of maximum alert by the government after the storm.

Only three hours after the replacement of the tropical storm watch to warning, Richard was nearing hurricane status,[29] and the tropical storm warning in place on the east coast of Belize upgraded to a hurricane warning.[36] The hurricane warning associated with Hurricane Richard remained in place for the east coast of Belize as landfall was occurring,[37] since the storm made landfall to the south-southeast of Belize City.[22] Prior to the storm's landfall, an estimated 10,000\u00a0people took refuge in storm shelters and churches.[38] Throughout Belize, Hurricane Richard damaged thousands of homes and leaving many without power. The Belize Zoo and Tropical Education Center, a major attraction for ecotourists and Belizeans, was in the path and heavily damaged forcing it to close to remove debris and repair their animal exhibits.[39]  Overall damage was BZ$33.8\u00a0million ($17.4\u00a0million 2010\u00a0USD), most of which from crop damage, especially to citrus fruits. The entire grapefruit harvest was lost, an estimated 25% of orange crops were lost, and several large trees were downed.

The season had three tropical storms and three hurricanes, none of which became major hurricanes.[nb 1] However, in the absence of modern satellite and other remote-sensing technologies, only storms that affected populated land areas or encountered ships at sea were recorded, so the actual total could be higher. An undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 has been estimated.[2] Jose Fernandez-Partagas and Henry Diaz initially documented five tropical cyclones in a 1995 report on this season. A sixth system was added by Michael Chenoweth in 2003 from records taken in Col\u00f3n, Panama. The first tropical cyclone was observed as a tropical storm offshore the East Coast of the United States from June\u00a015 to June\u00a017. The second and third systems were active in mid-August and mid-September, respectively, and both attained Category 2 intensity at their peaks on the modern-day Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale and neither made landfall. A fourth tropical cyclone caused flooding in Saint Lucia and brought heavy rain to parts of Barbados on October\u00a05, but its track prior to that date is unknown.

It formed on June\u00a026 from a tropical wave to the south of Mexico. It quickly strengthened as it approached the coast, and early on June\u00a027 Carlos moved ashore in Oaxaca with winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h). The storm rapidly deteriorated to a remnant low, which persisted until dissipating on June\u00a029. Carlos brought heavy rainfall to portions of southern Mexico, peaking at 337\u00a0mm (13.3\u00a0in) in two locations in Guerrero. Throughout its path, the storm damaged about 30,000\u00a0houses, with a monetary damage total of 86.7\u00a0million pesos (2003\u00a0MXN, $8\u00a0million 2003\u00a0USD). At least nine people were killed throughout the country, seven due to mudslides and two from river flooding; there was also a report of two missing fishermen."

        "content": "The origins of Carlos were from a tropical wave that exited the west coast of Africa on June\u00a014. The wave moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, with little evidence of its existence on satellite imagery. By June\u00a020 it crossed Central America into the eastern Pacific Ocean, later spawning an area of convection, or thunderstorms, south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec.[1] The National Hurricane Center (NHC) first mentioned the system in its tropical weather outlook on June\u00a024, by which time a low pressure center developed.[2][3] Gradually, the system continued to develop due to light wind shear, with rainbands and convection located near the broad center.[4][5] By early on June\u00a026, the disturbance had organized enough for the NHC to initiate advisories on Tropical Depression Three-E, about 130 miles (210\u00a0km) south-southwest of Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca.[6] Upon first being classified as a tropical cyclone, the depression had a slightly elongated circulation. An anticyclone to its north was forecast to track westward, which would allow the depression to track west-northwestward and remain offshore; however, the NHC noted uncertainty in its motion.[6] The cloud pattern gradually organized, with warm water temperatures and lessening wind shear.[7] At 1200\u00a0UTC on June\u00a026, it is estimated the depression attained tropical storm status; upon doing so, the NHC named the storm Carlos.[1] As it reached tropical storm intensity, Carlos began an erratic northward track toward the Mexican coast, under the influence of a trough.[8] It quickly strengthened, developing a well-defined eye feature in the center of the convection. Based on the eye, it is estimated Carlos made landfall early on June\u00a027 with peak winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h), about 60 miles (97\u00a0km) west of Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca, or about 150 miles (240\u00a0km)/h) east-southeast of Acapulco, Guerrero.[1] As Carlos moved inland, it turned to the northwest in response to the anticyclone over Mexico, and it quickly weakened to tropical depression status.[1] By 12\u00a0hours after landfall, there was little evidence of a circulation on satellite imagery.[9] Late on June\u00a027, Carlos degenerated into a non-convective remnant low pressure area near Acapulco. The circulation turned to the southwest and emerged into the Pacific Ocean; by 0000\u00a0UTC on June\u00a029, the system dissipated completely.[1]"

On the day when Carlos made landfall, it dropped heavy rainfall, with 24\u2011hour statewide maxima of 254\u00a0mm (10.0\u00a0in) in R\u00edo Verde, Oaxaca, and 112\u00a0mm (4.4\u00a0in) in Petatl\u00e1n, Guerrero.[12] Throughout the country, rainfall peaked at 337\u00a0mm (13.3\u00a0in) in both Marquelia and Azoy\u00fa in Guerrero.[13] Tropical Storm Carlos affected 79\u00a0municipalities in Oaxaca with flooding or rainfall, and much of the region was declared a disaster area; as a result, disaster funds were opened.[14] Across the region, the combination of rainfall and strong winds downed power lines, disrupted phone service, and flooded two major highways;[15] additionally, the storm left widespread damage to other roads and airstrips.[16] In northwestern Oaxaca, seven people were killed when the heavy rainfall triggered a mudslide. Mudslides were reported elsewhere in the state, and about 30,000\u00a0homes were damaged.[17] In one town, the flooding forced 150\u00a0families to evacuate to shelters.[16] In Guerrero, a flooded river killed two people.[15] Four fishermen were reported missing, possibly swept out to sea due to the storm;[15] the Mexican army searched offshore for several days, rescuing two of the four fishermen by four days after the storm.[17] Overall, the storm affected about 148,000\u00a0people, 10\u00a0ha (25 acres) of crops were destroyed, and monetary damage totaled 86.7\u00a0million pesos (2003\u00a0MXN, $8\u00a0million 2003\u00a0USD), a third of which was property.[18]"

It formed from a tropical wave which interacted with a large trough of low pressure to form Fern, as well as Hurricane Ginger, Tropical Storm Heidi, and a system later designated as Tropical Depression Sixteen,[1] which moved into South Carolina. Fern crossed southeastern Louisiana as a tropical depression on September 4 before swinging back out over the Gulf of Mexico. Fern reached hurricane status on September 8, reaching a peak intensity of 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) before making landfall near Freeport, Texas, two days later. Fern's path was erratic, as it made  three sharp turns during its duration, making it difficult for forecasters to track.[1]\nThe second Atlantic tropical cyclone to make U.S. landfall that year, Fern produced heavy rainfall across Louisiana and Texas, causing flash flooding that left 2 indirect fatalities and damage totaling over $30\u00a0million (1971\u00a0USD$, 219\u00a0million 2024\u00a0USD)."

Still moving northwestward, the tropical depression made landfall in southeastern Louisiana on September 4. A building high pressure system over the Central United States forced the tropical depression to move southwest over the Gulf of Mexico. The warm waters then caused the depression to reach tropical storm strength and the storm was given the name Fern by the National Hurricane Center on September 7.[1] The following day, Fern reached hurricane status as it neared the Texas coastline. The hurricane reached a peak intensity of 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) and its barometric pressure dropped to 979 millibars. An incoming mid-latitude trough caused Fern to stall east of Texas for twelve hours. After the trough moved by, Fern turned southwest, paralleling the Texas coastline before making landfall on September 10 between Freeport and Matagorda.[1][2] At landfall, Fern had weakened to a strong tropical storm as it moved further inland. Because the center of Fern was elongated, it was still able to receive moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and as a result, weakening was slow. Between September 10 and September 11, Fern bypassed Corpus Christi, Texas, before dissipating as a tropical depression after crossing the Rio Grande into northern Mexico.[1][2]"

In addition, small boats were warned to stay in port and residents were advised to be aware of storm conditions brought by Fern. The next day, the hurricane watches were changed to warnings, forcing residents living on the Texas coast to board up and evacuate. In preparation for the storm's impact, Civil Defense workers and the American Red Cross were put on alert.[4][5] In Galveston, eight emergency shelters were planned to open but five were closed when officials learned that they were not needed as most residents chose to ride out the storm in their homes. When Fern moved inland, the National Weather Service issued 21 tornado warnings and numerous flood warnings.[6] In North Beach, city buses were used to transport evacuees inland and local officials were concerned about what to do with the relief trailers used to house survivors of Hurricane Celia a year earlier.[7]"

Central and Northern Florida received 1 to 3 inches (25 to 76\u00a0mm) of rain. In Louisiana, after making landfall as a tropical depression, Fern produced rainfall up to 10 inches (250\u00a0mm) across the southeastern part of the state, including up to 7 inches (180\u00a0mm) in New Orleans. The outer bands of the tropical depression brought 3 to 5 inches (76 to 127\u00a0mm) of rain across the coastal sections of Mississippi and Alabama. There were no reports of damage or fatalities in either Florida or the eastern U.S. Gulf Coast.[1][8] As Fern made its final landfall, a weather station in Port O'Connor, Texas recorded a sustained wind speed of 86 miles per hour (138\u00a0km/h). In Corpus Christi, winds up to 66 miles per hour (106\u00a0km/h) were reported.  In coastal Texas, storm tides of 5 to 6 feet (1.5 to 1.8\u00a0m) above normal were reported from Galveston to Freeport.  One spotter reported seeing a flock of swallows in the eye of the storm during landfall.  Heavy rainfall from the hurricane fell across eastern and central Texas.  A total of 10 to 26 inches (250 to 660\u00a0mm) of rain was measured in a stripe from Bee to San Patricio County. Other locations in Texas reported rainfall of 10 to 15 inches (250 to 380\u00a0mm), while areas from Galveston to Rockport received 5 to 12 inches (130 to 300\u00a0mm)  of rain. The heavy rainfall caused severe flash flooding that isolated numerous small towns in eastern and central Texas. An outbreak of five tornadoes was reported during Fern's landfall, two of which caused minor tree and roof damage in Texas City. In addition, lightning from the hurricane caused six reported house fires on Galveston Island while 7,500\u00a0homes and business were damaged (mainly by flooding) near Corpus Christi. Two indirect fatalities were reported, both from drowning incidents, while on Mustang Island, the hurricane caused four Cuban fishing boats to run aground. In all, the storm left $30.2\u00a0million (1971 USD, $220\u00a0million 2024\u00a0USD) in damage and two deaths.[1][6][7]"

After rapidly intensifying before its landfall in Sinaloa, Naomi caused rainfall throughout northern Mexico and the U.S. state of Texas in association with a frontal system, with the highest measurement occurring in Corpus Christi. Four people perished in Mexico due to Naomi's effects with ten more missing, all in Sinaloa. The only reported injury in Texas due to the remnants was a factory worker who was injured when the roof of the plant they were working in collapsed due to rainfall. Naomi was the seventeenth tropical depression, fourteenth tropical storm and the fourth hurricane of the 1968 Pacific hurricane season. Its precipitation on the Mexican Altiplano briefly threatened the unfinished L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas dam on the Nazas River. If the dam failed,  the twin cities of G\u00f3mez Palacio, Durango, and Torre\u00f3n, Coahuila, would have been inundated. On the other hand, releasing water from the dam would have saved Torre\u00f3n by submerging G\u00f3mez Palacio with the dam's runoff.

On September 9, six more ships reported winds of 35\u00a0mph (56\u00a0km/h) from the system, which was at 13\u00b0N, 101\u00b0W at the time,[1] and the system was given depression status on the same day.[2] Later that day, satellite pictures clearly showed the vortex and center of the developing cyclone, and on September 10, the first report of tropical storm force winds were reported south of the low by the ship Builder, which showed winds of 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h). The depression continued to develop at a rapid pace, with large feeder bands which helped to absorb moisture to strengthen the cyclone extending from the center, which was becoming better defined. One of the feeder bands developed near Manzanillo, Colima, which reported winds of 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h) from the band prior to daybreak. Towards the end of the day, the Allison Lykes reported 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) winds from the cyclone and, early on September 11, sufficient evidence that the depression had reached tropical storm status resulted in the cyclone being upgraded and named \"Naomi\".[1] For the next twelve\u00a0hours, Naomi continued to rapidly intensify, with feeder bands flowing into a tightening spiral structure in the center of the storm. Ship reports around this time showed winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) to 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h). Towards midnight, a computerized mosaic showed a clear eye and Naomi was upgraded to hurricane strength early on September 12 while at 19.8\u00b0N, 106.8\u00b0W based on the mosaic, an intensity that was verified by the Meisei Maru, which reported winds of 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h) at 6:00\u00a0Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). After being upgraded, the hurricane moved to the north at a pace of 9\u00a0mph (14\u00a0km/h) before making a slow northeastward turn. The turn had the hurricane passing 30\u00a0mi (48\u00a0km) \u2013 40\u00a0mi (64\u00a0km) west of Mazatl\u00e1n, Sinaloa. The hurricane then began to accelerate, landfalling on Sinaloa near Punta Piaxtla at 3:00\u00a0GMT on September 13.[1] Shortly after landfall, the Sierra Madre Occidental took a toll on the hurricane, causing it to dissipate later that day[2] while midway between Chihuahua, Chih., and Piedras Negras, Coah.,[3] with the remnants moving over Texas.[4] In total, the hurricane travelled 1,100\u00a0mi (1,800\u00a0km) while active.[5]"

The Associated Press dispatch also reported that Naomi was responsible for knocking out communications over a large area in Mazatl\u00e1n as well as downing power lines and damaging houses.[1] At least 2000 people were reported homeless in Durango due to the hurricane.[6] The hurricane also caused damage to Highway 15 between Mazatl\u00e1n and Tepic. Although the highway reopened soon afterward, some areas that were struck by the hurricane were still rough.[7] Naomi's most notable impact in Mexico involved the L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas Dam on the Nazas River, which was not complete by the time the hurricane hit.[8] The dam, upriver from G\u00f3mez Palacio and Torre\u00f3n, was feared to break down from the water being built up behind it, influenced by the hurricane.[8] The two options were to either open the dam, saving Torre\u00f3n by inundating G\u00f3mez Palacio,[9] or risk inundating both towns by keeping the dam closed. The decision was made harder by the fact that, if the dam was released and no rain fell to refill the basin behind the dam, the farms would have insufficient water for agricultural growth.[9] Photography from the Environmental Science Services Administration's Automatic Picture Transmission based on the ESSA-6 weather satellite showed that the clouds from Naomi responsible for the rain had almost moved over the area near the dam. Based on the images, the authorities decided to gamble on the dam to successfully hold up, and it managed to hold back the waters without breaking.[8] The hurricane caused four drowning deaths and $16 million in damage in Sinaloa.[10]"

At the time, the storm was moving towards the west at 14\u00a0mph (23\u00a0km/h).[2] At the time, Inga was a very small tropical cyclone; gale-force winds extended less than 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km) from the center.[3] However, by September 23, the storm had become disorganized and sprawling.[4] Later that day, Inga weakened back into a tropical depression.[1] The depression continued west-northwestward, passing north of the Leeward Islands, before drifting northwestward. It once again attained tropical storm status on September 28,[1] while situated well to the east of the Bahamas.[5] Inga continued to intensify, and achieved hurricane status at 0000 UTC on September 30, at which point it turned northeastward.[1] The storm then abruptly, yet gradually, turned towards the south, and ultimately completed a counter-clockwise loop as it bent back westward.[1] Steering currents were weak, and the hurricane continued to proceed slowly.[6] Late on October 3, it turned to the northwest, still as a Category 1 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale.[7] The storm then curved northeastward and intensified to Category 2 status at 0000 UTC on October 5.[1] Inga accelerated somewhat as it passed to the southeast of Bermuda. By the morning hours of October 5, it was determined that the hurricane posed no significant threat to the island.[8] At 1200 UTC, the storm's lowest known barometric pressure of 964 millibars was recorded. Shortly thereafter, it briefly strengthened to Category 3 status; the cyclone peaked with maximum sustained winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h). As it moved towards the open waters of the Atlantic and entered a cooler environment,[9] it deteriorated to Category 1 intensity on October 6.[1] The hurricane slowed again, and as cold air became entrained into its circulation, it began to lose tropical characteristics.[10] However, Inga once again intensified and reattained Category 2 intensity on October 7. At this point, the hurricane was drifting generally eastward. However, in time the storm turned towards the south and began to weaken.[1] Operationally, the storm was believed to have downgraded to a tropical storm on October 8 and regained hurricane status thereafter,[11][12] but instead it likely maintained Category 1 intensity steadily until October 10. After the storm finally degenerated into a tropical storm, it curved southwestward.[1] The storm's center became ill-defined and elongated at the storm continued to lose strength.[13] Heading westward, Inga was downgraded to a tropical depression[14] before dissipating fully on October 15,[1] about 290\u00a0mi (470\u00a0km) from where it initially attained hurricane status.[15]"

The damage caused by the Meadow Fire was severe. The high-intensity wildfire burned very hot and, in some areas, the large fir and lodgepole pines were reduced to charcoal stalagmites.[5] The forest floor was slow to recover because of the lack of moisture during the California drought. During the summer of 2015, greenery was scarce and the forest floor was still covered in a thick layer of ash.[6] However, scientists predict that the coniferous forest will regenerate after a few years despite the drought.[7] The Little Yosemite Valley backpacker's campsite is not within the Meadow Fire's burn scar."

One body, that of two-year-old Lydia Sutthithepa, was never recovered.[32] Over 150 people were hospitalized with various injuries, including four in critical condition.[6] The mudflows destroyed over 100 homes and damaged an additional 300.[33] Writer T.C. Boyle, whose home was proximate to both the fire and mudslides, documented the collective trauma in The New Yorker magazine.[34] Cleanup efforts began a week after the initial mudflows, with debris being sent to the Ventura County Fairgrounds for sorting and the Calabasas Landfill for disposal.[35][36]"

The system was disorganized, with convection being located to the east of a broad and elongated low-level circulation. It was located in favorable conditions for development and sea surface temperatures in the area ranged from 29\u201330\u00a0\u00b0C (84\u201386\u00a0\u00b0F), though the JTWC assessed its development potential in the next day as low.[2] The system's low-level circulation began consolidating, and on June 2 at 00:30 UTC, the JTWC upgraded its development potential in the next day to medium.[3] On June 3 at 18:00 UTC, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) assessed that a tropical depression had formed over the Philippine Sea.[4][a] On the next day at 03:00 UTC, the PAGASA gave the depression the local name Domeng as it was located 675 kilometres (420\u00a0mi) east of Guiuan.[6] The depression absorbed an invest as convection covered the low-level circulation, and on 14:00 UTC the same day, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert as it was located approximately 225 nautical miles (415\u00a0km; 260\u00a0mi) northwest of Palau.[7] The depression began to exhibit signs of anticyclonic outflow as it was steered northward by a mid-level subtropical high-pressure area,[8] and on June 7 at 12:00 UTC, the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical depression, assigning it the designation 06W.[9] 6 hours later at 18:00 UTC, both the JMA and the JTWC upgraded the depression to a tropical storm, with the JMA giving it the name Maliksi;[4][9] the system's circulation remained broad.[10] Maliksi passed by the western edge of the high-pressure area and turned northeast,[11] and on June 9 at 06:00 UTC, the JMA upgraded it to a severe tropical storm.[4] At 21:00 UTC, Maliksi exited the PAR, with the PAGASA issuing its final warning on the system.[12] On June 10 at 00:00 UTC, Maliksi peaked in intensity, with maximum sustained winds of 110\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 970\u00a0hPa (29\u00a0inHg) as it was located southeast of Okinawa.[4][b] The JTWC assessed Maliksi to have peaked at the same time, also estimating the same windspeed in the 1-minute sustained standard.[9][c] Maliksi began slowly accelerating to the northeast, developing a ragged eye as it became exposed to strong westerlies.[14] After reaching peak intensity, convection around the center began to decrease,[15] with the low-level circulation beginning to elongate.[16] Maliksi began extratropical transition as it was located over an unfavorable environment,[17] and on June 11 at 18:00 UTC, the JMA assessed that Maliksi completed its transition into an extratropical cyclone,[4] with its low-level circulation being displaced from its upper-level circulation;[18] the JTWC estimated extratropical transition began 6 hours earlier.[9] Maliksi's remnants dissipated east of Honshu on June 13.[4]"

It burned approximately 281,893 acres (440\u00a0sq\u00a0mi; 114,078\u00a0ha) before being fully contained on January 12, 2018, making it the largest wildfire in modern California history at the time. It was surpassed by the Ranch Fire, part of the Mendocino Complex, in August 2018.[1][9][16][17][18][a] The fire is currently the eighth-largest wildfire in modern California history, as of 2024. The fire was officially declared out on June 1, 2018, after more than two months in which no hotspots were detected.[19] The Thomas Fire destroyed at least 1,063 structures, while damaging 280 others;[1][2][20][9] and the fire caused over $2.2 billion (2018 USD) in damages,[10][13][11] including $230 million in suppression costs,[11][12] becoming the seventh-most destructive wildfire in state history at the time.[21][22] As of August 2020, the Thomas Fire is California's tenth-most destructive wildfire.[21] Ventura's agriculture industry suffered at least $171 million in losses due to the Thomas Fire.[13] By January 2, 2018, the Thomas Fire had cost over $204 million to fight,[11] and had forced over 104,607 residents to evacuate.[23][24][25][26] At its height, the Thomas Fire saw over 8,500 firefighters mobilized to fight it, which is the largest mobilization of firefighters for combating any wildfire in California history.[27][needs update] The fire began on December 4, north of Santa Paula, near Steckel Park[28] and south of Thomas Aquinas College from which the fire was named. Fast-moving, it quickly reached the city of Ventura, where over five hundred residences were destroyed that night.[29] The fire destroyed almost as many residences in several rural communities amidst the rugged mountain terrain of Ventura County. The fire threatened the Ojai Valley, and on December 13, the fire completely surrounded the area, including Lake Casitas.[30][31] The fire began burning through the rugged Santa Ynez Mountains as it threatened several small communities along the Rincon Coast north of Ventura, expanded into the Los Padres National Forest, and reached Santa Barbara County. Firefighters concentrated on protecting the communities of Carpinteria and Montecito in the southern portion of the county as the fire burned in the foothills of the Santa Ynez Mountains where access was difficult.[32] The unusually strong and persistent Santa Ana winds were the largest factor in the spread of the fire.[33] Much of Southern California experienced \"the strongest and longest duration Santa Ana wind event we have seen so far this season\", according to the National Weather Service.[24] The region experienced an on-and-off Santa Ana wind event for a little over two weeks, which contributed to the Thomas Fire's persistent growths in size.[34] At its height, the wildfire was powerful enough to generate its own weather, qualifying it as a firestorm.[35] There were periods of time when the fire was advancing at a rate of an acre (0.4 ha) per second.[36] The winds also dried out the air, resulting in extremely low humidity.[33] The area, along with most of Southern California, experienced the driest March-through-December period on record.[37] While November is the typical beginning of the rainy season in California, the first measurable rain for the area fell on January 8, 2018, more than a month into the fire. With the natural vegetation burnt, flash floods and mudflows damaged homes in Montecito when the rains arrived.[38] Evacuations were ordered or anticipated for neighborhoods that sit below areas recently burned by the Thomas Fire and other wildfires.[39] By January 10, at least 21 people had been killed by the sudden flooding and debris flows that followed the heavy rains, which also destroyed over 100 homes.[40][5]"

        "content": "On December 4, 2017, the fire was first reported by a nearby resident at 6:26\u00a0p.m. PST,[41] to the north of Santa Paula, near Steckel Park and Thomas Aquinas College,[1][29][42] after which the fire is named.[43] That night, the small brush fire exploded in size and raced through the rugged mountain terrain that lies west of Santa Paula, between Ventura and Ojai.[24][44] Officials blamed strong Santa Ana winds that gusted up to 60 miles per hour (97\u00a0km/h) for the sudden expansion.[33][45] Soon after the fire had started, a second blaze was ignited nearly 30 minutes later, about 4 miles (6.4\u00a0km) to the north in Upper Ojai at the top of Koenigstein Road.[46] According to eyewitnesses, this second fire was sparked by an explosion in the power line over the area. The second fire was rapidly expanded by the strong Santa Ana winds, and soon merged into the Thomas Fire later that night.[46] According to statements released by investigators on March 13, 2019, Southern California Edison was responsible for both ignitions.[14] Late on the night of December 4, the Thomas Fire reached the hillside neighborhoods of Clearpoint,[47] Ondulando,[48] and Skyline[49] in the city of Ventura and destroyed many single-family detached homes.[50] Many people fled with little or no warning when evacuation orders were issued, as the fire had traveled 12 miles (19\u00a0km) in just a few hours.[51] Tuesday morning, on December 5, saw 1,000 firefighters battling the blaze, with no containment of the fire. At 7 a.m. PST, one helicopter began dropping water, while fixed-wing aircraft waited to be deployed after the winds died down.[6] The firefighters tried to save Ventura homes in the midst of a red-flag wind advisory with ridgeline winds of 35 to 45 miles per hour (56 to 72\u00a0km/h) and gusts up to 70 miles per hour (110\u00a0km/h).[6] The fire continued jumping across the valleys along the steep slopes of the foothills that abut the northern portion of the city. As the fire traveled along the interface between the foothill rangeland and the area developed with homes, it reached the hills above downtown where several apartment buildings and other homes above downtown Ventura were damaged or completely destroyed.[6] The fire burned over Grant Park above City Hall, and burned along the ridge above the western portion of the city, which stretches north along the narrow Ventura River valley, and is characterized by steeply-sloped sides. The fire continued moving north up the valley throughout the day. The entire community of Casitas Springs, which lies northwest of Ventura, had a mandatory evacuation issued as the fire approached.[24] The fire reached Black Mountain[52] overlooking Ojai. The entire Ojai Valley was given mandatory or voluntary evacuation orders. The Ojai pumping system was damaged by the fire and the entire water system stopped working for a time so water was not available from the hydrants for use by the firefighters.[53] The western flank of the fire jumped over Highway 33 and burned through the Taylor Ranch oil fields[54] on the other side of the valley. The fast-moving, wind-driven wildfire continued past the area that had burned in the 2015 Christmas Day Solimar Fire, before crossing the 101 Freeway to the Solimar Beach area, on Pacific Coast Highway, along the Pacific Ocean. The fire continued its northwesterly march along the Rincon Coast to Rincon Point, at the Santa Barbara County/Ventura County line.[24] On Tuesday, December 5, additional National Guard helicopters were brought in to fight the six largest wildfires burning in Southern California. Officials said they also obtained \"every last plane we could find in the nation.\" C-130 airplanes were obtained from the U.S. military, and more than 290 fire engines came from Montana, Utah, New Mexico, Idaho, Arizona, Oregon, and Nevada.[55] On December 7, the Thomas Fire grew further to 115,000 acres (46,539\u00a0ha), with containment of the fire at 5%.[1][36] On December 8, the Thomas Fire grew to 143,000 acres (58,000\u00a0ha) with containment of the wildfire increasing to 10%, after the Santa Ana winds died down.[56][57] On December 9, as the Santa Ana winds returned, the Thomas Fire expanded to 155,000 acres (63,000\u00a0ha), while containment of the fire increased to 15%. By the afternoon of the same day, the fire entered Santa Barbara County near Divide Peak.[58][59][60][61] Early on December 10, the Thomas fire expanded to 173,000 acres (70,000\u00a0ha), but containment of the blaze stayed the same as the previous date, at 15% total containment. The evacuation orders were expanded further north into Santa Barbara County into the communities of Carpinteria and Montecito.[62][63] Only the southern and southeastern flanks of the wildfire had been contained.[62] However, by the evening of the same day, the powerful Santa Ana winds had caused the Thomas Fire to undergo another period of explosive growth, expanding to 230,000 acres (93,000\u00a0ha) in size, with containment dropping to 10% overall, indicating no new progress in fire containment.[64][65] Another firefighter was injured, when he fractured his leg, and he returned home to recover.[7] On the same day, fire analysts stated that the Thomas Fire had been generating its own weather for the past two days, a behavior only observed in very massive wildfires and indicative of a firestorm.[35] The Thomas Fire was generating massive pyrocumulus clouds, which were gathering heat from the flames below, although the unstable column of air could collapse at any time, which would generate sudden wind shifts near the fire and pose a major hazard to firefighters. This behavior had been previously observed during the massive 2009 Station Fire in Los Angeles and 2020 Apple Fire in Banning.[35] At this point, the Thomas Fire had become the fifth-largest wildfire in modern California history[25] and the largest wildfire recorded in California in December.[66] The Thomas Fire was also estimated to be at least the 10th most destructive wildfire on record in California.[22] On the morning of December 11, the Thomas Fire had grown to 230,500 acres (93,300\u00a0ha), while containment of the fire had increased to 15%.[41] After this expansion in size, the Thomas Fire's northwestern flank almost linked up with its southwestern flank, to the east of Carpinteria, cutting across parts of Route 150, and threatening to envelop Ojai and Lake Casitas.[67][30][68] By this time, the Thomas Fire had grossly surpassed the size of the previous largest fire in December, which was extremely unusual.[66] Fire officials noted that many areas had been \"Moonscaped\", an event in which the brush has been so completely burned that it was left looking like a barren and blackened landscape, resembling the surface of the Moon, which is indicative of extreme fire behavior.[7] During the evening of December 11, the Thomas Fire expanded further to 231,700 acres (93,800\u00a0ha), while firefighters increased containment of the fire to 20%.[69] On December 13, the Thomas Fire's expansion slowed on its west flank, as it reached the burn area of the 240,000-acre Zaca Fire (97,000\u00a0ha) from 2007. However, the Thomas Fire's northwestern and southwestern flanks merged on the western shore of Lake Casitas, completely encircling the lake and the Ojai area.[31][70] Firefighters have expected the fire's growth to be disrupted if it reaches the burn scars of other previous fires to the west within the last 10 years: the Tea, Jesusita, Gap, and Rey Fires.[8] On December 14, the Thomas Fire expanded further to 242,500 acres (98,100\u00a0ha), surpassing the Zaca Fire to become the fourth-largest wildfire in modern California history. Later on the same day, the Thomas Fire expanded further to 249,500 acres (101,000\u00a0ha). On the same day, a Cal Fire Engineer (Cory David Iverson) died, while working northwest of Fillmore, on a flareup near the eastern flank of the fire.[3] On the morning of December 15, containment lines in the Santa Barbara and Montecito areas and protecting nearby homes was the priority, in addition to the threatened Carpinteria and Summerland areas. Officials feared the sundowner winds could push the fire into those communities as they blow south from the mountains down to the coast, and because they also dry out the air.[71][32] Although they prevented the fire from reaching the community, it still grew to 259,000 acres (105,000\u00a0ha) with 40% containment on the morning of December 16, surpassing the Rim Fire in size, and becoming the third-largest wildfire in the modern history of California.[32] Around this time, officials and experts feared that the Thomas Fire could surpass the Santiago Canyon Fire of 1889, which had burned over 300,000 acres (120,000\u00a0ha), and is believed to be California's all-time largest wildfire on record.[72] On December 17, the Thomas Fire expanded to 270,000 acres (110,000\u00a0ha), with 45% containment, reaching the burn scar of the 2008 Tea Fire and the 2009 Jesusita Fire.[73][74] However, the weakening of Santa Ana winds in the evening allowed firefighters to make progress on containing the fire, with firefighters able to keep the Thomas Fire from burning southward into the majority of nearby homes, and they also attacked the western front of the fire.[73] On December 18, firefighters began a large firing operation north of the Thomas Fire, south of Route 33, in order to clear away excess brush, and to attempt to control the Thomas Fire's northward expansion.[75][76] Firefighters hoped that the winds would push the control fires southward, away from the highway and towards the main body of the Thomas Fire. Fire officials stated that the control burns could scorch up to 20,000 acres (8,100\u00a0ha), before they connect with the main portion of the Thomas Fire.[76] On December 19, the Thomas Fire grew to 272,000 acres (110,000\u00a0ha), with 55% containment, surpassing the burn area of the Rush Fire in California to become the second-largest wildfire in modern California history.[77] On December 21, all evacuation orders for Santa Barbara County were lifted, as firefighters continued to make progress on containing the wildfire.[76] By this point, the Thomas Fire had become the 7th most destructive wildfire in California history.[21] During the evening of December 22, the Thomas Fire expanded to 273,400 acres (110,600\u00a0ha), with containment remaining at 65% for the second day, surpassing the Cedar Fire of 2003 to become California's largest wildfire in modern history.[18] By this point, however, fire officials stated that any further growths in the fire's size would likely be due to control burns from firing operations, due to more favorable weather conditions for firefighting.[18] Due to the cooler temperatures and increase in humidity, the control fires were not spreading as intended, so firefighters used flamethrowers to spread the control flames manually.[34] On December 23, fire growth paused, and containment of the wildfire was brought up to 70%.[78] By the evening of the same day, firefighters had completed firing operations near the northwestern flank of the Thomas Fire, with no more planned for the time being.[79][80] However, on December 24, the Thomas Fire grew to 281,620 acres (113,970\u00a0ha), after the fires from the back-burning operations completely merged into the Thomas Fire,[81][82] though containment of the wildfire also increased to 86%.[83] The Thomas Fire had ignited about 30 oil seep fires within the fire perimeter, at the Upper Ojai area. Fire officials had ordered a foam product to help extinguish the oil seep fires, though officials warned that the products may cause more smoke upon application.[81] Favorable weather conditions continued, with a few snow flurries precipitating over the Thomas Fire on the same day.[80] On December 26, the Thomas Fire remained at 281,620 acres (113,970\u00a0ha); no further growth in the fire's size was anticipated at this point.[84][85] The number of firefighters deployed decreased to about 900, and containment of the Thomas Fire increased to 88%.[84] That same day, CAL FIRE released a chart with the top 20 largest wildfires in California history, adding the Thomas Fire as the new largest fire.[86] On December 27, the Thomas Fire experienced another small expansion in size on its northeastern flank, to 281,893 acres (114,078\u00a0ha), while containment of the wildfire increased to 91%.[87] Early on December 29, the Thomas Fire was 92% contained, with no further increases in size.[88] On the same day, a smoldering area within the western edge of the Thomas Fire's perimeter, near Gibraltar Road, flared up, sending smoke over Santa Barbara. However, firefighters were able to extinguish the new flames by 1 p.m. PST on the same day.[89] On December 30, incident command was transferred to a local team headed by the Los Padres National Forest staff, and the Thomas Fire remained at 92% containment.[90][91] At that time, fire officials decided to let the remaining flames within the Thomas Fire's perimeter burn out; afterward, full containment of the wildfire was not expected until January 21, 2018.[90][9]"

When the winds ease, the smoke has hung in the air in many communities. The typical moist, cool daily onshore winds in the evening have also been bringing smoke inland. Native chaparral burned extensively to charred stems and ash. Coastal chaparral is a fire-adapted biome that burns frequently and catastrophically in Santa Ana wind. The chaparral plant species readily re-sprout or regenerate from serotinous seed in the Mediterranean climate of coastal, Southern California. The Inter-agency Thomas Fire Command mapped at least 50 chaparral fires of various sizes that had burned in the Thomas Fire area since 1950.[131][132] The 1985 Wheeler Fire burned the central portion of the Thomas Fire."

On January 21, 21 fatalities, 2 missing persons, 129 destroyed residences and 307 damaged residences, attributed to debris flows, were reported by the inter-agency, storm-response team[136] in Santa Barbara County.[137] Writer T.C. Boyle, whose Montecito home was within the proximity of both the fire and mudslides, documented the collective trauma in The New Yorker magazine.[138] Debris flows are generated in the following general sequence of events: Fire reduces the organic soil layer to ash and char. Water-repellent, organic hydrocarbons condense in shallow, mineral soil, enhancing runoff. Locally heavy rain, exceeding the infiltration rate of the soil, generates surface runoff. Eroded unconsolidated sediment and ash is suspended and dissolved, increasing the density of the flow. Pore water pressure developed in unconsolidated soil and sediment causes liquefaction. Erosion increases as gravity drives mud flow through the drainage basin in confined channels. Mud flows mobilize woody debris and larger sedimentary particles as debris flow, which continues to accumulate as smaller channels combine with larger channels. As the size of the debris flow increases, larger particles are entrained, channel erosion occurs, landslides and vegetation are incorporated. Multiple debris flows may be generated in the eroding, mountainous portion of the drainage basin. Debris flows typically surge, as precipitation rate and sediment supply vary, hydraulic jumps occur, landslide dams in the channel form and collapse. Upon exiting the steeper mountain canyon, as the stream gradient is reduced, the debris flow spreads laterally and begins to deposit larger particles on the alluvial fan. Where the stream channel is plugged with debris, lateral channel migration occurs, building upon the existing alluvial fan deposits. Deposition also occurs down-stream of the alluvial fan, where stream gradient decreases, on the floodplain, alluvial plain, coastal plain and river delta. As precipitation, subsurface flow, runoff, stream flow and supply of sediment and debris decreases, the stream reverts to low-flow characteristics. It takes years for disturbed channels to achieve relative stability as bed load sediment adjusts and vegetation is reestablished."

The newer fire quickly merged into the Thomas Fire later that night.[46] Residents on Koenigstein Road have said that a transformer exploded, but officials have not confirmed this claim.[46][141] In March 2019, investigators determined that Southern California Edison\u2019s equipment had sparked both ignitions that became the Thomas Fire, but in a settlement with public agencies, the utility did not admit fault.[14][142] In September 2020, Edison announced a combined settlement of $1.16 billion with the insurance companies over the Thomas Fire and Montecito Mudslide.[140] On December 16, 2021 the California Public Utilities Commission approved penalties and permanent disallowances against Southern California Edison for violations related to the ignition of five 2017\u20132018 Southern California wildfires. Under a proposed settlement with the CPUC\u2019s Safety and Enforcement Division, SCE shareholders will pay a $110 million penalty to California\u2019s General Fund, incur a $375 million permanent disallowance for cost recovery, and contribute $65 million in shareholder funds to safety measures, for a total of $550 million.[143]"

The costliest storm of the 1965 Pacific hurricane season, it formed from a northward-moving disturbance that originated southeast of Socorro Island. After reaching tropical storm strength on the Saffir\u2013Simpson Hurricane Scale, the cyclone turned to the east-northeast. The storm made landfall near Mazatl\u00e1n on September 26 and quickly transitioned an extratropical cyclone. Although fairly weak, the system was responsible for causing heavy damage to the Mexican economy. Flooding in Mazatl\u00e1n washed out many houses and submerged others in muddy water. At least six people died with damages totaling $10\u00a0million (1965 USD) and possibly higher. The name Hazel was retired following this storm."

The disturbance moved northward uneventfully until late on September 23, when the disturbance became a tropical depression at a distance of 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km). The next day, the depression intensified into a tropical storm while moving north at 8\u00a0mph (13\u00a0km/h). Later on September 24, satellite imagery suggested winds of up to 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) near the center. Around that time, Tropical Storm Hazel reached its peak pressure of 986\u00a0mbar (29.1\u00a0inHg). On September 26, a ship reported peak winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h). The storm then moved towards the east-northeast and made landfall just south of Mazatl\u00e1n on September 26 and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone shortly thereafter.[1][2]"

However, 10,000\u00a0people fled the low-lying areas of Mazatl\u00e1n.[3] Substantial damage was recorded in the city[4] Many rivers overflowed its banks, and roughly 5,000 people were without shelter. The entire city of Mazatl\u00e1n was without power and the city water system was damaged.[5] At least 50\u00a0boats were damaged or sunk by the storm. The damage from the storm was estimated to be at least $10 million (1965 USD), making Hazel the costliest tropical cyclone of the season.[1][3] Three people were reported killed in Mazatl\u00e1n, two fishermen died when attempted to ride out the storm, and a boy who was electrocuted by a downed power line. Three additional deaths from electrocutions were reported in a rural section of Nayarit. Due to a communications breakdown, no word was received about six vacationers in Mazatl\u00e1n.[4] The city was only reachable by boat.[6] In addition, several shacks made of wood, tin, and cardboard were either washed away or inundated by up to 6\u00a0ft (1.8\u00a0m) of muddy water while flooding from the storm had washed out bridges and roads throughout the state and some merges were cancelled.[4][7] The cyclone also had a major impact on the coastal economy since Mazatl\u00e1n's shrimp fleet, which makes up the base of the city's economy. In southern Sinaloa, 55,000 acres (220\u00a0km2) of cotton, corn, and sorghum were lost.[4] There were also reports of heavy losses to livestock.[3] On account of the storm, 1,000\u00a0people sought shelter in schools; in the farm areas of Barron and El Wailamo, people were taking refuge on top of trees and homes.[3] Army units and relief agencies rushed to provide aid to coastal cities.[5]"

It was granted town status in 1817.[citation needed] Between the 1860s and 1917, the town was a place of political exile, with some of the more prominent exiles including the Polish writer Wac\u0142aw Sieroszewski, as well as Bolshevik revolutionaries Ivan Babushkin and Viktor Nogin."

        "content": "Verkhoyansk sees excessively cold winter temperatures and some of the greatest temperature differences on Earth between summer and winter. Average monthly temperatures range from \u221244.7\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221248.5\u00a0\u00b0F) in January to +16.5\u00a0\u00b0C (61.7\u00a0\u00b0F) in July. Mean monthly temperatures are below freezing from October through April and exceed +10\u00a0\u00b0C (50\u00a0\u00b0F) from June through August, with the intervening months of May and September constituting very short transitional seasons. Located within the Arctic Circle, Verkhoyansk has an extreme subarctic climate rather than a tundra climate, dominated much of the year by high pressure. This has the effect of cutting off the region from warming influences in winter and together with a lack of cloud cover leads to extensive heat losses during the cooler months. Verkhoyansk is one of the places considered the northern Pole of Cold, the other being Oymyakon, located 629\u00a0km (391 miles) away by air. The lowest recorded temperature was \u221267.8\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221290.0\u00a0\u00b0F), recorded on January 15, 1885, and both February 5 and 7, 1892.[12][13]  On 6 February 1933 however, the temperature at Oymyakon reached \u221267.7\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221289.9\u00a0\u00b0F), just barely above Verkhoyansk's record.[12][13] Only Greenland and Antarctica have recorded lower temperatures than Oymyakon or Verkhoyansk: the lowest directly recorded temperature at ground level is \u221289.2\u00a0\u00b0C (\u2212128.6\u00a0\u00b0F), recorded at the Vostok Station in Antarctica on 21 July 1983,[14][15] and a temperature of \u221293.2\u00a0\u00b0C (\u2212135.8\u00a0\u00b0F) was recorded via satellite observations at the East Antarctic Plateau in Antarctica on 10 August 2010.[16] The World Meteorological Organization has recently recognized a temperature of \u221269.6\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221293.3\u00a0\u00b0F) measured in Greenland on 22 December 1991 as the lowest in the Northern Hemisphere. The record was measured at an automatic weather station and was uncovered after nearly 30 years.[17] In this area, temperature inversions consistently form in winter due to the extremely cold and dense air of the Siberian High pooling in deep hollows, so that temperatures increase rather than decrease with higher altitude. In Verkhoyansk it sometimes happens that the average minimum temperatures for January, February, and December are below \u221250\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221258\u00a0\u00b0F). In its short summer, daytime temperatures over +30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F) are not uncommon. The average annual temperature for Verkhoyansk is \u221214\u00a0\u00b0C (7\u00a0\u00b0F). On 20 June 2020 and again in June 2023, Verkhoyansk recorded a temperature of +38.0\u00a0\u00b0C (100.4\u00a0\u00b0F),[18][19] yielding a temperature range of 105.8\u00a0\u00b0C (190.4\u00a0\u00b0F) based on reliable records, which is tied with Oymyakon for being the greatest temperature range in the world. It was also the highest temperature above the Arctic Circle ever recorded. Only a handful of towns in Siberia and Canada have temperature ranges of 100\u00a0\u00b0C (180\u00a0\u00b0F) or more, and Verkhoyansk is the only place on earth with a temperature range of 105\u00a0\u00b0C (189\u00a0\u00b0F) or higher. Verkhoyansk has never recorded a temperature above freezing between November\u00a010 and March\u00a014.[20] Verkhoyansk has an extreme latitude temperature anomaly when compared with R\u00f8st off the coastline of Norway. Both settlements are on 67\u00b0N and almost on the same latitudal decimal. In spite of this, R\u00f8st is on average more than 45\u00a0\u00b0C (81\u00a0\u00b0F) milder during winter. In summer and particularly during July, on the other hand, Verkhoyansk is significantly warmer than its Norwegian counterpart. Verkhoyansk has a dry climate with little rainfall or snowfall; the average annual precipitation is 182 millimeters (7.2\u00a0in). Although no month can be described as truly wet, there are strong seasonal differences in precipitation, with the summer being much wetter than the winter; yet interestingly, because the driest month (April) is in the \"summer\" and has less than one-third the precipitation of the wettest \"winter\" month (October), Verkhoyansk's climate technically qualifies as K\u00f6ppen Dsd, a classification found only in parts of eastern Siberia.  The dryness experienced in winter is largely due to the dominance of high pressure at this time of year. Finally, Verkhoyansk has very low seasonal lag, with December being colder than February, and June warmer than August.  Interestingly, a similar scenario can be encountered in Patagonia in the Southern Hemisphere, where June is the coldest month in many areas."

The city's waterfront was completely flooded, along with some houses near the waterfront. Muscogee wharf was partially destroyed, broken into two pieces. On either side of the wharf, railroad tracks had been washed away.[1] A total of 39 freight cars carrying coal were also washed away.[6] In addition, the grain elevator of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad was destroyed during the hurricane.[7] A timber boom was demolished during the hurricane, leaving wood and debris on the beach.[1] Along Intendencia Street, several cottages were flooded; in some areas, the floodwaters were 10 feet (3.0\u00a0m) deep. The southern end of West Main Street was completely inundated and was swept away. There was devastation between Barcelona and Perdido streets, with several boats wrecked. Between Palafox Street and Wright Street, many houses' roofs were torn away. Rail service in and out of Pensacola was severely affected; one train arrived several hours later than scheduled, and it was said that it had to stop \"every few yards\" in order to remove trees and debris covering the track. Between Magnolia Bluff and Milton, the track was destroyed and the Escambia Bridge was partially demolished. The fishing industry of Pensacola was estimated to have suffered at least $500,000 in damage. Many wharfs had been completely destroyed during the hurricane.[1] Electricity was shut off during the hurricane.[8] Fort Barrancas, Fort Pickens, and Fort McRee suffered severe damage.[1] At Forts Pickens and Barrancas, damage was estimated to be around $10,000.[9] In the Bayou Grande area of Pensacola, the tide was estimated to be about 12 feet (3.7\u00a0m) above normal. At the intersection of Cedar and Baylen streets, oyster boats, steam tugs, wood, and other debris were scattered. A boat identified as the Wolverine was tossed into a lot near the corner. Trees and chimneys were blown down, and a tin roof was peeled off a house as a result of strong winds. On the 26th port, one bark was completely destroyed, while another eleven were tossed around. A schooner that sank during the hurricane was tipped over. At the 38th port, 29 schooners were thrown ashore, and another sixteen were completely destroyed. Only eight of the 36 lumber barges floated, while three of eight tugs were floating, and of those three of them were wrecked.[1] Other debris was scattered around the city, including pieces of shattered glass.[8] A fire occurred at a hotel in Pensacola.[10] At the navy yard of Pensacola, all but three boats\u2014the Isle de Luzon and two \"water boats\"\u2014were either sunk or thrown ashore. A steel dock owned by Spain was untouched, but areas surrounding it were littered with debris. In the towns of Wosley and Warrington, waterfronts were severely damaged and some houses washed away. At Pensacola Bay, the tide was 10 feet (3.0\u00a0m) high; at East Bay, the tide was measured at 9 feet (2.7\u00a0m); at St. Andrews Bay, the tide was 6 feet (1.8\u00a0m) high; and at Apalachicola Bay, the tide was 5 feet (1.5\u00a0m) high. The damage caused in the city totaled to at least $2,620,000, while the damage within the vicinity of the city amounted to more than $1,230,000. The total damage caused within Pensacola and the surrounding areas totaled to greater than $3,850,000. The hurricane was considered the worst in the city in 170 years. However, there was widespread praise by residents and newspapers for the Weather Bureau for tracking the hurricane and issuing storm warnings three days before the storm made landfall.[1][6] A total of 35 people were killed in Pensacola.[11]"
